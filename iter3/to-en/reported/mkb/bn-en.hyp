Mann Ki Baat October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Deepawali's best wishes to all of you, we have been told here - 'Shubham Karothi Kalyanang Arogyan Dhansadam'.
Deepajyotirmanmost in the Enemy Landscape.
What a beautiful message.
Deepawali is now being celebrated in different countries of the world.
It is not only the Indians who participate in this festival, but also the governments of many countries, citizens and social organizations of that country celebrate Deepawali with joy.
A similar India is built there.
Friends, There is a different attraction of such tourism in the world.
Our India is a country of festivals and there is a huge opportunity for such tourism.
We should strive to promote Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and also include people from other states and other countries in this joy.
We have so many festivals in every state and region, people of other countries are keen to celebrate these festivals.
This is why the role of Indians living outside the country is very important for the promotion of such tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had decided that I will do something different on the occasion of Diwali.
I had said - Come, let us all celebrate the strength of Indian women and their achievements in this Deepawali.
Immediately after seeing, there is a lot of inspirational stories in the social media.
Warrenal's Kodipaka Ramesh, Namo App has written: My mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took charge of five sons.
Today we have five brothers in a good life.
My mother is my God.
My dear countrymen, if you look at myself, he is the Laxmi of India, the Prime Minister said.
Ramesh ji, I salute your mother.
Mr. Khushboo Kuanar, the daughter of Bus Conductor and she led the women's forces in Assam Rifles.
His daughter is India's Laxmi near poet Tiwari Ji, who is also her power.
He's proud that his daughter painted a very good picture, and took a very good place in Clatt's exam.
Again Mega Jain wrote: A 92 year old woman has been serving pilgrims at the Gwalior Railway Station for many years.
Megaji, India has been inspired by the humble nature and compassion of Laxmi.
People shared a lot of such stories.
You must read, take inspiration and share a few things around you.
My heartfelt condolences to all these lacs of India.
My dear countrymen, Sachi Honnamma, a famous woman poet of the 17th century, wrote a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
This is the feeling that India is the goddess whom we are talking about, maybe it was the seventeenth century.
Peninanda Permegandanu Himavantu, Peninanda Bhrinda Perchinda Janakrayanu Jaswadenu, Himavantu, Parvati, Rishi Bhrigu, and Janaka were famous for her daughter Sita.
Our daughters have a strong identity and a bright future through our pride and the noble cause of these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November 2019, the 550th Birth Anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but also in the entire world.
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters who have completely dedicated their lives to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I'll never forget my guru travels to Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot of talk about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can share with you but it will take several aspects of Mann Ki Baat.
He has always placed service at the top of everyone.
Guru Nanak Devji believed that selfless service is invaluable.
He fought firmly against the social curse like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, his message has reached far and wide.
He was one of the greatest travelers of his time.
He had visited many places and wherever he lived, he had won the hearts of all through his simplicity, humility and purity.
Guru Nanak Devji has travelled to many important religious places.
It is said that the famous saint of Assam, Shankardev, was inspired by his ideals.
He also traveled to the holy land of Haridder.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the water problem there.
Well, Guru Nanak Devji is a famous place known as Guru Nanak Jira Saheb which reminds us of his commemoration.
During an auspicious time, Guru Nanak ji had travelled north Kashmir and surrounding areas.
This established a strong relationship between Sikhism followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji had visited Tibet and he was accepted as a Guru.
He traveled to Uzbekistan and was also venerable there.
And in an indifferent time, he travelled widely to European countries, including Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Afghanistan.
He lived in the hearts of millions and millions of people who followed his teachings with full reverence and are still doing so.
And this journey was organized to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
There, all those princes, along with the Golden Temple philosophy, also had the opportunity to know about Sikh heritage and culture.
He was a great hero who united the country.
Just like Sardar Patel had the surprising power to unite people, he was able to coordinate with those who had shown ideological differences.
Sardar Patel also looked at the microscopic issues in depth and looked at the exams.
He was literally the Man of Detail.
He was well versed in organizational skills.
He was also specially skilled in planning and designing strategies.
When one hears or reads about Sardar Saheb's methodology, one gets to know how wonderful it was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country attended the Congress Ahmedabad session.
He ensured that no one suffers from water.
He also interacted with the farmers and urged them to develop Khadi bags.
Look again, the sale of Khadi has increased considerably.
The country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a vital role in the Constitution.
He does an important task of ensuring our fundamental rights so that there is no possibility of discrimination based on caste or community.
Friends, We all know that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as the first Minister of State for Home Affairs of India had done a historic and magnificent job of uniting the segments and territories of the country.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had a special characteristic that none of his vision would have been observed.
On one hand, his vision was focused on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
So far southern Lakshadweep could not escape it .
Indeed, when we refer to Sardar Patel's efforts, we talk about his role in certain parts of the country.
Like Lakshadweep also he played an important role in the smaller area .
Immediately after receiving the news, Sardar Patel immediately took tough steps without delay.
He sent instructions to the brother of Mudalia , Architect Ramswami Mudaliar and architect Laxmanswamy Mudaliar that taking along the residents of Trevankar immediately hoisted the national flag there .
As per his instructions , an instant wave was removed and the neighbouring capture of Lakshadweep was defeated .
After this incident Sardar Patel told the brothers and sisters of Mudalia that they should personally ensure that the development of Lakshadweep is achieved with all the help .
Today Lakshadweep is contributing immensely to the progress of India.
This is an attractive tourist destination and destination .
I hope you'll go to this beautiful island and their beach.
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity built in the memory of Sardar Saheb on 31st October 2018 was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the world's longest human statue.
It's twice America's Statue of Liberty.
The world ' s longest statue fills the hearts of every Indian with pride -LRB- as an Indian the heart gets filled with pride when it feels as if the world 's longest earth is established in our country -RRB- .
Every Indian 's head gets higher in spirituality .
You will be happy to know that 26 lakh tourists had come to see the Statue of Unity in one year .
That is, everyday about eight and a half thousand people took pride in this Statue of Unity.
The belief that Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had in his heart , that is exactly what he had expressed .
Now there are several attractions like cactus gardens, zoos, jungle safaris, child nutrition parks, Ekta nurseries and for this the local economy is growing and people also get new employment opportunities.
Professional training is also being provided to facilitate hospitality at home or at home.
Local people have started cultivating dragon fruits and I am sure this will be the main means for their livelihood.
Friends, For the country, for every state, for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study.
We are witnesses how a place can become a world famous tourist destination within a year , where people from within the country and abroad come .
Traffic systems, accommodation, presence of guides, environment friendly systems are developing every one after the other.
Very big economic growth has started and local people are innovating the services of the tourists as per their needs.
The government is fulfilling its obligations.
Friends , is there any such Indian who would not be proud to know that a few days back Time magazine has placed this Statue of Unity in the top 100 tourist spots of the world .
I hope all of you will come to see this Statue of Unity after taking a little opportunity from your valuable time , but I am very happy that every Indian who leaves for a ride , goes to roam around at least fifteen destinations of the country and keeps the night there .
Friends, You are aware that every year from 2014 on 31st October is being celebrated as National Unity Day.
This day gives a message to the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
RAN for Unity is also being organised this time.
This will involve all sections of society.
Running, mind and body are beneficial for both.
I hope that all of you will participate in the 31st of October - the unity of the country and the goal of keeping your body healthy.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had tied the country with unity.
This mantra of unity is a reflection of our lives and should strive to strengthen the mantra of unity at every level, at every level in diverse countries like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious in strengthening the country's unity and concerns.
There will be many examples around us that are working towards this end.
But sometimes their words mix with our memories very quickly.
Friends, I remember the month of September 2010 when the Allahabad High Court had passed a judgment on Ram Janmabhoomi.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Mrs. Indira Devi, was also assassinated on 31st October.
Today, I pay my homage to him, my dear countrymen, if a story is narrated in every household, every village, from East to West, from North to South, from every part of India, then it is cleanliness.
Every individual, every family, every village is keen to share my joyous experience of cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is a collective effort of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Therefore, the benefits of this scheme are 1. 25 billion Indians.
But there is a joyous and thrilling experience.
I've heard and I want to hear you too.
In such a difficult situation, even in such adversity, there is no dearth of bravery.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country but also running the Swachh Siachen Abhiyan.
There's nothing so cold out there.
In such a scenario, it is an important task to separate waste and manage waste.
We all know that Siachen is a glacier that is the source of rivers and pure water.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is aimed at ensuring clean water for those living in low-lying areas, using rivers like Nubra and Seok.
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival that awakens a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Deepawali, specially some new things are being bought and some are brought from the market to every family.
I once told you we tried to buy local goods.
If we get the things we need, we don't have to go to Tahsil.
If you get it, you don't have to go to the district.
The more we try to buy local items, the more Gandhi 150 will turn you into a great festival.
And I always urge that we don't have a leather hand, we should buy something made by our Khadi workers.
Even in Deepawali, many people have bought a lot before Diwali but there are people who think that after Diwali, things may be cheaper.
So there'll be a lot of people who still have to buy.
Therefore, with the best wishes of Deepawali, I would like to appeal to you people to come here for local reasons and buy local goods.
Look, can we also play an important role in fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of Deepawali.
Like everyone in Deepawali, we use beggars.
But sometimes there's an unconscious fire.
Sometimes he gets hurt.
I urge you all to be cautious and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
My best wishes are with me.
Thank you very much.
What's the matter, September 2018
Is there an Indian who is not proud of our Armed Forces and the soldiers of our army
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion Indians celebrated Parakram Parv.
We have recalled the fact that in 2016, the Surgical Strike, when our armed forces responded appropriately to the proxy wire against terrorism in our country.
Our Armed Forces exhibited exhibitions in different parts of the country so that the lions can feel the strength of the people, especially the youth of the country, how capable we are and how our armed forces can protect our lives.
Like the Parakram Parv, the day marks the glorious legacy of our Armed Forces to the youth of the country.
It inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a function at Jodhpur, Rajasthan on the land of brave warriors.
It is certain that our armed forces will give a befitting reply to all those who want to destroy the peace and prosperity of our country.
But he respectfully compliments the sovereign power of the country.
India is always committed to maintaining peace and stability.
In the two wars of the 1980s, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace. This is the war that we had no connection with.
Our vision has never fallen on the land of another country.
It was our commitment to peace.
Just a few days ago, on 23 September, we remembered the brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lancers who freed Haifa from the invaders on the occasion of the centenary of the Haifa War.
This was also a bravery shown by our soldiers for peacekeeping.
Even today, India is one of the largest number of UN peacekeeping forces.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have been playing an important role in the cause of peace and order in the entire world by wearing blue helmet.
My dear countrymen, our air power is unparalleled.
On the occasion of Republic Day, the most keen interest in the public discourse is the Fly Past, which reflects the unprecedented architecture and strength of our Air Force.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
In 1947, when the Pakistani invaders launched an unprecedented attack, the air force ensured that the Indian Army and the combat equipment reached the battlefield at the right time in order to protect Srinagar from the invaders.
The Air Force also responded to the 1980 war.
Who doesn't know the Bangladeshi language of 1971
The Air Force played a very important role in liberating Kargil from the intruders in 1999.
The Air Force deployed them by continuously bombing the enemy base at Tiger Hill.
The entire nation is grateful for the significant role played by the Air Force, be it relief and rescue operations or emergency management.
The contribution of the Air Force to combat natural calamities like storms, storms, floods or terrible landscapes is exemplary.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring the equality of women and men in the country and has opened the doors of each of its departments to the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is offering the opportunity to select the options of the Short Service Commission as well as the Permanent Commission which I had announced on the 15th of August this year from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that the Indian Armed Forces not only have men's strength but also the contribution of women power is increasing day by day.
The whole country was worried about how to save her.
You must know that Abhilash Tommy is a fearless, courageous and brave soldier of the Navy.
Abhilash was the first Indian who was travelling worldwide with a small boat without any modern technology.
For 80 days, while participating in the Southern Golden Race Competition in the Indian Ocean, there was a terrible sea storm.
Despite all this terrible danger, he told me about a vow to do something like this...
I pray for the speedy recovery of Abhilash Tomy and hope that his courage, valour and determination will inspire and encourage the youth of our country.
My dear countrymen, children are also aware of the importance of 2nd October.
This year, the day has a special significance.
We are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in the next two years.
The thoughts and thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have reached the world today.
Everyone, like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or Nelson Mandela, has gained strength from Gandhijis vision and struggled for equal rights and dignity of the nation.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss with you one more important work of revered Bapu which all the countrymen need to know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some thoughts as a constructive programme.
Later, when the freedom struggle was strengthened in 1945, Gandhiji had revised his thoughts.
The revered Bapu ji presented his thoughts to the people of the country regarding the rights of the farmers, the people of the villages and the labourers, to protect their rights, to promote transparency and education, which is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a public communicator.
Meeting with the people, the specialty of Bapus adoption of mankind was that of his nature.
This is the valuable feature of Mahatma Gandhi's personality.
He made the countrymen aware that they are important and essential for the development of the country.
He had transformed this realisation into a mass movement that was his greatest contribution to the freedom struggle.
In the freedom struggle, the people of every section of the society had dedicated themselves to Mahatma Gandhi.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra, which is the magic of Gandhiji.
Gandhiji had said - I would like to tell you about such a strategy, whenever you have doubts about it or whenever you feel arrogant, remember my thoughts.
Remember the poorest and the weakest person you have ever seen in your life and ask yourself, the steps you are thinking about will be useful for that person.
Does this mean that millions of hungry and unhappy people will achieve self-reliance
Only then will you notice that your doubts are supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be suppressed.
My dear countrymen, one of Gandhijis strategies is equally important today.
The economic power and purchasing power of the country's growing middle class is enormous today.
My happiness will be multiplied only if that benefit reaches the poorest of the poor.
Keeping in mind Gandhiji's strategy, whenever we buy something, when we celebrate Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary, we must keep in mind that every purchase of our countrymen is beneficial and the products that sweat, those who have invested, those who have harnessed their talents must have some benefits.
This is Gandhijis strategy, this is Gandhijis message, I believe that a small step can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
Similarly, today we can feel that we can contribute to our small tasks and our economic progress and economic empowerment of our country to strengthen the fight against poverty.
And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's era. This is a tribute to the revered Bapu's work.
Think of buying Khadi and Handicrafts products on a special occasion.
Two days later, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri Ji with revered Bapu.
Shastri ji's name enshrines an infinite reverence in our hearts.
His gentle personality always fills the hearts of every countrymen with pride.
The specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he looked very soft from outside, but he was firm in his heart.
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Mantra was the mantra of his great personality.
During the short span of about one and a half years, he has given the mantra of achieving the goals of the youth and farmers of the country, which is the result of his selfless penance towards the nation.
Millions of people have participated in this campaign and I am also fortunate to donate Swachhta Shram with the children at the Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to that school, the foundation of which was laid by the venerable father himself.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Corporate Groups, all have donated Swachhata to the masses.
I sincerely congratulate all the Swachhata loving countrymen for this.
Let's hear a phone call, "Namskar, my name is Shaitan Singh.
I especially thank you for your phone call.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in the country but all over the world.
This time India is hosting the worlds largest Swachhata Sammelan Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Officials from all over the world and experts from all over the world will come and share their experiences and practices related to cleanliness.
This is essential for the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited, the deprived and the deprived.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October, 2002.
25 years of NHRC will be completed in a few days.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but also helped to increase self-pride.
Our beloved leader, former Prime Minister Prayat Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clearly stated that human rights are not foreign to us.
Our National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has decorated the ideals of the ethical ethos, "Sarve Bhawantu Sukhina:"
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in curbing its misuse.
During the twenty-five year visit, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and trust among the people of the country.
I think it is very optimistic for a healthy society, for democratic values.
At present, 26 State Human Rights Commissions (SHRCs) have been constituted along with the work on human rights at the national level.
All these great men have inspired us, we salute them.
This year also we have tried to organize the Run for Unity in our villages, cities, metropolitan cities.
Run for unity is the right way to remember Sardar Saheb because he has worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I would like to urge all of you to strengthen this effort to unite every section of the society, every individual, through the Run for Unity on 31st October. And that will be his due respect.
My dear countrymen, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijaya Dashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today the entire country is celebrating Rakhibandhan festival.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
This festival of Rakhibandhan symbolizes the love and trust of sisters and brothers.
For centuries, this festival is a great example of social harmony.
There are several such events in the history of the country, when we have seen how a defence relationship binds the people of two states or different religions with faith.
A few days later, Janmashtami.
The winds of the sky will be heard from the windows of Hathi Horse Paul ki Jai Kanhaiya Lal ki and Govinda.
It's a different joy to enjoy yourself in the color of Krishna.
Children must have started organizing 'Dahi-Handi' in different parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra.
I am grateful to Mr. Chinmayee for taking this into account.
Friends, Apart from Rakshabandhan, Shravan Purnima is celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I congratulate all those people who have been working towards preserving, taking forward and delivering people to this great heritage.
Every language has its own importance.
There is a vast treasure of knowledge in Sanskrit language and literature that is useful in every aspect of life.
Whether it is science or the ecosystem, agriculture or health, psychology or architecture or be it ecosystem or be it ecosystem or be it environment or be it global warming or be it science or be it agriculture or be it architecture or be it architecture or be it ecosystem or be it ecosystem.
You will be happy to know that today all the people of Mattu village of Shivamoga district of Karnataka have chosen Sanskrit as the medium of communication.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which the word eternal can be created.
In order to weigh something, we use English quotations, sometimes shirts etc.
But those who are familiar with the well-defined words of Sanskrit, they are aware that how few words can be explained through these well-defined words.
That is, if a guru gives his disciple a single letter of knowledge then there is no wealth or wealth in the whole world that can repay the disciple Guru's debt.
On the occasion of Teachers Day, we always remember the great song and former President of India, Bharat Ratna, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.
Teachers Day was celebrated across the country on his birth anniversary.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day and remember his dedication towards science, education and students with reverence.
My dear countrymen, our farmer brothers, those who work hard, bring the news of the monsoon happiness.
Just a while ago, we have seen how the floods have caused the people of Kerala to suffer.
In such a difficult situation, the entire country has come to Kerala.
I convey my deepest condolences to those who lost their loved ones in this calamity.
The damage that has happened may not be fulfilled any day, but I want to assure all the bereaved families that 125 crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you on this unfortunate day.
I pray that those who have suffered from this natural calamity get well soon.
I firmly believe that Kerala's lives will soon become normal by filling with indomitable zeal and courage.
The way disaster destroys the lives of the people is very unfortunate, but on this unfortunate day we also realize the religion of humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, every person is doing his best to ensure that the areas where disasters are terrible, be it Kerala or any district or region of India, the people lives of those places are naturally transformed.
People of all ages and people associated with all kinds of work are enhancing their support.
Everyone is wondering how the misery of the people of Kerala can be shared so that it can be lost.
We all know that the armed security forces are the heroes of this disaster rescue operation in Kerala.
They have taken all the measures to save the flood affected people.
Air Force, Navy or Army, BS-F, CI-S-F, R-A-F have been busy carrying out rescue and relief operations.
I would like to particularly mention the hard work of the NDRF personnel.
The way they have worked in dealing with these threats, they are very much appreciated.
The power of NDRF, their commitment and the ability to make the situation sustainable by taking quick decisions has created a revered seat in the minds of all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, while reading the suggestions sent for Mann Ki Baat this time, I have seen that most of the people have written about it, it is our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
From Ghaziabad to Kirti, Sonipat to Swati Baat, Kerala's brother Praveen, from West Bengal to Dr. Swapan Banerjee, from Katihar in Bihar to Akhilesh Pandey, many more people have urged me to tell about the various aspects of Atal ji's life in Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov.
On the 16th of August, the people of the country and the world have received news of Atal ji's death, they have expressed deep condolences.
He is a leader who left the Prime Minister 14 years ago and went far from active politics in the last ten years.
He wouldn't have seen much in the news.
The affection, reverence and grief that everyone showed for Atal ji is a symbol of his great personality.
This country will always be grateful to Atal ji for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
Today, I would like to share with you one more illustration of Atal jis immense personality - the Political Cultural Culture that he has tried to transform the Political Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Culture.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the Academic Amendment Act, 2003.
This amendment brings about two important changes in the politics of our country.
The first is to limit the Ministers of States to fifteen percent of the total assembly seats.
Atal ji brought about a transformation in this system which will result in savings in wealth and wealth, efficiency and efficiency.
Atal ji was the only visionary who transformed the situation and created a healthy and smooth system in politics.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In the year 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 PM to 11 PM.
Another Azadi, we achieved the work of Atal ji, through the creation of Indian Flag Code.
It is applied from 2001, thereby leading to universal fluctuation.
The common Indians get an opportunity to unfurl the national flag.
This is how he brought our beloved Tiranga to the people.
You have seen how Atal ji has brought about a change in the voting process and has strengthened the country with the courageous steps taken by the people's representatives.
My dear countrymen, whenever there are discussions about the Parliament today, there is talk of blockade and hostility, but when something good happens then there is no discussion about it.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament concluded a few days ago.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and that of Rajya Sabha was 74.
Leaving the interests of the party, all MPs tried to make the most useful of the Monsoon Session, as a result, Lok Sabha passed 21st and Rajya Sabha 14th Bill.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament will be remembered for its social justice and youth.
Several important Bills have been passed for the betterment of youth and backward classes in the Session.
You all are aware that for decades OBC Commission like the SC  ST Commission was being formed.
In order to ensure backward class rights, the country has fulfilled the resolution of the OBC Commission this time and has given this institution a constitutional right.
This step will help in achieving the objective of social justice successfully.
The Bill has also been passed to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will further protect the interests of people belonging to SC and ST communities.
At the same time, it will protect the perpetrators from torture and enhance their confidence.
No civil society can injustice the women of the country.
The perpetrators of this crime will be punished for a minimum of 10 years, for raping girls under the age of 12 years.
Just a few days ago, you might have read in the newspapers that after just two months of hearing, a court in Mandsore, Madhya Pradesh has heard the punishment of two convicts for raping a girl.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh sentenced the criminals to death after hearing only five days.
A court in Rajasthan has also given such a speedy verdict.
The Act will play a pivotal role in resolving the offences against women and girls.
Financial progress is incomplete without social change.
The Lok Sabha passed the 3rd Lok Sabha, although it was not possible to pass this session in Rajya Sabha, I would like to assure Muslim women that the entire nation stands with all the strengths to provide them justice.
When we come forward to protect the interests of the country then we can bring about a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the deprived and the deprived.
In this Monsoon Session, all of us have come together to set an example.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, at this moment, the vision of millions and millions of people is dedicated to the Asian festival.
Every morning, in the newspapers, in television, in news, in social media, an Indian sportsperson has won.
Asian Games are still on.
I congratulate all those who have won medals for the country.
I convey my best wishes to those who are still in the race.
India's athletes, especially Shooting and Wrestling, are performing well and our athletes are bringing medals in the games we have not done well before, like Wushu and Rowing.
This is not just a medal, it is a testimony to the courage and dreams of Indian sportspersons and Indian competitors.
This is a positive feature.
Many of the youth who have won medals are 15-16 years old.
It is also a good sign that many of the athletes who have won medals have risen from the infamous villages and humiliations and have achieved this by working hard.
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day. On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all sports enthusiasts. At the same time, I pay my tributes to the great sportsperson of Hockey.
I appeal to all the citizens of the country to make sports and keep an eye on your fitness because healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
When India fits, India will build a bright future.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners of the Asian Games and convey my best wishes to the rest of the players.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple at Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unforgettable blend of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone was surprised to see the ueen Ki Bao of the eleventh century in Patan in Gujarat.
India has always been an engineering experiment.
There are many engineers in India who have imagined the unimaginable and have set an example in the engineering world.
Our great engineers have a jewel in their legacy that still makes people wonder.
This is Bharat Ratna Dr.
In that part of the country, he remembered the rest of the country with great respect and reverence.
In his memory, on 15th September, Engineers participated as Day.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have made their mark in the eastern world.
In the context of the unprecedented achievements of the engineering world, I recall one incident of the terrible earthquake in Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
He was funny looking at me. Look at this house.
Kutch is called Bhunga.
My house saw three earthquakes.
He was saying this thing with pride and pride that even a long time ago, our engineers used to make houses by judging the local environment and the situation, so that people could be safe.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we will have to think about the future and organize workshops at different places.
We have to think whether we have to learn new things in the changing times
You have to teach
The world is fighting natural calamities.
What's the new use of structural engineering here
What's his course
Should we teach students
I convey my best wishes to you all for this thing.
We'll talk again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
It stirred the mindset of the people.
You must have seen on TV that a team of 12 young football players and their coaches went to a cave in Thailand.
It's usually a few hours to go there and get out of there.
But on that day, Bhagyadevi had a different desire.
When they entered a lot inside the cave, the sudden rain caused a lot of water to accumulate in the face of the cave.
Efforts are made to find out where those youngsters are, where they are, how they can be brought out.
But I'd like to see this whole thing in a different way.
The government, the parents of the children, the family, the media and the citizens of the country have shown a remarkable behaviour of peace and patience.
Everyone has joined this mission in a team.
Everyone's inconvenience - I think it's a matter of learning and self-confidence.
My parents didn't feel sad or mother didn't drop the water.
The patience, restraint and calmness of the entire society is really a matter of education for us.
In this regard, a Thai navy soldier was killed.
The entire world is surprised that despite such a terrible situation, the rescuers have done courageous and patience in the dark cave.
This shows that when people are united, they are astonishing.
It is necessary that we focus on our goals in a calm mind and work for it.
A few days back, our country's popular poet Neeraj has died.
The specialty of poet Niraj was hope, confidence, determination and self-confidence.
All the words of poet Neeraj can inspire all of us.
He wrote, The darkness will go as far as the thunderbolt is concerned, the darkness will go as far as the thunderbolt is concerned.
The months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for the youth.
This is because this is the time when Pick Session for Colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam leave school and go to college.
In the month of February and March, examinations, uestions and Answers were conducted on the occasion of the holidays of April and May, resulting in the discovery of future life and career choice.
The month of July is the month when the youth takes a new path in their lives, when the focus goes away from 'Kochen' to 'Kote off'.
The focus of the students goes from home to hostel.
Students enter the umbrella of Professors from the umbrella of Parents.
I believe that my young friends are very enthusiastic and happy about the auspicious occasion of college life.
For the first time, getting out of the house, going out of the village, getting out of a safe environment, we have to show ourselves the way.
These youngsters leave their homes and leave their lives on a new path.
There is no way out of books, we have to study, but we have to keep on looking for innovative things.
Old friends are precious.
The youngsters who have left their homes and have gone out of their homes should discover that place and know about the people, language and culture there.
My best wishes to all the youngsters for starting a new chapter.
Her father's been nurturing her family by dumping dust.
I congratulate ASHARA for this success.
The students of such ill-hearted families who have shown their hard work and concentration in adverse conditions that inspire all of us.
Like Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is a resident of DTC, or Abhay Gupta of Kolkata, who has studied under the street lights, among them are Afreen Shaikh, the daughter of Ahmedabad, whose father is Auto Challan, the daughter of a resident of Nagpur, Khushi, son of Chaukidar of Haryana, Kartik, son of a brick-headed labourer of Jharkhand, Ramesh Sahu.
Since the birth of Anushka Panda, a disabled girl from Gurgaon, the victims of hereditary diseases called Spinal Mascula Autopsy have achieved success by crossing the barriers of their determination and mind.
We will get such examples when we look around us.
Any good thing in any part of the country gives me strength and inspiration.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I saw a news in which it was written: Two youngsters had succeeded in fulfilling the dream of Modi.
After reading the news, I came to know how our youth is trying to transform the lives of the common man with the help of technology smart and creative usage.
Once I had appealed to Indian youth to think about how to use their talent for India and do something after taking time out.
I had requested to convert brain-drain into brain-gain.
Two I-T professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayee have made a remarkable effort by acknowledging my challenge.
Using their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have created a smart village app.
This app will not only connect the people of the village with the entire world but will also get any information or news on their mobile phones.
The App provides the village telephone directory, news sector, events list, health centers, information centers etc.
The FACT rate among Kisans is also very useful for the farmers as well as for their products.
Santosh ji, thank you very much for your phone
Indeed, Pandharpur is a unique festival.
Friends, On the eleventh of the eighteenth month, which was on 23rd July this year, the Punyatra of Puntharpur was celebrated with a lot of fervor.
Pandharpur is a sacred city in Kolapur district of Maharashtra.
Saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram were dancing in the paduka palanquin and dancing in the name of Lord Vithal.
Devotees reached there for the darshan of Lord Bitthal, who is also known as Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vitthal protects the poor, the helpless and the oppressed.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense respect and devotion towards the Lord.
You go to the Beethoba Temple in Pondicherry, there is a different feeling of importance, beauty and spiritual joy.
My request to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat programme is that if the opportunity comes, you will certainly gain the experience of Pandharpur Punyatra.
Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram and many such monks are still teaching the people in Maharashtra.
We have received advice from them about goodwill, love and brotherhood in words like 'Varood' or 'Awang'.
We have got this mantra from them that society can fight against blind faith.
They have shown the right path to the society at the right time and have ensured that the evils of the society are removed from the society and have brought compassion, equality and purity among the people.
One such great man was Lokmanya Tilak who had made a deep impression on many Indians.
We remember Tilak ji on his birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was a brave and self-confident man.
He had the power and intellect to mislead British rulers.
The British were so scared of treason against him for three-three times in twenty years.
I would like to tell you about the idols of Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
In October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, Imagine that more than forty thousand people had gathered to welcome him 100 years ago.
After that, Vallabhbhai Patel, as mayor of the Municipal Corporation, decided to set up a memorial at Victoria Garden, the ueen of Britain.
Normally, the British rulers are very dissatisfied with this and the collector has repeatedly proposed to construct a memorial called Smaru Hella.
But Sardar Saheb is Sardar Saheb, if necessary, he will resign but he will leave the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
Finally, the statue of Sardar Patel was constructed and invited Mahatma Gandhi to inaugurate it on 28th February, 1929.
Revered Bapu had said at the Great Inauguration Ceremony that Ahmedabad was not only the Mayor of the Upper House but also the power that enabled him to establish the statue of Tilak.
My dear countrymen, one of the special features of this statue that Sardar Patel had established is that Lokmanya Tilak ji's chair has written under this statue, Swaraj is my birthright.
It sounded like God's instructions to the English.
The first universal Ganesh Festival was started by Lokmanya Tilak.
The universal Ganesh festival, traditionally enriched with respect and honour, became an effective medium for society awakening, unity, equanimity and equity.
Ganesh Mandap is now visible on the streets of any city.
All the families of that street organized the Ganesh Festival together.
This is an unparalleled opportunity for our youth so that they can acquire special powers like organisation and leadership and develop them within themselves.
My dear countrymen, I have also said this thing last time, while remembering Lokmanya Tilak ji, let us celebrate Ganesh Utsav with Dhamma but let us celebrate the festival of 'Parivas-Bhandab'.
May the statue of Ganesh ji embellish his decorations, the priests and the priests embellish him.
He had dedicated his life so that the countrymen could breathe in a free India.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
There are youngsters in India who cannot be inspired by this poem Sarafak Khal Khan, Bhagwat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, who inspired the brightness of the poets like Ashfaq Khal Khan, Bhagwad Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azads bravery and freedom gave inspiration to many youngsters.
Azad had lived his life, but he never gave up his head before the foreign rule.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit the village of Azad in Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again I offer my homage to two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad Ji.
A few days ago, in the Junior Junior Junior Twenty World Athletics Championship held in Finland, Indias brave daughter Hima Das won the gold medal.
The country's daughter, Ekta Bhayan, in response to my letter, e-mailed me from Indonesia and is now preparing for the Asian Democracy.
Ekta is being written on e-mail: Whenever Mohan is in the life of an athlete, it is my pride that I have done it.
Ekta, we all are proud of you.
His achievements are remarkable because he has made his challenge a medium of success.
In 2003, on the Road Accident, Ekta falls under the body of a terrible cow, but she has not lost courage and has achieved her goal by strengthening herself.
I salute Ekta Bhawan Ji, Yogesh Katuniaji and Sundar Singh Ji for their courage and struggle.
Please move forward, play, improve.
My dear countrymen, several events in the history of August are full of festivals but sometimes diseases enter the house due to the weather.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for your good health, for this month of August inspired by patriotism and for the several festivals that have come here for centuries.
Mann Ki Baat will be reunited.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, once again I am fortunate to meet you all on this occasion of Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, a historic cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You might have realized that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan's first international test match and it is a matter of pride for all Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two sides demonstrated excellent sporting talent in the match.
Rasheed Khan, an Afghan leader, played a very good role in IPL this year. And I remember the President of Afghanistan, Shri Ashraf Ghani, who tagged me in his twitter: People of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I also thank our Indian friends who have created a platform to showcase the sporting prowess of our athletes.
Rasheed represented the best of Afghanistan, the Prime Minister said.
He is a resource in the field of cricket and he also enjoyed it a bit - No, I don't want to give it to anyone.
This match will be memorable to all of us.
Though it was the first match, it's natural to remember, but I'll remember the match for one more thing.
The Indian team has done something that is unprecedented throughout the world.
When the Indian team was taking the trophy, a winning team showed what it could do.
While taking the trophy, the Afghan team invites those who are playing international matches for the first time, and photograph them together.
What can be the sportsman spirit and sportsmanship we can feel from this thing.
Sports is the best way to unite society and find out the talent that our youth has.
My best wishes to both the teams of India and Afghanistan
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, we witnessed an unprecedented sight of Yoga.
Whether it is the European Parliament in Brazil, the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Japanese Navy fighters, the people of all parts of the country are witnessing Yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic event of Yoga has been organised and I have been told that the women of Demonstration of several seats have also been organized.
India and China's troops have practiced Yoga together on the high ice cap of Ladakh.
If people from all over the world participate in the Yoga Day celebrations with such enthusiasm, then why should it not be of immense value in India
Our air warriors performed yogasanas at 15,000 feet above the ground in the middle of the sky.
It was a sight, they were not sitting in the airplane, they were drifting into the air.
Whether it is schools, colleges, offices, parks, high houses or playgrounds, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
A panorama of Ahmedabad was charming, where about 750 physically handicapped brothers and sisters had created a record by doing Yoga at one place.
I believe that today Yoga is doing the work of One Wellness and Revolution.
An effort of wellness is being undertaken by Yoga. I hope that it will progress.
Gradually, more and more people will choose Yoga as part of their lives.
Thank you for your phone.
Do you know why Kabirdas ji had gone to Imghar
He is the one who knows and understands the sorrows of others.
Whoever doesn't understand the sufferings of others, he's cruel.
Kabir Das ji gave a special emphasis on social coordination.
"Jagme Bari Koi Nehi, Joe Mann Ki Baat.
Give me the pulses, please.
In another word, Kabirdas ji has said, "What kindness yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea greed and sin.
Her invaluable words continue to affect her even today. Now when we talk about Saint Kabir Das Ji, I remember her duo.
"This is the greatness of Guru and one such guru is Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
Those who have shown the path of truth to millions of people, who have been inspiring people from the past.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
There is another history that has been associated with Punjab.
The horrific event of Jallianwala Bagh in 2019, which marks 100 years of its passing away, was a shame to humanity.
On April 13, 1919, someone forgot that black day when fire broke out on innocent, innocent and innocent civilians across the boundaries of cruelty by misusing power.
But we will always remember the eternal message that has been delivered by this tragedy, it is that violence and abuse can never solve any problem.
Peace, non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice always win.
My dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar from Rohini, Delhi has written on Narendra Modi Mobile App to Dr.
Ramanji, thank you very much for the first time
It is a pleasure to see your interest in the history of India.
You know, yesterday, 23rd June, Dr.
Perhaps very few people know that, in 1937, Dr.
At the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore spoke in Bengal at Kolkata University Convention.
That was the first example when during the British rule, a person spoke in Bengali at the Convention of the University of Kolkata.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industrial Minister of India and in a sense, he had laid a strong foundation for Indias growth as well as its inclusive growth.
In 1948, the first industrial policy of independent India was based on its vision and vision.
Dr.
It was a dream of Mukherjee that India will be self-reliant, progressive and prosperous in every sector of the industry.
He wanted India to be a big industry and with it full focus on MSMEs, cotton industry, textiles and cotton industry.
He has set up finance and organisation sets for sustainable development of cottage industries and small scale industries, which will lead to the All India Radio between 1980 and 1980.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had a great contribution.
He was very passionate about the progress of West Bengal.
A part of West Bengal has been protected due to his thoughts, consciousness and activity and is still a part of India.
Come, let us remember this message of unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and let us make sincere efforts to take India forward through brotherhood and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, for the last few weeks, I had got the opportunity to talk to all those people who have benefited from various schemes of the government through video calls.
I had got the opportunity to move away from the file and listen directly to the people about the change in their lives.
People have said that their resolutions, their happiness and sadness, and their realisation.
I believe that this was not just a government programme but it was a learning experience and what could be more satisfactory than what I have seen in the public eye during this period
When I used to listen to a common man, his simple simple words, devotional feelings, he used to touch his heart.
I was told that in far-flung villages, girls have been helping in creating passports for the elderly and the elderly from the common service centre.
One of the sisters of Chhattisgarh is collecting attached to ice cream manufacturing, millions of youngsters from Jharkhand are running Jan Aushadhi system and supplying medicines at affordable prices to nearby villages.
The youngsters in West Bengal who were pursuing their jobs two-three years ago are now successfully not only doing their businesses but also providing employment to 10-15 persons.
Students from schools in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues like West Management in the Tinkering Lab of the school at a young age.
There were numerous stories of experience and there was no corner of the country from where the message of success did not come.
I am happy to note that in the entire event, I have felt the strength of the successes of the government, the strength of the country's tenth, the power of the dream of New India, and the power of the resolution.
There are some individuals in the society, unless they talk disappointingly, they say that they dont work to create distrust, they do not find a broken path instead of building.
In such a scenario, when people talk about new hopes, new zeal and accomplishments of their lives then their success is not deserved by the government.
The story of a small girl from a remote village also inspires 125 crore people.
I am grateful to my countrymen.
You have connected 40-40, 50-50 lakh people with this video bridge and have given me new energy.
I once again express my gratitude to you.
I have also felt this smell of good.
In fact, the corporate professionals of Bengaluru, IT engineers have jointly created a simple prosperity trust and have activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
Through this trust, they have been connected with the farmers, have constructed the schemes and have been making efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
All these trainings are being imparted to the farmers through these Trusts to provide support to professionals, engineers and technologists.
Earlier the farmers who were dependent on just one crop so that the crops could not be used and the benefits were not there. Today, they are not only procuring several crops but also making good profits by proper marketing of crops through this trust.
Farming will be good only when good quality seeds are used and Seed Banks have been created separately for this.
Women are taking care of the Seed Bank and women are also associated with it.
My dear countrymen, one year of GST is going to be completed.
Today, the dream of the people of the country which was One Nation One Tax has been realised.
One Nation One Tax Reform: If I have to give credit to someone for this system then I will give credit to the states.
GST is a beautiful example of cooperative federalism where all the states decided to work together for the welfare of the country and as a result such a large tax reform system has been started in the country.
Till now, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can proud that the decisions taken in the GST Council so far, despite the different political views, individual States and representatives of different priorities.
Before GST, there were 17 different taxes in the country, but after the introduction of this system, there is only one tax regime in the country.
After the introduction of GST, check posts have also been discontinued and this has resulted in faster movement of goods and other goods which have not only saved time but also benefitted in logistics sectors.
GST is perhaps the world's largest tax reform system.
This huge tax reform in India has been successful because the people of the country have adopted this system and this Jan Shakti, Jan Grahati, has ensured the success of GST.
It is generally believed that such a massive reform will take 5-7 years to properly implement such a large country with such a large population.
But the zeal of the honest countrymen, the zeal of the festival of honesty and the participation of the people, the result of this is that within a year this new tax regime has established itself, has achieved its place and has also revised itself through an inbuilt system.
This is a great achievement that has been achieved by 125 crore Indians.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
You must have remembered that a team of six women commanders of the Navy had been travelling in the sea for several months.
I would like to say something about Navika Sagar Parikrama.
These six daughters of India have returned to India on 21st May through more than 250 days of IN-SV Tarini and welcomed them warmly.
Approximately 22,000 nautical distances have been covered in various oceans and seas.
This is an unprecedented event in the world.
Last Wednesday, I had got the opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate these daughters for their adventurous work, for enhancing the reputation of the Navy, for enhancing India's honour and especially the daughters of India.
You must have seen that in the last few days, new information has been received about Mount Everest-Jai people.
On 16th May, five tribal students of an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhurabe, Pramesh Ale, Umakanth Madhvi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Sawam won the highest peaks in the world.
They were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh since August 2017.
They were selected in Mission Shaurya.
And by winning the Everest with the help of the name, they have brought laurels for the country.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to the young students of Chandrapur School.
Recently, sixteen year old Shivangi Pathak has won Everest in Nepal as the youngest Indian woman.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter, Dia Everest, won the first father-daughter jute.
Not only is the youth winning Everest, but on 19th May, 5000 Mrs. Sangeeta Behal also won Everest.
There are also some Everest climbers who are not only skilled but also experienced.
This work is not only commendable but also accomplishes the responsibility of cleanliness and environment.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all those brave hearts, especially daughters.
So many people from different fields will come forward to support this.
In the context of Fit India, I believe that the more we play, the more we play, the more the country plays.
People are sharing videos of their Fitness Challenge in Social Media and also challenging others by tagging them.
I believe that this is a very good process and this kind of challenge encourages us to stay fit and fit for others.
My dear countrymen, several times you have heard something about sports and sportspersons from me in Mann Ki Baat.
"Thank you very much for your phone.
These games were a special part of the summer holiday.
Traditional games have two parallels.
There's an outdoor and there's an indoor.
One of the diversities of our country is perhaps one of these games.
The same game is known by various names.
It was played at the Square Board of 8. 08.
Its name is Atu in Madhya Pradesh, Pakirakali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Dayam in Tamil Nadu and Changpo in Rajasthan.
If the people of different states do not know each other's languages, they will be right at the time of the game.
That's a game everywhere in the villages and towns.
This is also known by various names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotibilla or Karabilla.
In Odisha it is called a shooting, in Maharashtra it is called Bittidalu.
Creating traditional sports is such a way that besides physical strength, it also helps to increase our physical talent, concentration, consciousness and speed.
And these are not just sports but also teaching the values of our lives, teaching goals, achieving stability, building team spirit and helping each other.
Just a few days ago, I had seen that our traditional games have been incorporated in the training programmes of Business Management to improve the overall personality and interpersonal skills.
At the same time, we are also aware of our culture and traditions.
Some sports make us aware about our society, environment etc.
Now schools, parasites, youth should come forward and encourage these games.
Through Crowd Sourcing, we can build a museum of our heritage sports.
This game can be made videotelling to show how to play the rules and regulations.
Animation films can also be made so that our new generation can know about these games, play and grow up, my dear countrymen
The theme of this time is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I would like to assure you that we will not use polythene, low grade plastic and we will try to reduce the harmful impact of plastic pollution on our nature, wildlife and our health.
I urge the World Environment Day website wedindia 2018 to look into all the information and try to use it in its everyday life.
Loss of lives and property damaged.
All these changes have been brought about in the Weather Pattern.
This is what Mahatma Gandhi has spoken for all his life.
Today, India is talking about Climate Justice, COP 21 and Paris Agreement, we have united the world through the International Solar Alliance, behind all these things, we are doing a good job to fulfil the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
On the occasion of Paryavasi Diwas, we have a little thought of what we can do to make this world cleaner and greener.
How can we move forward on this path, what can we innovate
It's raining.
Now we can plant a record number of trees and it is not only planting but it is also important to take care of them till the trees grow.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
Today, on 21st June, everybody remembers that not only you, but the entire world remembers 21st June.
All over the world, 21st June is celebrated as International Day of Yoga and it is unanimously recognized that the preparations for the event began a few months ago.
It is reported that preparations are being made to observe 21st June as International Day of Yoga.
Increases courage in yoga which always protects us like a father.
Forgiveness creates a sense of compassion, as mother feels for her own children, mental peace becomes our eternal friend.
The beneficiaries said that by doing yoga regularly, the truth is our son, please, our fear, self-confidence, our brother, the world is doing our bed and knowledge to hungry.
When a person is so talented, he naturally wins all kinds of fear.
Once again, I appeal to all the countrymen to take forward the vast heritage of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
My dear countrymen, today is 27th May, the first Prime Minister of India, Shri Pt. Jawaharlal Nehrus Tirodhan Diwas.
I salute Panditji.
In May 1857, the people of India had given the English their own strength.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were roaring against injustice.
Sadly, we have been calling the 1857 incident as a rebellion for a long time.
In fact, it wasn't just a small one, it was an attempt to hurt our self-esteem.
This brave Savarkar, fearlessly wrote that what happened in 1857 was not an insurgency but the first fight for freedom.
Savarkar was accompanied by the Veerra of India House in London to commemorate its 50th anniversary.
He was a worshipper of both armoury and science.
Veer Savarkar, who was familiar with his struggle against Bahaduri and the British Raj.
But apart from this, he was also an Ozvi poet and social reformer who always stressed on goodwill and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji has given a wonderful description of Savarkar ji.
Savarkar is taking both poetry and revolution together.
Being a compassionate poet, he was also a brave writer.
Our daughters, who were once forced to visit the houses from the waste stupas to households, today they are learning the work of sewing up the toilets and sewing the toilets of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters, who are full of hope and belief.
They have shown that if you are determined to do something and if you are committed to it then success can be achieved in all the difficulties and this is not just a signature but you will be able to see it at every corner of the country.
Look around you, neighbours will look at how people are defeating the problem.
You people have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we get satisfaction with the tea there, there are discussions and analysis with some people.
These discussions are political, social, film, sports, sports and sportspersons, and the country's problems should be solved in such a way, but most of the time this practice is limited to discussion.
He also organised education, health and food for all children coming to school.
He wiped out the darkness of their lives.
Tamso Maa Abhyangamaya: Who does not know this sadness, but it has been shown by D Prakash Rao.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the entire nation.
There will be many incidents that inspire you.
There's probably a lot of stuff.
Let us take forward the positive mindset.
In June, it is so hot that people wait for rain and hope for the clouds of the sky.
A few moments from today, people will also wait for the moon.
The sight of the moon is the emergence of the ID.
At the end of a month of fasting at Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a symbol of a bright festival.
My belief is that everybody will celebrate the festival with enthusiasm and especially the children will be benefitted with good wishes.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
My best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, thank you all very much.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Recently, Commonwealth Games were organized in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries of the world including India participated in the event.
When such a grand event was organised, thousands of sportspersons from all over the world participated in it, imagine how encouraging environment could be created by it
Our athletes also showcase excellent sports talent and win medals one after the other.
Whether it is shooting, wrestling, loading, table tennis or badminton, India has achieved record success.
India won 66 medals in 26 gold, 20 rupees and 20 bronze.
This has made every Indian proud.
After the end of the game, when India's representatives with medals hoisted athletes flags and medals on the Vijay Platform and played national music, the feeling of happiness, pride and honour is a unique experience.
But I want to tell you what I'm listening to these players.
India's performance at Commonwealth Games was very good at the same time it was unique.
Manika Batra won medals in all the events that Manika Batra had won.
Manika Batra is the first Indian woman who has brought gold medals to India in her personal Table Tennis.
The 15-year-old Indian shooter, Anish Bhanwala, has been the youngest player in India to win the Gold Medal.
India's only Chinese Commonwealth Games won the Para Power Lifting Medal.
This time the games have won most of the medals for the women players.
Whether it is squash or boxing, loading or shooting, women sportspersons have shown their valour.
At the end of Badminton, two Indian sportspersons, Sina Nehbal and P.
V.
The whole country has seen this game.
The sportspersons at the Games have come from small towns across the country.
We have reached this place with a lot of obstacles.
Their parents, parents, teachers, coaches, other helpers, school, school teachers and the environment of the school have played a vital role in the achievements that they have achieved today.
They also have the role of friends who have enhanced the morale of the players in all situations.
Together with the players, I thank them all.
John Gentlemen, Shri Shashikanth Bhosle shared a picture of his swimming pool and said, My body is my weapon, my basic material water, my world is swimming.
I feel happy and healthy by visiting the dawn written by Ruma Devnath.
He added that Fitness comes with a smile and when we are happy, we will laugh.
Smt. Devnath, there is no doubt that happiness is fitness.
Damn butterflies wrote a picture of their trekking.
Traveling and trekking for me is Fit I India.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that some of the names are also very attractively inspiring our youth for Fit India.
Chitravineta Akshaykumar gave a video on the tour.
I've seen that video, you'll see, and this video shows him exercising with a piece of wood.
He said that this exercise is very useful for the stomach and back muscles.
I believe that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
You must be preparing.
The importance of International Day of Yoga on 21st June has now been accepted by the entire world.
There is no need to tell anybody in India or the world about the use of Yoga for physical development, mental development and normalcy.
You might have seen an animated video that showed me.
The work that a teacher can do is being done through animation, so I thank the animation makers for doing this work with great care.
My young friends, all of you have come out of the examinations and exams and now you are thinking about the holidays.
I would like to invite you to do a new job today.
I have seen that many youngsters are now spending time learning something new.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to experience new lifestyles from far off the paper and computer.
My young friends, for a special internship today, I would like to urge you all to join the three Ministries of the Government of India such as Sports, Human Resource Development, Drinking Water Department, Swachh Bharat Summer II.
Those who have worked very well in colleges and universities will be awarded at the national level and those who have worked very well in colleges and universities will be successfully awarded the ICG.
I once again invite the students and the youngsters to join the INTERNSHIP and become beneficial.
I hope that our youth will take forward the movement of Swachhata.
I want to know about all your efforts.
You must send your experiences, send story, send photos, send video.
Let us regularly look at the programmes of India where people from different parts of the country are doing good work and how good they are talking about.
A few days ago, I was seeing that some of the youngsters from Delhi who are not able to afford to pay their dues to the poor children, these youngsters have started an encouraging activity to educate and educate children from Delhi.
Initially, they explained to the street beggars and children who worked in small businesses that they were also involved in the development work.
The 15 children from the slum neighbouring Geetha Colony, Delhi, have become a part of the learning process of two thousand children at 12 locations in the capital today.
In this campaign, young teachers have been making efforts to change the society by taking out two hours of free time from their daily busyness.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of Uttarakhand have set an example of inspiration for the farmers of the country.
They have changed the fate of not only their own but also of their respective regions.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, most of the thieves, cotton and yogurt are cultivated.
In the hilly areas, the farmers did not get the right price for their crops, but the farmers of Kopkot Tahsil avoided the loss of their produce directly in the market and took the path of value addition.
They have produced biscuits from farm crops and are selling the biscuits.
These farmers have created a government entity in Munnar and have opened the biscuits.
As a result of the efforts of the farmers, the administration has incorporated it into the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit has spread to almost 50 Anganwadi centres in Bageshwar district and to Kosani Almora.
With this effort of the farmers, the Turn Over of the companies has not only reached 10-15 lakhs but also provided food to more than 900 families.
My dear countrymen, I have often heard that a war for water will begin in the coming days.
Everyone says so, but don't we have any responsibility
Water conservation is not a new thing for Indians.
There is no need to know any particular language for reading the book.
In the past, our ancestors have done so.
They gave maximum importance to the importance of every drop of water.
They have made new ways to save every drop of water.
You will see that in many temples there are water irrigation systems, water conservation systems, water conservation, water conservation, lamp making etc.
Large inscriptions can be seen in the temples of Manarkobil, Chiran Mahadevi Kobilpatti and Pudukottai.
Even today, many bouries are known as step wells in the tourism sector, but they are a shining example of the water conservation efforts of our ancestors.
If you go to Rajasthan, you will definitely visit Chand Bauri in Jodhpur.
This is India's largest and most beautiful baury, we must remember that this is the largest baury in the region where there is acute water scarcity.
Water conservation will be as effective as the optimum time and precursor system for water conservation will be maintained in April, May, June-July.
The MNREGA budget can be spent on water conservation.
Several initiatives have been taken in the last three years for water conservation and water conservation.
Approximately Rs. 32,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water dams in the Manrega Budget every year.
In 2017-18, I can say that out of 64 thousand crore rupees, 55 or 35 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation.
In the last three years, this water conservation and water conservation system has benefitted about 150 lakh hectares of agriculture.
This work has been done with the hard work of about 40-45 villages.
I would like to say, April, May, June, July and coming, we can take a lot of responsibility for water conservation and water conservation in the coming days, take some plans and do something.
My dear countrymen, when Mann Ki Baat happens, there are several news reports, letters and phone calls from all around the country.
But the philosophy that preserves the noble prize winner Rabindranath Tagore's pacefully, beautyfully and integrity does not know anything about it.
Please tell us about Mann Ki Baat so that people can know about it.
He had a unique impression on everything in his writings, Rabindranath Tagore was a brilliant personality, a strange personality, but he always had a teacher in him.
He wrote in Geethanjali: "He who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students".
It means that when people are illiterate, they can feel hungry for others.
When he is thirsty, he can feel the thirst of others.
This is the time to recall the teachings and messages of the Father of the Nation.
The teachings of his life make us equal and commit ourselves to the path of brotherhood.
Once a question was asked to a Prophet: What is the best thing in Islam
The Prophet had said, To feed the poor and the underprivileged and to maintain goodwill with everyone without knowing.
Prophet Mohammad believed in wisdom and compassion.
He was not arrogant about anything.
He used to say that pride only embraces wisdom.
Poet Mohammad said that if someone has more than requirements, then give it to someone who needs it, for this reason Ramzan has a special significance.
The Holy Month is a month of pride for all the weaker sections.
Poet Mohammad believed that a person's own sacred soul enriched him.
My dear countrymen, Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is a land of compassion, service and sacrifice which has guided millions of people across the world.
Remembering Lord Buddha, this intellectual philosophy reminds us of the great responsibility of his striving, determination and action.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
It's the kind of human values that are the most needed in the world today.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar emphasised that Lord Buddha had a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
He said, "My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
The people of the country, be it the oppressed, the exploited or the deprived, have strengthened these marginalized people through the Constitution of Baba Saheb.
There can be no greater example than compassion.
Lord Buddha's compassion for human suffering was one of his great qualities.
We have inherited the teachings of Lord Buddha from all over Asia.
In many countries of Asia such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, the teachings of Buddha are also linked to the roots of Buddhism. And that is why we are building the infrastructure of Buddhism that connects the important places of Southeast Asia with the Buddhist regions of India.
I pray for the blessings of those great men for the entire world, so that we can fulfil our responsibility for building a peaceful and compassionate world in their ideals.
Today, we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statue of Lafing Buddha, which is said to have brought good fortune to Lafing Buddha, but very few people know that this co-existence is also associated with an important event in the history of India's security.
Perhaps you are wondering what could be the link between Lafing Buddha and the Indian army
You must remember that 20 years ago, on the evening of May 11, 1998, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had spoken to the countrymen who had conveyed the message of pride, valour and happiness to the entire nation.
There was a new confidence in the people of India that was spread all over the world.
That day was intelligent.
On 11th May, 1998, atomic test was conducted at Pokhran, Rajasthan in the western part of India.
Twenty years of his passing away, the test was conducted on Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
India's experiment was successful. In a way, India was able to demonstrate its strength in science and technology.
We can say that the day has been marked as a day to showcase his military might in Indias history.
Lord Buddha showed the world that inner strength is essential for peace.
Similarly, when you can become stronger as a nation, you can live peacefully with everyone.
The month of May, 1998 is not only important because the atomic test was conducted in that month, but it was more important than it was possible.
It showcased the entire world that India is the land of great scientists, and with a strong leadership, it has the potential to scale new heights and goals.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra Jai Jawan - Jai Kisan - Jai Vigyan.
Today, when we are going to commemorate the 150th anniversary of May 11, 1998, the mantra of Atal ji 'Jai Vigyan' for Indias strength, we have to move forward to build a modern India by self-sufficiently strengthening the mantra of 'Jai Vigyan'.
We have to make our own energy a part of India's energy.
And then we will be able to enjoy the journey that Atal ji had started to see.
My dear countrymen, I will talk about Mann Ki Baat again.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Representatives from ASEAN countries came here on 26th January and brought together various cultural groups.
It is a matter of great pride that most of them had presented the Ramayana to us.
That is, the inspiration and influence of Ram and Ramayana is the same not only in India but also in ASEAN countries in this part of the world.
My dear countrymen, I have received a lot of letters, e-mails, phone calls and opinions from you all this time too.
I have read what MyGov has written about the introduction of Online Course of Soft Cold Sanskrit.
Besides being an IT worker, I am glad to see your passion for Sanskrit.
I have asked the stakeholders to inform you about this.
I also urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat who are working on Sanskrit, to think about how this proposal of soft winter can be taken forward.
Shri Ghansham Kumar from Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar, said in the Narendra Modi App.
The concern that you have expressed about the decline in ground water level is truly important.
And Ayushman Bhoomi can happen only when we take care of every creature living in this land.
You have requested for water supply for animals and birds during the summer season.
Shackle-yeah, your thoughts have come to all the audience friends.
Speaking on the occasion, Shri Yogesh Bhadresha said, I would like to say something about the health of the youth.
He said the youth of our country are physically weaker than other Asian countries.
A few days ago, the French President had visited Kashi and had written to Mr. Prashant Kumar of Varanasi that he had touched his heart and inspired him.
He expressed interest that all the photographs should be published in the video social media.
Pachmadhi ji, the Government of India has shared all the photos on social media and the Narendra Modi App on that day.
I would like to tell all the children like yes, that if all these letters were sent to them, my entire day's tremors and hard work would be a temperament.
All these letters, all these phone calls, opinions, all that I have heard and all these things have touched my heart.
They wrote about their experiments, shared their holiday plans, and thought about the sufferings of animals and birds in the summer.
Farmer brothers and sisters have sent a letter to me about the ongoing activities of Kisan Mela and farming across the country.
I was advised by some conscious citizens about water conservation.
A lot of letters are coming to our festivals, our culture and traditions during the festival.
On reading your letters, I can understand that Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karimganj in Assam, had built nine schools for the poor children with his own will, only then could I realize the indomitable will power of this country.
When I hear the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Chakra of Kanpur, who walked on foot from the foothills and treated the foetus brothers and sisters and gave free medicines then it is a matter of pride for the patience and humanity of the country.
Siddul Losker, a taxi driver in Kolkata, died due to lack of timely treatment.
A lot of such motivational events have been inspired by my country.
Today, the whole world sees India in other eyes.
Today, when the name of India is enshrined with immense respect, then the emergence of children and children of this country remains hidden behind it.
My dear countrymen, in the coming months, it will become very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
Because there's a lot of farming letters.
This time, I have seen the video of my interactions with farmer friends on Doordarshan's DD Kisan channel and I feel that all the farmers should see this DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan and use the suggestions of agriculture in their own fields.
If we talk about Mahatma Gandhi, whether Shastri Ji or Chaturthi Charan Singh Ji or Chaturthi Devi Lal Ji, all of them considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and public life of this country.
Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri always emphasized on conservation of trees, plants, forests, etc. and the need for better agro-processing.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had said that there is a need for better income for our farmers, improved irrigation systems and ensuring all these things and creating a comprehensive public awareness to increase food and milk production.
In his speech in 1995, Charan Singh appealed to the farmers to use new technologies and innovate.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have recorded a record production over the last five years in 2015-16.
They showed that if the goal is fixed, there is complete self-confidence, there is a promise in the mind then everything can be done.
Today, with the hard work of the farmers, technology has been matched.
This will give a big boost to the agricultural producers.
I have seen the letter that has come to me, several farmer friends have written about the MSP and they want me to discuss it in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a major decision has been taken to provide the farmers the right price for their produce.
It has been decided that MSP for specified crops will be at least one and a half times the investment.
Besides, work on Agriculture Marketing Reforms is also underway to ensure that farmers get the right price for their crops.
Efforts are being made to ensure that the local markets of the villages are connected to the world market.
For farmers not to go far to sell their produce, it will be linked to APMC and e-NAM platform by upgrading the necessary infrastructure of 20,000 rural haats.
This means that a system is being created to connect with any market in the country from a single farm.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the start of the 150th anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.
How will the country celebrate this festival
I request you all to share your thoughts with everyone through mygov.
What can be the logo of Gandhi 150
All the work related to health was earlier under the charge of the Ministry of Health.
Preventive Health Care is cheap and easy.
The more we become aware of the Preventive Health Care, the more it benefits the individuals, the families and the society.
Cleanliness is the first condition of keeping life healthy.
Besides, work is underway to create Health Wellness Centre across the country.
As a Preventive Health Care, Yoga has created a new identity in the world.
Yoga promises to be both healthy and capable.
As a result of our commitment, Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
This year, International Day of Yoga is 21st June and there are no more 100 days left.
In the last three International Day of Yoga, people from all over the country and abroad participated with great enthusiasm.
We have to ensure that we join ourselves and encourage family members to join us.
In a new and innovative way, we have to popularise Yoga among children, young and old people, be it men or women.
Television and Electronic Media of the country have a separate programme on Yoga.
But can we create awareness about Yoga from now onwards as a campaign till Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga but I am a Yoga practitioner.
Some people have made me a teacher of Yoga through their own thinking and have made me a 3D animated video of my Yoga.
I would like to share this video with you so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Efforts are being made to make healthcare affordable, affordable and affordable for all.
Today, more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country, where more than 800 medicines have been sold at affordable prices.
Further new centres are being opened.
Heart Stent prices have been reduced to 85 for heart patients.
The cost of artificial knee transplant has also been reduced from 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, nearly 10 crore households, i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in the existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
A new medical college will be established in every three districts.
You need your help to reach this awareness to every person.
We all have to strive together to get rid of TB.
Many years ago, Dr. Ambedkar had spoken about India's industrialization.
Industrialization is a powerful medium in his thinking, which will benefit the poorest of the poor in the country.
Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt that India would once be a strong centre of labour and industry.
Today, when the Make in India project is progressing successfully across the country, it is his dream that will inspire us.
India's position in the global economy is now a bright star and the FDI inflows into India.
The world trade is now looking at India because we are now becoming hubs of investment and innovation.
Dr. Ambedkar was deeply trusted in self-reliance and self-reliance.
A person in the country should not live in poverty, so he wanted it to be Dr. Ambedkar.
He also firmly believed that poverty cannot be snatched away from the poor.
Today, schemes like Mudra Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India are developing young entrepreneurs in our country.
He said that the Doordarshan had spoken about the governance of rivers and valleys, and had envisaged that there would be a variety of executive committees for water conservation and use.
Today, the historical history of expansion of waterways and ports has begun in the country.
The new ports and old ports are also being reformed at the same time on the seashores of India.
In the decade of 1990, when the world was the second war, the cold war between the two powers and the country's worries, Dr. Ambedkar had imagined the spirit of Team India or India.
He understood the importance of Federalism and therefore thought that the Centre and the States must work together for the betterment of the country.
Today, we are blessed with cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism at every level of the country and governance.
The most important thing is that Dr. Ambedkar is an inspiration for several people like me from the backward classes of the country.
India's image is completely different: an India that belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the underprivileged.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organised across the country from 14th April to 5th May, 2019 to mark the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
The campaign will be undertaken across the country through various programmes for Rural Development, Poverty Alleviation and Social Justice.
I would like to congratulate all of you for taking part in this national mission.
My dear countrymen, in a few days, many festivals, festivals and festivals are coming up: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Vaishakhi.
The occasion of Mahavir Jayanti is a day to remember the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavir.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir, the propagator of non-violence, is an inspiration for us.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti.
Esther Ellie used to think of Christ Jesus who wanted peace of humanity, goodness, justice, kindness and compassion.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2018
We have seen that the colour of the sea looks blue, but we know from our daily experiences that there is no colour of water.
Have we ever thought of the river, the sea, the water becomes colorful
This question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This question was given by a great scientist in modern India.
When we talk about science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding performance in light scattering.
His discovery is known as the Roman Effect.
We celebrate 28th February as National Science Day every year, as it is said, on this day, he discovered Light Scattering for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana, scientists like Satyendra Nath Bose are proud of India.
The famous particle named Satyendra Nath Bose is also named after Boson.
Recently, at a function in Mumbai, I got the opportunity to inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
The extraordinary work being done in science is very attractive.
The Artificial Intelligence will help in manufacturing robots, bots and unspecified machines.
Nowadays, various machines are making their intelligence smarter through self learning.
It can help improve the lives of the poor, the deprived and the underprivileged.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists to know what kind of artificial intelligence can be used to make the lives of brothers and sisters easier.
Can we get a better prediction of natural disasters through artificial intelligence
Can Artificial Intelligence facilitate smooth access to healthcare
A few days ago, I had the pleasure of inaugurating the 'I Create' programme in Ahmedabad, Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel.
There was a young man who said that he had created a digital instrument where if anyone cannot speak, then the instrument meditating would become frightening and you can talk like you can talk to a person who is capable of speaking.
I think we can use Artificial Intelligence in such a way.
Scientific and Technological Valueutrals.
You don't add value to it.
Any machine will do what we want.
But it depends on us what we want from the machine.
Tomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the Lightball, failed many times in his work.
Once he was asked about it, he said, I have searched 10,000 ways of not making light balls, that is, Edison also made his failure stronger.
Incidentally, it is a privilege that today I am living in the workplace of Maharshi Aurobindo, in Auroville.
He challenged the British administration, fought against them, questioned their rule.
In this way, he questioned every aspect of life like a great sage, found answers and guided humanity.
Repeated questions are important to know the truth.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, I have received a lot of messages about safety and disaster in times of crisis, people have written to me something or the other.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, from Pune, has sent his comments on optical security at the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He said that in our country, apart from artillery and manufacturing, safestards are not good.
If we are not aware of safety in day to day life, if we cannot control safety, then it is even more difficult to ensure safety in times of great danger or misery.
Most of the accidents are the result of our mistakes.
If we remain cautious and follow the regulations, we can not only save our lives but also protect our society from any major accident.
Sometimes I have noticed that there are several directions on safety in the workplace, but those rules are not followed at all.
My request is that those municipalities and municipalities who have fire brigades should go to different schools at least once a week to drill students.
It will be of two benefits: the habit of being cautious of rioting and the new generation of children will be able to learn a lot.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading the nation to deal with the menace of disasters.
A scheme called Apada Mitra has been launched to train volunteers in Cyclone or Vanna Pravan districts.
Training and awareness are very important.
Till two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year in Lou or Hit Wave.
NDMA then organised workshops on Heat Wave and launched a campaign to increase public awareness.
We have a good outcome in the collective endeavour.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat waves fell unexpectedly to about 220.
This shows that if we give importance to safety then we can be safe .
I would like to honour all those who are present at the venue in the event of an accident and help the victims in rescue operations.
The number of such names - no-known heroes is no less.
Further, dangers are always present in the Fireand Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Para-Military Force and the brave soldiers of the Armed Forces who risked their lives and rescued others from the danger.
India and other MSTEC countries - Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal - participated in the exercise led by India a few days ago.
We've heard them many times.
But today if someone takes our plane and asks us, where is it, where is the life jacket, how to use it, I'm sure no one can answer it.
If we all become aware of our safety then the security of the society is also included in it .
My dear countrymen, in this budget, emphasis has been laid on the production of wasteto wealth and wasteto energy through biogas in the villages to create a Swachh Bharat.
Efforts have been initiated and it has been named as Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of the GOBAR Dhan Yojana is to make the villages clean and generate income and energy from dung and post-harvest waste to compost and bio-gas.
Animal dung and other biological fossils are used for energy generation in any European country and in China.
But it was not fully utilised in India.
We are moving towards this direction by incorporating it into Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen.
The target is to utilise the livestock dung, post-agricultural waste, kitchen waste etc.
Under the Gobar-Dhan Yojana, the farmers and rural brothers and sisters of rural India will be encouraged so that they see dung and waste not only as waste but also as source of income.
Use of biogas to cook and generate electricity will also increase self-reliance.
This will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
New employment opportunities will be created in the areas of waste collection, transportation, bio-gas sales etc.
An online trading platform will be created to ensure proper implementation of the Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I would like to urge the enthusiastic people, especially the sisters living in the villages, to come forward and make SelfHelp Groups and organise the subsidiaries to make full use of this opportunity.
I invite you to join the movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs, to convert the waste of your village into wealth and to make dung-rich with cow dung.
But we came to know of an unprecedented attempt at Raipur in Chhattisgarh and it is that the first ' Waste Festival ' organised in this state .
The objective of the festival, organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation, was to create awareness about cleanliness, creativeness of city waste and re-use of garbage.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Nagar Nigam, the entire Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for exhibiting this festival in a unique manner with the importance of waste management and cleanliness.
The International Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
Various events are held in the country and the world.
On that day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar was conferred on all those women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the last few days.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development, leaving women-led development.
Today, I am reminded of a speech by Swami Vivekananda.
Independence. A hundred and fifty years ago, this idea of Swami ji reflects the spirit of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life.
Today, our women power has given them self-confidence and self-confidence through their actions.
They have not only taken the country and society forward but have also taken the work to scale new heights.
Finally, our dream of a New India is that where women are empowered, strong and are equal partners in the overall development of the country.
A few days ago, a man gave me a great advice.
He recommended that on 8th March, various programmes were organized to celebrate Women's Day, but what can be done to honour the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village and city
This number is not small - 15 lakh women have been organised and have been running the cleanliness drive for a month.
Starting from January 26, 2018, in just 20 days, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand Jal-Shia i. e.
You can imagine how big it is.
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power, such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will transform the cleanliness drive in day-to-day life into a peoples habit.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching the news that electricity had reached three villages of Elephanta Island after seventy years of independence.
You are well aware that Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai.
It's an important tourist destination.
I am amazed to know that despite being such a big tourist destination in Mumbai, even after so many years of independence, electricity has not reached Elephanta.
For seventy years, the three villages of Elephanta Island - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Santant Bandar - all those darknesses in the lives of the people of that place have been removed and their lives have become bright.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that the Elephanta village and the Elephanta cave will now be lighted up.
This is not just an electricity but a new honour for development.
My dear brothers and sisters, a few days ago, we had celebrated the Shivratri festival.
The importance of Hollywood festivals is as important as Holiday Dahan, which is the reason why the evil was burnt to death by burning fire.
On the day of Holi, it is a beautiful moment and a messenger of love, unity and harmony.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
And two days ago, we had observed Republic Day at ease.
It was the first time in history that the top leadership of ten countries was present at the celebrations.
My dear countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathi wrote a long letter to me in the Narendra Modi App today. He expressed his desire that I should touch the coin of his letter.
He wrote, 1st February is the Day of Death of the Space Expeditioner Kalpana Chawla.
He has taken us away from the Columbia Space Accident but has inspired millions of youngsters around the world.
I express my gratitude to Bhai Prakash ji for starting his long letter with the passing away of Kalpana Chawla.
If there is a will and a firm commitment, if there is any hunger to do something then nothing is impossible.
Several pollutants of the country have contributed immensely to the creation of various components of BED.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Friends, I don't know how many names
Today, we talk about Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, but hundreds of years ago, in our scriptures, Skandhapuran, Dasputra, Kanyakumari, Dussehra Promotion.
This is the significance of women in our society.
And that is why in our society, women have been given the status of energy.
This woman power binds the entire country, all the society and the family at the brink of unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given several more examples.
He wrote that our adventurous Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharamans 'Sukhoi-30' warship will inspire him.
The three brave women thought Kanth, Mohan Singh and Avni Chaturvedi are driven fighter aircraft and are currently undergoing training in Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft.
Today, there are several areas where women are the first to live and our women power is doing something or the other.
It has also been added as e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, women have an important role to play in the ongoing positive transformation of the country and society.
Today, as we discuss women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment. You might be wondering what could be the connection between this.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first such railway station in India where all levels of staff are women.
Women employees in all departments.
Be it commercial department, railway police, ticket examiner, announcer, Point Person, more than forty women employees are handling the station.
Today, our energy is leading from the front.
Whenever there is talk of tribal women, there is a certain picture in everyone's mind, there will be jungles, there will be mountain chests, there will be a familiar view of the girl child walking on their heads.
But in Chhattisgarh, our tribal women, our energy has created a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is one of the Maoist-affected areas.
Violence, torture, bombs, guns and guns have created a terrible environment there.
Tribal women living in such a terrible situation are making their own self-reliance through e-rickshaws.
In a short span of time, all the women there have been part of this process.
On the one hand, as they are empowering themselves through self-employment, the Maoist-affected area is also changing the pictures.
Besides, it is also possible to provide special energy to conserve the environment.
I also compliment the district administration there. From grant-in-aid to training, the district administration has been playing an important role in the success of these women.
We have repeatedly heard that people have said that there is something that doesn't disappear from our existence.
Whatever negative excuses, the erosion, whatever is required, is to be acknowledged.
And the specialty of our society is to continue the process of self-reform.
The identity of any living society lies in the process of self-reform.
Centuries of endeavours against social evils, evils and policies are continuing in our country individually and socially.
Through this drive, efforts are being made to create awareness against social curse such as child marriage and wrestling.
He was sworn in in the State to fight against illicit policies such as penance and marriage.
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and enthusiastic youngsters, mothers and sisters, all of them have fought this battle.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, this human chain continues to penetrate across the borders of the state.
Such evil policies are required to ensure that all sections of the society participate in the real development process.
Come, let us all pledge to simultaneously eliminate such evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there and every person involved in the human chain for describing the specific and comprehensive issues for the welfare of the society.
My dear countrymen, Shri Darshan from Mysore, Karnataka has written in MyGov and spent six thousand rupees per year for the treatment of his father.
He was not aware of the earlier Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
But whenever he came to know about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, the price of medicines was reduced by up to seventy-five percent.
He expressed his willingness to talk about Mann Ki Baat while talking about it so that more and more people get information about it.
Over the past several years, many people have written to me about this.
I have also seen several videos and social media that are taking advantage of this scheme.
And when I come to know about such things, I am very happy.
I have a deep satisfaction.
And I was also pleased that Shri Darshan ji had a feeling that he had got the benefits of others.
This will benefit the common man, especially the elderly, who are forced to take medicines daily.
The life giving medicines bought from here are prepared according to the approved standards of the World Health Organisation .
This is the root cause of affordable quality medicines.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
These not only provide affordable medicines but also create new employment opportunities for private entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Amrit Stores of Hospitals.
The only purpose behind this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare services to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, from Maharashtra, Shri Mangesh has shared a picture on the Narendra Modi App.
It was such a picture that my attention was drawn to that photo.
A grandson has joined his grandfather in the Clean Morning River Cleanliness Campaign.
I have come to know that the citizens of Akola organised Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morana river through Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna river used to flow for twelve months earlier, but now the weather is dependent.
Sadly, the river was filled with wild grass and garbage.
A lot of waste was being wasted in the river and nearby .
Hence, an Action Plan was created by NIEA and a day before Makar Sankranti, four kilometres in the first phase of Mission Clean Morna from 13th January to clean both sides of the river Morna.
The Swachhta Abhiyan was carried out in a similar manner on 20th January and I have been told that this drive will continue every Saturday morning till the Morna river is completely cleaned.
This means that nothing is impossible if people make a solemn pledge to do something.
A massive change can be brought about through Jan Andolan.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and the city administration, all the citizens involved in making this work a Jan Andolan.
My dear countrymen, you have also heard a lot of discussions on Padma Awards recently.
Newspapers and television discussions have attracted attention.
But if you look at it with a little bit of attention then it will be a matter of pride for you, because it will be a matter of great pride for us and it will naturally be a matter of pride for us that how the common man of our country is reaching this height without any recommendation.
There is a tradition of awarding Padma awards every year but the entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can choose any person.
This has brought transparency in the process of online processing.
In fact, the election process of this award has been completely transformed.
All such persons have been awarded Padma Awards which cannot be seen in big cities, newspapers, TV, etc.
Now there is no identity of the person in the field of awards, but the importance of his work is increasing.
You might have heard about Shri Arvind Gupta ji.
He has been creating toys from the things that have been left out for four decades so that the youngsters can enhance their curiosity towards science.
His efforts are to encourage youngsters to pursue scientific experiments from unnecessary things.
This inspires youngsters by showcasing films made in 18 languages in 3000 schools across the country.
One such story belongs to Sitaba Jodatti of Karnataka.
She is not called the Goddess of Women Empowerment.
Since the last three decades, in Belagavi, he has done a great job in transforming the lives of countless women.
He had dedicated himself to the goddess at the age of seven, but he spent his entire life for the welfare of the goddesses.
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You can hear the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh. Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a poor family, in a tribal family.
He used to have a small job for leading life but he was fond of creating traditional tribal paintings.
Today, he is respected not only in India but also in the whole world for this hobby.
His paintings have been exhibited in many countries like Nalanda, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who has brought laurels for India abroad, has been recognized and awarded Padmashree.
You will be surprised to hear the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutty.
Lakshmikutty taught in Kollar area and still lives in the tribal areas in the middle of dense forests in shade huts.
He has produced five hundred herbal medicines depending on his memory.
He has the skills to manufacture snake bites.
Lakshmiji has been serving people with her knowledge of these herbal medicines.
This unconscious personality has been recognized and honored with Padma Shri for his participation in the society.
Today, I would like to mention another name. The 75-year-old Subashini Mistrik of West Bengal has also been selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistri is a woman who has distributed utensils and vegetables in the houses of other people for the construction of a hospital.
When he was thirty years old, his husband died due to lack of medical treatment and this incident inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in the hospitals created due to their hard work.
I firmly believe that there are many such jewels, women and gems in our multi-storeys, whom no one knows or knows.
Sometimes people should come to school and college to know about their experiences.
There should be some effort in society outside the awards.
My dear countrymen, every year on January 9, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
This is the day when revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
Today, we celebrate unbreakable bonds between Indians and Indians residing in different parts of the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we organized an event where all the MPs and mayors of Indian origin living in different countries of the world were invited.
You will be happy to note that Indian descendants and mayors from Malaysia, Malaysia, Malaysia, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa, America and many other countries have joined the event.
Our Indian diaspora, who lives in various countries of Europe, who are working on cyber security, who are associated with Ayurveda, who are delighted in the society through music or poetry.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for the recognition of the Indian diaspora and for their contribution to the entire world.
On 3rd January, the revered Bapu, who showed us a new path.
These were not just the basic elements.
Even today, we can see every step that Bapu's message was justified.
If we make a solemn pledge to follow the path shown by Bapu then what can be a greater tribute than what can be done
My dear countrymen, I conclude by congratulating you all on the auspicious occasion of two thousand eighteen years.
Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2017
This is the last episode of Mann Ki Baat this year and the last day of the year 2017 is also the last day of the year.
This year, I and you have shared a lot of things for almost a year.
The exchange of letters, comments and opinions on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat always keeps me filled with a new zeal.
Within a few hours, the years will change, but this continuity of our conversation will continue.
In the coming New Year, we will share new experiences and new ideas.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
A few days ago, the whole world was smoked by the Festival of Hollycles.
This festival will be celebrated with great joy throughout India.
At this time of Christmas, we remember the teachings and teachings of Jesus Christ, and the greatest emphasis on Jesus Christ was the spirit of service.
This service is also evident in the essence of thought.
Shri Ramkrishna Paramhansadeva also said that Shiva is serving life in wisdom and every word has a human value all over the world.
Dear countrymen, this year also marked the 350th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
He has always inspired human beings in all these poets, poets, philosophers and great warriors.
He has taught us to fight injustice and atrocities, he has shown the way to freedom from the bonds of caste and religion.
And in this endeavour, he had to lose a lot in his personal life, but he never gave up his inferiority complex.
Every moment of his life was filled with love, sacrifice and peace.
Let us commit ourselves to take inspiration from the teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and his great philosophy of life and recognise his ideals in our lives.
You must be surprised to know that the New Year comes every time and even the coins come every time, what is the special day
The entire India is looking forward to welcoming you in the 21st century.
You must be proud of yourselves as voters of the 21st century.
The power of arbitration is the greatest strength of democracy.
Remember, you can also play a crucial role in building the 21st century India and it is going to start from 1st January.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had specially spoken to the youth of 18-25 years of age, full of energy and determination.
I believe that the dream of a New India will be fulfilled by immensely possessing the capabilities and strength of the youth.
The New India that we are talking about in the coming days is a poison-free India of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
India is free from dirt and poverty.
New India, whose leadership will be powerful, peaceful, unity and goodwill.
Make a path for yourselves, connect those people who are associated with you, and be prosperous in this manner, let us move forward.
Would you like to imagine how we plan before 2022
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom movement into a peoples movement.
My young friends, this is the need of the hour that we also transform the dream of a beautiful and meaningful India of the 21st century into a mass movement.
Today, a lot of opportunities have been created for the youth.
From Skill Development to Innovation Rentrepreneurship, our youngsters are coming forward and succeeding.
I would like to ask you to think about how to find a place in New India Youth and create a system in this regard so that when the next year is over, he can easily know about all these things, and he can take advantage of it.
My dear countrymen, I had talked about Impactivity in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Nothing is impossible for a person who is positive and encouraging.
Pessimism Leadstoo Wicknes, Optimism to Power.
I had requested the people of India to share their positive moments in 2017 and welcome 2018 in a positive atomsphere.
I am happy that people have shared their experiences and experiences on social media platforms, MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
Positive India hashtag with lakhs of tickets, which has reached more than 1. 5 crore people.
The composition of an economist has started in India and has spread to the entire world.
The Tweet Arresponse that came was inspiring.
There was a feeling of happiness.
Some of the countrymen have discussed all the facts that have had a positive impact on the minds of those incidents this year.
Some people shared their own experiences.
Sound byte  Name Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Bihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
 Namname Jyoti Rajendra Growth
And he died at the accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
We were very much benefited by this support of the government and we were able to handle the situation.
 My name is Santosh Yadav.
National Highway was constructed in 2017 from different villages across our villages.
Two incidents that our Indian soldiers had done - the surgical strike carried out by the Pakistanis, which destroyed the extremist launching pads and at the same time it was unparalleled for our Indian soldiers in Doklam.
 My name is Satish Bevani.
Over the last forty years, there was water shortage in our area and we were dependent on the pipelines built for the army.
Now we have a pipeline.
So in 2017, we didn't get this bigger.
There are many people who are doing such things at their own level so that there is a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India that we all are working together.
Let us enter the year 2018 with all these small joys, let us begin the New Year and take concrete steps towards Positive India.
When we're all talking about positive, I want to share one thing.
I came to know about the inspirational story of Topper Anjum Bashir Khan Khatk of Overcoming Kashmir Administration.
He has come out of the stigma of radicalism and hatred and has topped the examination of the ESK Administration Service.
You will be surprised to know that the rebels burnt his ancestral home in 1990.
There was so much violence and jealousy that his family had to leave their ancestors behind.
The atmosphere of violence around a small child was sufficient for darkness and bitterness in the heart, but Anjum did not let it happen.
He never gave up hope.
Today, he has been inspired not only from Jammu and Kashmir but also from the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that no matter how bad the situation may be, the clouds of despair can also be destroyed through positive work.
Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
This is the strength of the country, this is the strength of our youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever the world's famous religious places are discussed, the Sabarimala temple of Kerala is very natural.
Millions of devotees are present here every year on the blessings of Lord Ayyappaswamy in this world famous temple.
When such a large number of people visited this place, how big a challenge can be to maintain transparency in that place
And especially in the mountains and forests.
P.
Vijayan, a police officer, started a program called Punyanam Punkavanam and started the Swachhta Abhiyan to raise awareness about cleanliness.
This campaign is a pilgrim who will not complete his pilgrimage till he is doing some or the other physical work for cleanliness.
There is no small difference in this campaign.
Every pilgrim is taking part in the cleanliness drive as a part of the worship of God.
Every morning, there is a strange sight of this cleanliness and all the pilgrims are present here.
Be it celebrity or be it wealth or be it a big officer, or be it a common pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgrim or be it a pilgri
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
The Swachhta Abhiyan in Sabarimala has been accomplished, Punyanam Punkavanam has been successful and all the pilgrims participated in it.
And we have taken a pledge that when Bapu will be the 150th Birth Anniversary, we will do something to give a Swachh Bharat to his dream.
Efforts are being made at a massive level across the country for cleanliness.
There is a change in the participation of people in rural and urban areas.
The Swachh Survekshan-2018, the worlds largest survey, will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to monitor the progress of sanitation at the urban level.
The programme will cover over 40 crore people in more than four thousand cities.
The Swachhata App will provide analysis for revision of the usage and service sector.
It will be seen that every citizen of the city is connected with the process of keeping the city clean and it is transformed into a habit of the city.
My dear countrymen, some things seem to be very small, but in a society it becomes far-reaching.
Today, I have mentioned such an incident in Mann Ki Baat programme.
After decades, this injustice is happening to Muslim women
However, the Muslim women of our country have not been empowered.
I am very happy that our government has focused on this thing.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken urgent steps in this regard and has removed this barrier from a 70 year old tradition.
Today, a Muslim woman can go to Hajkar without pride and I am glad that this time around 1300 Muslim women have applied to go to Mehram Viharhaj and Muslim women from different parts of the country - from Kerala to North India - have expressed their desire to go to Haj.
I have suggested to the Minority Affairs Ministry that the women who want to go to Haj alone should get permission from them.
Our efforts will be to ensure that our women get equal rights and equal opportunities in the way of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26th is a historic day of our country.
But the day of 26th January, 2018 will be specially remembered.
It was never before in India's history.
The year 2017 was remarkable for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN has completed 50 years and India has completed 25 years of its MoU with ASEAN countries in 2017.
It is a matter of great pride for us that on 26th January the ten great leaders of the world have met together.
My dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, however, our country is a country of economics.
Perhaps there isn't a day when there's no claw.
Recently, we all celebrated Christmas, and the New Year is coming.
May the New Year bring happiness, prosperity and happiness to all of you.
Let us all move ahead with new initiatives, new zeal, new hopes and resolves.
In January, the sun was resurrected and Makar Sankranti was celebrated.
It is a festival related to nature.
On the one hand, each of our legacy is somehow connected with a natural phenomenon, but in our culture full of diversity, the way to fulfil these incidents of nature is different.
All these portals are covered from 13th to 17th January.
The names of these mountains are different, but there is only one element in its depth - nature and agriculture.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There is hardly anybody in India who does not remember or respect him.
He testifies to our youth and to the facts of the country.
He completed the ninth year on 28th September.
I had the privilege of talking to Didi on the phone before my foreign trip.
This conversation was exactly the same as a younger brother spoke with his elder sister very carefully.
Latadi, Salutations.
I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
Greetings.
Modi ji: I had called for this because this time on your birthday I will be busy traveling by air.
I will be back on the 28th of the night, and on the 29th of the morning, your birthday will be over.
Okay, okay.
Lota ji: At the age many grow up, but it is very important to get the blessings of those who grow up with their work.
Yes, but I think this is the blessings of my parents and the blessings of all the audiences.
Modiji:..
I'm more happy when you proudly say your mother was Gujarati...
No, I don't want to hurt you anymore because I can see and know how busy you are and how much you work.
How much to think about.
When you brought your mother's handkerchief, I sent someone to see him, take his blessings.
My mother was also very happy to see your love.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all on your birthday.
But I was so busy that I couldn't take time.
Yes, yes, yes, sure
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, the atmosphere of festivals will once again be filled with new zeal and resolve.
It's a festive season
Over the next few weeks, the festival will continue to be cheerful and glorious throughout the country.
The house will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of this joy of festivals.
And it is called the darkness in the bottom of the lamp.
Perhaps this proverb is not just a word, it is an instruction for us, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Just imagine, some rooms are illuminated in the light
On the other hand, in front of him, there are some people in the neighbourhood.
In some houses, sweets are destroyed, and in some houses children are sweet for sweets.
At least, additional or non-vegetarian items can be delivered out.
In many cities, start-ups of young friends from several ENGOs are doing the same.
They collected dresses, sweets, food from the people's house, then they found the bad guys and brought the things back to them.
Can we sleep on the banks of the lamp with full awareness and determination during this festival
Laxmi was welcomed in the traditional tradition.
In our culture, girls are considered as Lakshmi because they bring fortune and prosperity.
This year, can we have universal programmes to honour girls in our society, villages and cities
Can we have a programme to honour these lakhs of people of India on this Diwali
There are many daughters and daughters around us who are doing excellent work.
Some people are working for the education of poor children, some are creating awareness about cleanliness and health, some are serving the society as a doctor-engineer and others are trying to bring justice to someone as a lawyer.
May our society take pride in their recognition and honour.
The programme to honour them should be implemented across the country.
You can do one more thing, share the achievements of these girls in social media as much as possible and use hashtagbharatkilaxmi.
Like all of us had carried out a massive drive called Selfie with Dotter, which had spread across the globe.
My dear countrymen, I have said this thing in Mann Ki Baat earlier, it has been a great advantage that I had the privilege of speaking directly or indirectly with many familiar people.
A few days ago, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tayong, sent me a very attractive letter.
I'm Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
I'm very happy to read. I thought it would be very useful for me to read the book before examining.
I liked a lot of things in this book, but I also noticed that there are many suggestions in this book for students, but there is nothing in this book for parents and teachers.
See, my young friends also have the confidence that the main servants of the country will have to do something.
My little student friend, I thank you for writing letters first.
Thank you for reading Ekam Warriors twice or thrice.
If I can take time for the new version, I will definitely try to write something for the parents and teachers as you want.
But I'll put an application to all of you.
Can you help me
I must consider them.
I will think about it and I will definitely try to write it in my own language, in my own way.
It may be that if your suggestions come in plenty, my new version will also be confirmed.
So I'll wait for your opinion.
I once again thank our young student friend Arunachal Alina Tayong.
My dear countrymen, you are aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of India through the news papers and TV.
But you know that I'm a common man like you.
I also heard that speech and watched the match.
The simplicity and transformation of the 23-year-old Daniel Madambhav is an influx of everyone.
I must have been impressed.
Shortly before that speech, he won 19 Grandslam winners and finalized near Tennessee Legend Raphael Nadal.
If someone else was sorry, he would be disappointed.
He complimented Sportsman Spirit for losing his last stand after a tough fight.
Champion Nadal also complimented Danil for his performance.
In the same match, the morale of the loser and the humble use of the winner are both teaching.
If you don't listen to the speech of Daniel Medvedev, I would especially urge all of you to watch the video.
It has a lot to learn for people of all ages.
Even the moments beyond defeat, these moments don't make sense to win our lessons.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, what I am going to say is just for your good.
Arguments, debates and defaults will continue, but the problem should be resolved before any issue is resolved.
Otherwise, the problem takes a magnitude and solving it becomes a tough thing.
If we're awake at the root, we can save a lot.
With this feeling, I believe that my young friends must talk about an urgent subject.
We all know how harmful the drug addiction to the health and once it becomes a bad practice, it is difficult to get rid of it.
Tobacco cornea is intoxicating.
The consumption of this tobacco in Kaishora is also harmful for the development of the brain.
We all know about these things, but today I want to inform you about a new topic.
You are aware that recently a ban on e-cigarette has been issued in India.
This e-cigarette is an electronic device different from ordinary cigarettes.
In e-cigarette, nicotine liquids are heated and chemical smoke is produced through which nicotine enters the body.
We know about the dangers of ordinary cigarette, but there is a misconception about e-cigarette that it is not harmful.
Aromatic chemicals are used to avoid stink like common cigarettes.
We normally see Father chain smoker in a family he tried so that nobody else in the family smoked.
And the little cigarettes in the grocery, keep them away from the bee.
There is no smoke about cigarette, those who are selling, those who are buying or seeing, they all know that cigarette is harmful.
But the issue of e-cigarette is quite different.
There's very little awareness about this.
People are not familiar with the devastating aspect of e-cigarette and this is why dedication-cigarettes have entered the room.
Sometimes the children are playing magic in front of their mothers and fathers, without fire, without smoking the countryside, they say e-cigarettes and the big ones give a big hand.
You know, we smell it when someone around us ate the cigarette.
Even in pockets, cigarette packets can be smelled.
But this is not the case with e-cigarettes, be it the youngsters, ignorant or fasion statements, in their own bags, in the middle of the books, or in their hands, or in the pockets.
Youth power is the future of our country.
E-cigarette has been banned so that these new instruments of intoxication do not ruin our country, do not destroy the dreams of the family, do not destroy the lives of the children.
Somehow this drug addiction cannot root in society.
I urge you all to abandon the practice of tobacco and stop any misconceptions about e-cigarettes.
You must remember Fit India.
Fit India means not just going to the gym every morning and evening.
The name of Fit India is also to avoid all these misconceptions.
I believe you don't feel bad about me, but you'll feel better.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of great privilege for us that India is the birthplace of such great personalities who have dedicated their lives for others and not for themselves.
Our India, this land is a multi-storeyed boss.
A lot of humanitarian gifts have been given by this country.
A human being is going to be honoured in Vatican City on October 13, which is a matter of pride for all of us.
On that day Pope Francis is going to announce a cent to Marium Thresia.
Sister Marium Thresia has contributed immensely to the well-being of humanity in the short span of fifty years.
I once again pay my respects to Sister Maryam Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially my older brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world that today when we are going to celebrate Gandhi 150, at the same time, 130 crore Indians have pledged to stop using Single Use Plastic completely.
The way India has taken the lead in preserving the environment, the world is now looking at India.
I am sure that you all will join the next mission Single Use Plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing to this mission in their own way.
However, a youth of our country has started a unique mission.
His work attracts me and I try to understand and understand his new plan by talking to him on phone.
Perhaps his words will help other people in the country.
It was new to me when I first heard the plogging word.
Perhaps this meagre measure is used abroad.
Hello, Ripudamanji, this is Narendra Modi.
With this, we will not only take care of ourselves but we will also be able to save the health of mother Earth.
I believe that 130 crore Indians will move ahead with this goal and we will take 130 crore steps to build a single useful plastic free India.
Rippu Daman ji, thank you very much once again
My dear countrymen, the preparations for 2nd October are going on throughout the country and around the world, but we want to take the 150th anniversary of Gandhi Ji.
We want to make our lives better for the country.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is the dream of all of us and that is why on 31st October every year we are organizing the Run for Unity in the country.
My dear countrymen, perhaps you might remember from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August that by 2022, you will go to fifteen places in India.
Go to at least 15 places and try to stay there for midnight.
Look at India, understand, feel it.
We have so many varieties.
On the occasion of Deepawali, whenever there is a holiday, all of you go for a walk and I urge you all to travel to 15 places in India.
You will be happy to know that India has made great strides in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index and it has been possible with your cooperation.
This is especially due to understanding the importance of traveling.
That is, we have moved ahead at this very time and if we try more then we will be able to make a place in the world before the completion of 75 years of independence.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of diverse India.
It will also be seen that on the day of Diwali, there will not be any fire incident or any person will be harmed due to fireworks.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
Six days after Deepawali, the surviving Mahaparab Chhat is one of the most rules-based festivals in our country.
Everything from food to dresses is followed by tradition.
Chhath Puja is completely associated with the unparalleled nature and the worship of nature.
On the one hand, the sun and water, the centres of worship of the great mountains, and the utensils made of bamboo and soil, and the common materials associated with the worship of the original.
It also includes the expression of the importance of cleanliness in our lives.
Before Chaturbhuti, all the people gathered together with the fervour of sanitation, rivers, ponds, ponds, shrines, i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja - Conservation of environment, Disease Reduction and Discipline.
Behind this tradition of eating the prasad, it is also logical that it destroys the pride and the egoism that hinders the progress of the individual.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that Mann Ki Baat has tied up with the masses of this country.
Take the examples of Khadi and Handloom.
You must be glad to hear that there is so much sale in just one store in Khadi and Handloom.
During Deepawali, Khadi gift coupons have seen an increase of six hundred and eighty percent.
The volume of Khadi and Handicrafts has also increased by nearly ninety percent this year compared to last year.
It is evident that today youngsters, elderly people, women and people of every age group are enjoying food and handlooms.
I can imagine how much it has benefitted from the families of tenants, poor families, handloom families.
And we talked about Khadi for Fashion but in the last few years, I have been told that after Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion, Khadi for Transformation is taking that place.
Khadi has emerged as a powerful tool to empower the poorest of the poor, from the poorest of the poor.
He's playing a very big role for the village.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written in the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about my experience of Diwali with the Defence Forces and he also wants to know how the Defence Forces embraces Diwali.
Shri Tejas Ghoshwad also wrote on the Narendra Modi App: How can we make arrangements to reach out to our defence forces
We also think of our heroic defence forces.
We also believe that the sweets of our homes should reach out to the soldiers of the country.
You all must have spent Deepawali with great joy.
Deepawali has come here with a special experience for me.
I am fortunate to have celebrated Diwali with our brave defence forces once again deployed across the border.
This time, Deepawali along with the security forces in the Gujarat sector of Jammu and Kashmir has become unforgettable for me.
On behalf of all the people of our country, I salute every soldier of our defence forces for their struggle, dedication and sacrifice to protecting the nation by facing the difficult situation on the border.
When we get a chance, when we get an opportunity then we should know the experiences of our soldiers, they should listen to their glorious stories.
Many of us don't know that our defence forces are playing a vital role not only in border but also in ensuring peace across the world.
As UN Peacekeeping Forces, they are making India proud all over the world.
A few days ago, on 24th October, United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everybody remembers the contribution of the United Nations towards peace in the world.
And we believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is our family all over the world.
And for this belief, India has been contributing actively to the United Nations.
You must be aware of the proposition of the Constitution of India and the proposition of the UN Charter, both of them started with the words 'We the People'.
India has always emphasized on equal rights of women and is a living example of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
In its opening statement, the proposal was Al-Main and Barn Free and Equivalent, which has been reversed in the efforts of India's representative Hansa Mehera, and later is Olhuman Beings and Barn Free and Equivalent.
It seems to be a very small change, but we can see a healthy thinking in it.
India is one of the most important contributors to the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.
India has always played a major role in the UN Peacekeeping Mission.
There are people amongst you who may first know this information.
More than 8,000 defence personnel have contributed to UN peacekeeping efforts.
At present, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with the United Nations Peacekeeping Industry and this is the third largest in the world.
Until August 2017, about 50 of the world's sole peacekeeping efforts have contributed.
These efforts are being undertaken across the globe in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan etc.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated at Indian Army Hospitals in Congo and South Sudan and have been rescued.
India's defence forces have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts by spreading peace and security.
Indian women have played a key role in peacekeeping.
Very few people know that India is the only country that sends women police units to Liberia for UN peacekeeping operations.
And see, India's move has become an inspiration for all the countries since then.
Since then, all the countries have started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to know that Indias role is not limited to peacekeeping, India is also training the peacekeeping forces of 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha are delivering the message of peace and harmony across the world.
Peacekeeping campaign is not very helpful.
Our security forces have to work in remote areas of the Jawans.
They have to understand different situations and different cultures.
Remembering him, the hearts of all the countrymen are filled with pride.
He was the only member of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force who was a brave man who was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeepers who has specially acknowledged his work in Cyprus.
In 1989, at the age of 72, he was appointed the Commander of the Army in Namibia's mission and served to ensure the independence of Namibia.
The former Prime Minister of the Indian Army, Mr. Thimayya, led the UN Peacekeeping Force at Cyprus and established himself in peace.
India is always sending a message of peace, unity and goodwill to the world as ambassadors of peace.
Our belief is that we live a peaceful and harmonious life and move forward towards a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our sacred land, this India, is blessed with the blessings of all such great personalities who have served humanity in a selfless manner.
Sister Nivedita, who is well-being and revered by Bhagni Nivedita, is also one of these great men.
Margaret Elizabeth was born in Ireland and later gave her the name of Swami Vivekananda Nivedita.
Nivedita means who is fully dedicated.
Later, he showed the excellent glory of his name.
Yesterday was the 150th Birth Anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his life for the welfare of the poor and the deprived.
Sister Nivedita used to suffer from the atrocities of the British Raj.
The British tried to compel Indians not only physically but also psychologically.
We have always tried to define our culture as low and unbroken.
Bhagni Nivedita revived the glory of Indian culture.
He encouraged the national consciousness, awakened and helped the people unite.
He travelled across the globe to protest against the propaganda of Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
The renowned nationalist Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati will be famous for his revolutionary poems Pudumai Pennel, NewWomen and Nari Sashaktikaran.
It is said that Bhagni Nivedita was the source of inspiration for all this.
The great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose was also helpful in several ways.
Through his writings and conferences, Shri Basur has helped both in publication and publicity of all the tests.
This is a wonderful co-existence of our India where the spirituality and science of our culture is commendable to each other.
Sister Nivedita and Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose.
In 1899, a magnificent plague of Kalkata megacity was swept away by the death of a man in Shaw.
Sister Nivedita came forward in the Rastaghat, Narmada Safai Abhiyan by ignoring her health.
This is the woman who gave up her luxury and joy for the poor and the distressed.
Sister Nivedita, who has given her everything to India, is resting here.
Undoubtedly, it's universal truth.
This will be a tribute to this great personality - if every Indian learns from his life and follows the path shown by him.
Thank you for your phone.
First of all, I convey my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the most important part of building a New India, the hero of the future.
Your anxiety is correct, the diseases that were seen earlier in adulthood are now being seen in your childhood.
It's surprising to hear that kids too are suffering from diabetes.
But now there has been a lot of change in our lives.
Nowadays these diseases are called lifestyledisorders.
The main cause of all these diseases at a young age is lack of physical labour and change in food habits.
It should be monitored by both the society and the family.
It will be noted that there is no unusual or terrible change.
What we need is to concentrate on small things and make them their habits.
I want the people of the family to make sure that the children play open fields.
If possible, the elders of the family will also join them.
Children should be habituated to using stairs instead of lift.
After dinner, the whole family will walk with the kids.
India Yoga will help in creating a habit of healthy life of our youth and protecting them from lifestyle disorder.
Yoga is simple because Yoga can only be taught.
No specific equipment or field.
Several tests are being conducted in the field of diabetes control.
A lot of work has been going on in this regard in AIIMS and the results so far have been very optimistic.
Ayurveda and Yoga should not only be considered as disease-free, but should also be a part of everyday life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have delivered good news from the world of sports in the last few days.
India has good news in badminton like Hockey.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth has won the Denmark Open and has made every Indian proud.
After the Indonesian Open and Australian Open, this is his third superstar award.
I congratulate this youngster for his success and for Indias pride.
Friends, FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month.
The teams from all over the world have come to India to participate and their sporting skills have impressed us.
I had a chance to see a match.
The audience was very enthusiastic.
The World Cup is a big event, where the world is watching you.
I was surprised to see the enthusiasm, zeal and inspiration of the youngsters.
The World Cup has been successfully organised and all the teams have demonstrated their best skills.
Even if India cannot win, the players of India have won the hearts of all.
India and the entire world have enjoyed this festival, and for football lovers, the entire football tournament was very entertaining.
The future of football is very bright and it is predicted.
I once again congratulate all the athletes, their colleagues and all sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, if I have to be very careful about Swachh Bharat then I will have to do Mann Ki Baat everyday and I will have to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes the youngsters take the pictures of their youngsters and sometimes the success of the Team Fort.
There is an incident of innovation on cleanliness somewhere. News inspires officers to work somewhere.
A few days ago, I had received a bouquet where the Chandrapur fort of Maharashtra is described as a renovation.
The entire team of NGO, called the Ecological Protection Organization, conducted a sanitation drive at Chandrapur Fort.
They sent me two pictures before and after the safai.
I am surprised to see that those around me who have been disappointed with the filthy atmosphere of filth and filth, wondering how to clean so many dirt, they can see the pictures of this Chandrapur Fort and I would like to tell them about how the work, resolve, jealousy and livelihood of the youngsters of the Ecological Protection Organisation has been reflected.
Your frustration, your unbelief, will disappear.
The Bhagirath effort for cleanliness is a unique example of beauty, dedication and dynamism.
The castle is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of all the people of the country to protect and preserve the historical solar energy.
I thank all the employees of the Ecological Protection Organization and all the residents of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak on 4th November.
Guru Nanakshu is not the first Guru of the Sikh community, he is the Jagadguru.
He spoke of the welfare of the entire humanity, equal to all the nations and communities.
Emphasis has been laid on womens self-esteem and empowerment.
Guru Nanak Devji walked 228 thousand kilometers and spread the message of humanity in this journey.
He has joined the people, has guided them to honesty, sacrifice and work.
He did not just speak in his mouth, he did it in his life and his work.
He started the langarkhana and served the people.
The consumption of food at anchorage at simultaneously creates unity and equity.
Guru Nanak has spoken of three aspects of a meaningful life, name the Supreme, be labourful and help the troubled.
Guru Nanak also created Guruvani for his propaganda.
550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak will be celebrated in 2019.
Come, let us try to come back to life by following his teachings and teachings.
My dear countrymen, after two days on 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will celebrate his birth anniversary.
We all know that he had created a plan for an integral modern India.
We can learn a lot from the wonderful life of this great son of Mother India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had worked as a catalyst for India.
Millions of Indians were ensured in the umbrella of One Nation One Constitution.
His deliberations gave him the strength to overcome all obstacles.
He has set a goal and has progressed in the entire world, he has moved forward.
He used to say, "One person can do the work of a rhinoceros, who dreams of a nation where everyone has equal rights."
I want Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel to always inspire us.
He said that we cannot change the diversity of the nation and the community. Every woman and man of India should make a future of love and mutual love and goodwill.
The words of Sardar Saheb are still the inspiration and energy of our New India Vision.
And that is why his birthday will be celebrated as the National Unity Day.
His contribution to make our country an integral part of it is unforgettable.
On 31st October, Sardar Saheb's birthday, the Run for Unity will be organised across the country where children, women, youth and elderly people will be involved.
I urge you all to participate in the Run for Unity festival.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali, you have returned to your everyday life with a new resolve and a new commitment.
I convey my best wishes to all my countrymen for fulfilling all their dreams.
What's the matter, September 2017
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat, through the Akashvani.
Today is the 36th edition.
Most of them encourage me.
And I take half an hour of your time every month, but people keep on talking about Mann Ki Baat for thirty days.
And that is why the government is also creating a simple sense of compassion for the society.
And that is why the journey of three years of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of thinking and feeling for the countrymen.
And perhaps in such a short span of time, I am extremely grateful to my countrymen for the opportunity to share the feelings of the common man.
In Mann Ki Baat, I often remember Acharya Binoba Baat.
Acharya Binoba often used to say, unofficial, effective.
I am sure that after three years, psychologists, universities, researchers and media experts will definitely analyze this.
And I believe that this analysis will be very useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future, it will create a new consciousness and a new zeal.
And once I had said in Mann Ki Baat, we should think at the time of our meals that we will take as much as we need, we will not waste it.
But then I have seen that there have been so many letters from every corner of the country, so many social organizations, so many youngsters have been doing this thing for a long time.
And then I have seen that how many people have come forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I see Selfie With Daughter of a Panchayat Chief in Haryana and I keep it in front of everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only from India but from all over the world, a big campaign of Selfie With Daughter has started.
A few days ago, I had met the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
Send photographs wherever you go to Incredible India.
Millions of photographs from every corner of India have become a huge resource for those who work in the same tourism sector.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have felt how small events have created a massive movement.
Today, I feel like, because when I think that three years have passed, how many things have been happening in my mind for the last three years
The country is moving ahead every moment to reach the right path.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the betterment of the other, for the betterment of the society and for the betterment of the country.
During my three years journey of Mann Ki Baat, I have learnt it from my countrymen, I have learnt it.
This is a huge resource for any country.
And I have seen that there has been a lot of attraction towards Khadi recently and I have naturally said that no one will have to go to Khadi.
But there are many kinds of fabrics, why not Khadi
It looks like a younger generation has been attracted to Khadi.
The sale of Khadi has increased and a direct connection has been created with the employment of the poor.
On 2nd October, Khadi was released, a lot of discount is available.
Once again I would like to say that we should take forward the drive for Khadi.
We are working with this feeling that we will burn Deepawali in the houses of the poor by buying Khadi.
The poor of our country will get a boost from this work and we should do it.
And it has encouraged the Khadi workers and the people associated with the government of India to think in a new way to enhance their interest in this Khadi.
How to bring new technologies, how to enhance productivity, how to bring solar energy and handicrafts
How to revive the old heritage that had been closed for nearly 20, 25, 30 years
A Khadi Ashram at Sevapur, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh has been closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Several methods have been added.
Many people have got new opportunities for employment.
The Khadi and Village Entrepreneurship Training Centre (KVET) which is closed in Pampore, Kashmir has a lot to offer.
And I am glad that the big Corporate Houses of Deepawali have started giving the gifts to the new generations for modernization of this training centre.
People are also giving a gift to each other.
We all are feeling the way things can be moved easily.
My dear countrymen, we had made a solemn pledge in Mann Ki Baat last month and we had decided that we will celebrate the 15th day of Gandhi Jayanti throughout the country.
We will connect people with cleanliness.
Our respected President has started this work and has joined the country.
Today, the elderly, the men and women, the city-village have become a part of the cleanliness drive.
When I talk about achieving this resolution, we can see how our Swachhta Abhiyan is moving forward in the direction of achieving this resolution.
I'm sure some people are supposed to be involved.
This time we have seen one more thing - first of all, we will clear one place, secondly, it may be that we will not deny any place consciously but if cleanliness is to be a habit then we need a revolutionary change in the judiciary.
This time, several competitions were organized in the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign.
More than 2. 5 crore children participated in the Creation Competition on Sanitation.
Thousands of children have painted.
They have painted their own imagination of cleanliness.
Whenever there is talk of cleanliness, I never forget to express my gratitude to the people of the media.
We are witnessing the movement of Swachhata Hi Seva as to how much of our country's electronic media and print media can serve the country.
A few days ago, I was very much concerned about the 18 year old young Bilal Dar from Srinagar.
For the last 5-6 years, Bilal has been working on cleanliness since the age of 12-13 years.
Plastic, polythene, utilized bottles, waste waste waste waste waste cleaned in the largest lake in Asia near Srinagar.
I am glad that the Purnigam Bilal was not only made a brand ambassador, he had given his car to Bilal, he had given a uniform, he was also educating the people of other areas about cleanliness, inspiring them and not giving up the desired results.
Bilal Dar is a young but inspiring person who has an interest in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must admit that the history of the future is born in the womb of history and when we talk about history, it is natural to remember the great men.
The month of October is the month to remember many of our great men.
Sardar Patel from Mahatma Gandhi was born in October this year by many great personalities who had led us in the 19th century and 21st century, had shown us the path to walk and had suffered for the country.
When former President of India, Shri Abdul Kalamji spoke to the youth, he often talked about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
In his deep sense, he mentioned the scheme and himself went to the village to witness the work of Nanaji.
Remembering these great men, we recall them not to be of any benefit to them, so that they can find a way forward so that they can give the right direction to the future.
In the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely talk about Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
We say that unity in diversity is India's specialty.
We are proud of the diversity and we are proud of the diversity. Do we ever try to realise our diversity
I would like to tell all my countrymen in Hindustan, especially my young generation that we are in a state of consciousness.
Feel the separation of India, touch it, realize its pride.
This diversity of our country plays an important role in the development of your inner personality.
You go abroad, I don't mind, but sometimes you'll see your own house
The people of North India do not know what is there in South India
The people of western India do not know what is there in Eastern India
Our country is full of diversity.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, all of them had visited India, they had a new inspiration to see, understand the country and save the country.
These great men have seen this country in a big way.
They tried to understand and understand India in the beginning of their work.
You have tried to make India self-reliant.
Can we also not understand the norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms and dresses of different states and different communities of our country, to learn and understand the food habits as a student
There will be value addition in tourism only when we are not just a visitor but as a student, we will be able to understand, understand and absorb the characteristics of all those places.
I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of my own Hindustan.
It has also been experienced to spend night in more than four and a half districts.
Today, when I am taking this important responsibility of the country, I can immensely enjoy the experience of this journey.
That is why I have a lot of benefits to understand.
I would like to appeal to you all that the unity of diversity in India is not just a slogan, but also accomplish this resource of our energy.
If one kind of new food can be eaten every day throughout life, it will not be repeated.
This is the strength of our tourism.
I would like to say that on this vacation, you just went out of the house for a little change - it should not happen.
Your anxiety will be huge.
What can be a bigger teacher than you know
Normally, from October to March, the time is extensive for tourism.
If you meet the people there, send them pictures.
Write about the beauty of not only the wealth or architecture there but also about the life of the people there.
Please send all the remarkable papers on your journey to MyGov and send them to the Narendra Modi App.
I have seen one thing that if you are the seven best tourist destinations in your state to improve the tourism industry of India then every Indian should know about these seven things in his state.
If possible, we have to go to the seven places.
Can you give me any information on this
You see, if all these information is sent by the same state, then I will tell the government whether it is scrutiny or whether it is scrutiny or whether it is seven common matters have come from every state, it is a matter of publicity.
It means how to improve the tourist destination from the inspiration of the people.
Likewise, among the seven things that you have seen in the entire country, you would like to see someone or someone who needs to visit it, if you need to know about it then you must send the names of seven such places to MyGov, NarendraModiApp.
The Government of India will work with it.
The government will accept the decisions taken by you people to create films, create videos, create publicity literature, give a befitting reply.
Come, join me.
You can also be a major driver of the growth of tourism from October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, for being a human being, a lot of things touch my mind and shudder my mind.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
Because I'm a man like you.
A few days back, perhaps your vision has attracted our countrymen have seen a wonderful example of women power and patriotism.
Lt. Swati and Nidhi, the Indian Army, have two brave colonies, which are very extraordinary brave.
It is indeed an extraordinary reason that the husband of Swati and Nidhi was martyred to serve Mother India.
We can imagine how the world would be when it was this young age.
But the martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadekar's wife Swati Mahadek fought against this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He has worked hard for 11 months and has dedicated his life to realize the dream of his husband.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, her husband Mukesh Dubey served as a hero in the army and when she was martyred for the motherland, her wife Nidhi decided to mind and she also became a soldier.
It is very natural for every countryman to respect our women power, our heroes.
I congratulate these two sisters from the bottom of my heart.
They have given a new inspiration and a new consciousness to millions and millions of people.
Many congratulations to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, this time between the festival of Navratri and Deepawali is also a great opportunity for the youth of our country.
The World Cup of FIFA Under-17 is happening here.
I believe soccer can be heard in all directions.
Every generation will be attracted to football.
There will be no school-college field in India where our youngsters will not be able to play football.
Come, when the entire world is playing on the soil of India, we will also make this game a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
Mother Durga's time.
The entire environment is full of auspicious fragrance.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country. May our country scale new heights of success to fulfil the aspirations of the people of our country.
May the country have the power to tackle every challenge.
May the country progress at a rapid pace and in the 75th year of Indias independence in 2022, we have started our journey by creating a road map of five years to realise the resolve, unwavering hard work and determination of 125 crore Indians.
My best wishes to you all.
Celebrate Festivals and encouraging them.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2017
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
Our country is the land of Buddha and Gandhi, the land of Sardar Patel, who is dedicated to the unity of the country.
The universal values, non-violence and harmony that our ancestors have nurtured since ancient times are linked to our lives.
Ahimsa Param Dharma is what we have heard since childhood.
I had said from the Red Fort that violence will not be forbidden in the name of belief, it can be a communal belief, it can be a belief in political ideology or it can be a belief in any tradition.
No one has the right to enact laws in the name of faith.
Dr.
The Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us, the right to every individual has been ensured there.
I want to assure the countrymen that the government or the country will not compel anybody who goes on the path of violence, whoever goes on the path of violence.
Everyone has to be suppressed by the law, the law will judge him and the culprit will be punished.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Many of our festivals are directly related to the farmers and the fishermen brothers and sisters.
Today, I am talking about the festival, so first of all, I would like to tell you about the sweetness.
Yesterday, the festival of Sambastari was celebrated in the Jain community.
In Jain society, the festival of 'Purushan Parab' is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
The festival is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
And it is also known as the festival of forgiveness and on this day there is a tradition of conveying best wishes to each other.
Besides, our scriptures are the land of forgiveness and bravery.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated everywhere in India with great zeal and enthusiasm.
And when we talk about Ganesh Chaturthi then the issue of Universal Ganesh Utsav comes naturally.
This great festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasted for 10 days.
And we know this festival as a symbol of unity, equality and sanctity.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to the people of our country for the Ganesh Festival.
Now the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
Onam is one of the major festivals of Kerala in Indias plural festivals.
The festival is unique for its social and cultural importance.
The Omna Festival recalls the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
And now this festival has become a centre of attraction for tourism.
Besides, I would like to tell the countrymen that like the Navratri festival of Gujarat or the Durga Festival of West Bengal, today it has become the main attraction of tourism.
There is a lot of opportunity to attract foreigners in other festivals of our country.
We have to think about what steps we can take in the coming days.
Id-ul-uha will be part of this joyous festival.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festivals and cleanliness are part of our family life.
Preparations for the Festival begin with cleanliness.
It is not new, but it is important to make cleanliness socially transparent.
Universal cleanliness is not only in our homes but in every village, in every city, in our state, in our country and in our country, this cleanliness and festival has to be tied to a coincidence which will be unbroken.
My dear countrymen, the language of modernization is changing gradually.
Nowadays this new dimension has become a new parameter.
You will be able to see that today the children are building statues of Ganesh with soil in their homes.
The Swachhta Abhiyan that we launched three years ago, is the third anniversary of October 2nd.
At one such time, the officials of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanar in Banaskantha district of Gujarat took up 22 flood-affected temples and three mosques with cleanliness and cleanliness.
If this effort to ensure dedicated sanitation becomes a permanent part of our nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I would like to urge you that once again, on 2nd October, 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti, I would like to propagate 'Swachhata Hi Seva' and 'Swachhata Hi Seva'.
Create an environment conducive to cleanliness across the country.
And whenever we get the opportunity, we find and utilize it.
Strive hard.
Work together on holidays or Sundays.
Go to the neighbouring colonies, go to the nearby villages, transform it into a movement.
I urge all the NGOs, schools, colleges, social-cultural-political leaders, government officials, collectors and panchayat heads to create an atmosphere that will fulfil the dreams of Gandhiji on 2nd October, 15 days before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Mygov.
In-A, a department has been created where after the construction of toilets, you can enroll your name and the name of the family that you have helped in this thing.
My social media friends can play a creative campaign in the virtual world that can be really inspiring.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has been organizing a short film and painting competition under Swachh Sankalp Se Swachh Siddhi campaign.
You can write articles in different languages and there is no specific age limit for this competition.
Out of the participants, three at the district level and three at the state level will be selected and rewarded.
I urge you to participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
Definitely take some steps for cleanliness.
Millions and millions of people sometimes send letters, messages or telephones, send a message which is a supreme achievement and rare asset to me.
This is a great opportunity for me to know the thoughts and minds of the people of the country.
I look forward to your news more than the Mann Ki Baat programme you are waiting for.
I wait very enthusiastically because I can learn a lot from you.
I try to see, hear, read and learn as much as you can.
"Prime Minister, I am calling Arna from Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my friends.
He's always trying to help people, but he's got a mischief that I'm surprised to see.
I was lying with him for shopping once.
I saw he bought a two-thousand-rupee sari and spent Rs.450 for the pizza.
At the same time, he spent a long time with the auto driver for five rupees to go to Mal.
He did the same thing while buying vegetables on the way back and saved four or five survivors.
I felt terrible.
We spend a lot of money in big shops without any promise, but we dont believe in how much money we bow down to our laborer brothers and sisters.
My belief is that after listening to the contents of this phone, you have decided not to make such a mistake.
Don't you think that whenever someone comes to sell things around us, comes to ferry, we work with a small shopkeeper, a vegetable seller, sometimes we need an auto-recovery. Whenever we work with a gentleman, we pay less than Rs.
And when a person like us goes to a big restaurant to eat food, then don't look at what is written in the bill.
Not only this, I don't care if I buy sarees in the showroom, but if I work with a poor person, I don't give up.
There will be no difference in your life for two rupees, five rupees, but have you ever thought of how much this little behaviour hurts her mind
Madam, I'm grateful to you, you gave me a heart-to-heart call.
I believe that if my countrymen have the habit of behaving with the poor then they will definitely abandon it.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the entire country celebrates the National Sports Day.
This day marks the birth anniversary of Major Dhyan Chand ji, the great hockey player and the magician of the hockey.
His contribution to the hockey is incredible.
I am reminded of this thing because I want the new generations of our country to be associated with sports.
Let sports become part of our lives.
If we are the world's fastest country, we should also look at the playground.
Playing means physical fitness, mental alternates, personality enhancement.
Playing on the one hand is a wonderful heart-connecting event.
May the young generation of our country progress in the world of sports and today in the era of computers, I would like to make sure that the playground is more important than the playground and the playground.
Play in the computer but also show the football in the field outside.
Perhaps cricket players on the computer, but playing cricket under the sky on the open ground is a different joy.
Today, the situation is such that the children start watching the cartoon movies at one corner of the house or the mobile game gets complicated and the mother has to scream and say- when will you go out
Time changed, he was an era when Mother told the boy when you'd come and today it's been a situation to tell Mother, Dad, when will you go out
Friends, Ministry of Youth Affairs Sports has created a sports talent search portal for sports talent and its development where any child from all over the country, who has achieved some talent in sports, can upload his biodata or video on this portal.
Ministry of Sports will impart training to Selected Emerging Players and the Ministry will launch it tomorrow.
It is a matter of great happiness for our youngsters that the Andaman Seventeen World Cup is going to be held in India from 6th to 28th October.
Twenty-four teams of the world are going to make India their home.
Let us welcome our young guests from all over the world with the festival of sports, enjoy sports and create an appropriate environment in the country.
Today, when I am talking about sports, I remember that last week's interactions, I want to share it with my countrymen.
I got the opportunity to meet some young girls and some of them were born in the lap of the Himalayas who never had any connection with the sea.
Six daughters of our country who work in the Navy, their emotions and enthusiasm will inspire us all.
These six daughters, with a small boat - IN-S Tarini, will be able to cross the sea.
This campaign has been named Navika Sagar Parikrama and they will reach India after several months after travelling all over the world.
Sometimes forty days in the water.
Sometimes he will spend thirty days in water together.
This is our brave six daughters in the midst of the waves of the sea, and this is the first thing in the world.
There is no Indian who will not be proud of these daughters
I salute the feelings of these girls, and I have told them to share their thoughts with the entire country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for them to think about the Narendra Modi App so that you can read them.
Because, in a way, it will be a miracle of courage, a feeling of self-confidence, and I will be glad to bring these girls back to you.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters and blessings to them.
My dear countrymen, we all celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
The birthday of Dr. Radhakrishnan ji, the former President of India.
He was the President but for the rest of his life he had made himself a teacher.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was a devoted life to education.
The glorious qualities of a teacher are the joys of creation and enlightenment amongst his students.
Can we start a campaign in a mission mode
In our country, when there is talk of transformation, just as the mother of the family comes to mind, similarly the role of teachers in the society will be remembered.
Teachers have a huge role in transformation.
Every teacher has a transformational artist in his life and we are doing our best to make efforts.
It will play a major role in the country's transformation.
Let us move ahead with the mantra of Teach to Transform.
My name is Dr. Anna Awasthi.
I am a resident of Mumbai and affiliated with the India Research Centre of Howard University.
The scheme was launched on 28th August, 2014 with a dream.
Tomorrow, on 28th August, three years of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed.
30 crore Indians have joined this scheme and opened their first bank accounts.
The number of new Accountants is more than the population of many countries in the world.
If there's money in the house or pocket, it's costlier.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the poor people of our country have deposited about Rs. 65 thousand crore.
Again, those who have opened the accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also got the benefit of insurance.
Under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, a premium of just one and three rupees has created a new confidence in the lives of the poor.
When these poor people are in trouble in several families, the head of the family has died, the result of a premium is getting two lakh rupees.
I have been told about the benefits of Jan Dhan Yojana, Rupay Card, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and insurance for the common man.
My dear countrymen, I wish you all the very best.
What's your mind, July 2017
The hearts of the people are such that the rainy season is very pleasant for the people.
Animals, birds, sheep, nature - everyone is happy with the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when rain takes a terrible form, it shows how much water destruction power is.
Nature is our life-threatening, our nurturer, but sometimes floods, earthquake-like natural jungles, their terrible forms of destruction.
The changes in the weather cycle and the environment have a negative impact.
During the last few days, India has to face natural calamities especially in parts of Assam, North East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal due to heavy rains.
Flood devastating areas are being monitored.
Extensive rescue operations are underway.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are on their way.
The state government is also making all efforts to help the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations, citizens wishing to do service are making all efforts to reach out to the people in this situation.
It affects agriculture, animals, infrastructure, infrastructure, electricity and connectivity.
We have recently formulated a scheme to ensure that our farmer brothers have a positive role to play in the insurance companies, especially the agricultural insurance companies, so that the farmers can get the benefits of climate change.
People are talking about their old age.
Before the rainy season, most of the mock drills were constructed in the entire government programme.
NDRF's Team was appointed.
Gradually, we have created such a thing that according to the forecast of the monsoon, we will do our job in such a way that we can get rid of the losses.
Whenever I am ready for Mann Ki Baat, I see the citizens of my country who are more than me.
This time there are so many letters about GST, so many phone calls, and people are still cheerful about GST, asking questions.
I would like to tell you that Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am talking to Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I am extremely impressed by your speech on Chartered Accountants Day.
This is the reason in our country that today's Goods and Service Tax-GST has started.
I'd like to hear your opinion on this.
Thank you.
It has been almost a month since the launch of GST and it has seen remarkable results.
And I am glad that whenever a poor person writes a letter, how the prices of the poorest of the poor have come down for GST, how things have become cheaper.
Anyone living in the north-eastern region, far-flung areas and jungles has been writing in a letter that earlier I was afraid of what would happen, but now when I have learnt and understood this thing then I feel that the work has become very easy from the past.
Business has become very simple.
And most importantly, the confidence of the consumers is increasing.
Now I can see the impact of GST on the Transport and Logistics Sector.
How the trucks have grown.
As a result, a strong smooth transition is being carried out, in which migration is being done, a new registration is being done and this has created a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes, economists, eminent personalities of management, scholars of technologies and researchers will certainly present the use of GST in India as a model for the world.
It will become a Case Study for various universities across the world.
This is because such a big change in the scale and participation of millions and millions of people, its use and success in such a vast country, it is indeed a success story.
The world must do research on this.
GST has been used, every state has participated in it, every state has its responsibility.
All decisions have been taken by the States and the Centre in unanimous agreement.
And as a result, the primary goal of every government is that there should not be any pressure on the poor for GST.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries, all the departments, central and state governments associated with this work.
GST is an excellent example of Indias overall strength.
This is a historical experience.
This is also a campaign for social reforms.
I once again bow down to millions and millions of people of our country for making such a big effort.
My dear countrymen, the months of the month of August.
Yusuf Mehr Ali.
What happened to our new generation on August 9, 1942
From 1857 to 1942, how did the Indian diaspora united themselves with the aspirations of independence, how much they had tolerated, how much they had to tolerated, how much they had to bear, how much they had to bear, how much they had to describe it in the pages of history as an inspiration for the creation of a developed India.
This was the time when in every corner of Hindustan, everywhere in the city, everywhere in the villages, all the educated, educated and the poor fellow citizens shoulder-to-shoulder to shoulder the uit India Movement.
At the instance of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians dedicated their lives to fight in the Karengaye Ya Marenge Mantra.
After Mahatma Gandhi had called for the uit India Movement on 9th August, when all the British leaders were jailed, they came forward to take the movement forward.
Lohia, Jayaprakash Narayan is the second generation leader.
Two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi were seen in the 1920 Non-Cooperation Movement and the uit India Movement of 1942.
There was a similar face in the Non-Cooperation Movement, then in 42, the intensity of the movement increased so much that even great men like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karenge Yamarenge'.
Behind these achievements were public participation, peoples participation, peoples participation and peoples participation.
The whole country fought together on that day.
I sometimes imagine that India's first freedom struggle was in 1857, when we collected the leaves of history.
The war, which began in 1857, took place at some point in every corner of the country till 1942, and in this long time it gave rise to an intense demand for freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Every person is committed to doing something or the other.
Generations have changed but the intensity of their resolve has not diminished.
A group of people have come, they have joined the struggle, they have moved away, they have joined the struggle in the same way. And they have tried every moment for the country to uplift the British Empire.
From 1857 to 1942, the movement was brought to an extreme extent in 1942, and the toxic toxin of uit India was ruined in such a way that the British migrated to 1947 in five years.
Between 1857 and 1942, freedom came to every countrymen and the five years from 1942 to 1947, the five decisive years of the resolve were the reason for the country's independence.
These five years were the key determinants.
Now I want to connect you with this process.
We were free in 1947 and in 2017.
It's been 70 years.
The government's here.
The rules and regulations have been framed, changed and revised.
Everyone has tried their best to get rid of the countrys problems.
Efforts are being made to increase the income of the common man in the country, to eradicate poverty and to develop it.
Expectations have increased.
We will celebrate the 15th of August, 2017 as the beginning of the resolution and we will be able to fulfil the resolution of 75 years of independence in 2022.
From 1942 to 1947, when the country was at the forefront of independence, the five years from 2017 to 2022 could be the decisive year for Indias future.
After five years, we will celebrate 75 years of independence.
A solemn pledge that we will achieve in the next five years.
Come, use technology to come forward with new ideas like video-posts, blogs, registrations, new ideas.
This movement has to be transformed into a mass movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will also host the uit India uiz competition for young friends at the app.
The uiz competition is an attempt to make the youth of the country familiar with the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am glad that in the last three years, I have received several proposals from every corner of the country to discuss what should be said on 15th August, the main objective of these proposals is to make their dreams a reality.
On 15th August, I will try to discuss these proposals as long as I can.
I'll finish in 40-45 or 50 minutes if it's too much.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk about another topic.
Socio-economics is closely linked to the economy of India.
It's not supposed to be empty.
Our festivals and festivals are not just for joy and joy.
Our festivals, festivals, social reforms, together with our festivals, are directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor in the country.
After a few days, there will be festivals like Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, Chauth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Deepavali etc. and there will be some opportunities for the poor people to earn money.
This festival enjoys a simple joy.
A few months before the Raksha Bandhan Festival, hundreds of families have become small households in business.
Several types of treasures like suti, silk, etc. are used in different ways, and nowadays people prefer to keep homemade.
Hundreds and thousands of businessmen are associated with a festival like this.
Deepawali is directly related to all the poor families of the country.
Today, when I talk about festivals, festivals and the economy of the poor people associated with it, I also want to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I think that the people of India are more conscious and active than I am.
For the past one month, aware citizens have written to me about the situation.
They have appealed to me that whenever I talk about eco-friendly Ganesh on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, people like earth-made Ganesh and plan.
Lokmanya Tilak was the 125th year of Ganesh Utsav this year.
125th year and 125 crore Indians.
Lokmanya Tilak Ganesh Festival was organised keeping in mind the spirit of social unity, awakened society and social reform.
Come, let us also recall him and organise composition competitions, seminars etc. during the Ganesh festival this year.
Come, let us integrate this festival with the financial system of the poor, let us enjoy our festivals as a financial festival of the poor, let us enjoy our economic joy.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels to new heights in education, financial sector, social sector or sports.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters, we are honoured for them.
Just a few days ago, our fishermen showed extraordinary talent in the field of women cricket.
This week, I had the opportunity to meet these playing girls.
They had the impression.
I told them that I had a different assessment.
I have seen that if the players of India are failing then the anger of the countrymen falls among the players.
Some people say something that breaks the generosity, say something that is very painful.
Not all this, girls praised her and gave her respect.
I have seen a beautiful change in this thing, and I have told these girls that you have got the good fortune that you have not succeeded in removing this thing from your mind.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to enhance the name of the country.
My dear countrymen, once again I would like to remind you of the August movement and once again I would like to recall it on 9th August.
May every countrymen promise, let every countrymen guide them for five years to fulfill their resolutions.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let us move ahead with this belief that the fate of the country and the future of the country will be enhanced.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
Weather is changing.
It was so hot this time.
But fortunately, the rainy season is following its footprints.
Rainfall has started in some parts of the country.
After the rains, the cold winds are getting a little comfortable with the heat of the past.
All of us have seen that whatever excitement or anxiety may be there in individual life or in public life, the rainy season changes our mindset.
Today, the chariot of Lord Jagannath Dev is being celebrated in different parts of the country with great enthusiasm and joy.
Nowadays, the chariot festival of Lord Jagannath is celebrated in some other places of the world.
The poor people of the country are specially associated with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
Very few people know that there is a word Juggernaut in English which means a beautiful chariot which cannot be stopped.
It is obvious that this word has come from Jagannath Devrath.
This shows how the world has acknowledged the importance of Jagannath Dev's journey.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
Come, let us collectively take inspiration from this festival and distribute happiness stores and take the country forward.
In this month of Ramzan, I came to know about a very inspirational incident in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In this small village, he lived in thousands of Muslim brothers and sisters and most of the residents of this region are Muslim families.
In the month of Ramzan, everyone in the village decided to build a toilet.
17 lakh has been disbursed to the private toilets assisted by the Government.
You will be happy to hear that even in this holy month of Ramzan, the Muslim brothers and sisters have returned the government's 17 lakh rupees. They said that our toilets will be built in our labour, in our money.
17 lakhs for other services.
On this auspicious occasion of Ramzan, I express my gratitude to all the villagers of Mubarakpur.
Everything of them is very inspirational.
The most important thing is that they have made Barakpur Open Defecation Free.
We know that three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala - have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration and the people of this state for completing this task.
We are well aware of the fact that we have to work hard either in personal life or in social life.
If my handwriting is bad, I have to make a long time conscious effort to fix it.
This is how physical and psychological changes occur.
Cleanliness is the same.
Some bad habits have become our nature.
Everybody has to focus.
Inspiring events will be remembered again and again.
I am glad that cleanliness is no longer a government programme.
It is taking the form of a mass movement in the society.
When the people associated with the administration take this work forward with the participation of the people, it naturally increases the strength.
I am reminded of a good thing that I want to tell you.
This happened in Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
Their aim was to build 71 Village Panchayats and 10,000 Family Toilets in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the local administration has completed the work of constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71,000 villages have become Open Defecation Free.
In-A, all these suggestions are received in the All India Radio.
It is important to be conscious of democracy and that is why it is necessary to remind the people of democracy of the events that have struck democracy and promote good events for democracy.
25th June, 1997 is such a dark day that no Indian can forget about democracy.
The entire country was transformed into a prison.
The voices of the opponents were sealed.
Jayaprakash Narayan and other dignitaries were imprisoned.
The judicial system didn't get rid of the terrible situation.
The newspaper was completely unnecessary.
Students from today's journalism, even those who work for democracy, recall the dark day and are consistently striving to increase awareness about democracy and this effort should continue.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also jailed.
During the year of emergency, Atal ji wrote a poem, describing his mental state of time in that poem.
We have to strengthen this heritage.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud of the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world grew into Yoga.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the rays of the sun through Yoga morning and evening.
Is there an Indian who will not be proud of
It was not like this that Yoga had not been practiced earlier, but today when Yoga has been tied to the cult of Yoga then Yoga has become the reason for the world to be united.
Almost all the countries of the world have adopted this vision of Yoga.
On the one hand, the Great Wall of China has been popularised in China, while on the other hand, the World Heritage Site of Peru is located at a height of 2,400 metres above the sea level.
The Eiffel Tower in France is shadowed by people.
More than four thousand people have joined hands in the UAE Abu Dhabi.
In the Herats of Afghanistan, India-Afghan Friendship Dam has given India a new dimension of friendship by associating with it.
In a small country like Singapore, seventy-seven programmes have been organized and they have run a campaign throughout the week.
The United Nations has released 10 postage stamps on International Day of Yoga.
Yoga has been conducted in the United Nations Headquarters under the leadership of Yoga specialists.
United Nations employees, worldwide diplomats participated in this.
Once again, Yoga has created a world record.
Nearly 50,000 people have joined hands in building a new world record in Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
I have also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But I am fortunate to join the rain for the first time.
Our soldiers have also practiced Yoga in Siachen where they are at 20, 25, 40 degree Celsius.
Our Armed Forces, be it BSF, ITBP, C-R-P-F-Hock, CI-SF, all have joined hands with their duties.
On the occasion of Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, since it was the third International Yoga Day, I had said that the three generations of the family should join together and share their photographs.
Some TV channels have taken this forward.
I have received a lot of photographs in this regard, some of which have been collected by the Narendra Modi App.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit one of my favorite institutions.
In a few days, a good programme is being organized in Kerala, the PENPANICKAR Foundation has created a habit of reading among the people, it is encouraging people to read books, hence reading day, reading manth.
I had the opportunity to go to the auspicious time, and I was told that we didn't raise flowers, we gave them books.
I'm nice.
And now I remember the fact that I was out of my concentration.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a system in the government that we will not raise it, we will leave it or we will welcome it with a handkerchief.
He will be a man of Khadi so that he will grow in Khadi.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this was the habit of everyone, but after coming here, my habit went away.
But he went back to Kerala and woke up again.
And I've started giving a notice to the government again.
We can gradually create a habit.
The flowering age is very low.
Once you have to take it off your hand.
But if I give the book, it becomes a part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
I went to London, the ueen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth invited me to dinner.
For many years, ueen Elizabeth took care of Mahatma Gandhi's handkerchief.
And I was very happy to visit him.
I didn't know if he wanted me to touch once.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
I believe that these habits don't change overnight and sometimes they have to be critical.
But, despite this, such a thing should be highlighted, efforts should be made.
Now I can't say that I've gone somewhere and someone's gone with flowers, then I'll tell him I can't do it.
But anyway, there will be discussions, but the conversation should continue, it will change slowly.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is being done in the direction of becoming the Prime Minister.
I have to immerse myself in the file, but I have made a habit of reading some of the letters I received and thus I get an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different kinds of people write letters.
I remember reading a letter like this.
A housewife, Arulmozhi, from the far south of Tamil Nadu, has written a letter.
What you are saying in that letter I thought of doing something to tackle my world, to handle the education of the children so that there is some financial gains in the culture.
In the same way, I started lending some loans from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and buying some goods from the market.
In this regard, the government has started a system called Governance e-Marketplace.
So I'm registering myself in the system.
Anyone who wants to supply the goods, electric bulls, dustbins, brooms, chairs, tables, whatever you want to sell, you can register it.
He wrote, First of all, I got Mudra Yojana and started my business and after that I registered all my selling goods at E-GEM, then I received orders from PMO, in the office of the Prime Minister.
It was an unknown news to me, asking me what did the PMO want to buy
He said he bought the lunch thermos and got 1600 pamants.
Yeah, that's Empowerment.
It has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship as well.
GovernmentE-Marketplace-GEM.
I would like that the number of people who want to sell something to the government should continue to grow.
I understand that this is an unparalleled example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and its goal is MinimumPrice and Maximumese, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we can take pride in Yoga and on the other we can also take pride in the success of Space Science.
This is India's specialty, Yoga is connected to the soil of our country and our country is also in far flung space missions.
Earlier, India had achieved many successes in sports and science.
Today, India is not only on the planet but also on the planet.
ISRO has also launched 30 nanosatellites along with Cartosat-24 satellites two days ago.
Besides India, nearly 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America have joined these satellites.
And these nano satellites in India will also provide immense useful information in the field of agriculture and forecasting of natural medicines for the benefit of farmers.
A few days ago, we all remember that ISRO has successfully launched GSAT-19.
Just imagine, how great our scientists have established in space research.
On 19th June, the Mars Mission completed 1000 days.
You all are reminded that for this Mars mission, we had successfully established it in orbit and its tenure was fixed for six months.
Its work was six months.
But what an extraordinary skill of our scientists is that even after six months it has been a thousand days.
Our thousand days of scientific journey is guiding our best in space research.
Our younger generations are encouraging their skills and their physical capabilities in sports as well as sports.
This is the day when India's badminton player Kidambi Championship in Indonesia and Spain has enhanced the honour of the country.
I congratulate Shrikanth and his coach for this retirement.
T.
Sports personality plays an important role in development.
Sports contributes significantly to the development of the overall personality.
There is no dearth of entry in the country.
If the family's boys and girls are leaning towards sports, they should be encouraged.
Once again, our countrymen, rainy days and festivals are celebrated in a way.
What's your mind, May 2017
Today, when I talk to you people, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
In the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the people of the world, especially the Muslim community.
During Ramzan, special emphasis was laid on prayers, spirituality and compassion.
We are fortunate to be Hindustani. Our forefathers have created such a tradition that the people of India can take pride in it.
We can take pride in the fact that India is home to all communities of the world.
This is a country that believes in God or atheist who worships idols or those who worship idols, all kinds of thoughts, all kinds of worshipping methods, all kinds of traditions and people have acquired the strategies of living together.
And be it religion, community, thought or tradition, it gives us only one message - peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan will help in furthering this trend of peace, unity and goodwill.
I once again wish you all the very best.
Last time when I had made Mann Ki Baat, I had used a word, especially the youngsters told me to do something new, to come out of the comfort zone with a new experience.
And this is the age of survival... to be a little risky, tough.
I'm glad that many people gave me feedback.
Personally, they encouraged me to talk to me.
There are so many messages that I can't fall, I can't even hear the messages sent by everyone.
But I have seen that somebody is trying to learn songs, somebody is doing a muck in a new musical instrument, somebody is trying to learn new things by using YouTube, someone is trying to learn new languages, someone is learning cooking, someone is learning dance, someone is learning drama, someone has started writing poetry.
My studies were almost shut down.
That's why I tried to fall on this vacation.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized that how many struggles were made for India's freedom, how many lives were there, how many freedom fighters had spent years in jail.
I have been inspired by the life of Bhagwat Singh, who had done a lot in a very young age.
That is why I request you to say something about this in today's era.
I am glad that today's youngsters are expressing their desire to know about our history, our freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for our country.
I went to Andaman and Nicobar many years ago.
I went to see Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar sat in jail and wrote the book Manji Janmath.
Writing poems on the prison wall.
He was locked up in a small room.
How much hard it was for freedom.
When I read Savarkar ji's book Manji Janmath, I get inspiration from seeing the Cellular Jail.
There's a light and sound show that's very inspiring.
There is no such state in Hindustan, there are no language speaking people who did not suffer from drinking water for freedom, who did not die in this cellular jail.
You must visit the pilgrimage centre of our freedom struggle whenever you get the opportunity.
My dear countrymen, the first Monday of 5th June.
This year, the theme of the United Nations is Connecting People toNature.
In other words ' back to basics ' .
And who has said something better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi has said many times - One must take a world one will not see. It is our duty to think and take care of the world we have not seen.
After getting tired, opening the door and breathing fresh air brings a new life.
When we are connected with the Panchbhav, the Panchbhav, the Panchbhav, then you are the source of a new life and a new emergence.
We all saw it, but we didn't think about it, we couldn't tie it in a rope.
After that, you must see that whenever you are associated with various natural conditions, a new consciousness will emerge within you.
And that is why in order to connect with nature on 5th June, we should launch our own campaigns all over the world.
Our ancestors are getting some results of what they have done to protect the environment.
If we protect the environment, our next generation will get its results.
In Vedas, the world and the environment are considered to be the source of energy.
We are told here - Motherland: Son of the Earth:
The Vedas say that the sanctity that we have in our world is for our world.
Earth is our mother and we are her children.
If we remember Lord Buddha then one thing comes out that the birth of Lord Buddha, his wisdom and his Mahaparinirvana were in three trees.
But we need to connect him with modern words and with modern debates.
I have received news from different states during this period.
With the onset of monsoon, a big campaign to plant trees has started in almost all the states.
Millions of trees are planted.
The whole world celebrates this day as World Yoga Day.
In a short span of time, on 21st June, this World Yoga Day has expanded everywhere and is involving people.
On the one hand, many powers that discriminate in the world are showing its distorted form and at this time World Yoga Day is a major contributor to India.
Through Yoga, we have bound the entire world together.
Just as Yoga binds the body, mind, intellect and soul together, today Yoga has binded the world together.
Yoga has a major role to play in leading a stress free life in this situation.
Yoga is not just an exercise , it is a result of health , body , mind , judgement and it is possible to feel this mixture only through yoga exercise .
Two days ago, I had written to all the governments and leaders of the world about Yoga Day.
Last year I had announced some Yoga related competitions and announced some awards.
A funny proposition.
He said, This is the third International Day of Yoga, I would like to urge all the three generations to practice Yoga on this 3rd International Day of Yoga.
Whether it is grandparents or grandparents or grandparents , parents , boys and girls should practice yoga together for three generations and upload their pictures .
Yesterday, today and tomorrow, a lucky combination of Yoga will show a new direction.
I thank you for this proposal. And I believe that the way we have driven Selfie with Daughter, and created a joyous experience, the pictures of these three generations of Yoga will create a vibrant nation and the world.
You must have sent me a photo by the people of the three generations at the MyGov through the Narendra Modi App, where people of the three generations are practicing Yoga.
Tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow, it'll be a beautiful guarantee.
I invite you all.
There are about three weeks left for International Yoga Day.
Let's get used to it today.
You should also spread the message of Yoga for three weeks and involve people.
It's a kind of Preventive Health Care movement.
I invite all of you to participate in it.
Since the day you have given me the responsibility of working as the Chief Servant, and from the Red Fort, I had got the opportunity to speak on the 15th of August.
I have been visiting different parts of India since that day.
Nowadays, wherever you are going, people of Modi ji, TV and social media are paying special attention to cleanliness.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have adopted Swachhata as a mission in your call.
Even the elderly have become aware of cleanliness.
Sometimes the younger ones saw them snatching away.
The cleanliness that you have started from the bottom of Kashi has taken the face of a movement through your inspiration.
You are right, wherever I go, there is a government sanitation work, but nowadays there is a festival of cleanliness in the society.
But when this phone call came, I thought and saw that yes, that's right.
The rest will be ready to welcome the Prime Minister, but the first is Swachhata.
It will automatically enjoy anyone who loves cleanliness.
I would like to thank everyone for emphasizing this cleanliness.
Someone gave me a proposal.
Anyway, it's a funny proposal.
I don't know if I can do it.
Modi ji , when you go to any invitation , tell me , what level of cleanliness will be if you invite me , how many tons of waste will you give me gifts , on the basis of which I will decide to go .
Dea is very good, but I have to think.
Again, there must be a movement, and a few tons of waste instead of other things.
How many people we're gonna save from illness
How big humanity will be.
Once we consider it as a wealth, we will have a new way of Waste Management.
The youngsters associated with start-ups will come forward with new plans and new instruments.
It is expected that these four thousand cities will be covered with dry waste blue dustbin-A and wet waste-waste green dustbin.
Waste of kitchen, such as vegetable peas, parched, egg-open, tree-food leaves, all these wet waste-green dustbin.
If all these things are used in agriculture, if the color of food is green then remember what to do with the green dustbin.
And the remaining waste materials such as unnecessary papers, iron, cardboards, glass, clothing, plastic, polythene, rubber and other metallic items such as dry waste, which are required to be recycled by the machine, are not usually used, these are blue dustbin.
I believe that if we can develop a habit like this then we will have to take new steps for cleanliness then we will be able to fulfil the dreams of Gandhiji for cleanliness.
Today, I would like to mention with pride that if a person does not mind then how big a movement can be created.
Cleanliness is such a thing.
During the last few days, you must have heard a news that the stinking Barsoba Beach of Mumbai has become a clean and clean Barsoba Beach.
It wasn't a sudden, a citizen worked for 80-90 weeks to change the image of Barsoba Beach, making Barsoba beach clean, beautiful by removing thousands of tons of waste.
And this is the responsibility of Versova Residence Volunteer.
An individual, Shriman Afroz Shah, gradually joined the work with utmost vigour since October 2015 and became a peoples movement.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) awarded Afroz Shah for this work.
He was the first Indian to be conferred the Championsof the Earth Award.
I knew that the local women were leading the most.
They took torchs to create awareness among the masses, in every street, in every household, they inspired everyone to do this.
I extend my warm greetings to all these mothers and sisters.
I also compliment the administrators of Jammu and Kashmir for the beautiful launch of the Block Open Defecation Free.
My dear countrymen, the work of the present government has been continuously being discussed in the newspapers, TV channels and social media for the past 15 days.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of being the Chief Servant.
People from all walks of life have analyzed it.
This is a good tradition for democracy.
I would like to thank all those who have given positive and important feedback, for taking care of misconceptions, shortcomings etc.
This criticism is very important for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, because of this a small citizen like me and you, the kind of impact that affects the minds of a common citizen on good and bad is the same in my mind.
There are hundreds of families who have written this to me.
As a simple man, as a simple citizen, it has made a big impact on my mind, it has encouraged me.
I'm grateful to Akbar.
Come, let us all move ahead in this environment with love and affection.
I convey my best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
And the curiosity of the children, the aspirations of the younger generation, and the aspirations of the elders, all these things come to our fore.
Every time the inputs for Mann Ki Baat have been analyzed by the government.
What are the suggestions, what are the complaints, what are the feelings of people
On the root, people's nature is advisable.
On the train, if someone wants to go to the bus, then do the same with the others.
But when I tried to look at them, I was overwhelmed.
In most cases, people have sent suggestions, they have tried to reach me, who really have done something in their own life.
They have tried to do some good work in accordance with their own intellect, strength, capability and opportunities.
And when I knew it, I thought these suggestions weren't simple.
It's all from the foolish feelings of the people.
Some people think that if these things are happening when they are working, they will be able to make a big difference if they listen to these things then it will be beneficial for many people.
Not only this, whenever I mention anything, I feel like these things and I am very happy.
I have never imagined that our country, especially the younger generation, has been working in this direction for a long time.
I knew that some social organisations have been working in this regard for a few years, but I can imagine that the youth of my country is working on this thing after a long time.
Some people sent me a video.
There are many places where bread is being run.
People collect bread from the bread bank, collect bread from the bank, collect the bread from the bank, and collect the bread from the people who are not eligible for themselves.
Those who are giving, they like it, and those who are doing it, they don't even think that they are small.
This is an example of how society works through cooperation.
This is the last day of April.
On 1st May, he was recognised as the State of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have worked towards achieving new goals of development and have worked for the betterment of the country.
And in both the states, the coming together of the great men and their livelihood in every sector of the society continues to inspire us.
On the occasion of the opening day of the two states, we should make a solemn pledge that our own states, our own countries, our societies, our cities, our families should reach to a height after 75 years of independence in 2022.
It should be planned to make this resolve a reality, and all citizens should enhance their efficiency.
The time has come to feel the heat in our country in March-April.
When I was taking advice from people in Mann Kibat, I had suggested what should be done in this summer and people had given it.
All these things are in vogue, nothing new, but it is useful to recall it at a particular time.
And I have seen that the family members are doing this work very well.
Once they know why they should fill this water, then ten times a day they can see if there is water in the vessel or not.
And the birds are coming or seeing.
I believe that a game is going on, but it is a wonderful way to instill compassion in real boys.
In our country, we should spend our lives in harmony with the nature of animals and birds, colour them, yet we should focus on conservation.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a hundred years of Dharmaguru Abhinana Saheb of the Dawoodi Bohra Samaj was completed.
He was alive for 103 years.
And to celebrate his 100 years, the Bohra community has launched a massive campaign to save the slaves through the Burhanifoundation.
I had the opportunity to be a part of this expedition.
Approximately thirteen thousand bird feeders spread them across the corner of the world.
This campaign has taken place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes I have become so busy that I have forgotten to give some water to the news papers, milkmen, vegetables, postmen who come to my house in the summer.
Young friends, I also want to talk to you.
Sometimes I feel that some of our younger generations are enjoying living from the comfort zone.
Their parents have also grown up in one group.
Some people go through extreme adversity, but most people live this life of comfortzone.
Now the test is over, a lot of plans have been made to make fun of the holiday.
It's fun to get hot in the summer.
But I would like to talk about how your vacation will be done as a friend.
I'm sure some people will listen to me and tell me.
Sometimes there is a difference between watching things on TV or reading books or listening to familiar people and feeling themselves.
Be the test-examination positive, just a little out of the comfortzone.
We are a middle class family, a happy family.
Friends, Have you ever thought that without reservation, we should take a ticket and sit in the second classroom of the train and travel 24 hours
Sometimes feel it, I don't mean to repeat it, but do it once or twice.
In the morning, he used to go to a poor village with his football, volleyball or other sports equipment.
Play with those poor boys yourself, you will see that you have never enjoyed this joy in life before.
When the children living like this will get the opportunity to interact with you, do you imagine how big changes will be brought about in the lives of those children
This experience will tell you a lot.
Several voluntary organizations are doing this service.
Sometimes a number of summer camps were organised to promote personality development and to participate in it.
If you are taking part in the Summer Camp, performing personality development, you should go freely to all those people of the society who have been deprived of these sub-categories and teach them what you have learnt.
You can learn how to do these things.
Our concern is that technology has come to reduce the distance, but the result is that there are six people in the same house, but the difference between them has increased so much that is imaginative.
Everyone is busy with new technology.
Living together is also a reform, that is strength.
Secondly, I'd like to say that you don't want to do anything new.
I try and lose myself for the best possible results, I am filled up in a coaching class in Vacation, I feel anxiety about supervision.
Sometimes we get scared, our younger generation isn't getting robots.
A little emphasis can be laid on improving skills.
Far from technology, it can be tried to simultaneously interact with oneself - Tamil, Telugu, Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi languages have learnt five to fifty stories - if we look at them in our country then somebody will find friends around us.
If you don't swim, learn to swim, draw pictures, maybe not a good picture, but you can try to draw something on the paper.
Do you ever want to learn how to drive a auto-rickshaw
You see, these are the new experiments, their skills will give you joy and you will be able to get rid of the horrific rhythm that has bound your life.
Get out of the past, do something, guys.
It's a chance to make life.
You're probably wondering if all the exams are over, we'll learn when we're in a new career, but there's no chance.
Again, you're gonna get involved in some other problem, so I'll tell you, if you're gonna learn your magic, then at least learn the magic of Tas.
Keep showing your friends magic.
Try to know something you don't know, you're gonna be beneficial.
The human qualities within you will be awakened, so many steps will be made to improve.
I say with my own experience, we cannot imagine how much we can learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new cities, new villages, new areas.
But before leaving, wherever we go, there is a traditional system, there is a sense of curiosity, there is a lot of consciousness, there is a lot of consciousness, there is a lot of consciousness among the people, there is a lot of enjoyment in seeing this new place.
Stay in the same place for four days.
Go to another place and stay for three to four days.
You can learn a lot from this.
Where did you go
You can share your experiences using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the government of India has also given you a very good opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from cash transactions.
They need the cash.
They started believing in digital currency.
But if he refers to someone else or concentrates on someone else and the new person does the transaction thrice, then you earn Rs.
Ten rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you get 20 people a day, it'll be 200 rupees a day.
Businessmen can also earn income, even children can earn income.
This scheme has been launched since October 14. This will be your guidance towards making Digital India.
Now the red light is gone, so no one can say that the red light is in the mind, it might have gone out.
I wanted an interesting phone call.
He also expressed his apprehensions, but this phone shows that people didn't like it at all, they felt a distance.
Namaskar Prime Minister, this is Shiva Choubey from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to say something about the government's Red Bacon Light Bank.
I don't have to get trapped in the traffic jam, and I don't have to wait for anyone.
I want to thank you very much for this concept.
Thank you for the fact that the grandparents of PIs are getting clean too.
The Prime Minister said, It is a part of the government's red carpet fuel system.
But we must strive to get rid of this idea from our mind.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that our history, our culture, our heritage must be remembered again and again.
We can save energy from this, we can get inspiration from it.
This year we are following the years of Saint Ramanujacharya.
Centuries are considered sufficient in other countries of the world, but India is such an ancient nation that we have a chance to remember thousands of years or more.
Thousands of years ago, he had agitated and succeeded in taking their entry into the temple.
We are so fortunate that some great man has been born in this country to deny social faults in all ages.
We can take inspiration from Santaramujacharya to showcase the spirit of collective endeavour towards social integration.
The Government of India will release a postage stamp in the memory of Saint tomorrow, 1st May.
I recall Santaramunojacharya with reverence and salutations.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the 1st of May.
This day is observed as the Labour Day in many parts of the world.
And when we talk of Labour Day, when we talk of labour and labour, we remember the story of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Very few people knew that today we are grateful to Babasaheb Ambedkar for the benefit of the workers.
Babasaheb's role in the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb Ambedkar and Saint Ramnujacharya, I also remember the great saint and socialist Jagatguru Basaveshwara of the 12th century Karnataka.
In the twelfth century, he talked about labour and labour in many languages.
In the Kannada language, he used to say Kai Kai Kaye Kailash.
This means that you will be able to reach Alaikailas in Shiva through hard work.
Today, when I talk about labour, it is very natural to remember Dattopant Thangdi.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima in a few days.
All the Buddhist religious leaders of the world celebrated that day.
And in India, the journey from war to Buddha is a unique symbol in the life of His Majesty Ashoka.
It is especially applicable to our neighbouring countries.
May the neighbouring countries continue to collaborate and develop.
Several projects are underway at the international level.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The benefits from this satellite will be immensely helpful in the economic and other developmental sectors of South Asian countries.
These will include mapping of natural resources, telemedicine, education, IT connectivity and people-to-people contacts, which will help in the progress of our entire region.
One of the important steps taken by India to enhance co-operation with the entire South Asia is an invaluable gift from our commitment to South Asia.
My best wishes to all those countries in South Asia who are involved in this South Asian Satellite project for this special effort.
Mann Ki Baat March, 2017
Most of the families in every corner of the country are busy examining their children.
Those whose tests have ended have a slightly comfortable environment and those families where the test is going are still under pressure.
But at such a time, I would like to say that the last time I had spoken to the students about Mann Ki Baat, I would like to hear them again.
You must use those words when you're tested.
March 26th.
26 March 2019 Bangladesh Independence Day.
Historical fight against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
Today, on this great day, I convey my best wishes to the Bangladeshi citizen brothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Independence.
And I would like to assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner, a good friend and shoulder to shoulder will contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region.
We are all proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are a legacy of our two countries.
The national music of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
An interesting fact about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1913, he was not only the first Asian to be conferred with the Nobel Prize, but also the name of the Nighthood by the British.
And when the British massacred the Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was one of those great men who had fought against it and at that time when a twelve year old child had a deep impact on it.
A new orientation in the lives of a laughing-in-house boy brought about the brutal killings of Jallianwala Bagh.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old boy, Bhagwad Singh, is our beloved, inspired by all of us.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, the British had hanged Bhagat Singh and his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru and we all knew that on 23rd March there was no fear of death due to the serving of Bharat Mata on the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
They had sacrificed their lives for Mother India's freedom.
And those three heroes are still our inspiration.
We cannot narrate the story of the sacrifices made by Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
The entire British administration was afraid of these three young men.
They're locked in jail, they're fine on the day of the hanging, but they're worried about what they can do with the British.
And so, on March 24th, where the execution was to be held, it was hanged on the 23rd.
It's a hiding thing that can't be seen normally.
And then the British brought their bodies to Punjab today and burned them quietly.
Many years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I felt the vibration of that land.
And I would like to tell the youth of the country that whenever you get a chance to go to Punjab, you must go to the tomb of Bhagwat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagwat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt.
It was during this period that the handle of freedom, his intensity, his insanity grew.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the armed revolution.
On the other hand, just 100 years ago, on 10th April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had performed Satyagraha in Champaran.
This year marks the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in Champaran, the Gandhian ethos and Gandhian style were visible in the freedom struggle of India.
This was a paradigm shift in the entire freedom movement, especially from the perspective of the rituals of the United Nations.
In this era, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Kheda Satyagraha, the hustle-bustle of the workers of the factory in Ahmedabad.
In 1915, Gandhiji came back from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha based on the pictures of Mahatma Gandhi.
Imagine a man who came back to Hindustan in 1915, who worked for only two years.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such a place where the organisational strategy of Mahatma Gandhi, the power to know the pulse of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, the power to bring the poor, the illiterate, inspiring and fighting against the British administration through Mahatma Gandhis own behaviour.
Therefore, we can feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we think of Gandhiji a hundred years ago, the Champaran Satyagraha is Gandhi, then it is a matter of deep study for any person to enter the realm of public life.
We can learn from him how to participate in public life, how to work hard and how Gandhi did it.
And there was a time when the great leaders, whom we heard, Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Hon. Gandhi had sent everyone to the village.
Prisoning on one side and suppressing yourself in constructive work.
There was a wonderful balance between Gandhi's work style.
What can be the meaning of Satyagraha, what can be the meaninglessness, what can be the meaning of helplessness in front of such a great empire - not just by words, but by successful presentation, Gandhi had presented a completely new judicial system.
The unwavering efforts to make this mantra a reality for the country and for the society will realise the dreams of those great men who have sacrificed their lives for the country's freedom.
And in this 21st century there are such Indians who do not want to change who do not want to be a partner in the progress of the country.
This wish of 1. 25 billion Indians will be able to produce the seeds of a New India.
There are many people who regularly go to the hospital to serve the sick.
Our country was born in the spirit of Ratan Garwa and the service of the people of our country.
If we look at this thought together, we can understand how powerful it is.
In the context of India, it is natural and inevitable that different views and views will emerge.
But it is also true that if the entire country takes certain steps in the direction of making a solemn pledge and implementing it then the dream of a New India can be successful.
It is not necessary that the essential work is done in the budget or in the public expenditure.
If every citizen makes a solemn pledge, follows a solemn pledge, performs a solemn pledge, at least one day a week stops the use of petrol and diesel, then we will be able to take this small step forward.
And I would like to say that everybody should observe his own citizenship and perform his duties.
Thus, the creation of a New India can be started.
India will be celebrating 75 years of its independence in 2022.
I urge you all to come, to dedicate your lives and to participate in this journey from Swaraj to Suraj.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to you.
The BHIM App has started two and a half months ago, but almost 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
You cannot imagine, you can become a major partner of the country, you can dedicate yourself to a brave soldier against black money and corruption.
A few days ago, the Digidhan Mela was organized for public education and awareness.
Nearly 1. 5 lakh people have received specific awards for the beneficiaries and seventy thousand people have received specific awards for the traders.
Let us join this effort to reduce cash transactions and use of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that whenever I want your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there are many opinions.
But I have noticed that there is no lack of interest in cleanliness.
I think it's important to understand the necessity of transparency.
I cross a river every day, where people pollute the river by throwing lots of garbage.
This river is coming through the Rispana bridge and our house is flowing by side .
In order to keep this river clean, I have spoken to the people in Paro and have spoken to them but it has not been specially beneficial.
I would request you to send a team here or publish it through a newspaper.
Brothers and sisters, You can see how difficult a girl from 11th century is suffering.
He's so angry to see the dirty dump in the river.
I think it's a good sign.
I want 125 crore countrymen to be angry with garbage.
Once there is anger, dissatisfaction and anger, we will certainly be able to do something against garbage.
It is a good thing that Gayatri has expressed his anger, has advised me and has said that he has tried a lot, but has failed.
Since the movement for cleanliness has started, awareness has increased.
Everyone has been associated with it in a positive way.
It's a movement.
Hate to waste is growing gradually.
Be it awareness or be it active participation or be it movement or be it movement or be it awareness or be it awareness.
This movement is possible in a comprehensive manner.
It's hard, but we have to do it.
I believe that the awareness among the youth of the country, among the boys, among the children, among the youth is indicating a good result.
Today, I would like to tell all those people who have listened to Gayatri in Mann Ki Baat that the people of Gayatri had spoken to us.
I don't get half as much as I can, and I leave it there.
Have you ever imagined how much we waste the irregular food we dump.
Have you ever imagined that if you do not waste then how much of this food can fill the stomach of the poor people .
There's nothing different about this.
Normally in our house when mother gives food to small kids , then as much as possible eat as possible .
There must be some effort in this regard, but indifference in this regard is an expression of social inequality.
It's unfair to the poor.
Secondly, if the savings are done, the family will also get financial benefits.
Thought is good for the society , but this thing is such that the family will also get benefitted by it .
I don't want to say anything about this, but I want to raise awareness.
I know some youngsters who are associated with such movements.
The youngsters of our country do this kind of hard work.
This kind of people will be found in every state of the country.
Their work can inspire us so that we don't waste food.
We'll take as much as we eat.
This is the way to change.
And those who are healthy , they always say - keep a little empty plate , keep a little empty stomach .
Whenever we talk about health we say - World Health Day on 7th April .
The United Nations has set a goal of Universal Health Coverage by 2030.
This time, the United Nations has focused on depression on 7th April on World Health Day.
According to an advisory, more than 150 million people in the world are victims of mental depression.
The problem is that some people around us are victims of this disease, but we don't understand that and maybe we're hesitant to talk about it.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not such that one cannot get rid of it.
When he creates a psychological surrounding, he begins to get rid of it.
The first thing is that we need to express the depression without suppressing it.
Along with your friends, with your parents, brothers and sisters, tell the teachers what is happening inside you.
Have you ever wondered why that guy is doing this
Be sure these are the first symptoms of depression.
If anyone wants to keep himself away from the middle of everyone and stay alone, then be careful not to let him be alone.
Let him stay with those whom he likes to live with.
Encourage him to speak in a funny way, find out what is hidden in his mind.
In diseases like diabetes people become physically weak , depression reduces the concentration of people , gains courage , reduces the power of fighting in lifestyle , destroys all our life-force .
If you start solving other problems with the spirit of service, your confidence will come back.
If you are able to meet yourself with others, serve yourself and do it selflessly, then see if your mind is lightened on anonymity.
Yoga is a habit but it is a good way to keep mind healthy.
Yoga is an extremely effective way of emancipation from psychological disorders, liberation from dysentery and happiness.
The International Day of Yoga was celebrated on 21st June every year.
If you have a few suggestions on International Yoga Day, send me the ideas and guidance through my Mobile App.
Whatever poems , songs can be written with yoga , keep on writing so that an inspiration can come in the masses .
This time I will talk to my mothers and sisters about healthcare.
A few days back, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
The Government of India has taken a very important decision for this thing.
The maternity leave that was given during pregnancy, pregnancy and postpartum childbirth was 12 weeks before.
In this context, only two or three countries of the world are ahead of us.
When these children grow up, they will have the country's wealth.
New Year Festivals are celebrated in different parts of our country.
The New Year is celebrated in the New Year of Gudi Paua in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra-Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmir Navreh, Ayodh, Sambastar Puja in Ayodh, Judh Sheetal in Bihar and Satuvani in Magadh.
A large country is full of diversity in India.
Greetings to all of you on New Year
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
The chirping of the bird brings a tide of joy.
Not only flowers, but also fruits grow in the branches of trees.
Summer fruits are also seen in the spring.
Similarly, in the field of cultivation, yellow flowers of mustard are expected to be planted in the heart.
Palash's red flower indicates Holly's arrival.
Amir has given a very beautiful description of this season of seasonal change.
He writes: The forest is blooming, the mustard is blooming, the fucking Kokil is calling, uh-uh.
When the colour of happiness in nature, when it touches joy in the form of joy, people also enjoy it.
Spring-Panchmi, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals paint the lives of people.
And so he said I'd like to say something about 104 satellite launches and interceptor missiles.
Shobha ji thanked you very much for remembering the pride of India.
Be it fighting poverty, protecting ourselves from diseases, connecting with the world, inspiring knowledge or information, technology and science have proved their role.
February 15, 2017 is a glorious day in the national life of India.
Our scientists have raised our heads to the world.
And we know that within a few years, ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented projects.
ISRO has established a world-record for space expedition following the success of Mars Mission Mangalyaan on Mars.
India is the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together.
And it is also heartening to note that this is the 38th continuous launch of PSLV.
This is not just a historic achievement for the entire India but also for the entire India.
ISRO's cost effective space programme has been a miracle to the world and hence the whole world appreciates the success of India's scientists in an open mind.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters will be able to know that our new Satellite Cartosat-2D will be of immense help to the extent to which water resources are available in our country.
We've sent some pictures to our satellite room.
That's what he started his work.
It is also a matter of great pleasure for us that our youngsters, our women scientists, have led all these missions.
This wonderful collaboration of youth and women is a proud moment of ISROs success.
On behalf of the countrymen, I congratulate the scientists of ISRO.
For the common man, for the service of the nation, they have always kept the aim of experimenting with the science of excellence and are creating new achievements every day.
The more we appreciate these scientists and their teams, the less it will be.
Sobhaji asked another question on India's security.
In defence, India has successfully completed the Ballistic Interceptor missile test.
In Interception Technology, Baliyan has successfully switched over 100 km from the ground while flying its experimental flights.
This is an important milestone in defence.
When we see new technologies and new scientific achievements then we are happy.
And asking has played a major role in the development of human life.
And those intellectuals who don't let him ask in the form of a question, they also raise questions, find new questions and create new questions.
That's the reason for a new discovery.
They don't calm down until the answer is answered.
And, if we look at the stream of development of thousands of years of human life, we can say that there is no breakthrough in the stream of development of human life.
Impossible.
The universe, the laws of creation, the efforts of mankind are ceaseless.
New science and new technologies emerge from him.
And every technology, every new form of science gives a new generation.
My dear young friends, when we talk of science, when we talk of the hard work of the society, I remember that this Mann Ki Baat programme has once again said that the science of the younger generation should be attracted.
There is a need for many scientists in the country.
Today's scientific community will launch a sustainable transformation in the life of the next generation.
When science researches, innovations, innovations, innovations, innovations, innovations, innovations, innovations, innovations, innovations, innovations, innovations, innovations, innovations etc.
This is where I saw an innovation for working for the poorest of the poor.
All such innovations were found in this competition.
Technologies are also on the rise in services.
Technology has become an integral part of life.
Indias digital transactions are on the rise.
In particular, youngsters are removing digital payments from their mobile phones.
I think it's a good sign.
There is a huge response to the 'Lakigrahak Yojana' and 'DG Dhan Vyapar Yojana'.
Approximately two months have passed since these two schemes have been awarded Rs. 15,000 per day.
One lakh rupees have been awarded under this scheme.
50,000, more than 4,000 businessmen.
The Minister expressed happiness at the Narendra Modi App that he has received a prize of Rs. 1000 in Loki Grahak Yojana.
And then I believe that Santosh should share with you all what he wrote.
I am very happy to know that Santosh ji, your name and work have given us both immense pleasure.
On the one hand, he has become an Ambassador of Loki Grahak Yojana while on the other hand he is driving.
The car passengers are also being made aware of the digital system with inspiration and inspired by this spirit, many more have started taking part in the digital system.
He had interacted with his friends about how the use of cards, e-wallets, and how they were happy about it in the form of a young friendly family in Nemadh, a young friend from Maharashtra.
He is also encouraging others to take the award of Rs. 1 lakh for his mission and a mission.
This work plays an important role in the fight against corruption and black money in a way.
A memorable day.
A few days ago, the 125th anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar was passed away.
Remembering him, you also taught at least 125 people to upload BHIM.
Teach us how to deal with it.
Therefore, I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation stone of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The BHIM App has to be handed over to 125 crore people at home.
The movement that has been going on for the last three months has been achieved in several villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has contributed a lot to the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village enhances the economic growth of the country.
Today, I want to tell you about one happiness.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked very hard to fill the grains.
This year, the maximum production of paddy has been done due to the hard work of our farmers.
All sorts of information indicates that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This year, the kind of crops that have grown in the fields, it seems that we celebrate Pongal or Vaishakhi festival every day.
This year, more than 70 million tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
8 more than the last record of our farmers.
It's an unprecedented achievement.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of this country have heard about the poor and about two hundred and ninety lakh hectares of land have produced various types of pulses.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service provided by the farmers to the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the farmer brothers and sisters of my country for their hard work and record production of pulses.
My dear countrymen, in our country, some programmes are being run by the government, by the society, by the organizations and by the organizations for cleanliness.
Something is happening in a way that is aware of cleanliness.
The seminar is being organised at Warangal in the state of Telangana.
The Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organized on 17th and 18th February in Hyderabad.
Six household toilet pits have been cleaned and officials themselves showcased how to make use of the Twin Pit Toilet holes.
They also demonstrated how comfortable toilets are in this new system, and there is no other obstacle or narrow mental obstacle till it is cleansed.
We also do the work of cleaning small kitchens, like we can clean toilets.
A Standard Twin PitToilet for a family of six members is completed in about five-four years.
Our farmers are well acquainted with NPK.
Cleanliness drives various government departments and individuals.
For the first time in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will participate in the Swachhata Abhiyan.
On the 2nd of March, Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will undertake Swachhta Abhiyan.
We are aware that whenever any citizen of our country does a significant job then the entire country gets a new strength and confidence increases.
We all welcome the kind of performance that our Divyang friends have made in the Rio Paralympics.
In the Blind T-20 World Cup this month, India has emerged as a world champion for the second time when it lost Pakistan.
I once again congratulate all the players in this team.
The country is proud of our Divyang friends.
I have always believed that the Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, strong, brave and unwavering in their resolve.
We can always learn something new from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, our daughters are not lagging behind in any field.
They have moved on foot and are making the country proud by their success.
A few days ago, our women sportspersons won the silver medal in Asian Ragbesevens Trophy.
I congratulate all these athletes.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is progressing at a rapid pace.
This is not just a government scheme, it is now a social consciousness and public education drive.
People have also been associated with this scheme in the last two years.
Every corner of the country, the burning flames that have been generated have made the people think that the mindset of the people has changed over the years.
It is a matter of great pleasure to know that when news of the birth of a girl child has taken place on the occasion of birth anniversary of a daughter.
This kind of positive thinking towards the girl child is a way of social recognition.
I came to know that the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu has been able to stop child marriage by conducting a special campaign.
More than 175 child marriages have been closed so far.
More than 55-60,000 bank accounts have been opened under the Superior Prosperity Scheme.
In Madhya Pradesh, a campaign to educate the girl child in every village under the Har Ghar Dashtak Yojana is underway.
Your Children's Apprenticeship campaign is aimed at encouraging those who leave school without finishing their education and re-enrolling them in schools.
New imaginations have also been linked to it.
It has been changed as per local requirements.
You are actively associated with it.
I can ask you a lot.
What is happening in the world, the thoughts of the poorest of the poor reach me.
I am extremely grateful for your cooperation.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Perhaps our ancestors decorated our cycle, economic structure and social systems in such a way that there is no relaxation in the lives of the society.
In the last few days, we celebrated a lot of festivals.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Sri Krishna was celebrated across India.
Sri Krishna is a person who, even after so many thousands of years, creates innovation, inspiration and innovation in every festival.
He can be an example and inspiration to solve any problem even today.
Any person can find solutions to any of the present problems from the life of Sri Krishna.
On the other hand, in spite of such a great personality, Sarathy could be persuaded to work in the battlefield.
Sometimes when we pick up the mountains then we take the food stalls, we can feel the innovation in all these things.
Today, when I talk to you, my mind is moving towards two faces.
A handsome wheeler, Mohan, another wheelchair.
Sudarshan Chakraborty Mohan left the bank of river Yamuna and landed at Dwarka on the coast of Gujarat and spent his last days in Delhi on the banks of the river Mohan Yamuna.
Thousands of years ago, Mohan had used his own intellect, duties, courage and thinking to avoid the war.
My dear countrymen, I speak of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On 2nd October 1869, a person was born not only on the sea shore of Porbandar, which was called Kirti Mandir, who had shown a new path to human history, had established a new excellence.
Miller Mazdoor, who was not paid satisfactory wages, has served them.
He considered serving the poor, helpless, sick and hungry as one of the duties of life.
He himself used to serve leprosy patients to inspire others to prove falsehoods about leprosy.
Whatever be the case, Mahatma Gandhi used to run away to help him whenever he was in trouble.
He not only emphasized the importance of service but also knew the importance of self-reliance in service.
The word 'Seva' can only be meaningful if it is done with joy, then it becomes 'Seva Param Dharma'.
But at the same time, the idea of 'Anant Sukha' is also inherent in the matter of service.
We can easily understand this when we observe Gandhiji's life.
In the life of Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and societies, humanity and humanity were the only concerns.
Be it Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha in Africa, he gave a fundamental impression on social development.
I am fortunate to have paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at various workplaces in my life.
Gandhiji emphasised on the spirit of service as well as the strength of organisation.
We want to use both the ideas of social service and social integration, community service and community mobilisation.
Will you come and go A-will we accept it
There is no obstacle, no obstacle, no obstacle, no obstacle, no obstacle, no obstacle, no joy, no joy, no joy, no joy, no joy, no joy, no joy, no joy, no joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat.
Several programmes, competitions, exhibitions etc. are being organized in the coming days.
I'll give you a good news on this occasion.
The Haripura panels were specially fascinating.
You remember that there was a congressional session in Haripur, Gujarat, where Subhas Chandra Bose was recorded in the history of the Congress Presidential election.
These Art Panels have a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Congress Haripura session in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then President of Shantiniketan, Nandlal Bose.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through artwork and showcase it during the Art Work Session.
This is Nandlal Bose, whose artwork enhances the beauty of our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
This practice of his art has given immortality to the Constitution as well as to Nandlal Bose.
Nandlal Bose observed the villages around Haripura and then made someart canvas about rural India.
This precious artwork was discussed in Venice.
And once again I congratulate Gandhiji on his 150th birth anniversary and appeal to every Indian to make a solemn pledge.
For the country, for the society, for the other, we must do something or the other.
This will be our beautiful, true and true reverence to Bapu.
Friends of Mother India, you must remember that in the last few years, we have been running the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign for two weeks before 2nd October.
This year it will start from 11th September.
This time we're gonna have to put special emphasis on plastic.
There is a lot of enthusiasm in the society about this mission.
Many of my business brothers and sisters have placed a placard in a shop where it is written that the buyer should come with his own bag.
You can also showcase your partnership in saving money and protecting the environment.
On 2nd October, when Bapu will complete 150 years of his life, then he will not only dedicate himself to the open defecation free India but on that day he will also lay the foundation stone of a new mass movement against plastic.
I appeal to all sections of the society, every village, every village, every corner and every citizen of the city, to pray for Gandhi Jayanti this year.
2nd October as a special day.
It could be recycled.
It could be used as a fuel.
There is no need to look here for inspiration, no one bigger than Gandhiji can be inspirational.
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit is a gem of delight, of wisdom.
Today, I want to touch an important topic by a Sanskrit Subhashit, it has been written a long time ago, but it still has a great significance.
Fools call stones gems.
Our culture has a lot of glory in food.
We have also transformed the knowledge of food grains into science.
We all need nutritious and nutritious food, especially for women and infant children.
People are fighting against malnutrition in a new and entertaining manner.
On the day of harvesting, Anganwadi workers used to collect one handful of crops from everyone.
The foodgrains were used for making hot food for children and women.
As a result, those who are donating will become a conscious citizen and a social worker.
Thereafter, he dedicated himself to this cause and became a soldier in this movement.
Liquid food is not solid food.
In Gujarat, in 2010, it was thought that the children should be given complementary food during the Annaprashan programme so that people can get awareness about it.
This is a great initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
In many states, people observe 'Tithi Bhojan'.
If there is a birthday, a happy day, a memorable day in a family, then the family members go to Anganwadi and school after making tasty, nutritious meals and the family members serve their own children and share their joy with everyone.
This is a unique combination of service and joy.
Friends, There are so many small things that our country can fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, malnutrition has affected the families of both the poor and the rich.
Poshan Abhiyan will be observed throughout the country in September.
You must be associated with this mission, collect information and add new ideas.
If you can save two people from malnutrition then our country will also be protected from malnutrition.
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there will be a lot of questions on this subject and that is why it has happened.
In the last few weeks, wherever I have gone, and whoever I have met, there has been a mention of Man Vs Wild.
With this expedition, I have not only been able to connect with the youth of not only India but also with the youth of all over the world, I have never thought that such a place will be created in the minds of the youth.
I have never imagined how diverse things our country and the world youth are looking at.
I went to Bhutan last week.
That's what I felt.
Tiger, Lion, Organism, I would be surprised to know how many things people can be encouraged.
I firmly believe that now people want to know about the steps taken in the field of climate justice in India.
Is it edited later
Look, there's no secret in it.
Some people have questions about this, so I am unveiling this mystery.
It's not really a mystery.
I used to say Hindi but he used to hear it in English, that is why the conversation would have become very easy and this is the complication of technology.
After this show, I have noticed that many people are discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You must visit nature and wildlife.
I told you earlier, I repeat, you must go to the North East.
Your mind will expand.
On 15th August, I had requested all of you from the Red Fort that in the next three years, 15 places in India and 15 places in 15 places for 100 percent tourism, see, discuss, take family, spend some time there.
Your life will spread your thoughts.
Last month we had the privilege of issuing Tiger Census.
Do you know the number of tigers in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, half of it was hard to find.
Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010 with tigers.
A resolution was taken here expressing concern over the decline in tiger population in the world.
The resolution was to double the number of tigers worldwide by 2022.
But this is New India, where we have achieved the goal at a rapid pace.
We have doubled the number of tigers here by 2019.
The number of tigers not only in India but also in the Protected Area and Community Reserves has increased.
I also remember the lions of the Gir Forest in Gujarat when I was publishing the Tiger Scouts.
When I was in charge of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the lion's residence in the jungle of Gir was shrinking.
Their numbers were declining.
We've done a lot of entrepreneurship in the Gir.
I decided to recruit women's guards there in 2007.
Infrastructure facilitation will lead to improvement in tourism industry.
In terms of nature and wildlife, we are focusing on conservation.
This time we will have to think in terms of compassion and compassion across the threshold of conservation.
My dear countrymen, can anyone forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893
This young Indian monk had awakened the spirit of the Tejaswami address among the humankind all over the world.
In 1893, when India was at the forefront of compassion, the world was forced to invent the brilliant words of Lord Swami Vivekananda in 1893.
Come, let us build the India that Swami Vivekananda had seen, the power that he knew.
On this occasion, we are going to launch Fit India Movement across the country.
You have to keep yourself fit, make the country fit.
This will be a very attractive mission for the fools and the elderly.
But I'm not explaining this in detail today.
Wait for August 29th.
2nd October, 2018 for Totally Dedicated Plastics
With all our strengths, we will join the campaign to keep our houses and its surroundings clean.
I believe that this campaign will create a vibrant social media.
Let us start this campaign with a new zeal, new resolve and new energy.
I'm waiting for your message and advice.
May the spirit of joy and service be enlightened.
Thank you very much, Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January 2017
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy is such a festival of reforms that brings about reforms and reforms in the future generations about democracy, the responsibility of democracy.
However, there should not be much debate over the duties of citizens and the rights of citizens in our country, the deeper there should be irregularity, the wider the practice should be.
I hope at every level, at every moment, the more emphasis is placed on duty.
Indias democracies can move on both the path of right and duties.
Tomorrow, on 30th January, we will have the holy rituals of Poojabapur.
On 30th January, at 11 a.m., we observe 2 minute vows and pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the nation.
As a nation, as a nation, we should become a common habit of paying a two minute homage to the nation on 30th January, 11th January, 2019.
On the eve of Democracy Day, I congratulate all the brave soldiers and their families who have been honoured in the various Bravery Index Awards.
All these awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Late Seva Medal.
I would particularly like to appeal to the youngsters - are you very active in social media, can you do one thing
This time, those who have been honored - please write aloud about them after searching for internet and send them to your friends.
When we are able to know about their courage, courage and heroism in detail, it is as surprising as it is.
On the one hand, when we were happy with the festivities and fervour of January 26th, our soldiers in Kashmir, who were determined to protect the country, who lost their lives due to the devastation of snow.
I pay my respects and homage to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are well aware of the fact that I am continuously listening to Mann Ki Baat.
The months of January, February, March and April are the months of examination for each family.
Half or two children are tested in the world but the entire family is smoked by the pressure of examination.
Family worries, student anxiety, teacher anxiety - a variety of psychological environment can be seen all over the world.
And I have always thought that we should come out of it and that is why today I want to talk to my young friends in detail.
When I announced this thing, a lot of teachers, parents, students sent me a message, asked me questions, advised, wrote about the pain, reflected concerns and after seeing all these things, I feel like sharing with you today.
I sent a message on the telephone from Creator.
Anyway, the question has been raised, but you must have the same question in your mind.
The test must be a pleasure.
This is an occasion of hope and zeal that we have worked hard throughout the year.
You have to decide that you will pressure it, not please.
And when it's festive, the best that comes out of us.
The society gets its own strength during the festival itself.
During the examination, there should be an atmosphere of family, friends and neighbourhood.
The entire family should fulfil this festival as a team with zeal and zeal and zeal.
In fact, from Kashmir to Kanyakumarika, Kutch, from Amreli to Arunachal, these three-four months are just tests and tests.
It is our responsibility that every year these three-four months, by adopting their own methods, by following the traditions of water, by understanding the environment of their own family, make it a festival.
That's why I'll tell you 'smile more score more'.
And you've seen that when you're happy, you're relaxed, you're very easily relaxed, and when you're relaxed, you're a year old.
You remember the whole view of what the teacher said in the classroom a year ago.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot afford to see the exams in the right direction.
I think it's a question of life and death.
The exam means the evaluation of what you've done for the whole year.
J.
Brilliant example of darkness.
He wanted to join the airspace but was ungrateful.
If he had become disappointed after this failure, he would have lost his life, would India have got such a big scientist
This has not only increased the competition among children but also increased the anxiety.
I would like to share your views on the state of education and the future.
What you really have in life is your knowledge, your skills, your self-confidence and your determination.
Of course not, you think he's a good doctor, so you need to go to him.
Whenever you go to a nominee for a big case, do you look for his marksheets
You have seen his experiences, his wisdom and achievements.
That is why sometimes the burden of this number becomes our way in the right direction.
Introspectively, when you just ran for numbers, you looked for the easiest way and concentrated on specific things.
And that is why we sometimes face failure in life even after being extremely grateful to the test.
Richa has raised one more topic, that is competition.
It's an area of great mental confrontation.
We can give examples of Sachin Tendulkar in this regard.
Friends, in every sphere of life and especially when you are going to examine, look at the fact that if you used to spend two hours before taking care of yourself, have you done that for three hours
Earlier, when he thought of getting up, it was too late, can you get up at the right time
Shri S.
That's how he helped me.
My mother couldn't pass the tenth grade examination but I couldn't pass the CBSE exam if she didn't get help.
Nice-yes, you're right.
You must have noticed that the number of women who ask me, the number of them is higher.
If you learn to confess once, many problems will be solved there.
If you don't admit it, you're gonna get rid of this problem.
Hope makes the road tough.
Acknowledgement of the present situation creates an opportunity to open up new solutions.
So admit what you have.
Look, you'll be free of weight.
We talk about the weight of school bags for small children, but sometimes I think that parents expect more and more children than school bags.
Many years ago, due to heart attack, a well-known person was in the hospital.
In fact, we go to a sick person and create a fear in his mind about the disease.
I would like to tell the parents that sometimes we live like this with the younger ones.
Have you ever thought of giving a glimpse of laughter to the children during the examination days
You'll see the situation will change.
I have a very funny call.
The gentleman didn't want to name himself.
On hearing the details of the phone, you will be able to understand why the person doesn't want to reveal his name.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I have done such a thing in my childhood that I am not going to mention my name.
I tried to imitate once I was a kid.
I waste a lot of time thinking about how to duplicate and how to do it.
At that time I could get the same number if I'd spent on studying.
When I tried to pass through a fake, I was caught and I had a problem with friends around me.
I'm telling you the same story again.
So where will you reach
Think you're digging your own path, that is, creating constraints.
I have also seen that some people are using all their talents and creative powers to imitate them.
If I talk about sports while examining, everyone will say: What kind of Prime Minister
This is because people think that students will be neglected in sports and they will be neglected in studies.
Besides the brain, there should be proper activity of the rest of the body.
If you have a brake in five minutes, you'll feel better than you're studying.
I don't know if everyone likes it, but I'm convinced.
Once a folk song singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long did you sleep
I want to know, brother, are you a doctor
He said, No, no, you don't tell me, it's related to your throat giving me this address.
If you sleep well, your morning cord will also rest.
I didn't think of my sleep and throat before.
He gave me a simple token.
Don't do that, it'll make your impressions unhappy with me.
Otherwise, the day the marksheet comes, the guardians will see my reflections instead of you.
If you sleep, it'll work. Don't think about it at all.
Sports plays an important role in keeping the mind, mind and body functional.
Let us move ahead with this mantra.
My dear countrymen, on 1st February this year, the Indian Coast Guard is completing forty years.
On this occasion, I congratulate all the personnel and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their duties towards the nation.
Our Coast Guard has taken pride in the world's four best coast guards with 126 indigenously built warships and 62 aircraft.
Keeping in mind the commitment of Coast Guard Mantra Om Raksham, our Coast Guard has always been resistant to safeguard the maritime frontier of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard had planned to clean the coastal areas of our country along with their main activities and thousands of civilians were also involved in the same.
The Coast Guard has our women pilots, but they are capable of handling the cannons of the Hovercraft.
Spring Rituraj.
Saraswati is worshipped in Spring-Panchami.
For the worship of learning, worship was followed.
It is not only a festival of learning but also a festival of inspiration for valour.
Rang Devasanti Chola is the inspiration.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of this spring-five festival.
My dear countrymen, the Akashvani has filled the Mann Ki Baat programme with a lot of valuable thoughts.
Last month, after the address of Mann Ki Baat, Mann Ki Baat was recited in regional languages.
This effort has achieved great success.
The countrymen have written letters from far and wide.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for this self-sufficient endeavour.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
My best wishes to all of you on Christmas.
Today is a day to recognise service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Jesus Christ said, "It is not good for the poor, it is our recognition for them."
There's a story about this.
Lord Jesus stood by a Temple Treasure.
Many rich people came and donated a lot of money.
Just then a poor widow came and donated two copper coins.
On the one hand, two copper donors don't carry any money.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Madan Mohan Malviji, Malviya Ji, who had awakened the solemn pledge and self-confidence of the people of India, had given a new direction to the modern education system.
On his birthday, I pay my homage to him.
Just two days back, I had the opportunity to launch several development works in the holy land of Malviji in Banaras.
I have also laid the foundation stone of Mahamati Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University.
A cancer centre is being set up for the entire region and it will not only benefit the people of Uttar Pradesh but also the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
He said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, our country has taken the lead in nuclear energy.
Atal ji has established an ideal with every role of leader, parliamentarian, minister or prime minister.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for his health.
I am fortunate to have worked with Atal ji as an employee.
A lot of memories are swimming in front of your eyes.
This morning, when I visited, I shared an old video that showcases how Atal ji's affection for a small worker would be blessed.
Today, all the countrymen are going to get the benefits of two schemes as a gift of the elderly.
Everyone wants to understand and learn from each other.
In order to encourage this, to enhance the strength of mobile banking, to make e-payment a habit, the Government of India is launching a scheme to encourage customers and small traders.
The scheme of incentivizing consumers is "Lucky Grahak Yojana" and "Digi-Dhan Behar Yojana".
And on 25th December, as a gift of Christmas, a sum of Rs. 1,000 will be deposited in the accounts of 15,000 persons through DR.
Today, not just for one day, this scheme will continue for the next 100 days.
The awards will be given to 15,000 people per day.
Millions of families will receive a gift of crores in 100 days but they will be eligible for the gifts that include mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI etc.
Use all the digital transactions such as USSD etc.
The DG-Dhan Vyapar Yojana is for the businessmen.
Businessmen will not only connect themselves with this scheme, but will also connect the consumers to cashless their businesses.
Businessmen will also be given different prizes and thousands of prizes.
These awards will not be available for those who can make purchases worth more than Rs. 3000.
The poorest of the poor can avail the benefits of USSD through feature phones and simple phones and also get the benefits of this scheme.
People from rural areas will be able to win the award through AEPS.
Your 10-12-class child will also be able to teach you this method properly.
This is very simple - it is easy to send the Hoyts App from the mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to know how to use technology in the country, how to make e-payments, how to make online payments.
In the last few days, cashless trade and cash transactions have increased from 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to encourage this process.
Businessmen can easily guess how big this decision is.
The traders who will exchange digital payments, will be exempted from income tax on online payment system instead of cash in their businesses.
I have learnt that the Government of Assam has announced a 10 discount on payment of Property Taxes and Trade License Fee digitally.
The branches of Rural Banks have decided that if their 75 subscribers have two digital transactions from January to March, they will get 50,000 prizes from their government.
5 lakhs under Uttam Panchayat for Digital Transactions (UPD-Transactions) scheme has been announced by the Government of Assam in case of 100 digital transactions in any village till March 31, 2017.
For the farmers, the Government of Assam has decided to confer Rs. 5000 on the first 10 farmers under the Digital Kisan Shiromani scheme for those who are fully purchasing the seeds and fertilizers.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and congratulate all the States which have taken such initiatives.
Interestingly, GNFC fertilizers have increased by 27 over the previous year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our day-to-day lives, there is a need for an unorganized sector.
In most cases, the wages of these people are paid in cash, money or salary for work, and we know that the workers are deprived of it.
Rs. 80 instead of Rs. 100, where Rs. 80 is to be paid, Rs. 50 is to be paid and these workers are deprived of benefits including health insurance.
But when cashless payments are made, the money is directly deposited in the bank.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is accessible to us.
Countries like India should come forward in these areas.
Our youngsters have made a lot of progress through start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity. Our younger generation should take new ideas, new technologies, new technologies and new technologies in this field as much as possible.
We have to join in the campaign to free the country from black money and financial corruption.
My dear countrymen, I would like to appeal to the people before every episode of Mann Ki Baat, to send your suggestions, to give their opinions and this time thousands of suggestions have been received in Mygov and Narendra Modi App.
The authors of the second group who have emphasized upon all these things, such good work, work for the betterment of the country, such a sacred task, however, they have described what kind of fraud is being committed against it, how new methods are being adopted.
Smt. Gurumani Kaubal has written in MyGov: This step is worth appreciating the amount of black money.
As citizens, we are rightly in trouble but we are cooperating with the fight against corruption that we are fighting.
We are playing the role of the Armed Forces in the fight against corruption, black money etc.
This is the same spirit from all corners of the country.
We all feel it.
In fact, this is the fulfilment of change in Agent of Change.
I would like to thank all of you for one more reason, not only for the difficulties that they have suffered, but also for those who are trying to mislead the common man.
Not only this, some people have opened their masks with their intellect, power and creativity and have brought the news to the fore.
I salute this power of the people.
People's affection is the blessings of God, the blessings of the people.
I thank the people of our country for taking part in this great quest against corruption and black money.
I wanted that the fight against corruption and black money should be discussed in detail in the Parliament as well as in the political parties and political funding.
Those who are running that there is a lot of exemption from political parties, their writings are wrong.
This government is a peoples government.
On the other hand, I said on the first day - 8th, this is an extraordinary fight.
There is a lot of news coming from government officials from civilians.
The success that we have achieved is mainly due to the awareness of the masses.
Can anyone imagine how much the citizens of our country are risking to open their masks
If you get help then this fight will be very easy.
There is a third party among those who send me letters, a large number of them.
They say that Modi ji should not stop, should not get tired and should take as much steps as possible.
You have to win this war, you don't get tired.
We have brought it out and we have made a very strict Benami Property Act.
This law will play a key role in the coming days.
It is our primary duty to work for the countrymen and for the people.
In the last few years, India has established itself with pride in the global economy.
As per the World Investment Report published by UNCTAD, India has moved to 3rd place in the Top Property Host Economy in 2016-18.
India has improved 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
The World Banks Logistics Performance Index (LPI) 2016 envisages a 19-phase growth of India.
Similarly, several other reports also indicate Indias rapid progress.
My dear countrymen, this time the Parliament session has created a lot of humidity among the countrymen.
Their anger has been reflected in a variety of ways in the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their condolences on this.
But sometimes something good happens in these things, the mind is filled with happiness.
Even in the Houses of Parliament, a good work has been done which has not been noticed by the people of the country.
Brothers and sisters, Today, I am glad to note that a bill related to the goals for persons with disabilities has been passed by the Parliament.
Our government is committed to persons with disabilities.
My Divyang brothers and sisters have added strength to this effort when they won four medals at the Para Olympics.
This victory has not only enhanced the dignity of the country but has also surprised the countrymen.
Like other citizens of the country, our Divyang brothers and sisters are our invaluable resources and energy.
I am glad that the passage of this Act will facilitate more employment for the Divyangjans.
Reservation limit has been increased to 4 per cent in Government jobs.
The Act provides for the education, facilitation and grievances of persons with disabilities.
The government has enacted this new legislation in accordance with the views of the United Nations.
A few such categories have been created for persons with disabilities so that they can get the opportunity and justice for the first time.
Thalassemia, Perkinsons Disease Affected Persons and Dwarfs have also been included in this category.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, this kind of news has come from the field of sports so that we all feel proud.
It is natural for us to be proud of being an Indian.
The Indian Cricket Team won 4-0 against the United Kingdom.
The performance of some young athletes is very commendable.
A great Kohli testing team didn't just do well, but gave a good leadership.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
Good news was received in Hockey after 15 years.
I convey my best wishes to these youngsters for their success.
This is a good sign for the future of the Indian hockey team.
Last month, our women sportspersons also made great successes.
The Indian Womens Hockey Team won Asian Championships Trophy and the Indian Womens Hockey Team won the Bronze medal in 18 Asia Cups a few days ago.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the cricketers and hockey teams.
My dear countrymen, the year 2017 is a year of new hope and zeal.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month, we all celebrated Diwali.
Every year during Diwali, I had gone to China border to celebrate Diwali with the army.
I have celebrated Deepawali in the high altitude of the Himalayas with the jawans of IT-B-P.
Every year I go to the border, but this time the experience of Diwali is completely different.
They were full of emotions and not only did the countrymen send their greetings, they were happy to see a wonderful reaction.
When I was watching these things, I was surprised to see what he was thinking.
But, to be honest, we don't really think this time during the Diwali festival.
On the contrary, I felt like joining the festival of Deepawali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, the spirit, joy, love and joy that has been enriched among the soldiers of our army will be limited only to Holi-Deepawali or not
I would like you to appeal, come, as a society, as a nation, as a nation, as a part of nature, be it a festival or a festival, we will remember the soldiers of our Army in some way or the other.
When united with the United Nations, the strength of the Armed Forces will increase by 125 crore times.
A few days ago, the heads of all the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had met me.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended the Panchayati Raj Convention in Jammu and Kashmir.
Approximately 40-50 heads from different villages of the Kashmir Valley.
I've had a long conversation.
While they made some claims for the development and development of the village, the recent situation in the Kashmir Valley, the laws and the future of the children came up for discussion.
A few days ago, the board was adjusted in Kashmir and about 95 of the students were adjusted in the examination.
I can clearly assume that our children in Jammu and Kashmir have a strong commitment to the development of a bright future through education.
I thank the students not only for their commitment but also for their parents, parents, teachers and village heads.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I asked for a public debate on Mann Ki Baat this time, I confess that everyone has made a single proposal.
Everyone wants me to say something in detail with a note of five hundred thousand rupees.
On 8th November at 8:00 pm, I had spoken of a great nationwide campaign for the development of the country.
Whenever I had made this decision and had made it clear that it was not a simple decision, it was a difficult step.
At the time of the announcement, I had warned that the impact of this proposal will be so bad that it will take at least 50 days to come out of it and then we will be able to move towards normalcy.
It is not easy to recover from the diseases that have spread over seventy years.
125 crore Indians have unwavering faith in their own country that they are committed to the development of the country.
This is the reason why we will succeed, whether the bank and post office workers are working in adversity.
And when it comes to humanity, they're getting more active.
When the local bank employees lost their ears, they immediately reached the house of the elderly gentleman.
Not only this, he has arranged for his treatment.
I'm surprised at this incident.
They are taking legal measures to save their black money.
One request is not to play with the poor to fulfil their unfair interests.
Your injustice is linked to the records of the poor, not to you after the investigation, these poor people will be trapped, they will suffer.
Strict regulations have been framed to bring Benami Property under control, which are being implemented in all areas.
I am an ordinary citizen of District Harada, Tahsil and Village Tirali in Madhya Pradesh.
Your five hundred thousand note bandits are very commendable.
My request is that through Mann Ki Baat, give a few examples where the common man has welcomed this step for the betterment of the nation even after facing many difficulties.
Thank you sincerely, you said that the time is coming, but no one can imagine that you can take such a big step.
By closing the notes of five hundred and a thousand, you should teach corrupt black markets.
Every citizen of India doesn't have a bigger day than this.
I thank you once more for this.
When we hear such news through media, public and government sources, the enthusiasm of work increases.
People went there and ate, and after two-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four days, they paid the bill.
This is the strength of my country, where service and sacrifice are the main ones.
The news that I had made during my election was spread all over the world.
Many countries of the world also learnt the use of tea and coffee.
But I didn't know that there could be a 'Cha-Meeting' on the plane.
I got the news that there was such a marriage in November.
In this marriage, only tea was organised for the party's invitees, there was no food and snacks because they lacked cash due to the closure of the note.
Bharat Maru and Skill Development Corporation (MSDC) have set an example in the fight against corruption and black money.
Whenever there is a crisis, people find new ways and once again I get to see an incident in Dhekiyazuli village of Assam on TV record.
The village tea workers and these tea-labourers get weekly wages.
Four neighbouring women collectively bought and paid a thousand rupees note.
You are well aware of the fact that even two days ago, the poorest of the poor could get the minimum wages deposited.
Each municipality tax pays only fifty percent of the taxes.
But after the announcement dated 8th, the old notebook hikes in the public.
You will be surprised to know that in the last year, Rs. 3,500 crore has been deposited in the country in the form of taxes. You will be happy to know that Rs.
We are witnessing such a plurality that has the direct consequences.
Brothers and sisters, the villages and the farmers are the backbone of our economy.
I would like to especially congratulate the farmer brothers of the country when we are adjusting every citizen, despite all the difficulties faced by this transformation of the economy.
I'm calculating the sale of seeds this year.
I am glad to see that the number of varieties of wheat, pulses or sesame seeds has increased this year as compared to last year.
In all adversities, the farmers have taken a new path.
Some important decisions have also been taken by the government while priority is being given to the farmers and the villages.
Our small businessmen also created employment opportunities and also participated in economic development.
In the last year's budget, I had made an important decision that even small shopkeepers of villages like the big Malls of the city will be able to do business for twenty-four hours and no law will stop them.
Adequate efforts have been made to provide loans under the Mudra Yojana.
Millions and crores of rupees have been given to these small traders through the Mudra scheme because those people who are associated with this small business have started their turnover of crores of rupees.
But this decision is natural for all these small businesses to get complicated.
You should also download the bank's app on your mobile phone.
Provide POS Machine for credit cards and learn how to do business without a note.
You have seen that big Malls continue to do business through technology.
Similarly, a small businessman can also do business with the help of user friendly technology.
There is no possibility of any collapse, there is no scope for expansion.
I urge you to join the Cashless Society.
You can avail full banking facility on mobile phones for business promotion and start cashless transactions.
These are technological solutions that are safe, secure and fast.
I want you not only to help in the success of this mission but also to give your leadership and I believe that you can lead this transformation.
I am confident that you can finish all the business transactions in the village through technology.
I also want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that a lot of research has been done on you.
It is written in the papers that a salary and what is being paid in the hands is different.
Sometimes when there was a full-fledged remuneration, there was a man standing outside, who was forced to split and make this anomaly a part of life.
In today's new system, we want your accounts in the bank, your wages are deposited in the bank so that the minimum wages are changed.
You get the full money, no one takes it off.
Today, I would especially like to talk to young friends.
We say that India is a country with a population of 65 of the age of fifteen years.
You, the youngsters and the youngsters of my country, I know that my decisions have been accepted by you people.
I also know that you support this decision.
I am also aware that you will contribute a lot to the positive development of this thing.
But guys, you are my true soldier, true friend.
My brave young men, can you help me
Just stay with me, it won't work.
You don't have any idea of the world of today.
It may be that even the elder brothers of your family are not familiar with this, they are not familiar with their parents, uncles, uncles and uncles.
You are aware of the kind of online banking and online ticket booking.
This is very common for you and you people also use it.
But today the country wants to do a great job, it is our dream of Cashless Society.
It's just that 100 percent of the cashless society is not possible.
But once we start the Less-Cash Society, the goal of Cashless Society will not be incomplete.
And I would like your active cooperation, time and solemn pledge in this regard. And I dont know that you will never disappoint me because we are citizens of India who want to change the lives of the poorest of the poor.
You are aware of the opportunities for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking.
Each bank offers online access.
Every bank in India has its own mobile app.
Every bank has its own wallet.
The whiteness of the wallet means e-manibag.
A lot of cards can be delivered.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, the RuP ay card is available to crores of poor families of India which was used very little.
The poorest of the poor, who have been using their pulses since the eighth date, have grown by almost three hundred percent.
In addition to the pre-paid cards available on mobile phones, bank also gets cards for cost of money.
And this is as simple as sending your Houts Appearance.
Phones that are available with common features can also be a cash transfer.
Whether it is smoke or vegetables, milk, news papers, tea or thief sellers, everyone can use it unnecessarily.
And I also emphasized the need to simplify this system.
All the banks are involved in this.
My young friends, despite all this, there are generations who are not familiar with these things.
And, Your Majesty, I know very well that this great work is activated.
The kind of creative messages that you have given on the Houts App - slogans, poetry, story, cartoons, new imaginations, smiles, smiles and smiles - seem to be the creative energy of the younger generation in the face of challenges.
And today, when we are in such a massive transformation then the basic creativity of your heart is becoming visible.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work and I believe that millions and millions of youngsters of the country will do this thing.
Please do one thing. Promise me from today that you will be a part of the Cashless Society.
Use online technologies on your mobile phones.
Moreover, every half an hour, every two hours, every day, every two hours, we will explain to the ten families how to use this technology, how to download the bank's app, how to spend the money in their accounts and how to provide it to the investors.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business.
You will voluntarily enter this Cashless Society, you will have to give leadership to the great campaign of expelling the society from the cycle of this note, the campaign of corruption-freeing the country, the campaign to free the country from black money, the campaign to free the people from misery and misery.
I invite you to come, not just to compete, but to become a soldier of this change and to change.
We will carry forward this fight to liberate the country from corruption and black money and there are many countries in the world where the younger generations have changed the lifestyle of that country.
M-PESA has set up a mobile system on Kenya Entrepreneurship, used technology, named M-PESA and today African businesses in Kenya have made this emergence.
This country has made a big revolution.
My young friends, I once again express my keen interest to take this mission forward.
I invite every school, college, university, NC-C, NS-S to do this thing in a collective manner.
You have seen that the most popular Amitabh ji is taking forward the Swachhata Abhiyan with utmost hard work.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, through your thoughts, your thought papers, your ideas are reaching MyGov, Narendra Modi App and keeping me in touch with you.
Now Mann Ki Baat is being promoted at 11 a.m. but after the completion of this broadcast, it is being used in regional languages.
I am grateful to All India Radio and the new initiative that they have taken so that the people of the country can get the opportunity to join the Hindi language language.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, October 2016
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
In every corner of India, the festival of Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
India is such a country where for 365 days there is a festival in any part of the country.
We have smoothly acknowledged the changes in the festivals in accordance with the pride of time and society by closing the traditional festivals.
But in all these things, we are able to see one thing in a better way that in India, the journey of festivals throughout the year, its depth, its impact on every individual - all these things are related to the same principle - to take the individual forward towards the world.
Efforts are being made to promote individuals and individuals, to spread their limited mindsets from Paris to the universe.
And it can be done through this festival.
Sometimes there is a festival in India which means a festival of eating and drinking but it also has an idea of what season and what should be eaten there.
What kind of crops are being produced by the farmers and how these crops can be linked to the festivals, what kind of reforms should be taken in the field of diseases, all our ancestors have mixed up with the festival in scientific ways.
Today, the whole world is thinking about it.
The destruction of nature is a matter of concern.
In India, this tradition of festivals strengthens the love and affection of nature and makes every person better and better.
And science has proved that what kind of changes are brought about in the sea waters of Purnima and Amavasya, what kind of effect is there on the nature and its impact on the minds of the people.
So far, our vacations have been linked to the universe and have a tradition of cultivation.
Today, when we are celebrating the festival of Deepawali, as I have said, every festival of ours is educated, it comes with the feeling of education.
The festival of Deepawali conveys the message of 'Tamsoma Ajantagamaya' from darkness to light.
Social fault- Deepawali is a festival of freedom from the shadow of individual evils and of light from darkness.
We all are well aware of the fact that in any part of India, the cleanliness drive is being carried out in every household during Deepawali, from the rich to the rich to the poor.
Every angle of the house is cleaned.
The government of any place in the world, the parliament, the ruler and everyone became a part of the Deepawali festival.
The Prime Minister of Singapore, through Instagram, shared the pictures of the festival of Deepawali with the entire world with great pride.
A total of 16 women members of the Singapore House, who stood outside the Parliament after Indian saris, were photographed on the social networking site.
And all this has been done for Deepavali.
Deepawali festival is celebrated everywhere in Singapore.
I mean to say that the festival of Deepawali inspires everyone from darkness to light.
During Deepawali, news of accidents, fires and deaths are very disturbing.
And it is an obstacle that on the occasion of Deepawali, many of the doctors went to Deepawali along with all the families to celebrate Diwali.
It is not just a day but it has been going on for a long time from Govardhan Pooja, Bhai Bhota, Benefit Panchami to Karthik Purnima.
This is a festival that has been going on for four days.
But it has a special significance: this festival gives a deep message to society.
There is a promise that all the people of the world worship the sun.
Chhath Puja is a festival where the setting sun is also worshipped.
It has a very big social message.
This is the time to express my gratitude to all of you on the occasion of Deepawali, on the occasion of Chhath Puja.
In the last few months, every soldier of our army has sacrificed everything for our comfort.
My heartfelt condolences to the sacrifices, meditation and hard work of the soldiers of the Armed Forces.
And that is why I felt that this Deepawali should be dedicated to the security forces.
I have called upon the countrymen to take part in a campaign called Sandesh to Soldiers.
But today I want to bow down to the fact that there are no people in India who do not have infinite love for the country's army, they are proud of the army, they are not proud of the security forces.
The way people have expressed it will give further strength to the countrymen.
We cannot imagine how much a message gives them to the soldiers of the security forces.
Be it the Indo-Tibetan Police, the Assam Rifles, the Navy, the Air Force or the Coast Guard, I do not know what kind of suffering our soldiers suffer.
When we are following Deepawali then some of them are protecting the Himalayas, some are protecting the industrialists, some are protecting the airports, some are fulfilling their responsibilities.
I really want to express my gratitude to the people of our country.
The artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the poet, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the poet, the artist, the artist, the composer, the composer, the composer, the composer, the composer, the composer, the composer, the composer, the composer, the composer.
I can imagine how proud it is for the soldiers of my country.
Sandesh to Soldiers - How many messages have come in this hashtag
Shriman Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has written a poem, I would like to read it.
Today I tell you, it's impossible that you are.
My dear countrymen, many families of my fathers house and father-in-law have served in the army. Sister Shivani has sent me a telephone message.
Let us hear what this soldier family is saying - Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am Shivani Mohan.
Our army brothers have been encouraged by the launch of 'Sandesh to Solsars' campaign in Deepawali.
My family is a soldier family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and father-in-law were the army officers.
It has inspired all the officers of our Army and Army Circle on the border.
I would like to say that the Army Officers and the soldiers have to sacrifice their wives and their entire family.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of fact that not only the borders that our soldiers are guarding, but also the lives of our soldiers.
Our brave soldiers will be inspired by patriotism in every sphere of life, I have noticed an incident which I would like to tell you.
The discussion shows that some families are not able to build toilets in the house due to lack of money.
The Prime Minister said that development has empowered 57 families with a sum of Rs. 1,000 each from their pockets.
Similarly, Himachal Pradesh has become an Open Defecation Free State.
Nobody goes there easily.
These youngsters walked on their shoulders with bricks, cement and other toilets and reached the jungle all day.
More than 150 municipalities and corporations have been declared toilet-free in Gujarat.
Ten districts have also been listed on this list.
My dear countrymen, the government has taken a lot of plans and if there is a better second plan after the first plan then the first one has to be abolished.
But usually no one pays attention to it.
There is no need for kerosene in the houses that have gas connections and electricity in our country.
But who looks for Arya in the government
I have heard that seven or eight districts have been kerosene-free today.
I believe that the entire state will become kerosene-free.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always our guide.
What the country will do, how it will do, all his ideologies are still considered to be examples.
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you plan, you will remember the poor and weaker sections of the country and then you will wonder if what you are going to do is beneficial to these people, will they not be harmed
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the problem.
Whatever our ancient beliefs, we have to bridge the gap between sons and daughters in our society.
This opportunity is a symbol of distinction between our daughters in the Indian society.
Though vaccination is done by the government, lakhs of children are left out of the vaccination programme and become victims of diseases.
Mission Indradhanush vaccination is one such drive, which includes survivors and children, which enables children to get rid of terrible diseases.
In the 21st century, the village will remain dark, it will not happen.
In order to make the village free from darkness, the mission of electrifying the villages is progressing with success.
Work is going on ahead of schedule.
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore households from smoke and this is also going on successfully.
Small entrepreneurs, small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, peasants entangle in the interest paid to the Mahajan.
MUDRA Yojana, Stand-Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account are all a successful campaign to get rid of the interested.
Financial benefits are being directly transferred to the bank through Aadhaar Card and direct benefits are being provided to the beneficiaries.
It's time to get rid of the black money in the lives of the common man.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the great soul of this country who had originated and demonstrated the unity of India, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's birth anniversary.
On 31st October, 2019, on the one hand, Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, the country's leading leader in unity, and Smt.
My Lord, you know that 31st October is Sardar Patel's birthday.
Sardar Patel is an individual who has given up his entire life for integrity and has succeeded in this endeavour.
He united everyone, and we can say the country's misfortune or say that Gandhiji was assassinated on that day.
And we all know what happened in the country after his assassination.
Sir, I want to tell you how to shut down such unfortunate incidents.
My dear countrymen, this sadness is not one.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel is a witness to this event and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job of uniting the country after charming it.
But it is also a sad sadness that Sardar Saheb had dedicated his life for unity, had fought, had been the main objective of unity of the country and had also been the victim of dissatisfaction.
But on the occasion of the birth anniversary of that Sardar, thousands of Sardar Saheb and thousands of Sardar Saheb were thrown away on the path of death after the assassination of Mrs. Gandhi.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who spent his entire life in the cause of unity, torture and torture of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, this page of history hurts us all.
But within this crisis, we have to take forward the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of the country.
There are many languages, nations, dresses, diet, but unity in diversity is the strength of India.
Every generation has a responsibility, every government has a responsibility, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner
We should protect ourselves and our country from the tendency of discrimination and discrimination.
Sardar Saheb has given us Ek Bharat, it is our responsibility to create Shreshtha Bharat.
The theme of unity is Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat.
Sometimes we hear the name of 'Amul'.
Today, the people of India and the people of India are also familiar with every product of AMUL.
However, few people know that the Doordarshan Sardar Saheb had imagined the creation of a cooperative producer.
We have a live example of what Sardar Saheb had done for the happiness and prosperity of the AMU-Farmers today.
I pay my tributes to Sardar Saheb.
On 31st October, we will remember Sardar Saheb wherever we live on Ekta Diwas.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali, Karthik Purnima is also a part of the festival of light.
Guru Nanak Jis teachings continue to showcase the right direction for the entire mankind, not only for India but also for the entire humanity.
Service, truth and good for everyone, this is Guru Nanak's message.
Peace, unity and goodwill were his theme.
The campaign to free society from discrimination, blind faith and evil was in every word of Guru Nanak.
I salute Guru Nanak from the bottom of my heart on the occasion of Janmashta Festival.
My dear countrymen, once again, this Deepawali dedicated to the soldiers of the country, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to you all on this Diwali.
Your dreams, your determination to be successful in every way.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
A few days ago, we had lost all the brave sons of the country in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay my tributes.
And that is why I will tell my countrymen that on that day, I will repeat that the guilty will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We're proud of our army.
Today, I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir in a special way.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the anti-national forces.
And whoever knows the truth, they have separated themselves from all that power and started walking on the path of peace.
Every mother and child should start fast and full-fledged schools and colleges.
Farmers also want their fruits to reach the markets of the country.
And, in the last few days, businesses have started smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are not only a way of resolving all of us but also a way of our progress and our development.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I believe that while sitting together we will find solutions to all the problems, we will find ways to solve them and at the same time we will develop better ways for the sisters of Kashmir.
It is the responsibility of the administration to protect the citizens of Kashmir.
In order to maintain law and order, the administration has to take some measures.
I would like to tell the legal guardians that we have the capabilities, strengths, laws and regulations that are required to maintain law and order, to give a life of peace and prosperity to the people of Kashmir and to make full use of it.
Occasionally, people of different thoughts nurture other thoughts than what we thought.
I have the opportunity to know a lot in Social Media today.
Every corner of the country, every corner of the country gets an opportunity to think about people and it increases the strength of democracy.
A few days ago, Harsh Vardhan, an eleven-class student, had sent me an entirely different feeling.
He wrote: "After an attack in Uri, I was very disturbed.
In my mind, there was a question as to what I could do for the countrymen.
I make a pledge that every day I will study for three hours.
I will be a deserving citizen of our country.
"Brother Harsh Vardhan, it is a matter of great pleasure for me that in this environment of anger and in such a young age you can imagine.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had tried to bring this feeling to the entire world.
And he inspired the people through the mantra of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' and showed how to work for the country.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji showcased the patriotic exhibition between bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi also carried out a movement, when it was necessary to create an orientation at a rapid pace, he used this intensity to further organise constructive work within the society.
We all, the Armed Forces, the administrators, should perform their duties and contribute to some constructive work with the spirit of patriotism, the country will reach new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr.
S.
Karthik told me through the Narendra Modi App that all the athletes who had gone to the Para-Olympics had created history and won their victory in the Human Spirit.
Both of you have not only created an emotional attachment for every person in the country but also for the participants of Para-Olympics.
Perhaps the para-Olympics and the performance of our athletes, from the point of view of humanity, have completely changed our vision for the disabled.
And I will never forget the words of our champion Deepa Malik.
When he received the medal, he said, "This is how I lost the disability.
There is immense strength in this thing.
This time, he had participated in the Para-Olympics with three women from our country.
In comparison with other sports disabled persons, physical strength, sports strategies, all these things become a big thing - will power, will power and will power.
You will be happy to know and wonder that our athletes have won the best four medals, two gold medals, one silver medal and one bronze.
The gold medal winner, Devendra Jhajharia, brought the gold medal for the second time in twelve years.
In twelve years, the age grows, and once the gold is found, the starvation becomes even more.
But Debendra has shown that the condition of the body, the growing age has never let him sleep and he has won the gold medal after twelve years.
He wasn't born a disabled person.
He lost one of his hands because of his electric shock.
You can imagine that the person who received the first gold medal at the age of thirty years and the second gold medal at the age of thirteen years has achieved a great deal in his life.
Mariappan won the Gold Medal at Thangavelu Hygiene.
Thangavelu lost his right foot at the age of five.
Poverty couldn't stand up to her determination.
He didn't come from a big city, he didn't come from a clean family in the middle.
In the 21 years of his life, he fought against all the evil deeds and brought medals to the country with the power of determination, despite his physical discomfort.
The name of the athlete Deepa Malik has been associated with a lot of triumph.
Varun C.
He won the Bronze medal at the Bhatti Hijamp.
In our country, in our society, in our surroundings, in our visionary changes towards our Divyang brothers and sisters, all these medals have played a very important role.
Very few people knew how the Divyangjans had performed in this para-oplimpics.
A few days ago, the same place was the Olympics.
Not only this, I was surprised when I came to know that the fourth person among the disabled, who did not receive any medal, ran in less time than the one among the ordinary citizens who had received the gold medal.
In the coming days, India is moving forward on the path of making a smooth scheme for Para-Olympics and for its development.
My dear countrymen, I had a wonderful experience during the Navsari last week.
It was a very sensitive moment for me.
The Government of India has organised a Mega Camp for the Divyangjans.
I met a young girl, Gaurishardul, who could not see her, who came from far-flung forests of Dang district.
The government of India has established a world record on the land of development which is very important.
Six hundred Divyangjans were made to listen to those who did not hear it in eight hours.
This incident has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for our countrymen that three world records are set up by the Divyangjans in a day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
On that day, I had said that Swachhata, Swachhata, Swachhta, Swachhata, should be the duty of every citizen, it should be the responsibility of every citizen to create a sense of hatred towards cleanliness.
On the 2nd of October, when we complete two years, I can assert that there has been an increase in awareness of cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore Indians.
I had said that let us move ahead in the direction of cleanliness, today we all can say that everybody has made an effort to move forward in one step.
That is, the country is moving towards 125 crore steps towards transparency.
Therefore, everybody could be the citizens, the government, the government or the roadsides, the buses or railway stations, the schools and colleges, the destinations, the hospitals and the elderly, the poor and the farmers of the village have contributed something or the other for cleanliness.
Friends from the media also celebrated a positive land in this regard.
I think we still have to move a long way.
To be healthy, to respect the citizens, especially the mothers and sisters, we must stop the practice of open defecation.
And that is why a campaign of Open Defecation Free (ODF) i. e.
I have recently visited Gujarat, where officials have told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will reach the goal of ODF on 2nd October this year.
Congratulations to all those who have been successful in this endeavour. Congratulations to all those who have been successful.
My heartfelt condolences to the countrymen - for the honor of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children, our country will be freed from this problem.
Come, let us resolve to move forward.
I would like to launch a new scheme for young friends, especially those who are used to using technology today.
The government of India has given a telephone number - 1969 to know about the status of Swachhata Mission in your city.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
And in 2019, we are going to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In the year 1969, you will not only know the statistics of your city's toilets but will also be able to apply for new toilets.
You, especially the younger generation, should take advantage of it.
The Government of India is also calling upon the Corporate Ward to come forward and call upon the professional youth who are willing to work towards Swachhata.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Personnel.
And with the cleanliness mission, we have to move forward towards the Wasteto Compost.
The chemical psychopaths have been told to buy the compost that was produced from the Waste.
The farmers who want to go to organic farming should get the required juice.
Those who revive the health of their soil, those who have suffered a lot due to the use of chemical fertilizers should also be provided with such fertilizers if required.
Shri Amitabh Bachchan has joined Brand Ambassador for this purpose.
I see that there's a constant new news about transparency.
One day I got the news papers: Students from Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages to create awareness about toilets.
The Government of India has also created one year calendar in its own departments.
Every department is focusing on 15 days, especially on cleanliness.
My request to the citizens is that if you are associated with the work done by these government departments, if you are related to it then you are also involved in this campaign.
This time, nearly five hundred cities of the population of one lakh people are running.
This is the reason that every city has a feeling that we are lagging behind and we will do something good next time.
A competitive environment has been created in terms of transparency.
I hope that all citizens will be able to participate in this campaign.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri will be celebrated.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is completing two years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali, I urge you to buy something from Khadi.
And I would like to urge every family to do something for Khadi so that the lamp of Deepawali burns in the house of the poor.
Though the next 2nd October is Sunday, but as a citizen, can we participate in the cleanliness drive anywhere
You must strive hard for at least two-four hours in Swachhata and share one of its photographs on the Narendra Modi App.
You can share it if it's a video.
This combined effort will give strength to this mission and will give a new momentum.
Let us remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and commit ourselves to do something good for the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a different joy in giving a recognition to ones life, a unique pleasure.
In the last few days, I have also seen that when I had requested to give up the subsidy on gas, the way the common man has responded is a very inspiring thing in our national life.
Some of our youths, small organizations, corporates, students and some voluntary organizations will jointly celebrate the 'Joy of Giving Week' in several cities from 2nd October to 8th October.
The objective of the drive is to collect food items, dresses and clothing to reach out to the underprivileged.
When I was in Gujarat, I saw that our officers visited the families and collected the old toys in their houses and provided the children with the organic farming in the poor habitations.
It was really a pleasure to see all the poor kids enjoying these toys.
I believe that in the cities where Joy of Giving Week will be celebrated, the enthusiastic youth will have to inspire and help.
This festival is a festival of charity.
I extend my heartiest greetings to all the youngsters who are doing this.
My dear countrymen, today 25th September is the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and today is the birth centenary of his birth anniversary.
How can the poorest of the poor get the benefit of development
He expressed his economic vision of working with all hands and water on all lands.
The nation will celebrate his birth centenary as a 'Gharib Kalyan Yojana'.
We can free ourselves from poverty only if the society, the government and all others are concentrated on the benefits of development.
My dear countrymen, I had started the Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashmi.
My heart is filled with the people of the country, which has always been revealed in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
On the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the listeners for the manner in which you have encouraged this programme, enhanced your energy and blessed it.
I also express my gratitude to the Akashwani that they have not only propagated the programme but have also made every effort to reach the audience in all the languages.
I also express my gratitude to all those countrymen who have written letters on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, have expressed their flaws in the government system, have prepared special programmes on all these letters and have created a platform to solve the problems faced by the summary in the programme of the government employees.
This is the reason that Mann Ki Baat has become a new medium of social change, not just a minute or two.
What could be the reason for anybody's greater satisfaction
And that is why I thank all those associated with it for making this institution a success.
My dear countrymen, the festivals of Navratri and Durga Puja, Vijaya Dashmi and Deepawali will begin next week.
Navratri or Durga Puja - this worship of Shakti must worship the unity of the society.
It will be a festival to connect with each other.
This will be the fulfilment of the real power and only then will we celebrate the victory festival together.
Let us worship Shakti, let us move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Yesterday, 29th August Hockey's birthday to magicians.
National Sports Day was celebrated across the country on this day.
I pay homage to Dhyan Chand ji and remind you all of his contributions.
He has played a key role in winning Gold in Indias Olympics Hockey in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
We're all cricket lovers, we know Bradman's name.
He used to mention that He scores goals like runs.
Dhyanchand ji was an invaluable spirit and a living torch of patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, the opponent hits the head of Dhyan Chand ji with a hockey stick.
There's only 10 minutes left when the match is over.
Dhyanchand ji did three rounds in that 10 minutes and said, I took the balls.
My dear countrymen, whenever the time comes for Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of suggestions on MyGov portal or Narendra Modi App.
Shri Ajit Singh said in the Narendra Modi App, Please tell me about Mann Ki Baat and their participation in sports as they have made the country proud by winning medals at the Rio Olympics.
Mr. Sachin has written to you, "In Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely mention the work done by Industries, Witnesses and Deepa.
One of them is from North India and one from South India, one from East India and one from the other.
It seems that the daughters of the entire country have taken the responsibility of brightening the name of India.
Shakta Thakur wrote in the MyGov portal that we could have done better in Olympics.
He said, "Dear Modi sir, I thank you for winning two medals in Rio first.
But I would also like to draw your attention to this thing as to what was the meaning of our extra ordinary competition
The answer is: No.
And no one else can do this without you.
Similarly, Smt. Satyaprakash Mehra has written in the Narendra Modi App: We need to focus on our additional educational programmes in Mann Ki Baat, especially on the issues of children and youth.
Thousands of people have expressed the same feeling.
There's no way to deny that we can't show results as expected.
In some cases, it has also been said that our sportspersons have not been able to reach the level of affordability in the field of sports.
And in the medal list, we are merely two medals.
But if this is not really the case, if we look at it properly then we will see that the players of India have shown great excellence for the first time in a number of cases.
Look, our Abhinavindra has been ranked fourth in the shooting and the medal for a very short span of time has been dropped.
In the gymnastics, Deepa Karmakar also performed well in sports and secured the fourth position, with a very low medal.
But how can we forget that he was the first Indian woman in gymnastics to qualify for Olympics and the last phase of Olympics
Approximately one such incident has happened in the field of Sania Empire and Rohan Nopada Jute.
We've shown good results in the athletics.
After 32 years, Lalitababar achieved sporting qualifications in track and field finals.
Boxing-Obikash Krishna Yadav reached the finals of the uarter, but he couldn't get the bronze medal.
Some players like Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das and others who have performed very well.
But, my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot more.
If we do what we've done this time, we'll be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
We will go home and review the sports practices in the world.
We'll build a roadmap for how we can do better.
We have planned the outcome by 2020, 2024, 2028.
I would like to urge the state governments to create such committees and see what we can do in the field of sports.
I would also like to urge the sportspersons to do brainstorming neutrally.
State Governments should review themselves and send their suggestions.
We have to prepare our architects and I believe that we will have to go ahead with the promise of 125 crore Indians, 65 youngsters and sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teachers Day.
I spent a few years with the students on teachers and spent time as a student.
I have learnt a lot from these little boys.
On 5th September, I have teachers day as well as educational days.
But now I have to go to G-20summit so I want to express this feeling of my heart in Mann Ki Baat today.
As much as a mother's place in life, the teacher's place.
After this Reo Olympics, Pullela Gopichandra Katha is being discussed again and again.
He's a player right, but we've got a good instruction.
Today, I have seen Gopichand as one of the best instructors than one player.
And on Teachers' Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand, his teachings, his self-sufficiency towards sports and his disciple's success.
We always feel the role of teachers in our lives.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, paid floral tributes to Dr.
The nation celebrates the birth anniversary of Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji as Teachers Day.
Wherever he reached in life, he always tried to spend his day as a teacher.
Not only that, he always used to say, "Good teachers are those whose students never lose.
Radhakrishnan ji has lived a wonderful life even after being the President, having spent his day as a teacher, saving his studentship.
I sometimes feel that I remember a lot of teachers because they were our models in our small villages.
Today, I can say with joy that a teacher of mine who is now ninety years old, has received a letter from him every month.
If you have photographs with your teachers, if there is any good incident with your teachers, if there is a message from your teachers then you must share it with everyone in the Narendra Modi App.
Look, it is very valuable to see the teaching community in the country from the point of view of the students.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Ganesh will be celebrated soon.
Lord Ganesha removes all odds and all of us want our country, our society, our family, all the individuals and their lives to die.
Whenever we talk about Ganesh Utsav, it is very rare to remember the name of Lokmanya Tilak.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave the Ganesh Festival a universal form.
He made this religious festival a festival of national consciousness, a festival of social reforms, and a festival of social reforms.
Through the Ganesh Festival, we should discuss all those issues that affect social life so that society becomes a new force, a new dimension in the institutions organised at this time.
At the same time, Lokmanya Tilak ji had given the mantra - Swaraj is our birthright, be it at the centre of all the discussions.
Today, not only Maharashtra but also Ganesh festivals are celebrated everywhere in the country.
The youth, particularly the youngsters, enthusiastically started preparing for the festival.
Why are some people striving to pursue the idea of Lokmanya Tilak who started this festival
Discussion conferences, creation competitions, imagination competitions were organized on various topics.
Everything that affects our society is beautifully transmitted to the idol.
The Ganesh Festival was marked by a public education campaign.
Lokmanya Tilak gave us this inspirational mantra of 'Swaraj is our birthright'.
But now we live in a free India.
We will now say, Su-Raj is our right.
We will progress on the path of Suraj, Suraj will be our main demand.
Can't we move ahead with this mantra
Come on, I invite you.
Our lives are impossible without festivals, but we have to change them as per the demands of time.
This time many people have written to me about the festivals and Durga Puja.
They are particularly concerned about the environment.
An individual named Shankar Narayana Pashupati said, "Modiji, do you want to tell everyone through the Vata programme that they do not use the Ganesh statue built by the Plaster of Paris and use the Ganesh statue made by the soil of the Pushkarini village".
Conservation of environment, conservation of rivers and nutrition, and conservation of small creatures living in water from pollution, is the service of God.
Lord Ganesh Vighanhari
That's why we don't create such idols.
I don't know how you're gonna take my words, but I'm not telling you alone.
Eco-friendly Ganesh Utsav is also a social service.
There's still some time left for the forgiveness.
We have to decide now that our old families who built statues will get a chance to earn if they build statues of land brought from Pushkarini or river.
And after the festival, they will be resurrected and the environment will be protected.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be awarded the Sant on September 4th.
Mother Teresa spent her entire life in the service of the poor people of India.
It is very natural for all Indians to be proud to have got the name of Mother Teresa Saint, who has made several attempts to make herself fit for the service of the poor.
A delegation of officials led by our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will be present on behalf of the Government of India and the Government of India to participate in the event to be held on 4th September.
We can always learn from saints, sages, monks and gentlemen.
I hope we get something new, learn and do something good.
Jan Shakti is considered to be a form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the common man with the five State Governments in the Ganga Safai Abhiyan.
Village Prime Ministers in Allahabad have taken a pledge to testify to the mother Ganga that they will stop the practice of open defecation in the villages, drive toilets, not allowing Ganga to be cleaned, and fully participating in the Ganga Safai Abhiyan.
I thank all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have made this event possible.
I also express my gratitude to the Chief Ministers of five states who have taken an important step by connecting the people with the Ganga Safai Abhiyan.
Boys and girls aged seven to seventy years have done this.
The letter had an emotional effect that the day after the letter was received, when the children had come to school, they had written to some parents and teachers of the school, they would make toilets in their homes by a specified date.
A sixteen-year-old girl from Koppal district of Karnataka is sitting Satyagraha against her family.
Gram Pradhan Mohammad Shafi, when he came to know that Mallamma was practicing Satyagraha, he collected 18,000 rupees and constructed toilets within a week.
Village leaders like Mallamma, Jeed Shakti and Mohammad Shafi are really remarkable.
This is the strength of the people to solve the problems.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is now the dream of all Indians.
It's a pledge for someone.
And some Indians have chosen it as their objective.
The Government of India is contemplating and informing all the people to make a film on Swachh Bharat for two or three minutes and send this shortfill to Government of India.
Details of this will be available on the website.
It will be a competition and the winner will be awarded on 2nd October on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti.
I also urge TV channels to make such photographs relevant.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to ensure that our relations with our neighbours are deep, easier and vibrant.
A few days ago, an important incident took place, the President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated the Akashwani Maitri channel in Kolkata.
Now, maybe some people wonder whether the President will embrace a radio channel
But it's not an ordinary radio channel, it's a very important step.
We have South Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are taking forward the same cultural traditions.
On the one hand, Akash Bani Maitri, on the other hand, they will exchange programmes on the other, and the Bengali people on both sides will enjoy the Akashvani.
All India Radio has contributed a lot to the people.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated it.
I would also like to thank Bangladesh for this thing.
I also convey my best wishes to all the friends of AIR who have been playing their part in foreign policy.
Such events give new energy, new inspiration and this is the source of inspiration for our countrymen.
A few days ago, I received a letter that shook my mind.
A mother of almost eighty years, a retired teacher, wrote this letter.
Unless he'd ever forbid his name to be published in the letter, I was very eager to tell you all.
In a letter he wrote, When you applied for gas subsidy, I gave up the gas subsidy and then I forgot it.
My countrymen, you know, I tried to send a letter to those who gave up their gas subsidy, and some of my representatives were present here.
I'm trying to write more than a million letters.
25,000 is not important here, it is important that this mother's emotions and the blessings of millions of mothers and sisters like her help us build the future of our country, it gives us strength and confidence.
My dear countrymen, last year we were very worried about drought, but in August, we have been suffering from continuous flooding.
Floods have occurred several times in some parts of the country.
State Governments, central governments, local administrative agencies, social institutions and citizens have done everything possible.
But there are reports in this flood report that we need to remember more.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by moving ahead with these little boys, they must never answer these innocent boys.
My dear countrymen, this country is bright and rich in diversity.
Thank you very much.
I had the opportunity to spend some time with the young friends of Delhi this morning.
I believe that in the days to come, the entire country will spread across the country.
We all know that within a few days, the world's largest sports event is being organized in the field of sports.
Reeo will repeat in our ears.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a grand and beautiful Run for Rio, Khelo and Live, Sports and Excellence Run.
Wherever I may be, I will do something to inspire our players.
I will also be with you as a citizen of a country like 125 crore countrymen to encourage all these sportspersons.
Come, let us commemorate each one of our sportspersons in the coming days.
Today, when I talk about Rio Olympics, a poem-loving Panjab has been composed by the student of Central University, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay.
Perhaps there are many more poets who have written many poems, perhaps somebody will recite them in poetry, they will do it in every language but I want to enjoy the poems that Surajji has taught me.
A young man, Shriman Ankit, has reminded me of the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalam ji.
The nation and the world paid tributes to Abdul Kalam Ji on his death anniversary last week.
Whenever Abdul Kalam ji was named, the pictures of a powerful India of science, technology, missiles and future were visible to us.
And that is why your government has been working to realise the dream of Abdul Kalam Ji.
If we spur old technologies without research and innovation, then we will be out of the changing times of this world.
And that is why the government has taken several steps so that the new generation gets attracted towards science, development of technology, research and innovation.
So I would like to say, Let us use aim to innovate.
And when I say "Let us aim to innovate" then AIM means "Atal India".
If the next generation is to be entrepreneurs then we will have to connect our children with this work.
And that is why the government of India has taken the initiative to develop Atal Tinkering Labs.
We wish that if we have a strong and advanced laboratory, we will build a framework for innovation, innovation, to work for it, to reach a definite target.
Just as there is a need to build a new laboratory, there is a need to improve the quality of ancillary laboratory.
We need to find technological solutions to these problems every day.
We have called upon todays youth to come up with Atal Grand Challenges, if there is any problem in your eyes, look for technology to solve it, do research and invent it.
The Government of India is encouraging and rewarding innovators to find new technologies to solve our problems.
I'm glad people have a lot of interest in this.
When we talk about Tinkering Lab, we applied for more than thirty thousand schools and when we talked about Incubation Centres, more than four thousand educational institutions and others applied.
The Government of India and the Government of India are working shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to help the flood affected people.
Even if there is a problem of rains, the hearts of people get filled with the rains because of the rains and cultivation at the heart of our entire economic pictures.
Sometimes a disease occurs that we have to afford life.
However, if we are aware, alert, conscious of the disease, then it is easy to prevent this.
Try to be cautious about cleanliness, be cautious, try to be safe.
Pay special attention to the children and there is no mistake that dengue is only in the poorest of the poor.
Happy, prosperous Elaka is the first dengue to spread.
You must have seen the information on Doordarshan, but sometimes we are indifferent to using it.
My dear countrymen, I want to draw your attention.
Life is so inexhaustible, so there is no need to worry about itself.
I'm sick, I think I'm gonna get cured soon, so I'm gonna get some antibiotics.
But my dear countrymen, the habit of eating antibiotics in such a way can create serious problems.
Maybe you've been relaxing for a while, but we should stop consulting doctors to stop eating antibiotics.
The microbes that malaria and malaria are rapidly transforming themselves so fast that the efficiency of the medicine is destroyed.
In medical terms, it is called antibiotic registry.
Anti-biotics should be used for this purpose.
You must pay attention to it.
When there is talk of health, I would like to add another thing to it.
Sometimes the thoughts of life-threatening mothers in our country are very high.
About three crore women are pregnant every year in our country, but some mothers die during childbirth, sometimes mothers die, sometimes children, sometimes mothers and children die.
It is true that the maternal mortality rate of mothers has declined in the last one decade but it is still not possible to save the lives of many pregnant mothers.
Nobody knows about the lack of blood during pregnancy, infection during childbirth, high blood pressure and ill-treatment.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan in the last few months.
As per the Campaign, all pregnant women will be tested free of cost on 9th of every month at Government Health Centre.
Both mothers and children will be able to save their lives. And I specially urge the physicians to say that you cannot treat the poor mothers without any money on the day of the month or on the 9th of the month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not spend 12 days in a year for the welfare of the poor
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
During the Kurukshetra war, Lord Krishna had also spoken to the trees on the battlefield.
In Geetha, Lord Shri Krishna says, I am amongst all trees Ashwatha: Sarvrikrishnang.
NASTI KULANG ANOUSHANG, NASTI KULANG ANOUSHAN, NASTI, NASTI ANOUSHANG, NATI Aayog, NATI Aayog, NITI Aayog, NITI Aayog, NITI Aayog, NITI Aayog, NITI Aayog and NITI Aayog.
The tree that donates, makes him cross the world like that tree.
And that is why those mothers and sisters who have been working for the welfare of themselves, they should plant good trees and raise them like a child.
Our scriptures, be it Geethas or Sacracharya Niti or the discipline of Mahabharata - are some of the present generations who have demonstrated this philosophy of Shastra in their own way.
Just a few days ago, I have been reminded of the example of Puna's daughter Gold, who touched my heart.
In the discipline of Mahabharata, it has been said that trees and plants also perform the duties of children, Golden has not only been the responsibility of his parents but also of fulfilling the needs of the society.
Marriage of Natni Gold at Krishankhandu Maruti Mahatra, Narayanpur village in Junar Taluk, Pune, Maharashtra has been an example.
Other temples can also start the tradition of planting trees instead of prasad in this rainy season.
Currently, in order to build a house in India, we have to import timber worth crores of rupees from abroad.
If we plant such trees on the side of our food, which will be used for building furniture and housing, then after 15-20 years you can cut and sell them with government permission.
This could be a new source of income for you, and save India from wood imports.
During the last few days, several states have undertaken several drives for this rainy season. The Government of India has also passed a CAMPA Act recently. More than 40,000 crore rupees are being circulated to the states for plantation.
Rajasthan is a desert state that has celebrated such a great festival and has pledged to plant 25 lakh saplings.
25 lakh saplings planted in Rajasthan are not small.
He will be able to understand the hard work done by visiting the soil of the state.
Andhra Pradesh has set a target to increase the green cover of the state by 50 by 2029.
The Government of India is implementing the Green India Mission (Green India Mission).
There is also a bright continuation of the Forest Festival in Gujarat.
This year, Gujarat has celebrated several schemes like Amban, Ektawan and Shahid Van as Van Mahotsav and has started the campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states, but everyone deserves to be praised.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa.
This is my exit journey, and whenever there is a foreign trip, it is a matter of policy, of business and industry, of defence discussions and of 'MoU' signed, all these things have to be done.
But I had a pilgrimage to South Africa.
Whenever South Africa is remembered, it is very rare to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever words like violence, love, forgiveness etc. come to the ears of this world, their faces brighten our eyes.
During my visit to South Africa, I visited the Phoenix Setlement, which is known as Sarododaya, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
I was fortunate to visit the Petermaritzburg station on the train on which Mahatma Gandhi had visited, when it was discovered in the event of the train, when it was discovered as Mahatma Gandhi, but I would like to say that this time I had the opportunity to meet those great people who have spent their lives with equal dignity and equality of all.
Even after such a penance, there was no need to take anything on their faces, there was nothing to do with it.
I could see the duties that have been mentioned in Geetha as a meeting of them.
I'll remember that interviewer forever.
There cannot be a mantra of equality and equal opportunity in any society or any government.
This is the path that leads us to a bright future.
We want a beautiful life, we want a good future for children - everyone needs different things.
Priority can be different, but the path is the same and the path is equitable, equal opportunity, equality of feeling and feeling for everyone.
Come, let us take pride in those Indians who lived in South Africa as well as in the mainstream of our lives.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Artist Burma, he has told me about an incident.
Prime Minister, I am calling Artist Burma from Bangalore.
A few days ago, I have read a newspaper record that a lady has committed suicide by cheating and fraudulently losing 11 lakh rupees.
As a woman, I have enough compassion for her family.
I want to know what you are thinking about these fraudulent and fake e-mails.
"Some people have lost their money and have lost their money.
This is a new way of sustaining technology that is spreading across the globe.
On the one hand, technology has played a major role in economic development and people who have misused it have also landed in the field.
You too have made a mistake at a time because they have written so beautifully that it appears as if they are real.
Your credit card, your debit card, your debit card, and your bank account becomes empty through technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, digital fraud.
We have to stay away from this kind of mood, stay alert, and we have to share such false messages with our friends and friends and warn them too.
Our parliamentarians also bring people from their respective areas, meet me, talk to me and talk to them about their problems.
But recently I had a good experience.
Some students from Aligarh had come to me.
You drew a beautiful picture at the station.
Not only A, he found the plastic bottles or oil cane in the village and planted it and planted it and made it a vertical garden.
This has given a new shape to the tarrel station.
If you ever go to Aligarh, you will definitely see the station.
A newness is visible.
This is an example of how public participation can be transformed.
Thanks to those who are doing such work in the country, especially my colleagues in Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals starts in our country when it rains.
Festivals will be held in different parts of the country in the coming days.
Festivals will be celebrated in the temples, in the worship places and you will also celebrate the festival at home and outside.
Rakshabandhan is an important festival for us.
Just like last year, cannot you give the mothers and sisters the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana on the occasion of Rakshabandhan
My dear countrymen, we have a lot of people who were born after independence.
I am the first Prime Minister of India to be born in a free India.
The uit India Movement was launched on 8th August, it will be 75 years of its independence this year and on 15th August it will be 70 years of its independence.
We are enjoying freedom and taking pride in being a free citizen. It is a wonderful occasion to remind all those who brought this freedom.
75 years of uit India Movement and 70 years of independence can give us new inspiration, new zeal and it can be time to make a solemn pledge to do something good for the country.
I hope that you too will do some good work in the inspiration of Swadesh Prem.
And nowadays technology has become so affordable that whatever thing you can easily deliver to me, let me invite you, let us remember the lives of our freedom fighters.
Everybody plans on vacations.
And on this holiday, mango climate, so maybe we can taste mangoes.
Sometimes it seems that if you get a chance to sleep sometime in the afternoon then it is very good.
But this time it's a terrible hot funny hole.
The thoughts of our countrymen are very natural.
And there is also a reduction in the number of water conservation sites.
Therefore, there is a lot to do with water conservation and water conservation.
Someone had told me a few days ago that the village dwellers and the village dwellers of Hebde Bazar Gram Panchayat in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra had laid emphasis on the need for water in the villages.
They have decided to give up the cultivation of all the crops like sugarcane, banana etc.
The more simple it sounds, it's not easy to do.
All of them made a solemn pledge
If a factory uses water and we talk about shutting down the factory, because if water is being used more then you are aware of the consequences.
It's true that I talked about a small village in Hebrew market, but there are many more such villages.
I congratulate all the villagers for this kind of good work.
I was told by a public person that the Gorba Gram Panchayat of Devas district of Madhya Pradesh had tried to construct agri reservoir in their own efforts.
They built about 27 agricultural reservoirs.
This led to an increase in ground water levels and water was rising.
I would like to say that they are more congratulative than railways.
The nature of human beings is that whenever there is a day in danger, if there is any good news then the danger is gone.
From 106 percent to 110 percent of the rainfall in the world, it seems as if a message of great peace came.
It is still late for rains but the news of good rainfall has created a new zeal.
Farmers need soil, they use it for their crops.
Can't we take the soil out of the village pond and pour it into the field
It will also improve the field and increase its water conservation capacity.
Sometimes in a cement saddle, sometimes in a serpent-filled saddle, sometimes in a serpent-filled rock and soil-filled roads, can water be saved
Increase water levels, our wells will have water.
So, as much as possible, water should be stored.
The rain water, the water of the village will remain in the village and if we do something for this purpose then it will be possible for a collective effort.
So today the water crisis is good, the drought is going on, but we have time for the next one and a half months.
Shriman Kumar Krishna asked MyGov: Will Ganga Safai Abhiyan be possible in our lives
How many governments have come up, how many projects have been formulated and a lot has been spent.
And that is why it is natural for millions and millions of people like Bhai Kumar Krishna to ask these questions.
The Ganga provides us a ropeway, the Ganga gives us a new strength to live.
As the Ganga flows, it also gives a new impetus to the economy of the country.
We had brought the Ganga to our neighbourhood but it required crores of devotees to save it.
This will never be possible without the full support of the people.
We need to be a change agent for its cleanliness and cleanliness.
Several schemes are underway by the government.
Efforts are being made to fully cooperate with all the states that are on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to connect social and voluntary organizations together.
Several steps have been taken to prevent pollution through environmental pollution and plants.
Everyday there is a lot of water in the Ganges through drains and nerves.
In order to clean the waste, Trash skimmers in Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc. have been cleaning the waste water.
All local organisations have been informed and requested to continue the work and regularize the cleaning of the waste.
Earlier, I was told that wherever the effort was made, it was possible to clean 3-11 tons of waste daily.
Then it's true that we're able to clean up a large amount of waste.
There are plans to set up Trash skimmers in other places in the coming days.
And the people along the banks of Ganga and Yamuna will soon realise that an effective plan has been prepared to control pollution of pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industry.
Extraction of waste material from the plant of Pulp and Paper Industries is almost complete.
All these things prove that we are moving towards the right goal and awareness has also increased.
People are also helping people in cleaning the Ganga, which is why this work is going on very well.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Diwas in India.
Today, Panchayati Raj system has been started in our country.
And today the Panchayati Raj system of the country has been working successfully as one of the most important destinations of our democracy.
On 14th April, we celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar and today on 24th April we are celebrating Panchayati Raj Diwas.
This is a beautiful end, the most important part of our Constitution is our village.
He was inspired to do this important work of connecting the village with the Constitution.
Towards this end, on his birthday, from 14th April to 24th April, he was commemorating the 10th day of his commemoration at Vipai Gramodya.
I am fortunate that on 14th April, when I had got the opportunity to visit Mahu on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, I had the opportunity to salute him.
Today, on 24th December, I will be celebrating Panchayati Raj Diwas in Jharkhand where most tribal brothers and sisters are present.
Once again I will interact with all the Panchayats of the country at three in the morning.
This campaign has done a great job of awareness.
At the same time, all these programmes have been going on for ten days in so many villages of India.
I congratulate all the state governments and village heads for this thing.
You have utilised this opportunity to further strengthen the democracy for the betterment and prosperity of the villages in a very basic and new way.
And that is why we will get the epidemic fruits as much as we emphasise on the village garden.
Sharmila called from Mumbai on the edge and expressed her thoughts.
Prime Minister Namaskar
I'm speaking from Mumbai on the Sharmila basket.
You have questions about my school and education.
For example, education needs to be amended over the last several years.
Today, if there is only one dream for parents in every family then it is the education of children.
Come home and car.
In a country like India, this feeling of education is a great strength for children to study.
I would like to further enhance this spirit of good education to the child and there should be greater awareness about it.
Therefore, I would like to urge all the parents to discuss the programmes of the school with the children in a very short time.
And if you think of something then go to school and discuss with the teachers.
This surveillance will help in reducing the shortcomings in our education sector.
And it must be possible for everyone's participation.
Every government in our country has emphasized on education and they have tried their best.
And it is also true that for a long time, we had focused on educational institutions, education system, school-colleges, teacher-teaching, and many children coming to school.
We have done a great job in promoting education.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Good education through literacy missions - this should be our main goal.
Infrastructure accounts were needed so far.
Now we need to assess the achievements of education.
The focus was on how many students had come to school so far.
Filled, filled and filled these mantras were consistently messed up.
But now we have to focus on providing good and efficient education to the children who have come to school.
You have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to focus on good education.
It's right, there's a lot of way left.
If we decide on 125 crore Indians then we will be able to cross this path.
However, Sharmila ji is true that it is impossible for us to change our mindset as well.
You must have noticed that some work has been done outside the conventional beliefs in the budget.
Out of the budget, 10 Government Universities and 10 Basic Universities have been asked to be free from government bonds and they have been asked to know what is the challenge before them to become the best universities.
Universities in India can compete with other universities in the world and there should be competitions like this.
Along with this, education is important as well as important skills.
This is why technology will play a very big role in education.
Tele-education technology will make our education easier.
And I believe that we will understand the results in the near future.
Your Excellency, Namaskar
I'm from Bijnor to Meena Karnwal.
Young people have an important role in sports along with reading and sports.
They must have a teamworking mindset and qualities of good leadership so that their overall development can be achieved.
I want you to inspire a large number of youngsters, I want the government to encourage the maximum number of NCC, NSS and India Scouts and Guides.
You have sent me such an offer that before I could talk to you, I would like to talk to NCC, NSS, India Scouts and Guides.
I had organized a meeting on your repeated requests so that the heads of NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guides, Red Cross, Nehru Yuva Kendras were present.
When I asked them when they had met together, they told me that they had attended such a meeting for the first time since independence.
Now I've given them some of these things.
I told them, why don't our young friends take part in water conservation during this summer
There was such a conversation with them.
I've seen it as a catalyst in us.
You must have noticed that the political situation in our country has reached such a stage that in the last few elections, there has been a lot of talk about how many gas cylinders will be provided by a party.
Economists also talked about reducing gas subsidies.
Some committees have also proposed to reduce gas subsidies.
It's all the experience.
I had said this thing but today I want to say that I am proud of my countrymen.
One crore families have voluntarily left the gas subsidy.
And this one million families are not rich.
I see that among those who have left the subsidy, some of them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers, families of middle class or lower middle class.
But it has been observed that more than 80 per cent of those families who have left the gas subsidies have gone to the distributors and left the gas subsidies on a written basis.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government gives up a small amount of taxes, the government can appreciate the weekly TV and newspapers.
In our country, Subsidy is considered to be a right.
But a million families left the subsidy.
First of all, I convey my best wishes to those millions and millions of families because they have made political leaders think in a new way.
The world's economists, who do this, present such a financial equation, are out of concern for them.
Sometimes I wonder if we will announce that there will not be any ticket examiner on this railway track.
We can do many such tests.
If we believe in the people of the country then we can achieve the desired results.
Anyway, it's your opinion.
It can't be a government rule, but we can create an environment like this.
And this environment is not being created by any political leader but by one crore families of the country this environment has been created.
All breaking news is bad news.
Isn't there anything good in our neighbourhood about 125 crore people
Please change this situation.
He used to talk about this again and again.
A few days ago, he had written to me on behalf of a newspaper that he would not print any disappointing news on Monday.
And everybody wants people to get the right and good news.
If a well-known person speaks well, selects good words and presents them in a better way, it can be more effective than its effect.
Good news inspires us to do good work.
That's right, it's good that you're gonna lose the place of bad.
If the lamp burns, the darkness will go away, it will happen
Perhaps you are aware that for this reason a website has been opened by the government - Transforming India has been published on this website.
This is not just the government but also the common man. You can send good news to this portal.
You can also join it.
Raviji, you've given me good advice, but please don't be angry with me.
We will all strive to work together, work constructively, and work towards a constructive goal.
The specialty of our country is Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela can be a center of attraction for tourists.
Very few people around the world know that crores of people have come to the bank of the river for such a long time.
Calm down, this fair is finished in a peaceful environment.
The event is an institutional vision, from the point of view of event management, from the point of view of peoples participation.
During the last few days, I have seen that some people are uploading pictures of the Singhsham Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India and the State Government to organize a competition on these photographs.
And tell the people to upload a good photo.
He said that we have laid special emphasis on cleanliness and not only should Swachhata be stuck in this premise, but also the message of cleanliness from the Kumbh Mela.
I believe that this Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual fair, but we can also make it a social interaction.
We can also build a cultural area.
This can be an opportunity to take a solemn pledge and a solemn pledge to the villages.
My dear countrymen, on this auspicious day of Panchayati Raj, I will certainly meet you once again. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
Mann Ki Baat is always awaiting me and you all.
This time too, I have seen a lot of letters, comments, phone calls from which I have received many stories, suggestions and inspiration.
I think you're taking my exams.
In spite of this, I would like to share your words with you people once again in the chain of Mann Ki Baat.
You must be reminded that last time I had discussed a book on the story of Prem Chandji and we had decided that if someone reads a book, they would share something with everyone through the NarendraModiApp.
I've seen that a large number of people shared information on various types of books.
I am glad that people have discussed books on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and self-interest.
Some people also advised me to talk about some more books.
But one thing I must admit is that I don't have much time to read.
But I believe that we should take this experience forward in the last one month.
I want these books to become an active platform for corner, readers and writers.
Friends, I feel that earlier I had touched the issue of water conservation in Mann Ki Baat but today I feel that even before I had told you, this water conservation issue was a matter of touching your hearts, it was a matter of pride for the common people.
I feel that the recent issue of water has shaken the hearts of our countrymen.
Several initiatives are being taken across the country for water conservation.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
A lot of innovative campaigns have been launched on the conservation of Media Water.
This not only prevents land degradation and crop failure, but also provides water to the fields.
You will be happy to know that the beautiful state of North-Eastern State of Meghalaya, the country's first state that has taken over its own water policy or water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
There's a lot of fairs in these days.
We can use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all walks of life come to this fair.
We can organize exhibitions on water conservation here, dramatically reach there and also provide water conservation along with the festival.
And that is why today I want to tell you about a few children.
These are Nidhi Biputu, Manish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tewari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Forest Tesh Ganguly and Hrithik Ala-Manda.
You will be proud of the fact that I will tell you about these things.
We all know, "Cancer" is a word that scares the whole world.
It looks like death stands in the craze.
But these 10 children have not only defeated cancer-like dangerous diseases in their lives but have also brought laurels for India in the entire world with their own achievements.
In sports, we have often seen that a player is a champion after winning a medal or after winning a medal, but this is a rare experience where they have become champions before participating in the competition and are also a lifelong champion.
This month, World Childrens Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
Sports like shooting, cotton, swimming, race, football, table tennis were organized.
The tenth performance championship of our country has won the medal at this event.
Some of them won medals again in a number of games.
My dear countrymen, I believe that you are proud of the success of India in the remotest part of the sky - Chandrayaan II.
From Jodhpur, Rajasthan to Sanjeev Haripura, Kolkata to Mahendra Kumar Daga, Telangana to P.
Several people like Arvind Rao have written on Narendra Modi App and MyGov from different parts of the country and expressed their desire to discuss Chandrayaan-2.
In fact, the year 2019 is a very good year for India in terms of space research.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March and then launched the Chandrayaan-2.
During the elections, it was not possible to discuss such a big and important news like A-Sat.
In just 3 minutes, the A-Sat missile was capable of hitting a satellite 300 km away.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this goal.
Recently, on 22nd July, the entire country has seen how Chandrayaan II interacted with Sriharikota.
Successful launch of Chandrayaan 2 has filled the country with pride, energy and happiness.
Chandrayaan 2 is a special mission in many ways.
We must believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan II is an Indian initiative.
It is an Indian in mind.
This is a fully indigenous mission.
The way our scientists had launched Chandrayaan 2 in a record time, day and night by rectifying all the technological problems.
We have faced such temporary setbacks in our lives.
But always keep in mind that we have the ability to overcome this barrier.
I firmly believe that this Chandrayaan-2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country towards science and innovation.
This is the final truth that science is the path of development.
We are now waiting for the month of September with immense interest when two lander and rover will land on the Moon land.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to invite my country's student friends, my young friends for an interesting competition and a competition and invite the youth of the country to participate in a quiz competition.
Asks about space and space, Indias space expedition, science and technology are the main issues of this questionnaire: what to do when a rocket launches, how to send a satellite to orbit or what can we know from this satellite or satellite
I would like to urge my young friends to take part in this quiz competition and make it more entertaining and memorable.
This will be a historic event in the lives of those awardees but for that you will have to take part in this uiz Competition and get the maximum number.
My dear countrymen, you must have noticed one thing that our Mann Ki Baat has given momentum to the Swachhta Abhiyan.
The effort towards cleanliness has always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago today has set a new benchmark of cleanliness in collaboration with everyone.
It is true that we have not yet achieved the goal of cleanliness but the way the cleanliness drive in public places has been successful in the anti-toilet movement in the open space is the result of the will power of 130 crore countrymen.
But that's why we don't stop.
This movement has now moved from Swachhata to Beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching a news report on Shri Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Sini is an engineer who has left his job in America to serve Mother India.
A few days ago, he took the responsibility of not only making Delhi clean but also making it beautiful.
He started beautification with his team from Lodhi Garden.
Through the Street Art, many areas of Delhi are being decorated with beautiful pictures.
From the walls of the overbridge and the school to the huts, when he made them beautiful, many more started moving forward.
You must remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh Mela.
I came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team had played a major role in this task.
There might not be any word in the colors and lines, but the images produced by them are more meaningful than thousands of words.
We have also seen this beauty in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important that we make efforts to make resources from waste to wealth in our lives.
That is, we have to move towards making gold from waste.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read an interesting comment on the MyGov portal.
The comment was from brother Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Sopian district of Jammu Kashmir.
He wrote: I like listening to Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to note that I have been playing an active role in organizing the Community Mobilization Programme Back to Village in my state Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was held in June.
I think this event should be organized every three months.
The event should also be organized online monitoring.
I believe that this is the first such event where people could speak directly to the government.
After reading the message that Brother Aslam ji had sent me, my interest in knowing about the scheme Back to Village has increased, so I read about it in detail and then I felt that it should be told to the entire country.
This scheme shows how much people of Kashmir want to connect with the mainstream of development of the country.
They also knew whether the villagers are receiving government services.
How can we increase their income
Some other things were added to the programme to make it more attractive.
Children's Sports Competition was organized under Khelo India scheme.
The event was distributed to sports equipment, Manrega Project Generation Card and Certificates of STs and Tribes.
Economic literacy camps were opened and stalls were provided to government departments such as agriculture, horticulture etc.
Thus, the event became a development festival.
It was a festival of public participation and a festival of public awareness.
The people of Kashmir were immersed in this development festival.
An officer was so overwhelmed by the warm welcome extended by the villagers that they migrated to that village during more than two days.
It is a matter of great pleasure for the participation of a large number of people in the Gram Sadak Yojana and for the betterment of their lives in these areas.
This is a wonderful outcome of a new era and a new resolve.
Such programmes and peoples participation in it prove that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir are interested in good governance and the power of progress is always more than the strength of the bomber.
Those who want to spread hatred in the path of development and stop progress, they will never succeed in their hatred.
My dear countrymen, the Gyanpeeth Awardee Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Vendra in a poem describes the commemoration of the Shravanamas in his poetry.
In this season, whenever we look around, it looks like the spiders have covered the green sheet.
At this time, the festival of love of brothers and sisters is also celebrated as Rakshabandhan.
You will be happy to know that in the last four years, most of the pilgrims have participated in the Amarnath Yatra.
Since 1st July, more than 3 lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than 60 days of pilgrimage in 2015, more devotees have joined the voyage in just 28 days.
I especially commend the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who have returned from the journey have brought the people of that state with warm memories of hospitality and care.
All these things will help in improving tourism in the future.
I have been told that more than 8 lakh pilgrims have visited Kedarnath Dham in one and a half months since the start of the Char Dham Yatra in Uttarakhand this year.
This is the first time since the great natural calamity in 2013 that such a record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I appeal to all of you that you must go to those areas of the country where the beauty and rainy season is spectacular.
This beauty of our country and the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage, may not be a big teacher.
I convey my best wishes to you all for this beautiful and lively month of Shravan. May you all have a new energy, new hope and new zeal.
On the other hand, this is the time when heavy rains occur in different parts of the country.
When we watch TV, there was a flood in all directions, there was water, traffic jams.
Another picture of the rains is that you will have to go out with your family to see the farmers, birds, waterfalls flowing, green sheets and slums.
My best wishes to all of you for the rain, the freshness and happiness that is freshness and happiness.
My dear countrymen, where do we start Mann Ki Baat, where do we stop
I'll be back after a month.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on Easter.
My young friends, all of you are busy in the examination.
Some people may have finished the test.
Some people are dragging on the one hand because the T-20 Cricket World Cup is on the other.
Even today, you are waiting for the match between India and Australia.
Today, India will be playing with Australia and I convey my best wishes to the players of both the countries.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been continuously depressed, we are losing, we are lagging behind, we are lagging behind.
Now our place has come down so low that we cannot dare to talk.
Throughout this year, we can create a football ecosystem.
In schools, colleges, in every corner of the country, our younger generation, our school children sweat.
There are very few people who go abroad, most of the people go to their state somewhere or the other for five days or seven days.
Some people go outside the kingdom.
I had told you that wherever you go, upload the photo from there.
We have to take this work forward.
You should do the same thing in a similar way but now write something with him - not just a photo.
And it is said - A traveler without observation is a bird without wing.
If you're fond of seeing good things, you're gonna have to make sights.
And I'm lucky I've got a lot of chance to travel.
When I was not the Chief Minister, I was not the Prime Minister, I was a young man like you, I had travelled a lot.
Perhaps there is no such district in India where I did not have the opportunity to go.
Tourism has a big role to play in creating life.
And now the youth of India is going to tourism with courage and passion.
I believe this is a very good example.
Our younger generations should be brave and should be able to reach wherever they are not.
I want to especially thank Coal India.
Then I'll stay away.
When we see the pictures of the people there, we think it's good to go there.
And the word is that the coal is black, so people get away from the mine.
But that coal mine has become a tourist destination
And I am glad that more than ten thousand people have seen the environment friendly mines tourist destination in Saon village near Nagpur.
This place is giving itself a chance to see new things.
I hope that if you go out on vacation, you will also be able to do something about cleanliness.
Perhaps it's not very scientific, but it's happening.
Can you also not give importance to the cleanliness of tourist destinations as a tourist
I firmly believe that our young friends will definitely help in this thing.
Thus, tourism is expected to generate a lot of employment.
India is still lagging behind in tourism compared to other countries of the world.
But if we believe that our tourism needs to be strengthened then we must attract the entire world.
We can drag a large part of the world tourism to ourselves.
And it will be possible to provide employment opportunities to millions and millions of youngsters in our country.
Whether it is the government, the institutions, the society or the citizens, all of them have to do this together.
Come on, we do something for that purpose.
My young friends, the vacations just come and leave - I don't like it.
You should also think about it.
Would you like to let your vacations, your important years of life and these moments of greatness go on like this
How many things I'm talking about - you can think of it.
Can you make a solemn pledge to add some more qualities to your personality on this vacation
If you don't know how to swim, you can vow to swim on vacation.
If you don't know how to drive a bike, you'll learn to drive a bike on holidays.
Do something to develop your personality during the holidays, to increase your efficiency and efficiency.
Not only the areas that I have spoken about, but there is an opportunity to do more than that.
This will enhance your personality and your self-confidence.
We'll talk about it among friends.
This time some suggestions have been received in the MyGov portal for Mann Ki Baat.
Like My name is Abhivedi.
I am delighted to do this, and I have been friends with many birds on this occasion.
I request you to repeat this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to this boy named Abhishek Chaturvedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
Abhi told me he's been doing this all year and many birds have become his friends.
The great poet of Hindi, Mahadevi Burma loved the birds.
In his poetry, he wrote: I won't let you go away, I will fill up the doors, I will fill the vessels with sweet cold water.
Come, let us make this message of Mahadevi ji work.
I convey my best wishes and thank you for reminding me of something very important.
From Mysore to Shilpa Cook has been a very sensitive subject for all of us.
He said, Our house has a milkman, a news paper, a postman.
Sometimes the dresser and the cloth seller go that way.
Have we ever asked them to drink water during the summer season or have we given them water
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people think Digital India is the world of young people in the city
If you download this app on your mobile phone, you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weather.
The App has a wide range of topics like market conditions, pickery market conditions, availability of good crops, availability of suitable medicines etc.
And if you put any questions in front of them, they will answer them and will also explain to you.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
This period is very important for the farmers.
Can't we dig those old places once again, clean them up so that they can save more water
You might have seen that efforts have been made to construct 5 lakh ponds and farm land ponds.
Emphasis has been laid on creating resources through water conservation under the MNREGA scheme.
How to save water from villages and villages, how to save every drop of the rain in the coming days, how to keep the water from the villages and how to start this awareness campaign.
You must join the various government schemes in this regard so that a peoples movement is created for the importance and conservation of water.
There are several villages in the country, there are several progressive farmers, there are many aware citizens who are doing this thing.
But we have to go further.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to tell you one more thing, just a few days ago, the government of India organized a big agricultural fair.
I have seen how many modern techniques have been developed and how many changes have been brought about in the agriculture sector.
But these technologies will now have to reach the farmers' fields.
And now the farmers are saying that we have to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers.
I congratulate you like this.
Excessive use of chemical fertilizers has sickened our mother Earth.
But if good spices are given in large quantities, what does it like to eat
No matter how good it is, excessive use of these fertilizers will be harmful.
Everything needs to be used as per requirement.
It also costs less, saves money.
I hope that we will be able to complete this work with full focus on the water conservation requirements.
The more water is saved, the more it benefits the farmers and the more life is saved.
My dear countrymen, 7th April is World Health Day.
This year, the theme of World Health Day is Beat Diabetes.
Diabetes is a disease that calls all other diseases.
Once someone is diabetes, many patient guests enter their homes and bodies.
According to statistics, there were 6. 5 crore diabetes patients in our country in 2014.
Three percent of the deaths are due to diabetes.
Diabetes is two types Type 1 and Type 2.
Type 1 is genetic, parental, and there is a possibility of children.
And the reason for type 2 is indecency, aging and excessive weight.
The world is concerned about diabetes and therefore, on 7th, the theme of World Health Day is Diabetes.
We all know, the biggest cause of diabetes is our lifestyle.
The hard work is going down.
There's no smell in sweat.
I'm not walking.
We're also playing online.
Nothing's happening in offline.
If you are interested in yoga, practice yoga.
Otherwise, at least run.
If every citizen of our country is healthy then India will be healthy.
And now all the privileges are easily accessible to the hands.
You must think about it.
Tuberculosis Day was celebrated on 24th March.
When I was a kid, I was afraid to hear the name of TB.
But when TB was due to death, we were scared.
But now we don't care about TB.
The number of TB patients in our country is much higher than in the world.
We need proper treatment and comprehensive treatment if we get rid of TB and we need proper and complete treatment.
Leaving the treatment in the middle, creating a new problem.
Tuberculosis is such a disease that everyone around us knows, they can also advise for check-ups.
It means, it's a disease that needs immediate testing.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this regard.
There are more than 13,500 microscopic centers and more than 4 lakh DOTs providers.
Treat properly and continue till the disease is eradicated.
I would like to urge you, be it TB or diabetes we will have to defeat them.
India has to be free from these diseases.
But it is not just the government, the doctors, the pharmaceuticals, until you have come forward.
And that is why today I appeal to the countrymen to come, defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, several important days are coming in April, especially on 14th April the birthday of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
He was accompanied by the 125th birth anniversary of Jayanti Dhammadham.
He is the birthplace of a mahu of Panchteerth.
His studies in London, initiation at Nagpur.
I am fortunate that this year, on 14th April, the birthplace of revered Babasaheb Ambedkar will be a privilege to visit Mahu.
Babasaheb has given us a lot to become a responsible citizen of the country.
Following this path, we can pay tribute to him as a responsible citizen of the country.
The festival is celebrated in different states, in different names.
Some people call it 'Nab Samvatsar', some people call it 'Gudi-Papa', some people call it 'Varsh Prapada' or 'Ugadi'.
You are aware that I had told you last time that my Mann Ki Baat programme will be able to listen to your mobile phones at any time in nearly 20 languages.
You have to make a missed call.
It has been only a month and I am glad that about 35 lakh people have benefitted from it.
You also write the number 81908 81908.
I repeat, 81908 81908.
I will be glad to be associated with you.
I also want to be your partner in this regard.
I am equally concerned about your children's exams.
If we change the process of thinking and thinking about the tests, we may be free from worry.
I have said in my earlier Mann Ki Baat that you must send me through your suggestion Narendra Modi App.
On this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to parents, examinees and teachers in a special way.
I want to tell you something from what I've heard, what I read, what I've been told.
I know, the test is about to begin in a few days.
How many percent will you get in the exam
I want to say that you set some goals for yourself.
Don't take pressure on yourself from anyone else's expectations.
You must work hard, but you must set the goal for yourself and try to achieve this goal.
When I was playing cricket, I also had a lot of expectations.
Just as time has passed, people's expectations have increased.
It was very important for me to find a solution.
I thought that I would expect myself and set myself a goal.
And if I set my own goals and achieve that goal then I must do something good for the country.
And I've always tried to achieve this goal.
My goal was always on the ball and that is why the goal has gradually been fulfilled.
And I believe God will give you good results.
Good luck
Never read with expectation.
Your future will be yours.
Make your goal yourself fixed.
Why should we waste our time while competing with others
Why don't I try to break my own record
Friends, don't consider exams as number games.
Life should always be guided to a greater objective - a dream should be guided.
Whether we are moving in the right direction or not, this test is a test for him.
So if there's any deficiency in achieving hopes, then don't be disappointed.
Make the mindset of hard work and effort.
Thousands of people have written small things on my App through mobile phones.
Mr. Gupta says healthy mind lives in a healthy body.
Students, you must focus on your studies and health so that you can get the tests done properly.
However, for 365 days, our daily routine should be in line with our dreams and resolves.
I agree with Shri Prabhakar Reddy, who specifically asked him to sleep at the right time and asked him to revise the dawn.
Prabhakar Reddy ji said that we should reach the test centre with admit cards and other papers.
I couldn't say that, because I'm a little depressed when I'm sleeping.
And when I talked about sleep, don't think I'm sleeping for the test.
Don't misunderstand, I'm talking about sleeping to be stress-free for a good test.
You mustn't do that.
I believe you won't do that.
It is essential to strengthen the foundation of chaos and success in life.
Discipline creates a strong foundation of life.
The irregularity and disorder that works in the morning, works in the afternoon, may seem to have happened.
I don't think anybody's small.
Do it properly, do it.
Friends, I've seen sometimes the test takers are like two.
One, they concentrate on what they read, what they learned, what they made.
Secondly, there is another kind of examiner who doesn't know what questions, what questions will come, whether I can solve it or not.
I have seen two types of examinees that the question papers will not be difficult or easy.
Exams are very similar to curd games.
When you're playing, you don't know which trick you're gonna come in, just like you don't know, you don't know what questions you're gonna ask.
So if you're calm, eat properly, sleep enough, your brain will remember the correct answer to the right question in the right moment.
Don't expect it to be a challenge. Think about it, can I remember what I have learnt all the years, can I answer these questions
So be calm, sleep well at night, not too self-defending, but not negative.
I've seen that your exams are much better than your fears about exams.
So, be confident and best wishes for you.
"Vishwanathan joy has really been a very important thing.
His eyes don't turn around.
We have heard that Arjun's life was only visible in the bird's eyes.
In the same way, I have seen Viswanathan joy, his focus is entirely on the goal and that is the peace of his inner world.
Don't talk to your friends, stay lonely, stay delicate, reverse a lot of books to the last minute. You can never calm your mind.
This is why laughing - laughing - laughing and laughing with friends - see, you will be relaxed.
But if the water isn't calm, nothing can be seen.
Then I feel that if you take a little rest then it will be good. Therefore, I have developed a system myself.
Deep breathing.
I breathe three or five times deep.
Sometimes it takes 30, 40 or 50 seconds, but my mind becomes absolutely calm, it becomes perfect to understand something.
Maybe it's my experience, but it can help you too.
Because most of the time we have seen that we will continue to hesitate by examining what is right and what is wrong
If the parents are educated at home then they should write what I have written in the entire account.
We're stuck in it.
Guys, don't do that.
It's done what happened to the test time.
Talk to the family about other things, remember the smile of the day before leaving.
If you go somewhere with your parents then remember that sight.
Leaving the test, he spent at least half an hour.
In the current perspective, he is trying to reach out to the world about the importance of 'Maintenance Manas'.
Pujya Murari Bapu has given several important suggestions for the students.
And accept whatever the situation is, please.
In my experience, we can be happy and happy if we adapt to the situation.
Without any stress, it will definitely be successful if you don't sit in the examination of the happy mind.
And if you do not succeed, you will not be saddened by failure.
We are grateful for the advice given by Pujya Muraribapu to all of us.
Friends, today I want to talk about another thing.
My mobile app includes Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, Shri Sushant Kumar, Shri K.
G.
But friends, if I say that Yoga will start from tomorrow morning then it will be unfair to you.
But, those who do yoga exercises, I don't want to do this today because they are tested.
If you start exercising Yoga, do it.
If you don't practice yoga before the examination, if you have a person who knows about Yoga then contact him who can do Yoga in two to four to five minutes.
Why don't you hurry
Make your day-long schedule in such a way that even if you get stuck in traffic jams, you can get timely tests.
Otherwise, this situation creates anxiety in the mind.
And one thing, the guidance on the question paper, maybe it's a waste of time to read them.
I have seen that sometimes after getting the questionnaire, we do not understand it properly but if the instructions are read properly then we can adapt ourselves to it and we can decide how to move forward.
It's very important to understand questions.
Rao has stressed upon patience - in a short span of time, he has advised all the test takers.
That's what I say to my young friends.
At the same time, we have a lot of opportunities in our country.
What you need is jealousy, self-sacrifice and ability to hold.
With all these qualities, you will be successful in all the tests and efforts.
This is the power of science and the power of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for encouraging the children of the country, for their determination, dedication and hard work.
Hang on, guys. Hang on.
If you're there, you'll be afraid of fear.
A bright future is waiting for you to do well.
My app Ruchika Dubs shared their experiments.
We all know about Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the electric bull, and we also read about him in our syllabus.
But today the light of that bucket is illuminating the lives of the people that is why the seeds of success lie in failure.
He had no legal education in mathematics, no special training.
Harry Potter is popular all over the world today.
But it wasn't the beginning.
He had to face many difficulties and how many failures he had to face.
Nowadays, not only students, but also the entire family, schools and teachers are associated with it.
But the situation of students is not suitable without the collaboration between parents and teachers.
The examination becomes easier when the teachers, parents, even the senior students prepare a team, unite and move forward with consciousness.
Shri Keshab Vaishno Devi has written on my App, he has complained that there should not be much pressure on the students to get more numbers.
You just need to be encouraged to be ready.
We need to think that they're worried.
Vijay Jindal has written, Do not put your hopes on the children.
Get their courage as much as you can.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Friends, I am sure about one thing that especially my young friends, our present lifestyle has changed from generations to generation.
We want to move forward with science at the same speed.
Friends, I am saying this because today is National Science Day.
Every year we celebrate February as National Science Day.
Sir C.
Raman announced his discovery of Raman Effect.
He received a prize for this discovery.
This is the reason why the day of February is celebrated as National Science Day.
Asked by science.
Scientific thinking, attraction towards science creates new ideas and on the other hand, new ideas cannot be created without science and technology.
I am C.
I salute Raman and urge you all to enhance your interest in science.
Friends, sometimes it is too late to achieve success and when success comes then the perspective of seeing the world changes.
Perhaps because of the busy scrutiny of the examination, you might not have noticed a lot of news but I would like to remind the countrymen that you might have heard that there has been a very important discovery of science in the world.
Our scientists have empowered us to identify gravitation waves.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all those scientists.
Our scientists will also make efforts to take this research forward in the future.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My countrymen, we have taken a very important decision in the last few days.
There are only two such systems in the world.
India is the third.
I once again express my gratitude to all the scientists.
My dear countrymen, this is the number one. From tomorrow onwards, you will hear my Mann Ki Baat.
You will also hear in your mother tongue.
81908 81908, I repeat 81908.
Friends, your exams are on.
I'll have to examine tomorrow.
125 crore Indians will take my exams.
February 29th - it's Lip Year.
Yes, you must have seen how healthy I am, how confident I am.
Tomorrow I will be tested - Persu will start with you.
If we all succeed, the entire country will succeed.
Thank you very much
This is my last episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
We followed Christmas a few days ago, and now we are preparing to welcome the New Year.
India is a diverse country.
There are many festivals here.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where the economy is associated with festivals.
Employment for the poorest of the poor is a festival.
I also convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the Christmas and my best wishes to all the people of the country for the New Year 2016.
May 2016 bring immense pleasure to all of you.
New joys, new hopes and new resolves will take you to new heights.
Whether it is terrorism, global warming, natural calamities, human-generated conflicts, the Earth is free from all these things.
You all are aware that I use technology completely, I can learn a lot from it.
Some people go out for Christmas holidays.
While focusing on other facilities in tourism, he pointed out that we should have a special interest in keeping the tourist destinations clean and sustainable.
The cleaner our tourist destinations, the brighter the pictures of India in the world will be.
I welcome the thoughts of Shri Sauleswarkar and convey his words to the people of the country.
He did a wonderful job, published in the newspaper.
So I thought I'd send it to you.
Dileep Singh Malviya, a resident of a small village, decided that if a villager collects equipment for toilet construction, he will construct toilets without any remuneration.
Considering this, he has worked hard in Bhojpura village so far to construct 100 toilets.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we hear disappointing things about our country.
As a result of the collective efforts of all people, our country is progressing at a rapid pace.
125 crore Indians are moving ahead together and taking the country forward.
We have achieved new opportunities for better education, new technologies and livelihoods, banking opportunities for citizens from insurance protection, new reforms in the era of international trade and development of new business infrastructure.
For the people of ordinary families who could not reach Dorgoda in the bank, I have easily provided loans through MUDRA Yojana.
When every Indian came to know that the entire world was attracted to yoga exercises and when all the countries of the world came together on the occasion of International Day of Yoga then we believed that this is our country and great India.
When this kind of feeling is created in our minds, we get a wonderful picture in front of our eyes.
Cleanliness is heard in every household.
Public participation is also increasing.
But I believe that the media will reach all these villages and showcase the hopes and aspirations of the people of the country.
And that is why the biggest benefit is that those government employees who are associated with this scheme will be encouraged to think that they have done something that will bring about a big change in the lives of the people of the villages.
Is it not necessary to reach out to the farmers, the poor, the youth, the women
There is no need to reach out to those governments who have worked, who have not worked, who should not be deprived of what they can afford.
They must be informed about their rights.
We must strive to make the right and good messages of the common man accessible to a large number of people.
This is also a kind of service.
I've made a little effort to do this like me.
I can't do everything alone, but I should do what I'm saying.
A common man can download the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone and contact me.
You should also join this effort like yours.
I want to reach out to 125 crore Indians. This is not possible without your help.
Come, let us all inspire the common people by encouraging them to share the goodwill and righteousness of the common man.
My dear young friends, from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August, I have started the Start Up India, Stand Up I.
Since then, it has spread to every department of the government that India can become a start-up capital.
It is imperative to have new ideas and new strategies in every aspect because the world cannot progress without new innovation.
There are talented young friends in every corner of India, they need only opportunities.
We will take this project forward with the request of all the state governments.
On 16th January, I will meet you and discuss in detail and wait for your suggestions.
There are millions of people in this country like me who are inspired by the ideals of Swami Vivekananda.
From 1995 to 12 January, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated as the National Youth Festival.
The festival is scheduled to be held from 12th January to 16th January, 2018 at Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
Can you give me some suggestions on this youth festival
My special request to the young friends is to send your suggestions directly through the Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand your minds.
This will be reflected in the National Youth Festival and I will give appropriate advice and information to my Government.
Friends, I am waiting for your views on the youth festival through the Narendra Modi App.
Dileep Chouhan, the visually impaired teacher of Ahmedabad and Gujarat, celebrated the Accessible India Day in his school.
I have received a very encouraging response from the students and inspired them to help the physically challenged persons in society.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
You're doing it yourself.
You are well aware of their problems and you must have faced many problems yourself.
Whenever there is an opportunity to interact with such people in the society, I have a lot of feelings.
As per our thoughts, we express our vision for their problems.
Some people are victims of organ loss due to accident.
Some people are born with physical disabilities.
Various words are used to identify all these people and there is a lot of concern about these words.
But it is always believed that the use of such words for these people is not right, not respectable.
It's true that the word has a special significance.
This year, the Government of India has launched the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Since I was supposed to be present at the event, I was thinking about it.
During this period, I felt that God has made some incomplete organs of which do not work properly, we call them handicapped and we know them handicapped.
But sometimes when I meet them, I understand that in our eyes, there is something incomplete but God has given him some extra power.
These are the people who have one or several organs that have the power of divinity, which is not in the body of ordinary people like us.
I like this.
I appeal to the countrymen, can we use the word 'Divyang' instead of the word 'Divyang'
On that day we started the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Physical and Virtual Infrastructure will be developed to facilitate access to persons with disabilities.
We may need schools, hospitals, government offices or bus terminus, sloping roads or ramps at railway stations, easy parking and lifting systems, braille library etc.
In our country gas cylinders are provided.
The government has brought about some changes in this regard.
With the help of Jan Dhan accounts, Aadhaar cards, etc. , the world's largest Largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme (LDBT) provides direct benefits to the beneficiary's bank account.
I am proud to know that it has been ranked as the Guinness Book of World Records for the successful launch of the largest Direct Benefit Scheme.
This project, known as Pahal, has been very successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore LPG consumers have benefited from the Pahal scheme.
Nowadays, the MNREGA scheme is ensuring the livelihood of rural people.
There were several complaints regarding the amount received under the scheme.
Now, most of the money is directly reaching the bank accounts of the workers.
There was a lot of problem with the students' scholarship money, there were many complaints.
This system has also been started for them and it will be taken forward gradually.
Approximately Rs. 40,000 crore has been directly transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries under various schemes.
Approximately 35 to 40 projects have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).
My dear countrymen, 26th January is Republic Day.
It is a matter of happiness that this year marks the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the founder of the Constitution.
The two-day session of the Parliament to discuss the Constitution specifically was a good experience.
The Constitution also lays emphasis on duty.
There is a lot of duties while voting, but why shouldn't there be any duties in everyday life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, cant we organise a competition of debates and poetry in schools, colleges, villages, cities and social organisations in front of the day of 26th January
You can write to me in your mother tongue or in English or in Hindi by writing poetry.
I want to be aware of your thoughts.
You can send it to my MyGov portal.
I am very keen to know about the duties of the youth of our country.
I want to make a small offer.
When we observe Republic Day on January 26th, cannot we take care of the citizens and school-children of our country to clean and smoothen the images of the great men set up in our cities and to maintain the sanitation of the replica related sector
I'm not talking about government.
As ordinary citizens, the more enthusiastic and emotional we are indifferent to the preservation of these great souls.
Can't we make it a normal habit for the society, for the country
On 26th January, let us all work together for the cleanliness of all these statues that have been constructed in the honour of the great men.
For this, people and citizens will have to move ahead voluntarily.
My dear countrymen, I once again congratulate you all for the New Year 2016.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Business and Employment will also start with new zeal.
Preparations for Christmas must have begun.
Festivals have a distinct significance in society.
Sometimes the festival works to remove grief, sometimes it creates a new zeal.
But sometimes whenever there is a problem in the festival then it becomes very painful.
There are reports of natural disasters everywhere in the world.
There are reports of natural disasters that have never heard or thought.
I convey my condolences and condolences to all these families in this hour of grief.
The State Government has been using all the strengths to rescue and rescue.
The central government also works shoulder to shoulder at all times.
At present, a team of rescuers from the Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I believe that despite this danger, Tamil Nadu will continue to move forward at a rapid pace and will continue to play the role played by him in taking the country forward.
When these dangers are happening around, the need to prevent them is also increasing.
Now his appearance has changed.
In each case, its capacity building has become extremely important.
Government, entrepreneurs, people, even smaller organizations have to work in a scientific manner in the Capacity Building.
I am happy to note that this initiative has been launched through a table tax exercise and best programme seminar and workshop in Delhi.
You are well aware of the problems faced by the farmers, not only by the biotechnology but also by the farmers.
It is our nature and generations have been working to ignite the roots of our crops.
Firstly, there was no idea of any damage that could be caused by it, so we are doing it.
Secondly, there was no training on what other methods could be.
When the impact of these dangers started falling on the city then people would be moved against it.
The sorrow you have expressed is true.
First of all, we have to provide proper training to our farmer brothers and sisters.
If we burn the roots of the crops then the time will be saved, the hard work will be saved, the fields will be ready for the next crop but that is not right.
The root of the crop is precious.
It's a biological furnace.
We're burning the meal and destroying it.
It doesn't end, if these roots can be squeezed, it can also be cattle feed.
In order to burn this root, the upper level of agriculture is burning.
The upper layer of our land is burnt, which our fertile land is pushed to death.
And that's why we have to play our part.
Mix the root of this crop in the ground, it will be cured.
If the biological fertilizer is used in that land, it can be doubled.
Once I had the opportunity to talk to the artisans.
They had a very good experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate bananas, they used to spend Rs. 5000 or 10 or 15 thousand rupees per hectare to clean the root of bananas.
If we hadn't found a tracker to clean it, the heels would have fallen like that.
Some farmers used to buried these roots in six or eight inches of measurement.
Because there is so much water in the root of that banana, where it is boiled, if there is any tree, tree or crop, it does not require water for three months separately.
The water that is on the root of banana keeps the crops alive.
The roots that used to be spent on cleaning the roots, now they are earning from them.
Our farmer brothers and sisters are not less than any scientist.
Dear Countrymen, on the 3rd of December, the entire world will celebrate International Day of Disability.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had talked about organ donations.
I also spoke about the helpline of NOTO in organ donation.
The National Organ Donation Day was celebrated on 27th November.
Chitravinetry Ravina Tandon and many other dignitaries from the society.
Organ donation can save a lot of valuable life.
It can bring immortality in a way.
When a part of the body gets transformed from one body to another, it takes a new life and it takes a new life.
What could be greater than this
A National Level Competition was organised through MyGov. in portal to generate audio logo, donor cards and noise generating in this regard.
Physically and mentally challenged persons have immense courage and power.
But if we change our vision, change our attitude towards them then they can become the inspiration for our lives and work.
We'll cry when we're in small trouble.
That is why they are the source of inspiration for us.
I compliment their determination, energy, ways of fighting their lives and the indomitable effort to make them stronger.
I want to talk about Javed Ahmas today.
Some parts of the kidneys, microscopics and stomach were to be fired by the terrorists.
There was a serious injury in the backbone.
The ability to stand on his feet ended up as usual, but Javed didn't mean the magic rate.
The terror attacks didn't trigger him.
An innocent person is suffering without any hesitation, life-threatening, yet he does not express any anger or anguish, and he is sensitive to these dangers.
This is his greatest determination, he dedicated his life to the service of society.
He is not always empowered, but has been engaged in teaching children for the last twenty years.
He has done MA in Social Sciences and as an admirer of social service and conscious citizens, he is making a silent revolution today.
Can people from every corner of India get inspiration from the story of Javed
I will commemorate the life, penance and human service of Javed Ahmad on December 3.
Timely, I am talking about Javed but I know that every corner of India is the inspirational lamp that gives a new light to life and guides new paths.
3rd December is the day to remember all such inspirational people.
Our country is a big country.
There are so many things that people are dependent on government.
The government and the government are in constant touch with the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the Dalits, the oppressed, the deprived and the underprivileged.
There is a network of ASHA workers across the country.
They did a lot of social work in India.
There's an outbreak of malaria.
Yamuna Monising, a hopeful worker from this village, has decided that no one in his village will be allowed to die due to malaria.
If someone in the village has a small fever, then reach the house immediately.
He started treatment on the basis of preliminary medication.
Emphasis on the use of pesticides in every household.
Just as the children need to sleep and take care of their children, the hope workers have dedicated themselves to protecting the entire village from mosquitoes and have made all villages to prevent malaria.
There are so many Yamuna monisings like this.
We have millions of such people around us.
We will try to see them with respect.
They can become a major force in the country.
We have always been a partner of happiness and sorrow.
I would like to honour all the hope workers through Yamuna Monising.
The first is the issue of Swachh Bharat, the second is related to the Adarsh Gram Parishad and the third is health care.
I request you to see these e-books.
Not only yourself, but also others.
You might be reminded of your involvement in these things.
Then surely send me to mygov portal.
There are so many things that we don't see, but there is real strength for society.
The perfect example is our greatest strength.
I invite you to join us in nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is concerned about climate change.
World Warming, Climate Change is now the most sensible and the most thought-provoking indicator, which is recognised as an indicator before doing everything.
The temperature of the world should not rise and it should be thoughtful and accountable for all.
Energy conservation is the first way to prevent temperature rise.
Once I had said that on the full moon night, we should shut the street lights and bath in the full moon for hours after saving electricity.
You should feel the ray of the moon.
A friend sent me a link to such a scene and I had a chance to see him.
A woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur, who cannot be seen on TV, who has got the opportunity to study, has done such a thing that no one has ever thought of.
He is working to provide electricity to the poor by using solar energy from the sunlight.
He is fighting with darkness and brightening his name.
People take the lanterns in the evening, go back to charge in the morning.
Approximately three to four rupees per day, but there is enough light in the house.
This salt jewellery recharged these plants with solar energy all day.
Look, the world's largest people are doing a lot of things for climate change, but a narrow country seems to inspire all of them.
In the same way, the name of Nurjahan is to illuminate the world.
Similarly, he is spreading light.
Congratulations to Honble Prime Minister for starting a scheme with MUDRA Bank.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana Fund the Unfunded.
However, the speed at which we want to move is still going to be the same.
Most of the beneficiaries of this scheme are SCs, STs and other Backward Classes who have worked hard and tried to run their families with dignity.
Absolutely encouraging.
I've got a lot of news.
I've been told that there's someone named Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He has received loans worth Rs. 8.
And he's initiated the practice of cleaning the pantry.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that this campaign will create new entrepreneurs.
And the gentleman showed it to the bedroom.
And there was a good business for his family.
But I want this scheme to be more publicized.
May all our banks be more sensitive and help small businessmen.
In fact, the economy of the country is driven by them.
People employed in small businesses are the real power of the economy of the country.
We want to focus on it.
Well done, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had spoken of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
There are many things that always create awareness in our society.
Internal Vigilance is the Prize of Liberty will be the prize for freedom.
In order to maintain the unity of the country, the Internal Security River has to be kept on flowing.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat - I want to make it a plan and I also asked for an idea on the portal.
I've been told there's a lot of suggestions.
I have been told that a certificate will be given to the participants.
A big prize has also been announced.
I believe your advice will be very useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter season is starting.
It's a good time to eat and wear dresses.
But I'll tell you, exercise.
At least one hour of your family members will be able to conduct physical exercises, see how awareness will be generated and how fresh it will be for the whole day.
Be good habits in good weather.
Joy Hind
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
This is the twelfth episode of Mann ka Baat, and it has passed a year to see this.
On 3rd October last year, I had the privilege of speaking at Mann Ki Baat for the first time.
There is immense pride in democracy.
There is a fundamental concern in my life and that is why I have unwavering faith in the peoples power.
From what Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what I have understood, what I have experienced, I can say that the strength of the people is greater than what we thought.
Our ancestors have said that they are a part of God.
I can say from Mann Ki Baat that our ancestors have immense power and immense truth because I have experienced it.
I have asked everyone for advice on Mann Ki Baat but perhaps I have been able to see or understand two or four suggestions.
But lakhs of people are actively advising me.
It's a big power on its own.
And in this way Mann Ki Baat has become a medium of expressing its own thoughts.
I once talked about selfie with daughter.
And so the whole world was surprised to hear.
But the pictures of millions of selfie with daughters have come from all over the world and the daughters have made it a matter of pride.
And when they took selfy with daughter, they did not only honour their daughters but also made a solemn pledge within themselves.
And when others see these selfies, they feel that they too have to leave their indifference to their daughters.
Millions of such photographs have been sent by people from every corner of India.
The tourism department of the state government or the central government could not even imagine that we have such valuable assets in the country.
Little, we're buying khadi things.
Today, I can say with great pleasure that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year.
And it wasn't for any government advertisements.
We didn't have to spend crores of rupees.
This was a belief in Jan Shakti, a feeling.
I had requested the financially sufficient people to extradite the subsidy for gas cylinders.
On a TV channel, I saw a widow, a retired teacher, and a gas cylinder.
The middle class, lower-middle class families of the society, who are very uncomfortable with giving up their subsidies, have also given up their beneficiaries.
Isn't that a volatile revolution
He said that the government will work with the people as well as with the people, he will work as a good driver for the betterment of the society.
The people of my country are trying to consolidate ourselves for the welfare of the country by giving importance to every small thing.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I thought of taking a new initiative.
Whether it is Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup or Kanyakumarika, there is no such place in India from where people have not called.
It's a feeling of my own.
People of all ages have called.
I heard some phones myself and I liked it.
My entire government will work according to your advice.
They gave positive suggestions.
Therefore, the people of the country have a positive attitude and this is a huge resource for the country.
Perhaps there were serious complaints on one or two of the phones.
And one thing has come to our notice, a lot of calls have come from persons with disabilities, especially those with visually impaired.
One of the reasons for this is that since they don't have the luck of watching TV, they must listen to the radio.
With this, I understand how important the radio is for the blind.
I have got a new direction from these phones and these phones are very important for making the government more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya gave me a suggestion from Alwar in Rajasthan.
I believe that everyone should listen to it and people from all over the country should consider it.
You must listen to what he is saying: "My name is Pawan Acharya, I live in Alwar in Rajasthan.
Pawan, I believe that your suggestion at the earliest will spread across the corner of India.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the Army.
I have spent time with the Air Force, Air Force and Navy personnel who have provided water, land and air safety.
What wasn't there - the entire history has been depicted alive.
We can understand the glorious moments of war, the indomitable courage and sacrifice of our armed forces, through this exhibition, as we did not get any pictures, neither videography was possible.
The battle of Haji Peer or the fight in the north of the country, the fight of the Chamunda or the victory of Haji Peer Pass, whatever you see, is a thrilling experience and is proud of our soldiers.
This exhibition will continue for a while.
My request is that those who live around Delhi, you must see this exhibition with your family and not hurry like me.
Look at the strength of democracy, a young boy is ordering the Prime Minister, but that young boy has forgotten to mention his name immediately.
Cleanliness should be instinctive and appropriate measures should be taken for it.
I have to hear a lot of things that Modi ji had spoken a lot about cleanliness but what is happening at the end
On the other hand, on the other hand, Parliament and on the other hand the children of the country are talking about cleanliness, what could be the greater good fortune for the country
This movement of cleanliness, the atmosphere of hatred towards garbage, the awareness about cleanliness will also force this government to work towards making a Swachh Bharat.
Local Autonomous Bodies - Panchayats, Nagar Panchayats, Municipal Corporations, Municipal Corporations or States or Centres - have to work in this regard.
And when we will celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will move ahead in the right direction to fulfil the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Once Mahatma Gandhi had said that if I have to make a choice between freedom and transparency, then I would first like cleanliness, after independence.
Gandhiji had more importance than freedom.
Let us follow Mahatma Gandhi and take some steps to fulfil his wishes.
He wanted to know about Deendayal ji's birth centenary.
My dear countrymen, the philosophy of life of the great men is an inspiration for us.
Any day is historically associated with the name of some great man.
In the days to come, we will remember all these great men, we will take their philosophy to every household and we will try to learn something from it.
I would particularly like to mention 2nd October that day, the birth anniversary of revered Mahatma Gandhi, I had said last year that you have different fashion clothes, different kinds of fabrics, different kinds of fabrics and other things, but Khadi products should have a special place.
And that is why in this Deepawali we will definitely provide space to our homes, we will wear clothing.
And look, last time the sale of clothing was doubled.
How many poor people have benefited.
The work that the government cannot afford to spend lakhs of crores of rupees through advertising has been done with your small help.
This is Jan Shakti and that is why I once again request you all for this work.
My dear countrymen, one thing has filled my heart with happiness.
I wish you all the very best to share this happiness.
I went to Kolkata in May and some of the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose had come to meet me.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose made all the arrangements.
I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with the family members of Subhash Babu.
You can imagine how enjoyable it is for me.
Perhaps they are all coming to the Prime Minister's residence for the first time.
But it is a matter of great pleasure for me that I have never had the opportunity to have such a hospitality in the residence of the Prime Minister in October.
More than 50 members of the family of Subhash Babu who live in different countries are coming.
He sent me a message from the heavenly crystal, and I heard his voice and thought he was going to be a leader or a leader.
He said, My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to make the youth aware of the registration of voters, which will enhance the participation of youth in the coming days and make the youth an important part of the government in the future.
Thank you very much for enrolling on the electoral roll and voting.
Every voter in the democracy is the fate of the country and this awareness is gradually increasing.
Even a few years ago, we have seen that the Election Commission was conducting elections, but in the last few years it has changed a lot.
Today, our Election Commission is not only the Election Director, but also the Assistant, the Voter-Friendly and the voters are at the centre of all their thoughts and programmes.
But only the Election Commission will work, it will not work.
I hope that if the youngsters of the country do not register their names in the electoral rolls, they will surely register and vote.
On the day of election, I can say that the first phase of polling is Polling, then drinking water.
It's a sacred duty. Everyone should do it.
Last time I came to Kashi.
I have met a lot of people, several programs have been organised, many have met but I want to tell you about the two boys.
But at such a young age, his interest in physics research surprised me.
I believe that he studies a lot, surfs Internet, familiar with new applications of science.
He was talking about how to get rid of rail accidents, how to use technology, how to reduce energy costs, how to feel a robot.
One such guy has met a small sandwich called Sonampatel.
Sonam is nine years old.
I was surprised that the whole Geetha was a girl's voice, but the most important thing is, when I asked her, she was arguing in English as a shloka, explaining the shloka, analyzing Hindi.
I told her to ask her father, she's been doing this since she was five years old.
I asked her about her studies, did she just read Geetha or did something else
The gentleman said, "No, Sonam, if you've started scratching all the readings in the evening, and if you've got history, you're in the middle of the evening."
They're astonished with the girl, she's the only one in her family.
I'm really surprised.
Sometimes children are fond of celebrity, and there's nothing in Sonam.
I believe that God has given it special strength.
Sandeep ji, what else will you do with me
Once a month, I have to make a lot of effort to do this.
Sometimes our friends in the Akashwani have to wait for me for half an hour and half an hour.
One year of Mann Ki Baat was completed.
Do you know how useful Subashbabu radio was
He started his radio broadcast from Germany and he used to tell the people of India about the freedom movement through radio.
He launched Azad Hind Radio with weekly news bulletins.
This radio was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushti, etc.
I would like to tell you, I would like to think about you, I would like to consider your suggestions and it is because of this that the horizon of my thoughts will open up to you through the All India Radio.
I say, but it's your point, and that's my satisfaction.
Once again I have got the opportunity to join you in Mann Ki Baat.
The people of far-flung South India are now celebrating the Omna Festival and yesterday the entire nation celebrated the festival of Rakshabandhan.
The Government of India has started several new schemes including social security for the common man.
I am glad that many people have come under this scheme in a short span of time.
I had requested that our sisters should be given such a safety scheme in the festival of Rakshabandhan.
A lot of information has come to me, which shows that since the launch of the scheme, eleven crore households have been connected.
I have also been told that about half of the benefits have been received by the mothers and sisters.
The Jan Dhan Yojana was launched a year ago when I was talking to you people.
A lot of questions were raised whether the work that was not done in sixty years would be done in such a short time
This has also helped the youth of the country.
You will be glad to know that in this year, 1 lakh 31 thousand Financial Literacy Camps have been opened to bring together the banking sector, the economy and the lower middle class.
This belief has been created that the poorest of the poor can get money from a bank.
I once again express my gratitude to all those associated with it and also to those poor brothers and sisters who have opened their accounts in the bank.
This bank is yours, you will not leave it anymore.
I've given it to you, it's your responsibility to hold it.
We have to keep all accounts open in the bank.
I have full faith, you will keep it.
A few days ago, the violence in Gujarat had disturbed the entire country.
And it is natural that if something happens in the state of Gandhi and Sardar Patel then the whole country feels sad.
But in a short span of time, the poor citizens of Gujarat and my brothers and sisters have been taking care of the situation.
They have played an active role in preventing the situation from becoming unseasonal and Gujarat has again taken the path of peace.
It is this path of peace, unity and brotherhood that we should walk shoulder to shoulder to shoulder for the right path and for the betterment.
Prosperity is the solution to all our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet and listen to the insurgents of the Sufi clause.
I am telling you that this experience of listening to their great words has brought a musical experience in my ears.
The words of those pundits, the way they talk, that is, the tradition of peaceful liberality in the Sufi clause, have reached my perception as the rhythm of a music.
I liked it so much.
Perhaps this true form of Islam is now the most needed to reach the copper world.
I believe that this love and generosity of the Sufi tradition will reach far and wide so that the entire humanity and Islam can benefit.
I also tell others that we need to understand the sufficient belief in different communities.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider myself fortunate to receive this invitation.
Pundits of Buddhism from across the globe are coming to India to discuss various issues related to mankind across the globe.
I am glad that these scholars have invited me there too.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, had visited Buddha.
This is a moment of great pleasure for me to meet all these evils of the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to once again express my heartfelt condolences to you.
I have also spoken about this thing in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
You have heard this thing in the Parliament, in the public meeting or in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I have been saying this thing every time that the government's mindset remains open on the issue of disputes regarding land acquisition laws.
I have often said that I have agreed to take any suggestions for the welfare of the farmers.
But today I would like to tell the farmer brothers and sisters that the proposal to amend the Land Acquisition Act has come from the state.
But I have seen that there has been a lot of misunderstanding about this and the farmers are scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, our farmers will never misbelieve and they will never get scared.
I don't want anybody to misunderstand or scare the farmers.
Every claim of the country is important to me, but the claims of the farmers are the most important among them.
I've decided to let this expiry.
That is, the position before the formation of my government came back.
But one thing was incomplete.
There were 13 such things which were to be completed in a year and therefore we brought them in the Ordinance, but due to this debate, that too was incomplete.
We are a mantra for the welfare of the poor and the farmers in our villages.
Therefore, I had said on 15th August that not only the Agriculture Department but also the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department will be formed.
We are trying to transform this decision quickly.
My farmer brothers and sisters, there is no reason to be confused and there is no doubt.
Don't be afraid if anyone tries to scare you.
I've got one more thing to say.
Two days ago, the 150th anniversary of the 1955 war was completed.
Whenever there is talk of war in 1985, it is natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also natural to remember the Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Mantra.
It is also natural to remember the sacrifices made by those who laid down their lives for the pride and honour of Indias Tricoloured National Flag.
I salute all those associated with the 65th India Vijay, I salute the brave martyrs.
Such historical events inspire us.
I am glad that India is doing a great job in various fields of science.
Our scientists are really doing a great job.
I have seen how young scientists are talking with enthusiasm, I have dreamt of a new dream in their eyes.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said that our students should move towards science.
After this interaction with the scientists, I felt that there is a lot of opportunities in this field.
I am glad that in just fifteen days, the government has started working on this thing in a short span of time.
Instructions are being issued and it is expected that interviews for small jobs will be removed very soon.
Today, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
In order to reduce the deaths of mothers and children in particular, 24 countries of the world have come together to share their views on Indias Call to Action Plan.
This is the first time in any other country outside the USA.
It is true that even today, about 50,000 mothers and about 9 lakh children die every year during childbirth or after that.
It's too worrying and fearful.
Though there has been a lot of improvement in this regard, Indias appreciation has also started at the international level, yet this number is no less.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of death due to tetanus of mothers and children.
The world has recognized it.
But we still have to save our mothers and children.
Brothers and sisters, Dengue is getting news today.
It's right that dengue is dangerous, but it's easy to get rid of dengue.
It has a direct association with Swachh Bharat.
We're advertising on TV with dengue, advertising on news papers, but we don't care about it.
Cleaning the small things in the house, keeping the water clean.
People's education has started at a rapid pace, but we are not paying attention to it.
Sometimes I feel that we live in a very clean house, a very good arrangement, but I don't think that the water that is accumulated in my house, I invite you to Dengu.
I urge everyone not to let death come so easily.
Life is precious.
The indifference to dirty water around will be a cause of death, it's not right.
Approximately 514 centres across the country have access to dengue tests at nominal cost.
It is very important to check the death of the tested person while on time.
I wish you all the very best in this regard.
Cleanliness must be emphasized.
Now from Rakhibandhan to Deepawali, there will be several festivals across the country.
You will see that you will be able to observe this method of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to share a happy news.
I often say that we are not fortunate to donate our lives for our country but we are fortunate to save our country.
Two youngsters from my country, two brothers from Nasik, Maharashtra, Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan has a strong desire to serve the tribals of the country.
These two brothers have enhanced India's pride.
America has a bicycle race, Race Across America, which is very difficult.
I convey my best wishes, thanks and congratulations to these two brothers.
I am glad that these two brothers have succeeded in this campaign with the aim of Team India Vision for Tribals.
See how everybody is working at a personal level to take the country forward.
When I heard these things, my heart swells proudly.
Sometimes we become injustice to the new generation by following the old traditions.
The older generations are convinced that the new generations do not know anything, this idea has been going on for centuries.
I have met several youngsters who have laid down their lives on Sunday on Cycle.
Some people say that I celebrate a bike day a week.
It is also very useful for protecting my body and health and environment.
And I like to think about the young man I am.
Cycle is being run in many cities of our country and there is a lot of people who are encouraging us to ride a bike.
It is a good effort to protect the environment and improve health.
Today, when two youngsters of my country have raised the national flag in America, I am happy to mention the way the thoughts and thoughts of the youth of India are going on.
I would like to especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
The construction of the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar in the land of Indu Mill in Mumbai was stuck for a long time.
At the same time, we have bought the house of 10 King Henry Road in London where Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar used to live.
The Government of Maharashtra will build a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This place of London will be an inspiration for the Indians who roam around the world.
I compliment both the efforts of the Government of Maharashtra for honouring Babasaheb Ambedkar. I am proud of them.
It's good to start this year.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will be helped in harvesting crops.
And it is a pleasure to hear about this.
There is a huge shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
We need pulses for the poor, we need some oil to make swords for food.
I am glad that this time the amount of pulses has increased by almost 50 and oilseeds have increased by almost 33.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
Our country's soldiers are equally closely associated with the land of the farmers.
The Kargil war was not only on the borders of the country, but also on every city and every village of India.
This war was fought by all the mothers and sisters whose soldiers were fighting the enemies in Kargil.
Today, due to their sacrifice, India is able to talk to the world at a rapid pace.
I am glad that almost two crore people have seen the MyGov portal.
Why cant we save the persons with disabilities while booking the train tickets through the website of RCTC
Now it's very small, but it's never been thought of by the government or by any reason.
But brothers and sisters, the government has taken into consideration this idea of Akhilesh Vajpayee and today this system has been started for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today, the logo that is being created, the tag line is being created, the plan is being formulated, the policy is being formulated, the MyGov portal has positive opinions on all these things.
There is a feeling of a new transparent air in the governance system.
Feeling a new consciousness.
The MyGov portal has received several suggestions on what I should say on 15th August.
From Chennai, the supposed Raghavchari sent many opinions.
You can send it to MyGov portal, write letters in All India Radio and write letters in the office of the Prime Minister.
Look, I believe this is a good thing that on 15th August, I have received suggestions from the public for my speech.
I believe you must send good advice.
Just two days ago, I saw an accident in Delhi and after the accident, a scooter driver has been running for 10 minutes.
He didn't get any help
And when you look at the statistics, you feel painful.
There was an accident every minute in our country.
For accidents, one death occurred every 4 minutes for road accidents.
And most importantly, one-third of all the dead persons is a young man between the ages of 15 to 25 years and one death can destroy the entire family.
They will do whatever the administration should do, but I would like to request the parents, your children should be clever or four-huiler, all the efforts should be made on the side of the family for caution.
Sometimes I see it written behind Auto Ricksaw, "Papa hurry up and come back home".
And that is why I say that the government has taken several new initiatives in this regard - be it education on road safety or be it road construction technologies or be it administration or be it emergency medical care for those injured after the accident, we are introducing the Road Transport and Safety Bill.
In the coming days, I would like to think about taking some important steps in the direction of using the National Road Safety Policy and the Road Safety Action Plan.
I have also taken up another scheme which will cover all the highways of the country including Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangagram and Mondiar.
I would like to mention a cashless treatment system for the first fifty hours after the accident - whether the injured person has money or not, who will pay, who will not pay, how the injured person gets good health care and gets first aid.
I have arranged a toll-free number 1033, an ambulance to report the accident across the country but all this is the next step.
Sometimes I say that the employees are employed.
I would like to tell you that in the last few days, some incidents have come to my notice and I like them.
Vijay Vishwaal showed how his own interest, his industry and his capabilities could be linked to his work.
There will definitely be discussions and discussions on the pictures of Vijay Vishwaal in the coming days.
I am reminded that the entire team of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has started such work in the entire district which touched my heart and I liked their work.
And they have taken the responsibility of providing toilets to their sisters during the Rakhibandhan festival so that mothers and sisters of the entire district dont have to go for toilets in the open.
I came to know about this kind of news that I want to share with you.
There is a small village named Keshla in Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh.
The people of this village have been campaigning for toilet construction for the last few months.
Now no person in this village has to do toilets in the open space.
After the completion of toilets, the people of the entire village celebrated a big festival on this occasion.
This is an example of how the values of the society are changing, the mental needs of the people are changing, how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I have been told about the North-Eastern India that however, the people of North-East are very active in their work.
They keep writing a lot - it's a good thing.
Today, I am happy to tell them that there is a separate ministry for Northeast India.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was the Prime Minister, a separate ministry was formed by the Development of North East Region (DO-N-E-R).
After the formation of our government, our Donor Department took an important decision that the development of North-Eastern India cannot be possible by sitting in Delhi.
Together, it was decided that a team of officials from the Government of India will visit the states of North-Eastern India such as Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim etc. and will be camping for seven days.
The effort to move from Delhi to the East, which I call Act East Policy, needs to be taken forward.
My dear countrymen, we are happy to be successful in the Merce Mission and we are proud of it.
In the last few days, India has successfully launched five satellites of PSLV-C28 in the United Kingdom.
All this news comes for a few moments and goes away.
We don't remember these usually.
But sometimes I think that today when we talk to the younger generation and want to know what they want to be in the future, one-sixth of the 100 students are found who said, I want to be a scientist.
Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India has launched a National Intellectual Exploration Mission (NIIS) to explore new talent.
Now we have to go to another village to charge mobile phones.
All the facilities available in the city should also be available in the villages.
That is why we have started Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Programme.
But we have to do more for the poor.
We'll finish it.
I've started it, I'll finish it.
On the one hand, the month of August-September is celebrated in our country.
A lot of festivals are also celebrated.
My best wishes to all of you.
You must send your suggestions for August 15th.
Your suggestions will help me a lot.
Thank you very much
When I told you, I didn't think I'd get such a remarkable response.
Millions of people posted photos on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
I have seen a photo of how many diversities India has - architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, sea.
I believe that the government of India has not even thought about it for tourism.
I liked some more pictures that I re-touched.
I believe that if we did not post the photo post of the Belum cave in Andhra Pradesh, we might not have known the locations that were hidden in our country.
But the sight that we saw on 21st June is very strange, I believe that there was no country in the world where the sun rays reached, where the sun was not welcomed by Yoga exercises.
I can assert that the sun does not set in the world of Yoga.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that the way people of the world have respected and sacrificed Yoga.
I am also very happy.
My heart is filled with happiness, the Sin River and the Eiffel Tower are a symbol of pride for the people of France, and they like that place for Yoga and have also given equal respect to Yoga.
People have practiced Yoga at the Times Square in New York.
When Sydney comes to Australia, the pictures of the Opera House swell in front of the eye.
Australian citizens have practiced Yoga at the Opera House, have shown Yoga the same respect as the Opera House.
Be it North America or Silicon Valley or Dumo Cathedral in Milan, Yoga has made us proud everywhere.
On June 21, when Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, performed Yoga at the headquarters of the United Nations, I was delighted.
Similarly, members of the UN Peacekeeping Forces have performed very well.
In Siachen, our army has deployed white ice sheets in India, wherever our navy was in the sea, they have participated in Yoga programmes.
In Delhi, Yoga has been ranked as the Guinnessbook of World Records.
It seemed that everywhere in the world a new question - a new joy, a new zeal, a new spirit is emerging.
A few days ago, when I visited a photo of the young children of Vietnam's family on Twitter, it was so beautiful that it was appreciated all over the world.
Female and female, adolescents, villages, cities, developed or developing countries have been associated with Yoga.
Yoga has truly bound the whole world together.
I don't know how the wise and the wise will see this thing but I feel one thing, every Indian can proud that the whole world is keen to know India.
Everyone's interest in knowing India has increased.
The world wants to know India's values, traditions and heritage.
Our responsibility is not to preserve this legacy but to distribute it among all.
We can do this if we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so familiar that we do not see any innovation in them like our family values, we do not know that our family values are important for the people of the world.
Why shouldn't we introduce our family traditions and values to the world
I believe that the world will be surprised - my firm belief will be surprised - there are many such topics which the ancestors have given us, which the world claims.
The success, joy and satisfaction of International Yoga Day has brought a new responsibility.
It is our responsibility to provide good Yoga to the world.
I believe that you can create a database on where Yoga will be taught and where Yoga teachers will be found.
I have seen the events of the past in a different way, the government is working, the government is working very actively, if the goal is fixed then we have seen the results of this thing.
When there was despair around us, as we used to hear a year ago, nothing would happen- nothing would happen- nothing would happen.
Ayush is a department of the government.
Nobody gave any importance to this.
But on the occasion of Yoga Day, this small section, which is located in one corner of the country, has led and organized such a massive event all over the world.
If the goal is fixed then small departments can do good work, it is a sample of that.
A few days ago, the world saw how our people protected people from Yemen.
Within a few hours, Indians have moved ahead to help Nepal.
If the government is active then the employees of all the banks have come forward to open Jan Dhan accounts in the bank and within a few days crores of people of the country are connected to the bank.
On 15th August, I had requested all the schools in the Red Fort to construct toilets and said that we will have to complete this work by 15th August.
It was a brave task to urge them to complete the work that was not done in sixty years.
That is, the government, the common man, the government employees all want to work for the country.
Last month, I started three public safety schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined the Jan Suraksha Yojana, although we have to take this project forward.
Festival of Rakshabandhan is coming in August.
Can we together create a strong Jan Andolan before this festival and facilitate the mothers and sisters of our country's Jan Arogya Yojana
On Rakhibandhan, this may be a great gift to sister on behalf of her brother.
When I come to Mann Ki Baat programme, many people send me suggestions.
Many people have suggested that I should talk about rain.
From Nagpur to Yogesh Dandekar, from Mysore to Harsh Vardhan Mahasay, Praveen Nadkarni Mahasay, Divya Jansu Gupta Mahasay, everyone told me to talk about rain in Mann Ki Baat.
This season gives a lot of pleasure to the mind.
People of any age want to enjoy the first rain water.
You must be enjoying the warmth of tea with hot pakora, bhajabhuji and bhutta in this rainy season.
As the sun rays give us energy, the rains give us strength.
Drop water is also very valuable.
As citizens, we have to develop a habit of saving the water from the bottom of the pit.
We should make a solemn pledge that the water of the village will remain in the village, the water of the city should be in the city.
Ren water harvesting is not a new thing for centuries.
Check dams, watershed development, small ponds, small field reservoirs, no matter what.
The Porbandar was on the shores of the sea, so rainwater was collected for sweet water and kept at home.
At that time, such efforts were made to conserve rain water.
We can do the same.
And I would like to give a suggestion from my experience of direct and successful conduct.
It's a village technician.
When you plant trees then place an old soil urn near the tree and fill it with water.
Filling water once or twice a month.
You will see that this tree will grow very fast and become very strong.
I would also like to tell the farmers that you should plant trees without roaming around your fields.
And we also know that in the rainy season, there is an increase in the number of diseases.
Increasing humidity in the weather, bacteria become active.
Therefore, cleanliness is very important at this time.
You should drink pure drinking water at this time.
It's true that the more careful we are, the longer the disease remains.
I want water, I want rain, but at the same time I want to prevent diseases.
My countrymen, we have recently started three new projects, especially for the citizens of the city.
There are at least five hundred small towns in our country.
We have to take this effort forward.
And I want to stay in this house for electricity, drinking water, toilets and schools for children to study.
When India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022 then we want to give our homes to every countrymen.
I am connected with all of you through social media.
I get new ideas, suggestions and suggestions from you people, I also get good ideas about the government's work.
But when this government scheme becomes its own scheme for the individuals, the society or the village, then how much increases its strength.
On the last day, Shriman Sunil Jaglan Mahashay, a Panchayat chief of Bibipur village in Haryana, had made a funny attempt.
And this creates an environment where every father takes selfie with his daughter and posts in social media.
The number of sands is much lower than the boys in Harian.
There are about 100 districts in the country where such a situation is very worrying.
The worst situation in Haryana.
And that is why I request you all to join your daughters in Selfie with Daughter.
Besides, to strengthen the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, write taglines, write beautiful taglines, it can happen in any language, English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any other language.
The tag line that will be inspiring, I will reiterate your selfie with your daughter.
In a similar way, we can transform this Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme into a mass movement.
Make our country ruined.
I am telling you from my experience that you should take this effort forward.
Make this a part of your life.
And one more thing - Incredible India - wherever you go, you must send a picture of it.
Our country will be able to know the diversity of our country.
I feel that the pictures related to handicrafts that you are sending are very rare.
You can also post pictures of handicrafts in your area in Incredible India.
There are several things that are being created in your city - the poor people also manufacture things.
And we have a simple medium that we can reach.
My dear countrymen, this is the case today.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be held again.
Some people sometimes feel that in Mann Ki Baat, I have announced a big scheme of the government but not that.
I'm working day and night.
Through this programme, I am talking to you lightly and lightly.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
Just imagine what's going on in the middle of this.
When I used to talk about Mann Ki Baat, I used to say that the words were mine, the voice of the throat was mine, but the words were mortal, you people were marvellous, you people were marvellous.
But I've waited a long time on Sunday.
Well, there's a chance.
In a household environment, Mann Ki Baat i. e.
My silent interactions with you people have been a part of this spiritual journey.
Some people asked me why did I go to Kedarnath during the polls.
You have the right and I can understand your curiosity.
I also feel that I will ever tell you about the situation of my time.
But today I believe that if I talk about those things then the form of Mann Ki Baat will change.
Voting is busy, guesses of defeat and polling remains when I got out.
Most people have discovered this politically.
But for me this was an opportunity to meet myself.
I could tell you I was going to meet with me.
I don't know when I can tell you, but I'll tell you because you have the right to me.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I have always felt a positive power in your endeavour.
Sometimes some of your words make my thoughts sharper.
He also spoke of the challenges faced by the people in the country and the society, and reiterated the need for an immediate solution.
I have noticed that there is a problem in the letter but there is also a specialty that some solutions, some suggestions, some imaginations are given directly or indirectly.
He expressed his anguish over cleanliness and welcomed this effort towards cleanliness.
When someone talks about the environment, he feels embarrassed about pollution and he also spoke of his own efforts.
He also spoke of the ways that are being adopted, and the imagination that he imagined in his mind is to prevent environmental pollution.
It means that the solution of the problem should be a glimpse of how it can be done with the entire society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror to the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of inner strength, capability and talent among the countrymen.
It is only necessary that the power and talent should be guided in the right direction, that they should be utilised.
Mann Ki Baat also says that the country will have to connect the power and activity of the 130 crore people.
I would like to mention another thing that Mann Ki Baat has a lot of letters, a lot of phone calls, a lot of messages, a lot of complaints are received, but there are very few complaints.
You can imagine that somebody is writing letters to the Prime Minister of India but doesn't he want anything for himself
This is an example of the high thinking of millions of people in the country.
My heart is full of happiness today.
And that is why I have easily announced in Mann Ki Baat that after a few months I will return to you again.
Keeping this in mind, let us move ahead with the stability of Mann Ki Baat.
When emergency took place in the country, the movement against it was not limited to political circles, political leaders or prisons.
I don't feel hungry when we eat dinner.
Similarly, the importance of democracy in day to day life is felt only when that right is suppressed.
And this is not because the Constitution of India took such steps that led to the rise of democracy.
The Constitution and the Legal Rules are required to drive the society system smoothly.
And that is why the country dedicated itself to the entire election, not for itself but for the protection of democracy.
Recently, the Great Democracy, the Great Elections have been conducted in our country, where the poorest of the poor, all of them have joined this campaign in their own right to decide the future of the country.
When something is very close to us, we cannot realize its importance
More than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India, Sixty One Crore
The number may seem to be very small, but if we look at the entire world then I would say that more people have voted in India than in any country in the world without a single china.
The number of people who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than double the total population of America.
The total number of electors in India is more than the population of Europe.
These are the hallmarks of the vastness and magnitude of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha Election is the largest democratic election ever held in history.
You can imagine what kind of events and human resources are required to complete this process.
This election has been possible due to the hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and staff.
On the one hand, nearly three lakh security personnel of the Paramilitary Forces have discharged their responsibilities to fulfil this magnificence of democracy, while twenty lakh police personnel of various States have worked tirelessly.
As a result of these hard work, this time the polling was more than the last election.
More than 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines are being arranged in this election process.
In order to ensure that no one is deprived of the right to vote.
Polling stations have been set up for only one female electorate in a remote place in Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the Election Commission officials had to travel in that place for two days.
This is the true honor of democracy.
The highest polling station in the world is also in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
There is one more information that we can take pride in.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women also voted enthusiastically like men.
The number of male and female electors is almost equal in this election.
One more inspirational fact is that there are 78 women Parliamentarians in the Parliament, which is a record.
I congratulate the Election Commission of India and everyone associated with the electoral process and salute the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, sometimes you would have heard me not "Bouquet" but "Book".
My wish was to give a book instead of a flower to appease the habitual
Another story that deepens my heart is Idgah.
The story is a boy's compassion, a pure love for his sister.
When the four-five-year-old Hamid takes a pinch from the fair to his sister-in-law, it appears that the love and compassion of mankind can be unprecedented.
The last line of this story is an unprecedented truth in our thoughts and teachings. "Christian Hamid played the role of old humids.
A very heart-wrenching story like this is Pus Ky Rat.
This story shows a reflection of the life of a poor farmer.
The farmers are very happy even after their crops have been wasted because they do not have to sleep in the cold fields of winter.
Though these stories are almost centuries old, yet their relevance still remains the same.
After reading the story, I have a different feeling.
When books are about to be read, I read about Kerala's letter library in one of the media.
You will be surprised to know that the library is located in a village in the deep forest of Idukki.
A primary school teacher, P.
V. Chinnathampi worked extraordinary for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by pushing them on their backs.
Today, this library is showing a new dimension along with tribal children.
Gujarat's 'Wangch Gujarat' campaign is a successful initiative.
Millions of people of all age groups participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, in the times of the Guru, I would like to urge you all to take some time out and place books in your daily routine.
You will really be very happy and you must write on the NarendraModiApp in whichever book you read so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat are aware of it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of my country are thinking about all those things which are not just present but also a big challenge for the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModiApp and MyGov, I noticed that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Belgavir Pawan Gaurai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related issues.
Water has a huge impact on our culture.
It has been said about the water in the suktam of Rikveda that Apo Hishtha Mao Bhubah Vishtha Na Urje Datta, Chakshey Yo Bah Shivatmo Rasa in Ranne, Tatya Bhajayteh Nah Ushtiriva Matar.
Due to lack of water, many parts of the country are getting damaged every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water received from rainy season in a year is being saved in our country.
Only 8 percent.
But now it's time to solve this problem.
I believe that we will find solutions to this problem with the help of other problems, with the help of public participation, with the strength of the people, with the capabilities, cooperation and resolve of 130 crore people.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country keeping in mind the importance of water.
This will facilitate quick decision making of all water related matters.
A few days ago, I tried to innovate something different.
I wrote letters to all the village heads of the country.
I had written to the village heads to save water, to save water, to save every drop of rain, to hold a Gram Sabha meeting, to sit with the villagers and to give a befitting reply.
I am glad that they have shown full enthusiasm in this thing and on 22nd May crores of people have laboured in thousands of Panchayats.
People have resolved to save one drop of water in the village.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you about a Gram Panchayat.
My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas, when the Prime Minister wrote a letter to us to save water, we did not believe that the Prime Minister had written a letter to us.
Once again, the people there are ready to play an active role in water conservation.
On behalf of me, I convey my best wishes to all the village heads, to all the panchayat chiefs and their activeness.
There are several Panchayat Pradhans across the country who have worked towards water conservation.
What I said, it is possible to achieve a positive outcome in everyone's efforts.
But everyone's goal is to save water, water conservation.
The work on water drainage is underway in Punjab.
This has prevented the problem of water accumulation.
The construction of a reservoir at Thimaipalli in Telangana is transforming the lives of the people of the village.
A major change has been brought about due to the construction of small ponds built in the fields in the poet's poetry in Rajasthan.
I was reading a public effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women had come together to resurrect the river.
I was also reading about those women of Gadhwal who have been working very well to keep the rain water smoothly.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I have made three requests for the countrymen.
My first request is that just as the people of the country had transformed cleanliness into a mass movement, let us start a mass movement for water conservation.
Together we resolve to save every drop of water, I believe that water is a prasad from Parameswar, water is a pilgrimage.
Let us begin an awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Be it the world of cinema or be it the world of sports or be it media friends or be it the people associated with social organisations or be it the artists of cultural organisations or be it the artists of communication or be it the leadership of this movement through their own methods.
Awakening the society, connecting everyone and binding together.
You see, we will see changes in front of our eyes.
Let us draw a list of water conservation methods and inspire people to conserve water.
You can share your content with Hashtag Janshakti4jalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I thank you and all the people of the world for one more thing.
Just like on 21st June, once again on the occasion of Yoga Day, three or four generations of each family have come together to celebrate Yoga Day.
The importance of Yoga Day is on the rise in awareness about Holistic Health Care.
If every corner of the world welcomes a lovely sun with sunrise then its entire journey ends with the sunset.
The Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities and people from all over the world have shown me how they have celebrated Yoga Day in their own country.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that in order to build a healthy society, a healthy and sensitive person is required, Yoga ensures that.
Therefore, the promotion and promotion of Yoga is an integral part of social service.
Prim Ministers Awards were announced in 2019 for their contribution in the promotion and development of Yoga, which is a good news to me.
This award has been given to those organizations of the world who have played a key role in the promotion and promotion of Yoga.
Like Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga very popular in Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan undertakes many institutions and training courses.
And can Indians remain behind where it is related to Yoga
Yoga Vidyalayas in Munger, Bihar, have been honoured for the past few decades.
Likewise, Swami Rajarshi Munich has also been honoured who has established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Honouring the glorious celebrations of Yoga and the homely message of Yoga, these two distinctions have added to the Yoga Day.
My dear countrymen, today our journey is awaiting your thoughts, feelings, new resolutions and new energy.
You can connect yourselves with your thoughts, it is important for me that Mann Ki Baat is exactly the same.
May your blessings be with me.
You are my inspiration, my strength.
Let us all sit together and listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme and perform all the responsibilities of life.
In the coming month, Mann Ki Baat will again be a part of your conversation.
Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, my heart is filled with the spirit of Mann Ki Baat.
Ten days ago, Mother India lost her brave sons.
To combat this challenge before the country, we all have to forget the differences between casteism, communalism, regionalism and the rest so that we can take stronger, stronger and effective steps against terrorism.
Our armed forces introduce immense courage.
You have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of terrorism.
The Army has taken a vow to freely destroy the terrorists and their alcoholists.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, an inspiring message came to the fore through the media, which inspires the people of the country with immense courage, zeal and energy.
Ramnanjan ji, the father of Shahid Ratna Thakur, in Bhagalpur, Bihar, has also given us the inspiration to commit ourselves to this sad hour.
He said that his other son will also be sent to fight against the enemies of the country and if necessary, he will also be present on the battlefield.
The entire nation salutes the indomitable courage of Manipuri wife Prasanna Sahur, the martyr of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He resolved to join his only son in the CRPF.
When the body of the martyr Vijay Soren, who was buried in the National Flag, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his younger son used to say that he too would join the army.
With the encouragement of this innocent child, this determination and idea is reflected in the thoughts of the young children of India.
My dear countrymen, all of us have been waiting for the War Memorial in such a long time since independence.
It is very natural for the countrymen to have a lot of questions and discourses in this regard.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on the App, expressed his happiness at the creation of the National War Memorial at Odupi, Karnataka.
I was surprised to know that there was no National War Memorial in India.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bhai, was born on February 29, 2019.
You all are aware that this special day comes once in four years.
In a simple, peaceful personality, Balyan Morarji Bhai was one of the most dedicated leaders of this country.
In our independent India, the record of presenting the most budget in Parliament is in the name of Morarji Bhai Desai.
In those difficult times, Morarji gave India the right leadership when democracy was in a critical condition.
Morarji Bhai had dedicated himself to the movement against the situation of the country in order to protect this democracy.
And for this, he had to pay a lot of money even after coming to Buddha.
The then government arrested him and imprisoned him.
But when the Janta Party won in 1987, he became our Prime Minister.
The 44th Amendment to the Constitution was proposed during his tenure as Prime Minister.
This is the reason why the 42nd Amendment to the Emergency was proposed where the power of the Supreme Court was ruined and some other proposals were made so that our democratic values could not be ruined and sent back.
As a result of the 44th Amendment Resolution, all the functions of the Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies were reported in the newspapers.
The Amendment proposes that the fundamental rights of the citizens should not be abolished in any way due to "employment status" in accordance with Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, just like every year, people were very curious about the Padma awards.
I want to tell you about some of these people today.
Recognizing the importance of Abdul Ghafoor Khatdi ji in Gujarat, he has done wonderful work to revive Kutch's traditional pathogen art.
He has done a wonderful job in bringing this rare industry to the new generation.
I gave the gift of 'Tree of Life' made by Abdul Ghafoor to former US President Barack Obama.
Among the awardees, Sabbir Sayeed of Marathwada is known as the Sevak of Gomata.
The way he dedicated his entire life to the service of cow slaughter, he added.
Madurai Chinna Pillai, the distinguished person who tried to strengthen and self-reliant the exploited and exploited through the Kalanjiyam movement in Tamil Nadu.
At the age of 100, he has trained people from all over the world in Yoga and till now he has produced 1500 Yoga teachers.
Yamuna Tudu, famously known as the Lady Tarzan of Jharkhand, has been brave enough to deal with planting mafia and maps. He has not only saved 50 hectares of jungle flying, but has also sent tens of thousands of women to protect trees and wildlife.
As a result of this hard work of Yamuna Ji, today the people of the village do 18 at the time of birth of every child and plant 10 trees at the time of marriage of every girl child.
He dedicated himself to the cause of self-reliance and self-reliance of visually impaired children by creating an organisation called 'Chokhi Mahila Sevakunj'.
In fact, he has done experimentation with farmers and my dear countrymen, this is the first time that there are 12 farmers among those who have been awarded the Padma awards this year.
Normally, very few people associated with the agriculture sector and those who directly belong to the farmers are listed among the 'Pamshree' beneficiaries.
And this is the living picture of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to share a heart-wrenching experience with all of you.
Today, I want to meet the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana PM-JYA and PM-JAY everywhere in the country.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, nearly 12 lakh poor families have taken the opportunity of this scheme.
I understand how big a change has been brought about in the lives of the poor.
If you people are familiar with the poor, those who cannot afford to get the treatment, they should know about this scheme.
These schemes have been launched for the benefit of the poor.
My dear brothers and sisters, there is going to be a school examination.
Preparations will be made for the examinations of the 10th and 12th grade boards across the country.
My best wishes to the test takers, their parents and teachers.
A few days ago, a massive event was organized at Town Hall Format in the Pariksha Pe Charcha program in Delhi.
I extend my best wishes to all the students, their teachers, parents, YouTube for the recording of this programme.
My dear countrymen, India will be talking about and its worship will not happen.
Perhaps, there is no longer a day in our country since there is no festival or pride, because we have thousands of years old traditions.
And within a few days, the Mahashivaratri is coming and this time Shivratri has fallen on Monday and when Shivratri falls together, our hearts are filled with a sacred feeling and devotion.
I have to acknowledge that I have been impressed with the power of Divyangjan.
My dear countrymen, connecting with you all through Mann Ki Baat programme is a unique experience for me.
I face millions of families every month through radio.
Sometimes, when I read your letters, talk to you people or listen to your suggestions and suggestions, I feel that you have taken one family from your family.
It's a pleasure for me.
Friends, Elections are the biggest festivals of democracy.
We will be busy with the elections for the next two months.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
He had spent his entire life in the field of food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
Organized by the Siddhaganga Construction, the cattle and agro-cultural units.
I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to a great man.
But today I'm gonna tell you something else.
Imagine, just for one Voter.
If you don't lose yourself for some reason, you're gonna have to suffer.
I am aware of the enrollment of electoral rolls and the day-long electoral rolls in the Amrus Bimele, as per the request of countless persons of the country.
My belief is that our democracy will be strengthened in terms of enrolment and inclusiveness of the youth and individuals.
This is where the British rulers described the birth anniversary of Mother India, Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Guru Bax Singh and the Major General Shahan.
When I looked at the stories related to the Mandir Neta ji at the Red Fort, the members of Netaji's family gave me a special gift.
Once Netaji used it.
I have arranged for the museum so that people can look at it and inspire the nation.
Our heroes are brave, patriotic stories are beneficial for our younger generations.
A few months ago on 30th September, I had visited Andaman Nicobar Islands.
But it was the 75-year-old event of the Azad Hind Government.
Dillichlo, Your Excellency, I am your Freedom Freedom Fund.
Several years ago, a couple of years ago would have to make all the files related to Netaji.
I'm glad we've done this kind of thing.
I believe that the day when Netaji had come to the Prime Minister's residence instead of his family.
I am told that Radio Station Weekly Writing English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Pusti, Urdu etc.
Business was the most important territory.
The museum is the historical exhibition and there is more than 450 old-generation painting art work protected.
It showcases excellent artwork among great artists like Amritshergil, Rajarabiburma, Avnindranath Thakur, Gagan Athakur, Nandlal Bose, Jaminira and Shailja Mukherjee.
He made a lot of painting.
He drew up the birds, discovered many natural beauty, and drew the human character-canvass-effectiveness in the medium of arts.
And it is surprising that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore did not recognise any part of this art gallery.
He didn't think he was painting. He didn't think he was supposed to be surprising.
Orpainting has also been exhibited in various countries, Russia and the United States.
I hope you will see the painting requirements of the temple.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of the saints.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at a function in New Delhi.
It was like this that Santaravidas.
The 19th February vision of Birthday.
Last 24-September, our sons have been launching 'Kalam-Sat'.
Orissa University has also exhibited sounding rockets.
Since independence, there has been an epidemic of 2014, and almost four years since independence.
We have established the world card in a single satellite mission with 104 satellites.
We are soon administering cross-border India through Chandrayaan-2.
Housing for All in this vision, Geo-Tagger has been made available to over 40 lakh households in the State.
At the same time, Geo-Tagger has been created in the country under the guidance of MNREGA.
Our satellites symbolize the power of our nation.
We are also extending our engagement with many countries across the world.
South Asiasatellites is another entrepreneurship that has promoted our neighbours.
Why are all the cars in the Kharshed area
Normally a body doesn't excite people at all, even then he has taken over the hellfire and he has shown his talent.
Asansolanians 10 years old Abhinavashakhelo in India Youth Games is the best winner.
Akshata Baswani has emerged as the golden silver jubilee of Kamti for a single farmer family in Karnataka.
When I talk about the philosophy of 'New India' then this is the resolution of 'Yuva Shakti'.
These stories of sports are authenticated not only by the people of India, but also by the small towns, by the floods, by the villages, by the Assamese, by the youth and by the youth.
My little friends, they're getting up on the test day.
Anshul Sharmamygov has written to Himachal Pradesh, I will have to say something to all those exams and their candidates.
Bhagalji, thank you very much for this.
Yeah, some familiars have the right to examine.
Children, their parents, teachers, teachers, everybody in the field of examination is extremely sad.
I convey my best wishes to every learner, to their parents and teachers.
I would like to tell you about this in today's Mann Ki Baat programme, but you will be happy to know that in the year 2029-September 11-2019, I will talk to the candidates of the country about Pariksha Pe Charcha.
I would like to tell you a lot about my young friends in the field of examinations, especially in the field of stress free exams.
In this regard, I was convinced by the opinions of the people and the opinion of Mygov in this regard is very good.
Wherever we go, we must pay homage to the martyrs every two minutes.
We will continue to remind ourselves of the revered Bapus reverence, the creation of New India, and the observance of Citizenship.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
We're entering 2019.

The Para-Asian outcome is also very good.
If I continue to talk about the success of every Indian and our comprehensive efforts, then the Mann Ki Baat programme will be so long that it will start in 2019.
All this has been possible due to the indomitable efforts of 130 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, we have lost some of the best countrymen in December this year.
On 19th December, Chennai, Dr. Jaya Chandran lost his life.
Narasamma was a helpful mother-sister-in-law.
He has served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
He was awarded the Padma Shri earlier this year.
Dr. Jaya Chandran and Sulagitti Narasamma have many illustrated personalities who have spent their lives for the betterment of the society.
When I talk about healthcare, I would like to mention the social efforts of the doctors in the business of Uttar Pradesh.
Just a few days ago, some of my party officials told me that some young doctors in the city are treating the poor free of cost.
Now hundreds of poor people are benefiting from this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctors and friends engaged in selfless service is really commendable.
Today, I can say with pride that our collective efforts have made the Swachh Bharat Mission a successful mission.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, more than 3 lakh people were associated with the cleanliness drive in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
In this magnificence of Swachhata, cities, voluntary organisations, school-children, and the masses of Jabalpur participated with enthusiasm.
This is where I can learn about Dr. Jaya Chandran.
Whenever it comes to time, I go to The Batter India.com website and try to find out about such incentives.
I am glad that today there are several such websites that introduce us to the life story of inspirational people.
You can easily learn Sanskrit through SanskritBharti Dot Inn.
I believe that many people will be able to know about these heroes who are transforming society.
It is very easy to spread negativeness but surrounding us, there is a lot of good work being done in our society and this is possible due to the combined efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports has a different significance in all societies.
Whenever a game happens, the audience also gets enthusiastic.
I would like to mention that Hannaya Nisa, a daughter of Kashmir, has won a gold medal at the Carette Championship in Korea.
The twelfth year Hannaya lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
I wish all the countrymen a bright future.
Many congratulations and blessings for Hannai.
Similarly, a lot of discussions are going on in the media about the sixteen daughters and sixteen daughters.
You must have read.
Gold in Junior Boxing Championships for Rajini Girls
He did something in honor of his father Jasmer Singh who sold luxury at a waterway shop.
Rajni said she had to admit her father a lot of sacrifice and suffering to reach this place.
Jasmer Singh, every morning, went out to work before Rajni and his brothers and sisters got up.
When Rajni expressed his desire to learn boxing to his father, he tried his best to enhance his enthusiasm and fulfil his dream.
Rajni Boxing practices started with old gloves, because the financial condition of his family was not good at that time.
Despite all adversities, Rajni did not lose courage and continued to teach boxing.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
As I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajni, I congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh and Usharani for their presence and encouragement.
This month, the twenty-year-old Bedangi Kulkarni of Pune has made the world proud to be the fastest Asian in the world.
He had cycled about 300 km per day for 159 days.
Imagine, 300 kilometers of cycling every day
His indomitable enthusiasm for cycling is really commendable.
Adversity never gets interrupted.
When we hear about such other examples, we also get inspiration from every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, several festivals are being celebrated in January with enthusiasm and joy like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magha Bihu, Maghi etc.
In all these festivals, the whole of India will see the colour of traditional dances and iron ore, somewhere colourful knives flying in the sky, somewhere they will sit somewhere.
Sports will be organised somewhere and sweets will be celebrated somewhere.
All these festivals are celebrated in different ways, in different ways, with the objective of observing festivals, which are somehow associated with agriculture and rural life.
This is the time when the sun rises and the sun enters the moon.
Since then, the day begins to grow gradually and winter crops begin to grow.
On this occasion, my best wishes to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
The spirit of unity between diversity and 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat' lies in the glorious festival of this idea.
We can see how these festivals are connected with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not seen separately, individuals and communities are united.
Another beautiful example of our devotion to nature is the festival-based calendar.
The calendars also contain details of planetary content throughout the year.
These traditional calendars show how ancient our relationship with natural and geographical events is.
Based on the speed of the moon and the sun, the lunar calendar sets the end of festivals and festivals.
It depends on who follows a calendar.
Festivals are scheduled to be held at many places on the planet's location.
The festivals like Gudi Padwa, Cheti Chand, Ugadi are celebrated in accordance with the lunar calendars like Tamil Puthandu and Vishu, Vaishakh, Vaishakhi, Paula Vaishakh, Bihu etc.
Many of us are also involved in protecting rivers and water in the mountains.
Chhota Parbati River and the pond are associated with the sun worship.
Millions of people take bath in the holy rivers in Makar Sankranti.
Our festivals also teach social values.
On the one hand, as they have a mythological significance, on the other hand, these festivals inspire and teach each other to develop brotherhood with ease in life.
I wish you all the very best in 2019 and wish you all the very best in enjoying these festivals.
Let us share the photos on this festival with all of you so that we can see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot in our culture that we can take pride in and we can showcase the entire world with our heads.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
Several films also showcase the richness and heritage of the fair, and they are true, the vastness of the Kumbh is as important as that of the heritage.
People from all over the country and the world come to participate in Kumbh.
The Kumbh Mela is witness to the gathering of faith and reverence.
Millions and millions of people from India and abroad are coming together at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has been nurtured and nurtured by our great cultural heritage.
Saints and souls have started reaching the Kumbh Mela from now on.
Last year, UNESCO has listed Kumbh Mela on Intensive Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, Ambassador of many countries had seen the preparations for the Kumbh.
The National Flag was unveiled simultaneously.
More than 150 countries are expected to attend the Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj.
This can be a major learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh are underway.
The people of Prayagraj are also enthusiastic about the Kumbh.
This time there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in the Kumbh.
This symbol of the faith of the people was shut down in the fort for thousands of years so that the devotees could not see it even if they wanted.
Now the AkshayBott door has been opened for everyone.
My appeal to you all is that when you visit Kumbh, you must share the different features and pictures of Kumbh in the social media so that more and more people get inspired to visit Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of spirituality be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith be the Mahakumbh of patriotism and national integration.
My dear countrymen, the countrymen are very keen to celebrate Republic Day on 26th January and on that day we remember those great men who gave us our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th Birth Anniversary of the revered Bapu.
It is a privilege for us that the President of South Africa, Mr. Siriel Ramaphosa, is coming to India as the Chief Guest for Republic Day.
Revered Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable bond.
South Africa is the place where Mohan had become Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started the first Satyagraha and stood up against casteism.
He had established Phoenix and Tolstoy Farm, from where the voices of peace and stability were raised all over the world.
He had gained strength and inspiration from revered Bapu for so many years in prison
Mandela had said, "Spirit is an integral part of our history because it is here that he used himself for the first time on the path of truth.
There is a detailed discussion on how steps are needed to strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
At this conference, I have announced the introduction of the Sardar Patel Award for National Integration which will be given to those who have contributed somehow towards national unity.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his life for the unity of the country.
He has worked for the rest of his life to keep India's integrity intact.
He said the unity of the country lies in the diversity of the country.
I would like to pay homage to Sardar Patel through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh will be on 13th January.
Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patan.
He gave up his last breath at Nanded in Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and the last time of life in Nanded.
In a way, the whole of India has got his blessings.
According to Guru Gobind Singh, it is the biggest service to alleviate the grief of the people.
He was blessed with valour, valour, sacrifice and philosophy.
He had an extraordinary knowledge of weapons and science.
On the one hand, he was an archer, on the other hand, a masterpiece, Braj Bhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi, etc.
I once again salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are some good things happening in the country that are not widely practiced.
Celebrations of 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi are being organized across the country.
Efforts to build safe and healthy food habits.
Swasth Bharat Yatra is being organised across the country as part of the Eat Right India campaign.
The expedition will continue till 27th January 2019.
India will be prosperous only when it becomes clean and healthy.
Nutritious diet is needed for good health.
Whether individual life or national life or social life, inspiration is the source of progress.
Come, let us move ahead with innovative inspiration, innovative zeal, innovative resolve, innovative goals, innovative goals and innovative goals.
Mann Ki Baat November, 2019
The 50th edition of Mann Ki Baat was completed today.
Golden Jubilee Episode Golden Episode.
This time most of the letters and phone calls have been mentioned in the 50th edition.
Through the MyGov App, the Partners of Delhi, Kamalkumar from Patna, Vikas Yadav from Patna and Manika Jain from Delhi on the Narendra Modi App, Government of West Bengal, Sangeeta Shastri from Nagpur have raised almost a number of questions.
This question is very natural.
In today's era, when people had almost forgotten the radio, why did Modi bring back the radio
Now the shopkeeper says, listen to this fucking radio.
I heard on the radio, that bomb exploding is going on.
The shopkeeper said that the Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, on the radio said that the historical significance of the Nuclear Bomb Examination was to break the bomb.
I was wondering if the shopkeeper's gentlemen were glad to see the dance, people were listening to the radio all day in his shops in this area, in the snowy mountainous region, in the middle of the forest.
I am thinking of the Radio Communication Reach and its far-reaching impact.
After that, when I became the Prime Minister, I would like to seek the most powerful connectivity.
Since the month of May 2014, when I started assuming the office of the Chief Servant, I felt that our country's unity, our glorious history, valour, diversity, cultural diversity, people's work, men's emotions, sacrifices, penance and penance should be spread across the country.
I have reached the 50th edition to read a lakh letters every month, to hear the phone calls, to know about the various apps and to share the same with me.
The results of this survey are very encouraging.
Seventy percent of those listening to Mann Ki Baat have heard every episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Most people think that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced positive thinking among all sections of the society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, peoples movement has achieved a lot of expansion.
Has Tag India Positive has been discussed in a number of discussions.
This is a paradigm shift in which people are coming forward for social service.
Modi will come and go, but our country is eternal, our culture will remain immortal.
These short stories of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
A new inspiration filled with enthusiasm will take the country to greater heights.
I read letters and I feel such feelings in them and work with them in mind.
I have realized both these things myself and shared them and shared them with all of you.
But who knows when these words go home again.
Whether a government will be so powerful that projects like Selfie with Daughter will be started from a small village in Haryana and will spread not only across the country but also across the world.
Every section of the society, including the celebrity, has been associated with it, and the ideas of the society have been demonstrated in such a modern language that will illuminate the modern generation.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat has also been enjoyed, but in my mind, 130 crore Indians are sitting.
They're my mind.
Mann Ki Baat is not a matter of government but it is a matter of society.
There are many aspects of social life in which politics is the only way.
If politics becomes a key factor, it cannot be a reflection of a healthy society.
Sometimes political events or politicians become so important that other talents or other talents of the society become neglected.
It is our collective responsibility to take care of the talents of human beings and other aspects of society for the bright future of a country like India.
I believe that Mann Ki Baat is the biggest achievement of the 50th edition of Mann Ki Baat that you are not the Prime Minister, you are questioning one of your closest friends, that is democracy.
There is also a toll free number - 1  7800, calling there, people record their message in their own voices.
I try to read as many letters and comments as possible before Mann Ki Baat.
I've heard a lot of calls.
Now, as the Mann Ki Baat episode continues to come forward, I keep reading your thoughts and ideas at different places.
That letter is not just a piece of paper for me.
Besides, I have spent nearly 40-45 years of my life as an integral part of the country and have also spent a lot of time in most of the districts of the country.
And that is why when I read a letter, I can easily connect myself with that place.
Then I note some information, such as village, name of the individual.
Truly, in Mann Ki Baat, the voice is mine, but for example, the emotions and the energy of my countrymen, I would like to thank all those who contribute to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not yet taken the name of Mann Ki Baat, but they are not disappointed and keep sending their letters and comments.
I have full faith that your message will come to me more than ever before and it will make Mann Ki Baat more entertaining, effective and useful.
It is also being tried that all the letters which are not included in the Mann Ki Baat programme should be monitored by the concerned departments regarding all the letters and suggestions.
I would also like to thank all the media, Doordarshan, other TV channels and friends of social media in All India Radio.
Mann Ki Baat is reaching the maximum number of people with their hard work.
Thus, they will become Narendra Modi for thirty minutes.
I would like to congratulate them for their talent and skills.
I urge you all to listen to this event in your regional languages as well.
I also thank those friends of the media who are regularly publishing the Mann Ki Baat programme on their channels.
A political person does not get satisfaction from the media, thinks he is less covered, or is a negative coverage, but the media has taken up many issues in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
This journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete without your help.
Nidhi-ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
Normally I say I have no secrets.
What I'm doing is perhaps in all families.
In simple terms, I try to make myself like those youngsters, keep myself in that position and try to match their opinions with a wave length match.
We have some old baggages in our own life, if they don't come up then it becomes easier to convince someone.
We don't know how one of us had acknowledged others and had acknowledged their thoughts.
The good quality of the present youth is that he never does what he does not believe in himself, and when he believes in something, he leaves everything behind him.
Often people talk about the communication gap between the elders of the family and the teenager.
But most of the families had limited discussions with the teenagers.
Most of the time you talk about studying or habits, life style - do it, don't do it.
It is also a matter of concern that without any criteria, the open mind is gradually decreasing in the family.
By replacing the expectations and not negotiating badly, any media becomes very important.
I have been in constant touch with the youth through various programmes and social media.
I've always learned from the thoughts of the youth.
Young people have different ideas.
Youngsters are enthusiastic, innovative and innovative.
Someone said that young students want to do different things together.
I tell you, what's wrong with that
They are skilled in multi-tasking, so they do so.
If we look around, there will be social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports or any other sector that will bring about a big change in the society.
The youngsters who dared to question and dream.
If we give up the ability to make decisions on the youth and if they can openly express their thoughts then they can bring about a constructive change in the country and they are doing it.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to MiGov website, Vinita Ji has written that this time Mann Ki Baat will have to say something about the Constitution Day on 26th November.
This is a special day because we are entering the seventeenth year of the Constitution of India.
Binita ji, thank you very much for your suggestions.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
It is a day to remember all those great personalities who have framed our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949.
It took two years and eleven months and 17 days for the Constitution to complete this historic task of drafting the Constitution.
Imagine, within three years, these great talented persons have given us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
The extraordinary pace at which they have made the Constitution is a unique example of Time Management and Productivity.
Inspired by this, we are also eager to end our responsibilities in a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a gathering of great talents of the country, in which everyone was committed to provide a Constitution that empowers the people of India and the poorest of the poor.
The main feature of our Constitution is that right and duties are detailed in detail in terms of rights and duties.
The balance between these two things will take the country forward in the lives of the citizens of the country.
If we respect the rights of others then you will also be protected from your rights and if we follow our duties in the Constitution then we will also be able to protect our rights.
I remember that in 2010, in 60 years of India's democracy, in Gujarat, we took out the procession by keeping the Constitution on the back of the elephant.
It was a memorable effort to make the youth aware about the Constitution and to inspire the various streams of their Constitution.
As a democratic country in 2020, we will complete 70 years and will complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us all respect the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, prosperity and prosperity in our country.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
6th December is his Mahaparinirvan Diwas.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I salute Baba Saheb who has given the right to save crores of Indians with dignity.
The republic was under Babasaheb's concern and he used to say that India's democratic ideals are not exclusive.
The definition of a republic or a parliamentary system was nothing new to India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he had insisted that we have achieved this independence after many years of struggle and that is why we have to protect it with the last drop of blood.
He added that no matter how much we Indians grow in different environments, the idea of the welfare of the country is always priority.
Once again I pay my homage to Babasaheb.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev, who will be celebrating his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev always wished for the welfare of mankind.
He has always guided society to truth, action, service, compassion and goodwill.
Our country will celebrate the 550th Birth Anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev next year, which will spread across the globe.
All the States and Union Territories have been requested to observe this day with Dhoomadham.
Thus, the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated across the world.
In addition to this, a train will also be run at all the holy places associated with Shri Guru Nanak Dev.
I remember Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara when I was discussing this issue recently.
The Gurudwara was widely damaged during the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, but the way the state government took the local people and restored that Gurudwara is an example.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that passengers of our country can easily visit the holy land of Shri Guru Nanak Dev at Kartarpur in Pakistan.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th episode, we will be meeting again in Mann Ki Baat. I believe that my thoughts about the Mann Ki Baat programme were first discussed in front of you because you people wanted to know about it.
Our journey will continue.
The more I get your courage, the deeper the journey will be satisfactory.
Sometimes people ask me what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I want to say that the feedback of Mann Ki Baat has touched my heart. Most people have said that when they listen to Mann Ki Baat programme, they feel that the family members are sharing their words among them.
I am glad that when I came to know about this thing in detail that I am one of you, one of you, one of you and yourself have made me big, then Im happy that I will come again and again as a member of your family through Mann Ki Baat, I will meet you all.
I wish you, too.
Come, let us take this journey forward.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
My wish is that all of you must participate in this race of unity in large numbers.
Approximately six and a half months before independence, the image of Sardar Patel was published in the edition of the famous international newspaper Time magazine on January 27, 1947.
The Time Service was designed by India in its lead store.
There were more than 550 Indian states at that time.
Though the interest of the British in India was over, they wanted to keep this country apart.
The Time Magazine wrote, the dangers like separation, jealousy, food crisis, price rise and power-politics have left India. However, if anyone has the power to unite the country then he became Sardar Vallabhbhai Bhai.
Gandhiji had told Sardar Patel that the problem of states is so terrible that you can solve it only.
Sardar Patel has truly solved one problem and has done the impossible task of bringing the entire nation together.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad, Trivandrum or Rajasthan, Sardar Patel was the only person who considers and sees India as an intellectual and strategic strategy.
It is indeed a reminder of the remembrance of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel when we look at this nation that is bound by unity and our Mother India.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel is even more important because we will pay tributes to Sardar Patel on this day to the Statue of Unity.
Settled on the banks of the river Narmada in Gujarat, the statue is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in America.
This will be the world's highest skyscrapers.
Every Indian can proudly say that the tallest statue in the world is now in India.
I believe that this unique architecture will be identified as one of the favorite destinations of the country.
This was the day when Indian soldiers landed in Kashmir and protected the valley from intruders.
This historic event is also related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was an old interview with the great soldiers of India, Sam Manekesh.
During the meeting, Field Marshal Manekesh spoke of the time when he was the Colonel.
At that time, an army drive started in Kashmir in 1947.
Field Marshal Manekesh said, "How was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in a meeting to delay the deployment of troops in Kashmir, while in the meeting, Sardar Patel looked at Manekesh with his habit and said that there will be no delay in the Army operations in Kashmir and as soon as possible, we will have to solve this problem.
The death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi on 31st October.
Tributes to Indraji.
My dear countrymen, are there people who don't like sports
Spirit, Stamina, Strength, Skill etc. are very important in the field of sports.
These are the measurements of success of any athlete.
On the other hand, these four qualities are important for nation building.
If the youth of any country have these qualities, they will not only improve the economy, science and technology of the country but will also highlight the country's victory in sports.
Recently, I've met two things to remember.
First of all, I got the opportunity to meet the Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
India has made a new record by winning a total of 72 medals in the Games.
In this scenario, we have won 3 more medals in the 13 medals in addition to Mix Event.
You must be reminded that India's performance in the Asian Games was also very good.
Look, in the last few minutes, I've used the best, the most beautiful words I've ever heard.
He was a father when he was eight.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the Orphanage, he used to clean the DTC bus and wait on the roadside for running a life-long car.
This Narayana has won the gold medal for India at the International event today.
Not only this, the area of sports in India is spreading in such a way that Judo-like events where India has not won an Olympic medal in Junior Level till date, Tababi Devi made a silver history in Judo at Youth Olympics.
Sixteen year old young woman Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
Her father sells a day-to-day and mother fish.
Sometimes there was such a situation that they didn't even have the money to buy food.
Similar situations have also come to a standstill for Tababi Devi.
He made history by winning medals for the country.
There are many more such stories, their lives are a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson, his enthusiasm is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, all of you remember that we have successfully organised the FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUP in 2017.
It has also been appreciated in the world's most successful tournament.
FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUPRECHERD broke the audience.
More than 12 lakh audiences have seen football in different stadiums across the country and have encouraged young players.
India is fortunate to be the World Cup hockey organisation in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will be held from 28th November to 16th December.
There is a separate place in the minds of any Indian who does not love any game.
India has a golden history in Hockey.
In the past, India has won gold sometimes and has won it once.
India has also gifted some world class athletes to the Hockey Games.
If we talk about hockey anywhere in the world then it becomes incomplete.
Hockey's magician Major Dhyanchand is known all over the world.
Besides, Balbinder Singh Sinior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Saheed, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai Hockey has brought laurels for India in the world.
Even today, Hockey players of Team India are making labour and dedication an example of success for the new generations.
Sports enthusiasts have a great experience sitting on the stadium.
When we go to Bhubaneswar, we will encourage not only Indian teams but also all the countries.
It is a legacy of prosperity and cultural excellence that the people of Odisha must remember and remember.
It is also a great opportunity for sports enthusiasts to visit Odisha.
My best wishes to the rest of the world.
My dear countrymen, a lot of people are coming forward in social service, they are doing volunteering, it is becoming a big inspiration for the people of the country.
A young man has committed himself to learn wheelchair basketball for basketball in wheelchairs.
This is the spirit of self-employment. This is the mission mode activity.
There is an Indian who will not be proud of these things.
This idea of 'No, we' will inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I was seeing your suggestions on Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to see a thrilling comment from my Puducherry's Shri Manish Mahapatra.
He wrote in Mygov: In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, please tell us how the tribal and traditional traditions of India are the best examples of unity with nature.
We need to learn something from them, how we will commit ourselves to our traditions for the Sustainable Development.
Manish ji, I express my gratitude to all of you for putting such a thing in front of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is one thing that inspires me to see our glorious past and culture back, today the world, especially the West, is discussing environmental conservation and is looking for a new path for balanced lifestyle.
Today, our India is not far away from this problem, but we have to surrender to solve it.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The Bhil tribes of Madhya Pradesh, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the trees like Bat and Arjun with reverence.
In a desert like Rajasthan, Vishnoi has shown us the way to preserve the environment.
They're ready to sacrifice their lives for tree conservation, but they're not ready to harm even a tree.
Mishmi people of Arunachal demand their relationship with tigers.
They call him their own brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland too, the tiger was seen as the protector of the forest.
The people of the Warli community of Maharashtra regard tiger as guests, as a symbol of the prosperity of the tiger.
The Kola community of Madhya Pradesh means that they have their own destiny with the tigers and if the tigers do not feed, then the villagers will have to remain illiterate.
The Gond tribe of Madhya Pradesh stops fishing at some places in the Breeding Season.
These places are known as fish shelters, and they have a lot of fresh fish in this tradition.
Tribal communities build their homes from natural material which becomes strong and environment friendly.
In southern India, there is a small zoological community in the remote areas of the Nilgiri Mountain, which, according to tradition, makes their habitations locally available.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in being very peaceful and united among themselves but when someone harms their natural resources then they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were tribal people.
Who can forget Lord Veerasa Munda who fought hard against the British rule to protect his forest land
There are many such examples of tribal communities that teach us how to live in harmony with nature and that our country is indebted to the tribal community for the forest wealth that is around us.
Come, we respect them.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, we talk about the problems faced by those people and those who are doing something amazing for the society.
All those things that appear to be common but in reality it has a far-reaching impact on the transformation of our mindset and the goals of our society.
Just a few days back, I was reading about Gurubachan Singh ji of Punjab.
Gurubachan Singh ji's son was married to a common and hardworking farmer.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan Singh ji had told his parents that they would do this marriage unanimously.
He suddenly said he had a condition.
Nowadays, on conditions of marriage, he is usually going to talk about a big sum, asking for something that will make the family of Connor difficult.
But you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurubachan Singh was a simple white farmer and he told his father that the condition that I am talking about is the real strength of the society.
Gurubachan Singh ji said, You promise me that from now on you will not leave the ruins that remain after harvesting the crops in the field of agriculture.
You can imagine how big social power is hidden in them.
Gurubachan Singh ji may be very simple but it is his personality and we have seen that there are many such families in our society who have transformed the personality into a better job for the society.
Shri Gurubachan Singh ji's family has set an example.
I read about another village of Kallar Majra in Punjab, which is situated near the river.
Kallar Majra was the headline because the people there did not burn the paddy stubble and mixed it with the soil, so that the necessary technologies were made.
I convey my best wishes to Bhai Gurubachan Singh Ji.
Congratulations to Kallar Majra and the people of those places who have been trying their best to make the environment clean.
You all are taking the healthy lifestyle of Indian heirs forward in the right direction.
Just as a drop of water produces the sea, similarly small awareness and positive work always helps in creating a positive environment.
India has a special significance for the eleventh day of November this year, as the first war ended on 11th November a hundred years ago.
It means that the end of the horrific destruction and the end of the massacre will be a hundred years.
For India, the First War is an important event.
To be honest, we had nothing to do with this great war.
Nevertheless, the soldiers of our country fought brave-hearts in this war, played a very big role and made the highest sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not behind anyone on the battlefield.
Our soldiers showed their bravery in difficult situations.
All this was aimed at restoring peace.
In the first war, the whole world saw the destruction of the world.
It is estimated that nearly one crore soldiers and more civilians lost their lives.
After this horrific war, the entire world understood the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed over the last hundred years.
My dear countrymen, there is a specialty in the North-East of this country.
Besides its natural beauty, the people here are also very talented.
Our north-east is now known for its best and greatest work.
It's a place where organic farming has improved.
Just a few days ago, the Honble Future Policy Gold Ward has won Sikkim today to promote long-term food systems.
The award was given on behalf of the United Nations Organization FAO, Food and Agricultural Organization.
You will be happy to know that the award for outstanding policy making is equivalent to Oscars.
Not only this, our Sikkim won the award by losing the single nominee of twenty-five countries.
That's why I thank the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is about to end.
Change of weather is clear.
Winter has arrived and with the change of weather, the season of festivals has come along with Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhai Bhota, Chhath Pujas and festivals in the month of November.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens for this festival.
I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to all of you, to take care of yourself at the time of the festival, to keep an eye on your health and also to the well-being of the society.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The country will move as much as you can.
