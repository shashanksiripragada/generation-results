Mann Ki Baat on October 2019
My dear countrymen, greet you.
Today is the sacred day of Diwali.
Deepawali is now being celebrated in many countries of the world.
The unique feature of this festival is that not only the Indian community but also the governments of many countries, citizens and social organizations of that place are celebrating Diwali with great joy and joy.
This is where a microcosm of India is being displayed.
Friends, Tourism Festival in the world is an attraction for tourism.
In our country, every region has its own diverse festivals and people of other countries have a special interest in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something different for this Diwali in the last Mann Ki Baat.
I had said, "Come, let us together celebrate the women power and achievements of India this time, that is, the laxmi of India.
Look, there were numerous inspiring stories in the social media.
My mother is my strength, written in the Codipak Namo App in Warangal.
My mother took charge of five children when my father died in 1990.
Today we have five brothers in good work.
My best wishes to your mother.
Geetika Swami, who is an Actor in 1996, says that Major Kushbu Kanwar, who led the team of Assam Rifles, the daughter of the bus conductor, is Bharatlaxmi.
Kavita Tiwari has her daughter Bharatlaxmi and her own strength.
She is very proud that her daughter is a great artist.
The daughter got a good rank in the CAT exam.
On the other hand, Megha Jain writes about an old 92-year-old man who has been supplying free drinking water to Gualior Railway Station for years.
Meghaji, the humility and compassion of Bharatlakshmi are very inspiring.
Many such stories were shared by people.
You must read, inspire, share the things you've got.
The emotions of that poetry, the words of that poem, are now a consciousness that we have written about what we say in the 17th century.
How excellent words, how excellent emotional, how excellent thought is this poem in the poetry of Kannada.
The Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Hemisphere was also known for his daughter Laxmi.
Our daughters are our pride.
It is because of the glory of these daughters that our society has a strong personality and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November, 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
I can never forget that I went to the gurudwara of Vancouver and Tehran.
I have many things related to Shri Guru Nanak Dev who can share with you but it will require several episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He stood firm against many evils like that.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji brought his message to the world far and wide.
He was the most travelling man in those days.
Going to many places, the simplicity, humility and the behaviour of the ordinary people swept everyone's mind.
The great religious journey of Guru Nanak Devji is called Udasi .
With the message of harmony and equality, he went north, south, east and west, and saw people, sages and sages everywhere.
Sant Shanker Dev, a well-known saint of Assam, is also believed to have inspired him.
Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism also went to the sacred places.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has gone to Sri Lanka in South India.
Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water in Karnataka during his journey to Bidar.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bihar which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji .
During such a journey Guru Nanak ji had travelled in Kashmir and surrounding areas of North India.
This has established a very strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji had also visited Tibet and the people there considered him a Guru.
He is also venerable in Uzbekistan.
As part of his visit, he has also visited Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He took a place in the minds of millions of people, following his advice with due respect, and still obeying him.
A few days ago, diplomats from around 85 countries went to Amritsar via Delhi.
He visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which marked the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
The diplomatic delegates also had the opportunity to visit the Golden Temple and learn about the Sikh tradition and culture.
After that, many Ambassadors shared the pictures there in the social media and wrote about the good experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember the 31st of October.
It was the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the steel man of India, who was on the verge of unity in this country.
Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to unite the people, and he was also accompanied by emotionally distinguished people.
Sardar Patel had seen and studied every small thing in depth as a labour force.
In the right sense, he was a personality of analysis.
Besides, the organizational capabilities were also enhanced.
He was skilled in formulating schemes and enhancing war strategy.
While reading and listening about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, we can see how deep his preparedness was.
In 1921, thousands of people from all over the country had come to participate in the congress conference in Ahmedabad.
Batilji was responsible for all arrangements related to the Mahasammelan.
He gave this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
He ensured that no one had any trouble in the water.
He contacted the farmers and asked them to make Khadi bags.
Farmers made bags and sold to delegates.
The delegates didn't want to steal shoes because they kept shoes in these bags.
On the other hand, Khadi sales have also increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constitution.
He spoke of the importance of ensuring basic rights, so that there is no possibility of any kind of difference in the caste system.
Friends, we know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job in uniting the nations.
Sardar Vallabhbhai's specialty was to take a look at everything.
After the partition of India in 1947, our neighbour's eyes fell on the island of Lakshadweep and they shipped it with the flag of that country.
Immediately after taking note of this, Sardar Patel, without losing time, has initiated drastic action.
He directed the brothers of Arcot Ramaswamy Bodhiyar, Arcot Laxmanaswamy Bodhiyar to reach Lakshadweep along with those from Thiruvananthapuram and raise the Tricolour Flag on Lakshadweep.
Soon there was a tri-flag flew and the land was devastated by the dreams of the neighbour of Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel instructed the brothers and sisters of Lakshadweep to ensure that all necessary assistance is available for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep plays an important role in the development of India.
This is an attractive tourist destination.
I hope you will also visit these beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, I had dedicated the Statue of Unity to the nation and the world in the memory of Sardar Patel.
This is the tallest statue in the world.
The Statue of Liberty in America is twice as high.
The tallest statue in the world makes every Indian proud.
The head of all Indians is rising with pride.
You would be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists visiting the Statue of Unity within a year.
People there are now starting to cultivate dragon fruits and I am sure it will become an important source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a learning subject.
We are witness to how a place is developing into a world famous tourist destination within a year.
There people from all over the country and abroad.
Travel facilities, accommodations, guides, environment friendly arrangements, etc. are developing on their own.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, An Indian who is not proud that Time Magazine has given the Statue of Unity a great place among the top 100 tourist destinations of the world.
I hope you too will take some time away from your precious time to visit the Statue of Unity.
However, my request to all Indians who have taken time to travel should go to at least 15 tourist destinations with their families and stay there at night.
Friends, As you are aware, every year since October 31, 2014, we are celebrating political unity day.
On this day, we have a message to save our country's unity, integrity and security at all costs.
On 31st October, 2018, the Run for Unit is being organised every time.
This includes people from all walks of life, from all walks of life.
The Radio for Unity is a symbol of this country, which goes in the same direction and wishes to achieve the same goal.
Likewise, in recent times, there is a special interest and enthusiasm in the cause of maladministration.
Radio Phone Unit is also a wonderful opportunity for that.
Running is beneficial for mind, mind and body.
Therefore, not only the body, but also the unity of our mind and our cultural India, and to bring India to new heights...
So, if you live in any city, you can find out where the Run for Unity is going.
I hope that all of you will run for Indias unity and your fitness on 31st October.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had laid the foundation of unity in the country.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious in strengthening the unity and harmony of the country.
If we look around, we can see many examples of our constant efforts to enhance mutual harmony.
However, sometimes the problems of the society, its contributions and consequences are routinely eradicated from memory.
Several kinds of people went to the plains.
What kind of parties were playing games to make their own profits from the environment
What kind of language did you speak to warm the atmosphere
Efforts have been made to resurrect different voices.
We recall what some speakers and some narrators have said to themselves to be glorified, and what irresponsible things have been said.
Appreciating the courts prestige with great pride, the Prime Minister said that there is no way to create an environment that warms up society and increases pressure.
These things have to be remembered forever, which gives us immense strength.
Those days, those moments give us a sense of duty.
This is an example of how the voice of unity gives strength to the country.
It was a major blow to the country.
I pay homage to that great lady today.
My dear countrymen, if a story that can be heard far and wide today, if one can hear a story of every village, from north to south, from east to west, if one hears a story in every corner of India then it is about cleanliness.
It inspires every individual, every family and every village to share their comfortable experience of cleanliness because this effort towards cleanliness is an effort of 125 crore Indians.
125 crore Indians are the heirs of its outcome.
But it's also a comfortable and attractive anointing.
I'd like to hear you too.
The world's highest battlefield, the temperature is 50-60 degrees mines.
There's only an oxygen name in the air.
In such an adverse situation, it is a great adventure to live amidst such challenges.
In such a scenario, our brave soldiers are not only waiting for our borders in the opposite atmosphere but also organising a programme called Swachh Siachen.
We know that Siachen is the source of rivers and water.
Therefore, undertaking a cleanliness drive here means ensuring clean water to those living in the valleys and they use water in rivers like Nubra, Shyok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is an occasion to awaken the spirit of all of us.
On Diwali, especially buying something new, and bringing something from the market, the family is getting less and less.
I once told you to try to buy local goods.
If we get the things we need in our village then we don't have to go to Taluk.
If you get to Taluk, you don't have to go to the district.
As much as we try to buy local goods, Gandhi 150 himself will become a great opportunity.
We have to buy something that our khadi weavers shaped with the hands of our weavers.
I urge you to buy local items along with the wishes of Deepawali.
Look, we can see how important we can play to realise the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
But sometimes it's irrelevant that causes fire.
There might be burns.
I appeal to all of you to regulate yourself and celebrate the festival with enthusiasm.
Many good wishes.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
There will be no Indian who does not feel proud of the soldiers of our armed forces.
Every Indian, whether in any region or in any caste or language, will always be enthusiastic to express his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion people of India celebrated the day of the valour of our armed forces with pride.
We recalled the surgical strike in 2016, when our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the arrogant pride of fighting terrorism against our nation.
Our Armed Forces Exhibitions were organised in different parts of the country with the hope that more and more citizens of the country, particularly younger generation, should know what our strengths are.
We wanted to know how talented we are and how our soldiers are saving their lives and protecting the people.
Days like Parakram Parv remind the youngsters about the pride of our Armed Forces.
It inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the nation.
I also participated in a programme at Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of heroes.
Our armies are sure to turn their backs on those who are trying to dismantle the atmosphere of peace in our country.
India is always committed to peace and dedication.
In the twentieth century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace in the two world wars.
And remember that we had nothing to do with that war.
It was an attack by our soldiers for peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest armed forces in the United Nations peacekeeping forces.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have played a crucial role in establishing peace in the world with blue helmet.
My dear countrymen, things in the sky are different.
We are celebrating Air Force Day on 8th October.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the air warriors and their families who have served the nation.
When the attackers from Pakistan launched an unexpected attack in 1947, it was the Air Force that ensured that Indian soldiers and combat equipment reached the battlefield on time to rescue Srinagar from the attackers.
The Air Force responded to the enemy in 1965.
Nobody knew about the 1971 Bangladesh War of Independence.
The role of the Air Force is also simple in liberating Kargil from the clutches of the invaders in 1999.
At Tiger Hill, the enemy's bases were bombed by night and the air force dumped them.
I am grateful to the Air Force for the unflinching efforts of our Air Force personnel, whether it is a disaster relief or a rescue mission.
India can proudly say that in the Indian Army, not only in the Armed Forces, but also in the power of women.
I was worried about how to save Tommy.
You know Abhilash Tommy is a brave hero.
He is the first Indian to be in the world with a small boat without the help of a single modern technology.
For the past 80 days, he has been on his way to the ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean, but has caused an accident in the aftermath of a terrible sea.
But this hero of India's Navy has been fighting for a long time in the ocean.
He lived in the middle of the ocean without eating and drinking.
Failure to life is not ready to accept.
A marvelous example of courage, determination and bravery - when Abhilash was saved from the sea, I spoke on telephone.
His courage, courage, determination, determination and the power to overcome evil and succeed will certainly inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, everyone knows what is the significance of 2nd October for our nation.
On 2nd October this year, we have a special significance.
For two years from now on, we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhis thoughts have inspired the entire world.
Later, when the freedom struggle was strengthened in 1945, he re-interpreted these thoughts and prepared a new edition.
His thoughts have been presented to the people about the rights of venerated Bapu farmers, villages and workers, and on many issues such as cleanliness and education.
This is called Gandhi Charter.
The venerable Bapu was a public organiser.
Meeting with people and mobilizing them was his characteristic, this was his nature.
This has been experienced by everyone as one of his greatest personalities.
He convinced each individual that the person is the greatest and most important person in the country.
His greatest contribution to the freedom struggle is that he has made it a mass movement.
As per the call of Mahatma Gandhi during the freedom struggle, people from all walks of life, from all walks of life have dedicated themselves.
In that, Gandhiji says, I'm giving you a mantra.
Without your doubts, you'll feel pride.
My dear countrymen, this mantra of Gandhiji is even greater today.
Today, we have to think of one thing on the basis of growing middle class in the country, their growing economic strength and growing dynamics.
Can you remember the revered Bapu for a moment when we go to buy something
Can you remember the venerable father's spell
Can you imagine which citizen of the country will be benefited by what I buy
Whose face will be happy
Who will benefit directly or indirectly if you buy it
If the poorest of the poor benefits, I would be more happy.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I am confident that your little step in the life of the poorest and the weakest person will make a big difference.
My dear countrymen, perhaps he didn't even know how Gandhiji had said that he would get freedom if he cleaned the premises.
But it happened, India got freedom.
Likewise, how can we feel that my country is contributing to economic growth, economic empowerment and strengthening the fight against poverty by doing small things
But I believe that if I do that, that would be the real patriotism of today's era.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri used to keep even the old and rigid dresses of Khadi, because one of them has forgotten somebody's work.
He used to say that these Khadi cloths are made very integral and every single piece of it should be utilized.
This feeling of love for the country and the people of the country was filled with the feelings of a small and lengthy gentleman.
In two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Scientist along with Pooja Baba.
As the name of Scientists comes, Indians will have a lot of respect in their minds.
His gentle personality is always a matter of pride for the people.
Besides, he seemed to be extremely humble, but he had a firm individuality like a hill.
The mudra of his Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is a reflection of his brave personality.
As a reflection of his selfless penance towards the nation, he gave the mantra to bring the jawans and farmers to the peak of victory in a short span of about one and a half years.
People from all walks of life are associated with this shramdaan of the fifteenth fire.
If you had not telephoned the issue about the kind of facilities that you had after toilets, people associated with cleanliness wouldn't have noticed such a heart-wrenching thing.
I would like to thank you for phone calls.
The closing ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October, 2018 at the commencement of his 100th birth anniversary.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit - 'Swarajya sat'.
In the Constitution provided by Babasaheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
In his vision, on 12th October, 1993, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was constituted by the National Commission for Human Rights (NHRC).
Within a few days, the Commission is completing 25 years of its existence.
The Human Rights Commission not only defended human rights but also enhanced human dignity.
Our favourite leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former Prime Minister of our country, has clearly stated that human rights is not a vision for us.
In this journey of 25 years, this institution has created an ideal and trustworthy atmosphere among the people.
I believe that this is a very promising event for the best democratic values for a healthy society.
Today, Human Rights Commissions have been set up in 26 States along with national level human rights activities.
As a society, we need to understand human rights and bring it into action. This is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas - the basis of SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas.
My dear countrymen, while Jaiprakash Narayans birthday is coming in the month of October, can we not remember the birth centenary of Rajmata Vijayraje Scindia
These superstitions are very inspiring for us, and we salute them.
On 31st October, Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary is being discussed in detail in the next Manki Baat but for a few years, on 31st October, a race for unity is being organized in every small and big city of Hindustan, in every village, in the streets.
This year, Radio for Unity must be organized in our villages, streets, cities and cities.
The race for unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the nation throughout his life.
Our endeavour to bring together all sections of the society, all the components of the country, on 31st October, through the Run for Unity Programme should be emphasized.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today, Rakshabandhan is being celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to all the people on this auspicious occasion.
Raksha Bandhan is regarded as a symbol of mutual love and trust of brothers and sisters.
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, there are numerous stories enshrined in the form of faith in the people of two different countries and religions.
The festival of Janmashtami is going on in a few days.
Greetings to all people on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
Friends, apart from Rakshabandhan, on the occasion of Shravan Purnima, Sanskrit day is celebrated.
I congratulate all those who have been associated with this great legacy and bringing it to the common man.
We are very proud that Tamil is the oldest language in the world and since Vedic times, Sanskrit has played a very important role in the propagation of knowledge.
You will be happy to know that residents of Matur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are still speaking in each other's cultural languages.
So one can describe a subtle emotion or even a subject.
It is also easy to understand because it is related to our soil and our traditions.
For example, to highlight the significance of the Guru in life, one alphabet maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro mathematician maestro maestro maestro maestro mathematician maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro maestro
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as Teachers Day throughout the country.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the occasion of Teachers Day.
At the same time, I appreciate your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, the season comes with new hopes for our hardworking farmers.
Rain brings comfort to trees, trees and dry reservoirs in scorching heat.
But sometimes the terrible and devastating floods come along.
Nature has come to a point where it is raining more than at one place.
We have already seen that the floods in Kerala have severely affected the lives of people.
Today, in this difficult situation, the entire country is with Kerala.
We have sympathy with those who lost their own.
I would like to assure the families of the distressed that even if the lives of those who have lost their lives cannot be reconciled, the hundred twenty five crore Indians will stand shoulder to shoulder in this hour of grief.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity recover health at the earliest.
I firmly believe that Kerala will emerge as a result of the spirit and courage of the people.
Unfortunately, the damage caused by accidents is unfortunate.
But we can see a lot of vision of humanity in times of danger.
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something in their own way wherever there is an accident, whether it is in Kerala or in any other state of India or district or region.
All age groups and all fields of work are playing their own role.
Everyone is contributing to the elimination of the sufferings of the people of Kerala and to share their grief.
We are aware that the Armed Forces personnel are leading the rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried their best to save the people in the flood.
My dear countrymen, this time Mann Ki Baat has been examining the suggestions received.
The subject written by more and more people across the country was our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Gaziaabad, Swati from Sonip, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swap Banerjee from West Bengal, Akshish Pandey from Katihar in Bihar and several others have written to the Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov asking him to mention the various stories of Ataljis life.
On August 16, the country and the world were saddened to hear Atal ji's death.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired his twenty-fourth interaction.
In a way, he has been away from active politics for the past 10 years.
There was no place in the news, no appearance in public life.
The gap of 10 years is very big, but after August 16, the country and the world saw that the ten year period in the minds of ordinary people of India did not break even a minute.
Whatever kind of love and respect he had with Atal ji, however sad it spread throughout the country, it shows his vast personality.
India will always be indebted to Atal ji for the 9th Amendment to the Constitution in 2003.
This transformation has made two major changes in Indian politics.
Firstly, the size of the Cabinet in the States has been fixed at 15 of the total number of seats.
Secondly, the limit prescribed under the Prevention of Deduction of Deduction Act has been reduced to one-third and two.
At the same time, clear guidelines have been framed to disqualify those who change the party.
Over the years, political culture has emerged as a giant cabinet builder in India and the formation of big cabinets was not only to divide departments but also to please political leaders.
Atalji changed it.
His move awaited money and resources.
And efficiency.
This transformation has led to the vision of a person like Atal ji and our political culture and healthy habits have grown.
Atalji was a perfect patriot.
The timing of the presentation of the budget was changed during his tenure.
Earlier, the budget was presented at 5 p.m. following the traditions of the British, because it was time for Parliament to start in England.
During the presentation of the Atal ji Budget in 2001, it was changed from 5 PM to 11 PM onwards.
One more freedom - the Indian Flag Code was created during the reign of Atal ji and it was authorized in 2002.
Departments added that the National Flag could be flagged off in public places.
It is a good thing and good luck for democracy.
It will be a great tribute to Atal ji for enhancing good habits for a healthy democracy, for a good democracy, for consistent efforts to strengthen democracy and taking forward the discussions with an open mind.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfil his dream of a developed and prosperous India, I salute Atal ji for all.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament concluded a few days ago.
You will be pleased to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha is 118 and that the Rajya Sabha is 74.
The Lok Sabha passed 21 Bills and 14 Bills in Rajya Sabha as a result of the efforts of all Members to make the Monsoon Session more effective than the interest of the party.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will be remembered as a session of social justice and well-being of the youth.
In this conference, the great bills that benefit the youth and the backward communities were passed.
For decades, there was a need to create an OBC commission like the STC.
In order to ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, this time the country has achieved its resolve to form the OBC Commission and has given it constitutional authority.
This step will become a step towards the goal of social justice.
The Amendment Bill, 2018 has also passed in this session to seek the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act provides for greater protection for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
It will also prevent criminals from committing aggressions, which will instill self-confidence in the samads.
No civilized society will tolerate any injustice against women power in the country.
The country is not ready to tolerate the perpetrators of rape.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Penal Code Amendment Bill and ensured strict punishment.
You must have read in the newspaper a few days ago that a person who raped an adolescent child was sentenced to death by a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh after trial for two months.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had completed the trial in five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
The court of Rajasthan also took such a decision very quickly.
The Act will play a pivotal role in preventing crimes against women and girls.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
I would like to assure the Muslim women that the entire nation stands with all its might to bring justice to them.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Parliamentarians of the country on this occasion.
My dear countrymen, the focus of millions of people is now on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every morning, people first appear in the newspapers, in television, in news and in social media, which Indian sportsperson has won medals.
The Asian Games are still on.
Greetings to all medal winners for the country.
Our girls have a lot of medal winners for the country, and this is a very positive sign.
Young sportspersons who have won medals are 15-16 years old.
The medal winners are a good indicator of the fact that most of the medal winners live in small streets and villages.
I once again wish the medal winners at the Asian Games and wish the rest of the sportspersons a good presentation.
Many congratulations to everyone on National Sports Day.
Hello, Bhavnaji, I respect the idea of the child.
We have seen the construction of houses and buildings with stones and rocks, but can you imagine the construction of an excellent, large and wonderful temple of a mountain that was about 1200 years ago on a rock
But the Brihadeshwar Temple in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where there is an incredible coordination of architecture and engineering.
A stakeholder known as Rani ki wave, built in the eleventh century at Pan in Gujarat, will surprise anyone.
India's land was an engineering laboratory.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
He is venerable in that part of the country and the rest of the country remembers him with great respect and loyalty.
In his memory, the 15th of September is celebrated as Engineers' Day.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have displayed their distinct personality all over the world.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers' Day, we must think about the future too.
There must be workshops.
Recently, Disaster Management has become a big issue.
The world is facing natural calamities.
What kind of structural engineering should be in this situation
How can we determine the priorities of making waste-free construction
We have to think about how many such things are being celebrated on Engineering Day.
See you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
Indias geography and diversity sometimes shows the fondness of rain.
But why do we blame the rain
V.
The team of 12 football players in Thailand took their coaches to the cave during their deportation.
It'll take hours to get in and out of the cave.
Because they didn't find any other way, they took refuge in a small rock inside the cave - that's not a day or two, but a day or two.
If the kids see death in front of them, you can imagine what the moment will be when they face it every moment.
On the one hand, they were facing an accident, on the other hand, human values were being manifested in the entire world.
People all over the world were praying for the safe release of these children.
But at the end of the good news, the world was quiet and happy.
But I feel like seeing this incident in another way.
Everyone participated in the mission as a team.
I think it's a matter of learning and understanding the behaviour of everyone.
In this endeavour, a young soldier from Thailand's Navy had to sacrifice his life.
It is astonishing for the world that despite such a difficult situation, they have not given up hope in a water-filled dark cave with so much courage and patience.
This shows that miracles happen when humanity combines.
The speciality of the poems of Neeraj ji was to shout hope, faith, determination and confidence.
The words of Neeraj ji for Indians will be very powerful and inspiring.
It must be dark.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has paid tributes to Dr.
Namaste Prime Minister, my name is Truth.
I have been the first year student in Delhi University this year.
During our school board exams, you talked about the tension and education of the exams and what is your message to students like me
The month of July and August is very important for the farmers as well as for the youth.
Because it's called the peak season of colleges.
It's time for millions of youngsters like the truth to leave school and go to college.
In February and March, if you go to the examination papers and answers, it is time to play the holidays of April and wait for the results and decide the way forward in life and choose a career.
Children come from the shade of their parents to the shade of their professors.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy since the beginning of their career.
For the first time, you have to go out of the house and go out of the village and get out of a safe environment and be regulated.
So many youngsters leave their homes for the first time to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students may have joined their colleges and some may be willing to join.
I want to tell you to be calm, enjoy life and enjoy the joy of inner soul in life.
There's no choice but to learn, but to find new things.
The value of old friends is very big.
Friends of childhood are insignificant, but the finding, making and preserving of new friends needs to be consciously taken into account in their own way.
Learn something new, acquire new skills and learn new languages.
Now, in terms of the capital season, a student from a very poor family of Madhya Pradesh, Asharam Chaudhary, was witnessing the news of how he succeeded by surviving the hard-working challenges of his life.
Be it from a poor family or from a challenging environment, we have so many students who have worked to become inspiring because of their hard work and dedication.
Prince Kumar of Delhi, father DTC driver, Abhay Gupta, who studied under street light in footpath in Kolkata, and Afreen Shaikh, father's autorickshaw driver, Ahmedabad's daughter Afreen Shaikh, is praiseworthy. Father's bus driver, Nagpur's daughter Khushi, father's guardian, Kartik from Haryana, and father's co-worker from Jharkhand, who works on bricks.
If we look around, we can see many such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives me energy and inspiration.
I was talking to Indian youth in Sanjoz, once known as the Technological Hub in America.
I asked them to think about how they can utilize their capabilities for India and do something in time.
I requested the brain drain to be transformed into brain gain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Vajpayee have made a different attempt by accepting this challenge.
With their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together prepared the Smart Gauge App.
This app not only connects the people of the village to the world but also makes them aware of any information and information in their own mobile phones.
The villagers of Taudakpur village in Rae Bareli, the village head, district magistrate and CDO inspired people to use this app.
This App is in a way bringing about a digital revolution in the village and it is easy to record, track and monitor all the developments in the village.
The app has a village phone directory, news section, intents list, health center and information center.
This app is very beneficial for the farmers and in a way, the Grameen Feature of the App is being used as a market for their produce among the farmers.
If you look at this incident, you can see that the young man lives in America, in the midst of his lifestyle and thoughts, he might have left India several years ago, but he knows the cornerstone of his village, he understands the challenges and keeps an emotional connection with the village.
But sometimes because of scarcity of time, sometimes because of distances, sometimes because of the surroundings, the slightest layer of molestation covers it, but if a small canal touches it, everything appears once more, it leads to the past.
Santosh ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
Perhaps this is a marvellous pilgrimage.
Friends, Asha Ekdashi is being celebrated this time on July 23.
Panchrapur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15-20 days before the Ektashi of Asha, the pilgrims embark on a pilgrimage to Parpur with teeth.
This journey, known as Vari, is being attended by millions of media persons.
Pilgrims reach there for the vision of Lord Vitthoba, called Bhagwan Vitthoba and Panduranga.
May God forbid the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have great respect and devotion.
Going to the Bhairothoba Temple in Parpur has a unique experience of greatness, beauty and spiritual joy.
If I have the opportunity to tell the listeners of Manki Baat, I must once again participate in the Parpur Wari.
Innumerable sacred places like Gyaneshwar, Namadev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram, etc. , are still spreading awareness among the common people of Maharashtra.
This sage tradition will continue to inspire every corner of Hindustan.
The message of harmony, love and brotherhood is received from all relevant customs.
A mandate is given to fight society with respect to blind respect.
Lokmanya Tilak was a brave and confident personality.
He had the power and the intellect to give the British rulers their fault.
The British feared him for attempting to commit sedition thrice in 20 years.
It's not a small thing.
I would like to present to you an interesting event related to Lokmanya Tilakan and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When we arrived in Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people reached there today, almost a hundred years ago, and during this journey, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to speak to him.
Lokmanya Tilak influenced Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Naturally the British dissatisfied with this, the Collector continued to deny permission.
However, Sardar Saheb was a Sardar Saheb and he was firmly determined that even if he had to give up his position, the statue of Lokmanya Tilak would be established.
The statue was finally built and on 28th February 1929 it was inaugurated not only by anyone but by Mahatma Gandhi itself.
Ganesh Festival has been started as a result of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak.
Ganesh Festival was celebrated with traditional respect and festivities and became a powerful medium of social awakening, social awareness, inclusiveness and equality among the people.
It was an era of unity in fighting the British in the country.
It is clear that our younger generation is still interested in this and our ancient heritage and our heroes of history.
Today you can see Ganesh Mandaps in many cities and all the streets.
This is a good opportunity for our youth to learn about leadership and organisationalism and develop their capabilities.
This time, from the idol of Ganesh Ji, all the ornaments should be environment friendly and the competition for environment friendly Ganesh Festival should be held in all the cities.
I'm gonna get these things to people.
The world's aristocracy has made a sense of self-confidence among the people, a seal, and Swaraj is our birthright, and will achieve it.
Even today, it is time to say that Swaraj is our birth right.
Every Indian should have good results of good governance and development.
This is the building of a New India.
50 years after the birth of Tilak, on the same day, on 23rd July, another son of Bharat Mata was born.
He sacrificed his life, thinking that we could breathe in the air of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrasekhar Azad.
Any youngster who is not inspired by these lines will be in India, and many youngsters like Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna Ab Hamare Dil Mai Haidekhana Hai Geor Kitna, Baju-e-Kaathil Mem Hai, Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad have been inspired by these lines.
Chandrashekhar Azad's courage and enthusiasm for freedom inspired many youngsters.
Azad lived his life, but he never bowed his head before the foreign rule.
A few days ago, at the Junior Under 20 World Athletics Championship held in Finland, Indias brave women and farmers won the gold medal at the 400m race.
I was sent an e-mail in response to my letter to another daughter of ours, saying that preparations for the Asian Games are going on in Indonesia.
I am proud that this is the moment when the Tricolour Flag is the greatest moment in the life of any athlete.
"Ekta, we all are proud of it.
The name of solidarity has illuminated.
The World Para Athletic Grand Private in Tunisia won gold and bronze medals in 2018.
I salute and convey my best wishes to Ekta Bhai, Yogeshi Kutiye and Sundersingh for your courage.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the centuries-long celebrations in this month of August, which will make you patriotic and healthy.
Let's reunite once again in Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, a cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You must have realized that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
Both teams performed well in this game.
From Afghanistan side, Bouler Rashid Khan also performed well at IPL this year.
I remember, the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, who tagged me, said, The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero, Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to my Indian friends for creating a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their potential.
Rashid Khan represents the greatest players in Afghanistan.
The Indian team has done something that is a model for the entire world.
When the Indian team bought the trophy, they called the Afghanistan team for the first time to participate in the International Competition and took photographs together.
My best wishes to the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that we will continue to play with each other's sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, the fourth Yoga Day on 21st June was presented as a different vision.
To see the whole world becomes one.
On the high snowy peak of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China performed Yoga together.
Yoga breaks all the boundaries and brings people together.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from over a hundred countries have turned this occasion into a big festival without any hesitation in caste, religion, region, colour and men.
It is natural for people all over the world to be so enthusiastic about Yoga Day programmes.
It is a matter of great pride for the country that 1. 25 billion people of our country have been practicing Yoga in our country's security forces, water and air.
Some Veer Sainiks performed Yoga at the inter-carriage and some performed Yoga on the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our air warriors performed Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth in the middle of the sky and strengthened everyone.
They performed Yoga in the sky, but not on the plane.
Yoga was conducted at schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports places.
Over the centuries, we have believed in the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.
Our sages, sages, saints and other sacred personalities have shown the emphasis on any subject in which Yoga literally puts it into practice.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives.
My dear countrymen, several people have written to me on MyGov and Narendra Modi App to mention Dress Day, which will be held on 1st July this year at Mann Ki Baat.
That's right.
Only if we have a problem will we remember the doctor.
However, this is a day to be a part of the achievements of our doctors and it is an occasion to thank them for their service and dedication to the society.
The role of a doctor is not confined to treating the disease.
Today, the doctor has a medical expertise, and he has a great experience of the common lifestyle and how it affects our lives.
With their capabilities and skills, Indian doctors have placed their mark all over the world.
The Prime Minister said that the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at a function in New Delhi.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my best wishes to all our doctors on the occasion of Doctors Day on 1st July.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate to be born in this land of India.
India has a rich history without any historic one month or day.
"Thank you very much for your phone call.
It's true I'm coming to Magahar on the 20th.
You know why he went to the graveyard
At that time there was a belief that those who died in Magahar would not have heavenly pleasure.
On the other hand, those who die in Kashi will have heavenly pleasure.
Maghar was considered indecent, but Saint Kabir did not believe it.
In today's era, they are the same source of inspiration.
That is, the true saint knows and understands the pain of others.
He who doesn't know the pain of others is ruthless.
At that time, there was an upheaval and conflict in the world and he conveyed the message of peace and harmony.
He united the minds of the world and worked to overcome disagreements.
His words are true even after centuries.
And a Guru is Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
He has guided millions of people, and has been a source of inspiration for centuries.
He taught Guru Nanak Dev to eradicate caste differences in the society, and to embrace humanity in all its forms and mankind.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, 'Serving the poor and the deprived is the service of God.'
Guru Nanak Devjis 50th Prakash Parv will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to participate in it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
I urge you all to think about new ideas, new ideas, new ideas and new ideas about how Guru Nanak Dev's fifth lighting festival should be celebrated in the society and around the world.
There is a history related to Punjab.
The horrific incident in Jallianwala Bagh, which has embarrassed the entire humanity, marks 100 years in 2019.
Dear Fellow Citizens, Shri Raman Kumar from Rohini in Delhi has written in the Narendra Modi Mobile App on 6th July, 2018.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was born.
He has written to the people about ShyamaprasadMukherji.
Ramanji, for the first time, thank you very much.
Dr.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation of the University of Calcutta in Bengali in 1937 on the invitation of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee.
It was for the first time that when the British ruled, somebody at the University of Calcutta had spoken in Bengali language at the Convocation.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
In a way, he laid a strong foundation for India and industrial development and built a strong foundation and built a strong platform.
In India's first industrial policy, which was declared in 1948, his ideas and visions were sealed.
It was his dream that India should be industrially self-reliant in all spheres and be skilled and prosperous.
He wanted the SMEs to focus on handlooms, clothing and cottage industries.
All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board, Khadi Village Industries Board and Khadi Village Industries Board were set up between 1948 and 1950 to provide them financial assistance and organizational support for the proper development of cottage and small scale industries.
Dr Jitendra Singh said that Indias defence manufacturing needs to be sustained.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee was the integrity of India, for which he had to sacrifice his life at the age of fifty-two.
Come on.
People talked about their imagination, comfort and achievements.
Girls in far-flung villages, through Common Service Centres, provide services ranging from pension to passport to senior citizens of the village.
A sister from Chhattisgarh runs an ice cream industry with cotton.
Like the ignorant light in Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters from the country are running medicine centres and providing low cost medicines to nearby villages.
A young man from West Bengal, who was wandering for employment two-three years ago, is successfully doing his own business today.
Not only that, they're giving jobs to 10 or 5 people.
School students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on key issues such as waste management at their young age in the tinkering lab.
There are some in society, without telling them disappointing things, without telling them about defeats, there will be no peace without finding ways to unify and unify.
In such a scenario, when the common man comes to know about ideas, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not the service of the government.
Even the incident of a small child in a remote village can be a source of inspiration for 1. 25 billion people.
With the help of technology, when I was spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge, it was very comfortable and inspiring to do something.
A new joy, a new zeal, a new zeal and a new inspiration is available to the poorest of the poor.
I am grateful to the people.
40-50 lakh people connected with this video bridge and gave me a new strength.
We'll feel the fragrance of good.
Something came to my attention the other day, it was a very different experience.
In connection with the farmers, schemes have been formulated and worked successfully to increase the income of the farmers.
In a way, the farmers have a huge role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing, and at the same time, they are trying to ensure that the farmers share double profits and better seeds are needed to improve their crops.
The seed bank has been built for it.
Women are looking for things in this seedbank and women are also associated with it.
Something I know, some I don't know, some people know, some people don't know, but millions of people continuously do some good things, and everybody's best wishes.
My dear countrymen, GST is going on for a year.
One Nation One Tax was the dream of people, and today it is really transformed.
People from different political ideologies, people from different states, people from different priorities, but all the decisions taken in the GST Council so far are unanimous.
Before the GST, there were several types of taxes in the country and only one type of tax in the country was conducted.
GST is a success of honesty, it is a festival of honesty.
Earlier, the complaint of Inspector Raj regarding taxes in the country was raised.
The GST replaces the inspector with IT and Information Technology.
From Return to Refund, everything is being done online through IT.
Perhaps GST was perhaps the largest tax reform in the world.
In India, such a massive tax reform has been undertaken that it has been accepted by the people of the country that the success of GST can be ensured through Jan Shakti.
It was generally thought that such a big reform would take 5-7 years for such a large population to succeed everywhere in such a big country.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Good morning.
Navika Sagar Parikrama Yes, I would like to say something about them.
These six daughters of India, their group, have returned to India on May 21, after roaming around the world in the maritime dockyard of INSV.
The entire nation welcomed them with enthusiasm.
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet these daughters to listen to their travel opportunities.
Once again I congratulate the world for once again showing the courage of those daughters, for enhancing the capabilities of the Navy, for enhancing the dignity of India, especially the women of India, not at all bad.
Nobody has adventure.
If we look at the development journey of mankind then we can see that progress has been made from the womb of any courage.
Development is on the verge of adventure.
On May 16, 5 tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhrue, Pramesh Ale, Umakanta Madavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam climbed the worlds highest peak.
The school children started their training on August 2017 at Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were selected under Mashin Shaurya.
They have made the country proud by conquering Everest in accordance with their names.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to all those associated with Chandrapur School, to these youngsters.
At present, the 16-year-old Shivangi Teacher was the youngest Indian girl to win Everest from Nepal.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to all those brave hearts, especially the daughters.
Tag each other and challenge them.
Everyone has joined this Fit India Movement.
The film industry, the sportspersons, the common man of the country, the soldiers of the army and the teachers of the school participated in it and heard its tunes from all sides.
If we fit, India and fit...
Captain Vrinda Kohli of the Indian Cricket Team has challenged me and I have accepted his challenge and this is a good thing.
Such a challenge will encourage us to fit along with others.
My dear countrymen, I have heard several times about sports and sportspersons in Mann Ki Baat.
Last time the heroes of Commonwealth Games spoke to us through this programme, Namaskar sir.
"Chavi Yadav ji, thank you very much for phone calls.
It is true that the games that were a part of every child's life in the streets of the past are coming down today.
These games were particularly part of the summer.
Sometimes at noon, sometimes at night, the children used to play for hours without worry.
Outdoor and Indore.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games.
The same game is known by different names at different places.
I'm from Gujarat.
A game in Gujarat is known as Chomal Isto.
It's playing with a wheel, or a mule, or a staircase, using an 8:8 size marble.
This game was often played in all the states.
In Karnataka, it was called Chaukabara in Madhya Pradesh and Paddi in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra and Dyayayam in Tamil Nadu and Changpo in Rajasthan.
But when you play, you know, people of all countries don't know the language, yes,
I'll tell you we're playing this game too.
Anyone who doesn't play kids or cocks when he's a kid.
The game was played in children, colonies and cities.
It has received various names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it was called Godibila or Karra Billa.
In Odisha it is called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vittillu.
Some games have their own weather, Season.
Like the season to fly the silk.
When everybody flys a silk, everybody will be able to express the different qualities of ourselves without any hesitation.
The big ones will be serious, but when they play, the child that is hiding in them comes out.
Traditional sports, along with physical talent, promote our rational thinking, concentration, awareness and skilfulness.
At the same time, we know our culture and traditions.
Many games make us aware of society and environment.
We can bring together people and create a large collection of our traditional games.
This time, the theme is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I urge all of you not to use polyethylene, low quality plastic to understand the importance of this theme and try to minimize the impact of plastic waste on nature, wildlife on our health.
Look at the enormous suggestions made by the World Environment Day website wed-india 2018 in an attractive manner and try to implement them in day-to-day life.
When it's very hot, when it's not over, when it's cold, everybody starts talking about global waming, climate changing like experts.
Is it funny to say that
All this is fundamentally climate change, its consequences.
Our culture has not taught us to fight our traditions with nature.
We must live in harmony with nature and live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi fought for this in all his life and every step.
Today, India speaks of climate justice, India has played a key role in the Cop21 Paris Agreement, and we have united the world through the International Solar Alliance.
How can we go ahead with this
What can be done as new
It's raining.
Preparations are being made to observe the International Day of Yoga on 21st June worldwide.
The world has repeatedly understood the Yoga for Unity for Unity in the last few years.
Yoga always dares to preserve us like a father.
If these qualities become a friend of somebody, the Yogi triumphs over all kinds of fear.
Once again I urge all the people to build a healthy, prosperous and good nation to promote our legacy of Yoga.
My dear countrymen, today is 27th May, the day marks the memory of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India.
Panditji's messages...
This month's memories are associated with another person.
In May 1957, Indians showed their strength to English.
The warrior wrote that the 1857 war was not a quarrel, but the first fight for freedom.
Savarkar's life was full of peculiarities.
But beyond that, he was a great poet and a social reformer, who always gave importance to harmony and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji has written a very good account of Savarkar ji.
Savarkar took poetry and revolution together.
He was a sensitive poet and a brave revolutionary.
If there is an excitement to do something, then it is possible to achieve success in all obstacles.
This is not just a matter of Seeker but you can see it in every corner of India.
If you look around, you'll see how people fail to resist restrictions.
When we still go to a tea stall, when we enjoy tea there, we must have noticed that there are some nearby discussions and discussions.
These discussions may be politically related, socially, films, sports and sportspersons, and the country's problems.
You will be surprised to know that he is the light of education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He opened a school in the name of Asha-Ashwasan for children living in streets and slums and for this, the poor tear spends fifty percent of his income.
He provides education, health and food to all school going children.
I'm D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his dedication and dedication and giving a new direction to the lives of the poor children.
He has deprived the darkness of their lives.
There must have been a lot of things going on with you.
There will be innumerable incidents.
Come on, let's encourage good.
We'll wait for the moon for a few days.
I hope that everyone will celebrate this festival with enthusiasm and special gifts will be given to the children on this occasion.
I hope Eid strengthens harmony and friendship in our society.
My best wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
We'll get together in Manki Baat next month.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from April 4-15.
71 countries including India participated in the event.
Imagine what would happen when thousands of sportspersons from all over the world participated in such a big event.
Encouragement, excitement, hope and hope, and determination to achieve, who can stay away from it in a concerted atmosphere.
India recorded records in filming, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis and badminton.
India won 66 medals, including 26 gold, 20 silver and 20 bronze.
This victory will make every Indian proud.
Everything drowned in the same feeling.
Words will diminish to clarify that feeling.
But I'd like to hear you from the players.
It was my dream to be a good player for India and Manipur.
Do you know that all the restaurants who have gone to participate in India this time have won the medal
Manika Batra won the medal in these events.
She is the first Indian woman to have won the Gold Medal for India at the Personal Table Tennis.
India received the highest number of medals in shooting.
Fifteen year old filmmaker Anish Bhanwala is the youngest player to win gold medal for India at the Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Para Power Lifter who has won medal in the Commonwealth Games for India.
This time, women are more than medal winners.
Whether it is squash or boxing or weight lifting or filming, women wondered.
The last fight in Badminton was Indias two sportspersons Saina Nehwal and P.
Sindhu was with him.
Everyone was enthusiastic that even though the competition was over, both the medals would be made for India.
The sportspersons at the Games went from different parts of the country to smaller towns.
They have the role of their powerful friends in every corner.
Last month in Mann Ki Baat, I had called upon the people, especially the youth, Fit India.
Come, collaborate with Fit India and urge them to lead Fit India.
I am very happy that people are very enthusiastic about joining this.
Shared by Sharing his own picture at Bhosley Swimming Pool, My Weapon Easy Body, My Element Eas Water, My World Easy Swimming...
Sharing his own picture of Dhawal Prajapati trekking, Fit India is a journey and trekking for me.
It was a pleasure to see many of the renowned people inspire our youth for Fit India in a very attractive manner.
Sanima Kalakaran Akshay Kumar has shared a video on the occasion.
You must see that he's exercising with Wooden Beed.
He says that this exercise is very good for outer and stomach muscles.
There's another video in the publicity.
He's playing volleyball with people.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences related to Fit India efforts.
I think such initiatives are very beneficial for all of us and the entire country.
There is one more thing to say, Yoga is the name of the inexpensive Fit India Movement.
Yoga has a special significance in the Fit India programme and you must have been preparing for it.
The significance of the International Day of Yoga on 21st June has now been recognized by the entire world.
You'll be ready now.
Your city, your village, your colony, your school, your college, everywhere, everywhere, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, every man or woman, must make efforts to connect with Yoga.
Today, in India or elsewhere in the world, there is no need to specifically explain how Yoga is beneficial for the overall development of the body, mental development and mental balance.
You must have seen that my animated video is very popular.
And they've done what they need to show a teacher very closely through animation.
You'll also get the benefit.
I'd like to say something by inviting you to a new job.
Many youngsters spend their time learning something new these days.
Otherwise, the internship offers a new experience in its own way.
Outside the four walls, life gets an opportunity to live a new way out of paper, pen and computer.
My young friends, I invite you to a special internship.
The Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018 has been launched in collaboration with three Ministries of Government of India - Ministry of Sports, Human Resource Development and Ministry of Drinking Water.
Students from colleges, youngsters from NCC, NSS and Nehru Yuva Kendra Volunteers, if they want to do something for the country, if they want to learn something for the society and the country, if they want to join it for the transformation of the society and if they want to do something for it then they can join it.
This will provide support and strength to Swachhta and will enjoy doing something before it on 2nd October, when we celebrate the centenary birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The awards will be given at the national level to the best participants, the best performing in colleges and the best performing in the university.
Not only this, the UGC will give two credit points to those who complete the best.
Students, students and youngsters are being invited to internship once more and benefit from it.
You can go to MyGov and register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope that our youth will come forward in this campaign for cleanliness.
I'm eager to know about your efforts.
Tell me what you know, tell me about the events, send the picture, send the video.
Use this vacation for a new experience.
Everyone wants to appeal to the people to see that how many people in every corner of our country do good things, how good things are happening, how good things are happening.
I have seen the story of the youth who are selflessly gathering for the education of the poor children.
A grand programme has been started to educate the children living in the streets of Dalli and children living in the hut.
The children who were begging on the roadside or who were doing a small job grabbed them so they left for this creative activity.
The youngsters and teachers associated with this programme have moved from their busy life to two hours and have made this serious effort for social transformation.
Brothers and sisters, similarly, some farmers in the mountainous region of Uttarakhand are a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
They not only made their own efforts but also changed the fate of the region.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand is mainly cultivated by Ragi, Chaulai, corn or barley.
Being a hilly area, farmers did not get the price they deserved.
This biscuit with iron ore is very beneficial for pregnant women.
This farmer created a cooperative movement in Munar village and started a biscuit manufacturing factory there.
Having seen the courage of the farmers, the government has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit is now reaching not only in Bageshwar district but also in 50 Anganwadi centers, Almora and Casani.
Under the aegis of the farmers, the annual turnover of the team has not only reached Rs. 10-15 lakhs, but it has also reduced the number of people going out of the district due to employment opportunities for more than 900 families.
Do we think water conservation should be a social responsibility
Imagine how to protect every rainbow.
We know that water conservation is not a new subject in the minds of Indians.
Not only the subject of books, but also the subject of language.
Our ancestors have lived this for centuries.
They gave priority to the glory of each drop of water.
They're looking for new ways to keep every drop of water.
There are large inscriptions at Manar Kovil, Chiranmahadevi, Kovilpatti and Pudukotai and many ponds are still like tourist centres.
But do not forget that these huge reservoirs of water harvesting are living examples of the efforts of our ancestors.
The UNESCO World Heritage Centres (UNESCO) are the well-known ponds at Adalaj and Patan in Gujarat.
These ponds are in a way Jal Mandir .
If you go to Rajasthan, you must go to Chandbawadi in Jodhpur.
This is one of the largest and most beautiful Bavadi (Kulam) in India, which is a water deficient region.
The time of April, May, June and July is the best time for rain water conservation and the amount of preparation that we are making earlier will also be benefitted.
In the last three years, water conservation and water management have done something in their own way.
In 2017-18, Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent on 55 of total expenditure, i. e.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted by such water conservation and water management.
With the help of people from around 40-45 villages, the dry Sasur and Khadreri rivers have been revived.
Be it animals or birds or farmers or farmlands or villages, how blessed is this victory for all of them.
Anankumar Banerjee, from Devitola village in North 24 Fargan districts of West Bengal, has said that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know about the vision of living peacefully, beautifully and inclusively.
Please, people should discuss this issue in the Manki Baat programme to know about this.
His penance was a magnificent seal for everyone, a brilliant personality and a multi-disciplinary personality.
I had the habit of listening to it... but it's my habit to wake up in the morning and listen to the Rabindra Sangeet on the radio...
You too must have been impressed by his poems.
I salute Rabindranath Tagore on this occasion.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated with due respect and respect throughout the world.
The social side of fasting is that when man is hungry himself, he knows the hunger of others.
When we thirst ourselves, we can feel the thirst of others.
Once a man asked the prophet what was best in Islam.
The Prophet replied, Give food to any poor or hungry person and behave with everyone, whether you know or not.
People give donations to those who deserve this holy month.
According to the Prophet Muhammad, a person is rich not only because of a sacred soul but also because of wealth and wealth.
We must be honoured to note that India is the land of Lord Buddha, showing the strength of compassion, service and sacrifice, he showed the way to millions all over the world.
Recalling this entire Buddha, Lord Buddha reminds us of our responsibilities to strive, resolve and live in accordance with the path shown by him.
Lord Buddha is the driving force of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is the most important human value in the world today.
Buddha's inspiration is immense in Babasaheb Ambedkar's social vision.
Baba Saheb has said - My social vision has been established in three words - freedom, equality and brotherhood.
The roots of my philosophy are religion, not psychology.
I have imbibed them from my Master Buddha.
The hard-working, exploited, deprived and marginalized millions have been empowered through the Baba Saheb Constitution.
There is no greater example of compassion.
This compassion for the people was one of the greatest virtues of Lord Buddha.
The advice of Lord Buddha is traditionally available anywhere in Asia.
I am glad that the Government of India is participating in the revival of several Buddhist temples, including the magnificent Ananda Temple of Myanmar centuries ago.
Today, there is a scene of conflict and humanitarian pain all over the world and the advice of Lord Buddha shows the way to avoid hatred with compassion.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all those around the world who believe in the principles of compassion and respect for Lord Buddha.
For the entire world, I pray for the blessings of Lord Buddha to fulfil my responsibilities for a peaceful, compassionate world building based on his teachings.
The people of India spread all over the world have got a new confidence.
It was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On May 11, 1998, at Pokhran, Rajasthan, on the west coast of India.
It is now twenty years since the day of Buddha Purnima was celebrated with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
India's experiment became successful and India showed talent in science and technology.
The day is marked as an exhibition of military power in Indian history.
Lord Buddha showed the world that the strength of the inner soul is necessary for peace.
And when you become strong as a nation, you will be able to live peacefully with everyone.
It is not only because of its nuclear testing in May 1998, but also because it is important for the country.
India's land is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India will scale new heights and goals.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave a mantra, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan...

I touched my heart with so many letters, so many phone calls and comments that I read and heard...
I'll have to talk for months, even if I talk about them.
I told you about the water for birds in the summer.
There are letters from farmers and brothers and sisters regarding the issue of Kisan Melas and farming across the country.
Some people have sent suggestions about water conservation.
Our festivals, our culture and our traditions will be commemorated in the festival season.
Why don't you change in these things, in these experiences, in these examples, there is so much inspiration, energy, commitment and enthusiasm to do something for the country.
It has the potential to transform the country.
When I get to know through the letter that a rickshaw driver from Karingenj in Assam, Ahmed Ali, has built 9 schools for the poor children through his will power, I can see the country's indomitable will power.
When we heard the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhary going to the footpath in Kanpur and examining the poor and giving them free medicines, there was an opportunity to understand the people of this country.

Many such inspirations introduce my country.
Today, the world's vision for India has changed.
We are moving ahead amongst all sections of society, there is a belief that our country is moving forward.
This confidence, this positivity will help to realize our resolve for a New India, and it will be a dream-worthy one.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This has led to a lot of letters related to agriculture.
This time, I saw a video of discussions with farmers on Doordarshan's DD Kisan Channel and all the farmers should contact DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan.
The feeling that Mahatma Gandhi was interested in soil, agriculture and farming, he said, To forget how to diagnose the world and to tell the soil, is forget hours.
Similarly, Lal physicists strongly advocated the conservation of trees, plants and trees, and the need to implement good farming practices.

In a speech in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh urged the farmers to use new technologies and innovations and stressed the need for them.
I went to the Krishi Unnati Mela organised in Delhi last day.
It was a pleasant experience for me to have discussions with farmer brothers and sisters and scientists, to know, understand, and to know new findings related to agriculture.
But the Meghalaya influenced me the most and the farmers of that region.
This very small state has seen a great deal of work.
Our farmers in Meghalaya produced records in 2015-16 as compared to the previous five years.
In detail, when I mention the MSP, the wages of other workers in the small amount spent, their cattle, machines or rented cattle, the cost of the machine, the price of the seed, the cost of all types of fertilizers used, the cost of irrigation, the interest paid on the state capital, the interest paid on the working capital, the rent paid to the landlord, not only this, but also the under-privilege of the farmer or his family, who is working in the field of agriculture, etc.
Besides, a huge amount of work is being done for agricultural market reforms in the country to provide fair price to the farmers.
Efforts are being made to connect the rural markets with the markets and global markets in Holsey.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the centenary year of Mahatma Gandhi.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our resolve.
Besides, how can a hundred twenty five crore people pay the best tributes to Gandhiji, shoulder to shoulder
I appeal to all of you to share your views with MyGov.
What should be Gandhi 150's logo
Slogan, spell, or what should be a celebration
Today, in the field of health, the country has moved from traditional methods.
The Ministry of Health was responsible for everything related to health in the country.
Today, all departments and Ministries are working together for a healthy India, be it the Swachhta Ministry or the Ministry of AYUSH or be it the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments.
Immunization is the cheapest and easiest healthcare.
The more aware we are against disease, the more it benefits the individual, the family and the society.
If life is to be healthy then cleanliness is the first thing that is needed.
As a nation, we have taken the challenge together and as a result, sanitary coverage has doubled to almost 80 in four years.
Besides, comprehensive work is underway for setting up of healthcare centres across the country.
Today, Yoga has become a mass movement, it is because of the dedication of all of us to home.
This time, the International Day of Yoga is just 100 days left to reach 21st June.
In the last three International Yoga Days, people from all over the world have participated with great enthusiasm.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends and everyone to do Yoga.
Innovative methods of Yoga must inspire children, youth and senior citizens.
A number of Yoga related events are being organized throughout the year on TV and electronic media.
Can we create an awakening in the field of Yoga from now onwards to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga.
I'll share the video with you... so that we can practice asanas and pranayamas together.
They'll be very helpful.
The rate of heart stent for heart patients has come down to 85 percent.

My dear countrymen, on 14th April, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Morocco.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
For him, industry was a good medium to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when we successfully launch the Make in India campaign in the country, Dr.
In keeping with his vision, the Smart Cities Mission and Urban Cities Mission have been launched in the country today, to provide all kinds of facilities in big cities and small towns of the country - be it water supply, health facilities or education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had great faith in self-reliance.
He wanted no person to live in poverty forever.
At the same time, he believed that his poverty could not be overcome only by giving width to the poor.
Today, the start-ups like Mudra Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India are giving birth to our youngsters.
He emphasized the importance of water consumption for the development of the country and various river valley authorities, various water related commissions and all are born in the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today, efforts are being made to reduce the history of waterways and ports in the country.
He emphasized the importance of federalism, federalism and working together between the Centre and the States for the growth of the country.
He showed that it is not necessary for us to be born in a big or wealthy family to scale higher heights, but for those born in a poor family in India, we can dream of dreams, we can make efforts to realise those dreams and we can achieve success.
He has made fun of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Accordingly, there will be special programmes on Rural Development, Poverty Welfare and Social Justice in India.
I urge all of you to take part in these programmes with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are coming in the days to come, the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavira, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Vaishakhi.
On the occasion of Lord Mahavir's Jayanti, it should be remembered for his sacrifice and penance.
The life and vision of Lord Mahavir Ji, the messenger of non-violence, will inspire all of us.
Greetings to all people on Mahavir Jayanti.
When you talk about Easter, you will remember the inspiring advice of Jesus Christ, who gave a message of peace, harmony and justice and compassion to humanity.
Vaishakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India in April.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science and they have written a few things.
We see the colour of the ocean blue, but we understand from our experience that the water is not colored.
Have we ever imagined why the water on the river or the sea looks colorful
The same question arose in the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This is the question that a scientist was born in modern India.
Now, when we talk about science, India is the first Indian to emerge as a CSIR.
One of his findings is known as Raman Effect.
It is said that this is the day when he found the truth of light skatering and this is why he received the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana, scientists like Satyendra Nath Bose are also proud of India.
The famous Boson Party has been named after Satyendra Nath Bose.
Recently, I got the opportunity to participate in an event in Mumbai and the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was heartening to know about the wonders in the field of science.
The Artificial Intelligence will help in the manufacture of robots, boots and other definite machines.
Now machines are making their brain smarter by self learning.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor and the poor.
In this programme on Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientific community how Artificial Intelligence can help in ease of living for Divyang brothers and sisters.
Can we know better about natural calamities through artificial intelligence
Can farmers help in farm production
Whether Artificial Intelligence has made it easier to deliver healthcare services to all, and whether it is possible to treat diseases in a modern way
Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in the inauguration of I Create programme in Ahmedabad, Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel.
There's a young man talking about developing a digital device.
I think many such things can use artificial intelligence.
Scientific technologies can be called Value Neutral.
Any machine we want will be doing.
But what we want to do with the machine depends on us.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the illuminating bulb, failed several times in his experiment.
Once he asked me about this, he replied, "I looked for ten thousand ways to find the bulb.
That is, Edison has made his own failures stronger.
Fortunately, let me say good luck that today I am in Aravalli, the land of Maharshi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British regime, fought against them and raised questions to British India.
The idea of questioning again and again is important to know the truth.
This is the real motivation behind scientific inventions.
Why, don't be calm until you get answers to what and how.
On this occasion of National Science Day, I extend my best wishes to the scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, I get a lot of messages on all subjects such as safety and disasters during the crisis, people write to me something related to it.
Shri Ravindra Singh from Pune and the Narendra Modi Mobile App have been deputed on safety in the jobs sector.
He has written that safety norms do not exist in factories and manufacturing in our country.
Next March is Indias National Safety Day, he said that people should also talk about safety in the Prime Ministers Mann Ki Baat programme, so that people are aware of safety.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important, both initiatives and preparation.
One that takes place at the time of accident - safety , during , disastrous and other necessity in daily life - safety in daily life .
If we are not aware of safety in everyday life, if there is no such consciousness, it is difficult to be at risk.
We must have often written in the boards on the way: "If you don't mind, the accident will certainly harm you, it will lose happiness and laughter and ensure safety without leaving the world so fast.
I would like to say that the fire brigades in the cities of Fire Brigade should go to schools once a week or once a month to showcase the mock drills in front of the children.
Therefore, there will be two benefits, the fire brigade will have the habit of being cautious and the new generation will be able to know a lot about it.
In terms of risks, India is a country of diversity, geographical and climate change.
This country has faced many disasters like natural calamities, chemical accidents and industrial accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is at the forefront of tackling the menace of accidents in the country.
NDMA is rapidly reaching out to rescue operations in various accidents like earthquakes, floods, cyclones and landslides.
Till two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives annually due to the heat wave.
Heat wave deaths in 2017 have come down significantly from around 220 in 2017.
It can be understood from this that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people, social organisations and vigilant citizens in the society, I compliment all those who have come with the path of safety in minutes whenever there is a danger.
The number of such unnamed heroes is no less.
Our Fire and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces, etc. , have reached the catastrophe and are helping the brave people without losing their lives.
We have to make a society that cares about the danger.
In our culture, we preserve values, often talk about protective values, but we have to understand the values of security.
We have to make it part of our lives.
In our normal life, we travel by planes hundreds of times, we see air hostess initially warning about safety.
We must have heard it a hundred times, but somebody takes us to the plane and tell us where everything is, where is the life jacket
So our ears on the plane have a habit of listening, but we don't think these warnings are with me.
This is what happens in every sphere of life.
We shouldn't think of security for anyone else.
If all of us are conscious of our security, the feeling of security of society must have been incorporated in it.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, we had given importance to the topic of 'waste to wealth' and 'waste to energy' in biotechnology.
The Gobardhan scheme aims at cleaning the villages, replacing the fodder of the grown animals, residue of farmlands, composta and bio-dairy, thereby generating wealth and energy.
The number of cattle in India is the highest in the world, with around 300 million cattle and their snack production is around 3 million tonnes per day.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen scheme, we are also moving forward in this regard.
The Gobardhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in keeping the village clean.
I invite you to become a part of this mass movement called Clean Energy and Green Job, to make the waste of your village rich and transform the waste into silk fertilizers.
My dear countrymen, we have so far heard about a variety of festivals such as the Music Festival, Food Festival, Film Festival.
However, as a unique initiative in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the first Churum Festival of the State was held.
The objective of the festival organized by Raipur Kaziranga was to create awareness about cleanliness and to make awareness about the unique methods of constructive use of waste and reuse of waste in the city.
Several programmes have been organized during this festival and the elderly people have participated in it.
Inspired by the programme in Raipur, different fertilizers were organized in other districts.
Everyone, in their own way, shared new ideas on sanitation, discussed and composed poetry.
The importance of dirt and hygiene was presented in a renewed manner in which the people of Raipur, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the rulers of Chhattisgarh, congratulated everyone.
Every year on March 8, International Women's Day is celebrated.
A lot of programmes are being organized in our country and around the world.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today presented the Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country and felicitated all those who have done exemplary work in various fields.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development beyond women's development.
On this occasion, I recall the words of Swami Vivekananda.
He said that the idea of complete womenhood is complete freedom, and this idea, which Swami ji had forwarded 25 years ago, shows the perception of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equitable participation of women in all spheres of social and economic life, and it is our responsibility.
We are a part of the tradition of recognizing men in the name of women, the children are known as Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, the Gandhari-Puthan.
Today, our women power expresses self-confidence and self-confidence through their actions.
They carried the country and society forward with their own progress and brought them to a new goal.
Our vision of New India is ultimately a partnership with women-powered, empowered and nation-wide holistic development.
There can be many examples of what women power can do and stories like this can be seen inspiring life by looking around.
I got an idea from Jharkhand.
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, 15 lakh women in Jharkhand should not be less this number - 15 lakh women organized a cleanliness drive for one month.
These women of Jharkhand have demonstrated that Swachhta Abhiyan can become a habit of the common man in normal life.
Brothers and sisters, two days ago, in three villages of Elephanta Island, after 70 years of independence, people had seen how happy the people there were.
You know that Elephanta Island is 10 km away from Mumbai.
This is an attractive tourist destination.
I congratulate the government and the people there.
I am glad that the villages and caves of Elephanta will now see the light of electricity.
This is not only electrification but also a new beginning of development.
May the light shine in the lives of people, may there be happiness in life... when will there be more joy and enthusiasm than this
My dear countrymen, we celebrated Shivratri the last day.
It is time to cultivate abundant agricultural land, refrigerated wheat, other golden harvests and boiling mangoes in the month of March, which is the unique feature of this month.
And as Holi is celebrated this month, it is a month of dearness for everyone.
On March 2, everyone will celebrate Holi with joy.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat 2018
For the first time in history, the rulers of 10 countries participated in this celebration.
On 1st February, he will pay attention to the commemoration of Kalpana Chaula, who carried out the expedition.
We were separated from the accident in the Colombia space ship but they inspired millions of youngsters around the world.
Everyone is saddened by the loss of Kalpana Chaula at such a young age.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that in India, these women are fast moving forward in all spheres and enhancing the pride of the country.
In ancient times, the respect for women of our country, their place in the society, their contributions, all over the world is astonishing.
There is a long tradition of Indian adults.
I tell you about Bai Bachao, Bai Padhao.
In ancient times, writers say in Skandapuran: Dashuputra, Samanya, Dashuputra Karmyam, this is the result of availability of Martha, Tatya availability of virginity.
I mean, a daughter is equal to ten sons. Ten sons will get their respect in one daughter.
This shows the importance of women in our society.
That is why in our society women have been given the status of strength.
This woman power embraces the whole country, the entire society, the entire family, in the spirit of unity.
Whether it is the scholarship of the priests of Lapamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi, the knowledge and devotion of Akamahadevi and Meerabai, be it the ruler of Ahalyabai Holcker, the courage of Rani Laxmibai, women power inspires us.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering.
Prakash Trishani continues to give several examples.
Our brave Raksha Mantri, Nirmala Sitharaman, wrote that it is inspiring to fly a fighter plane on May 30.
Under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, the women members of the Indian Navy have written about the world tourism in INSV Tarini.
He mentioned the brave women, Bhavna Kant, Mohana Singh, who were pilots of Chaturvedi Eve Warfare and trained in Sukhoi 30.
The women, led by Kakatiya Vajpayee, are proud to fly to San Francisco, USA and Delhi in Air India's Boeing Jet.
Remember every woman...
These women - the first female marchant navy captain, the first female train driver on the voyage train, the first female firefighter - the first female bus driver, the first woman in Antarctica, the first woman in Everest, the first woman in Everest, and for the first time in all these fields, the first woman who took the lead in breaking the establishment of our women power society, embraced extraordinary vision.
They gave a clarion call to all the obstacles and obstacles in the form of hard work, deliberate action and determination.
Not only their contemporary people, but also the future generations.
A new zeal and inspiration will fill them.
A book on these women who have taken NEEM should be prepared so that all the people of the country should know about this woman power and you should take inspiration from her work in her life.
This is available for e-books on the Narendra Modi website.
Women power has an important role to play in the positive transformation that is taking place in the country and society.
When we talk about women empowerment, we want to talk about a railway station.
You must have imagined the relationship between railway station and women empowerment.
Maunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India for every worker.
Empowerment is a form of self-sufficiency.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh is an area of Maoism-Pacific.
Violence, invasions, bombs, guns, pistols... the Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere.
Tribal women are getting self-sufficiency in such a terrible area by driving e-Orissa.
In a short span of time, a lot of women have been associated with it.
In addition to this, it will also strengthen the environmental protection.
The district administration has played an important role in the success of these women since the establishment of the Grand Finale and the establishment of the Grand Finale.
Over the centuries, in our society, individuals and socially continue to strive against social evils and evils.
A few days ago, we started such a beginning in Bihar.
In order to eradicate social evils from roots in the state, the world's largest human chain has been built at a length of thirteen thousand kilometers.
Through this envelope, he awakened the social conscience against the evils of child marriage, women's system, etc.
The state has resolved to fight evils such as women's wedlock and child marriage.
The youngsters, mothers and sisters of Kundi and adults, who are enthusiastic and enthusiastic, have participated in this movement.
Mann Ki Baat started in the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna without interfering with the border of the State.
Societies must be free from evils in order to ensure that everyone in the society gets the rightful role of development.
Come, let us pledge to free our society from evils and create a New India, a strong and capable India.
He was unaware of the Pradhan Mantri Janaushadhi Pariyojana.
Eli now knew about the Janaushadhi scheme, and when you started buying deserts, the desert spending fell by 75 percent.
Over the last few days, a lot of people had written about it and had said it to me.
The objective behind this scheme is to make healthcare affordable and enhance ease of living.
Deserts available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are 50 to 90 less than the branded deer sold here.
That's why quality deer are available at a lower price.
More than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
There is not only a desert price but also a new employment opportunity for individuals who want to find jobs.
Priceless deer are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) and at Amrit stores in hospitals.
All this has the only purpose in PIL - to provide affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country and to create a healthy, prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi App.
I am told that the citizens of Akola have also organized a cleanliness drive to clean the river Morna as per the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna river flows for twelve months before, and the Ellis flows only during the rainy season.
The river is full of flowers and potatoes and it is painful.
A lot of waste is thrown out of the river and its banks.
Formulation of an action plan, on January 13, a day before Makar Sankranti, on the first step of Mission Clean Morna, the two sides of the Morna River were cleaned up at 14 locations in four kilometers.
More than 4,000 people from Akola, more than 100 NGOs, college-school students, wells, adults, mothers and sisters participated in the Mission Clean Morna.
On 20th January, 2018, the Swachhata Hi Seva movement continued and the programme will continue in the morning till the river Morna becomes completely waste-free.
It's not impossible for anyone to do something.
A massive change can be brought about through the mass movement.
Congratulations to the people of Akola, the district administration and the colonial rulers for making this work a mass movement and your efforts will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of Padma awards these days.
Newspapers and television are getting news about this.
It is a common practice to give Padma awards every year, but it has changed its way over the last three years.
Any citizen can nominate anyone.
All the processes have been made online so that transparency is available in it.
In a way, the electoral process for these awards has changed completely.
Generally, Padma Awards will be given to those who do not appear in cities, newspapers, TV and conferences.
The award for Arvind Gupta will be given by Kay.
Being a student of IIT Kanpur, you will be happy to know that Kay has dedicated your life to making toys for these Aravindan Kudis.
He has been making toys with luggage for four decades, leaving the scientific temperament to grow in Kundi.
He tried to motivate the Kundis to undertake scientific experiments with abandoned goods.
For this, films made in 18 languages in 3000 schools across the country inspire Kai Kudis.
Make wonders that life is dedicated to wonders.
One such story is also the story of Sitha Jodatti of Karnataka.
The goddess of women's empowerment doesn't mean nothing.
They have contributed greatly to the transformation of the lives of innumerable women in the last three decades.
He dedicated himself as a goddess when he was seventy years old, and dedicated his life to the good of the gods and goddesses.
Not only this, Mercenarius has done an unprecedented act for women's good.
Because of this interest, the whole world is respected not only in India but also in India.
He will showcase his films in countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
He gave him Padma Shri, the recognition of the talent of Majum Shyam, the renowned Indian at home.
You will be surprised to see the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmiku.
Laxmiku lives in Kallar A place and lives in the tribal areas of Kodumka.
Five hundred green trees are made by their own memories.
There is a lot of privilege in making desert for the serpent.
Lakshmiji continues to serve the society through her own knowledge of greenery.
The world's renowned personality is recognised by Padma Shri to contribute to society.
At the age of 23, her husband died without medical treatment and this incident inspired the poor to build a hospital.
Thousands of poor people will be treated free of cost at the hospital built through their hard work.
Sometimes they should be invited to schools and colleges and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the awards, there must be some social effort.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
On 9th January, you returned to India in South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the unprecedented relations with Indians living in India and around the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, we have organized a programme to invite rooted Parliamentarians and mayors from all over the world.
In Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Brian, Suriname, South Africa and America, you and the members of the Parliament of India participated in the event.
I am glad that people of different countries live in India, people of different roots serve those countries and they continue to have strong ties with India, and this time the European Union has sent me calendar.
Our people of Indian origin live in different countries of Europe - some work with cyber security, some are dedicated to Ayurveda, some are composing poetry through their music.
30th January is a memorial day of revered father who gave us a new path.
On the occasion of martyrdom day, we pay homage to the great martyrs who laid down their lives for the cause of security, at 11 o'clock.
They're not just theories.
My dear countrymen, congratulating all of you on the auspicious occasion of 2018, end my speech.
Mann Ki Baat, 2017
This is the last edition of Mann Ki Baat this year and the last day of 2017.
I have shared a lot of things with you this year.
Years will change after a few hours, but the sharing of our ideas will continue.
On the occasion of Christmas, we remember the great teachings of Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ gave great importance to the spirit of service.
We see the essence of service in the Bible.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramahamsar used to say, We have to live our lives with vigour.
Extraordinary life filled with courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
In this attempt, he had to personally lose a lot of things.
It was a very fortunate occasion for me to participate in the Festival of Light organised in Patna Sahib on the occasion of the 30th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh earlier this year.
Let us decide with all our hearts that we will learn lessons from the great lessons taught by Guru Gobind Singh and the life that is inspiring.
January 1, 2018, meaning tomorrow...
Tomorrow is a special day for me.
But when I say it is special, I reiterate that the truth is special.
Indian democracy welcomes voters from the 21st century and voters from the New India.
This whole India is encouraging you to welcome you as voters in the 21st century.
You must be proud to be a voter in the 21st century.
Your vote will be based on New India.
The strength of the vote is the greatest strength of democracy.
Voting is one of the most competent in bringing about a progressive change in the lives of millions.
You don't have the right to vote.
You can also become the creators of the twenty-first century by thinking about how India should be in the 21st century, what your dream of India should be in the 21st century.
The youth of New India is synonymous with enthusiasm, zeal and energy.
The dream of New India is realised through our vibrant, skilled and powerful youth.
When we talk about New India, it is about a free India from casteism, casteism, terrorism and the poison of corruption.
An India free from waste and poverty.
Everyone gets equal opportunity, New India is fulfilling the aspirations of everyone.
New India is a power that guides us in peace, unity and harmony.
My New India Youth must come forward and analyze how New India will emerge.
How can we realize our concepts before 2022
How can we create an India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi had made the freedom struggle a mass movement.
My young friends, we must organize a mass movement to create a divine and divine India of the 21st century.
The progress of the people, the progress of the progress, and the progress of the people for a capable and capable India.
Today, a lot of opportunities have been opened for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and industry entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and succeeding.
I would like to imagine how the youngsters of this New India can get the knowledge of such opportunities and I would like them to come up with a system that can benefit from these schemes and schemes naturally when they are 18 years old.
There is nothing impossible for a person full of positive thought and enthusiasm.
There's a word in English, Pessimism Leaders to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
The interviews and responses received were truly encouraging.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some people shared the positive impact that had impacted their minds.
Some have shared their personal achievements.
My name is Fishu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket 1, Phase 1, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I'm speaking from the Bodel.
According to my husband's instructions, an insurance insurance insurance insurance company was charged at one rupee per month.
He died in an accident.
So we know what our situation is.
My name is Anand Jadhav.
Our Vindhya Village has been running National Highway since 2017.
My name is Satish Bevani.
Our area had shortage of water and we have been dependent on the pipelines of the soldiers for the past 40 years.
Now we put a special pipeline...
It was our biggest achievement in 2017.
There are many such things in their own way that positive changes are taking place in the lives of people.
In fact, this is the New India that we are building together.
Recently, I was told about the inspiring story of Amazon Bashir Khan Khatk, who was in the forefront of the Administrative Service from Kashmir.
He was out of the depression of terrorism and hatred and came to the fore in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
You will be surprised to know that terrorists had burnt his heritage in 1990.
His family would have to quit and flee from the land of his legacy where terrorism and violence were more.
He chose a different way for himself to serve the people.
Avoiding opposite environments, he wrote the story of victory himself.
Today, he is an inspiration not only for the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth across the country.
No matter how bad the environment is, the Amaze has proved to be able to discard the carpets of despair through positive steps.
Last week, I had the opportunity to meet some girls from Jammu and Kashmir.
It was zeal, excitement, energy, dream and determination.
I was inspired by the time I spent with those kids.
This is the strength of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural for me to talk about the Shabarimala temple in Kerala while talking about the world's famous religious places.
Every year crores of devotees reach this world famous temple to receive the blessings of Lord Ayappaswamy.
How big a challenge can it be to ensure that the devotees reach such an extremely glorious place without waste
If there are mountains and forest areas then you can specifically say it .
A police officer named Vijayan started a programme titled 'Punyan Punyan' which has started a self-reliance campaign of awareness about waste management.
If any devotee comes, he has made a habit that the journey will not be completed without doing any physical work in terms of cleanliness.
There's no big guy in this move, no small guy.
Assuming that all devotees are a part of the worship of God, they take some time for cleanliness, work and work to remove waste.
Every morning, the sight of waste disposal is very amazing, and all the pilgrims are participating in it.
No matter how big a celebrity is, no matter how rich it is, no matter how big an officer is, everyone is participating in a programme like a common devotee to cleanliness.
We have many such examples before us.
This cleanliness drive in Sabarimala becomes a part of the pilgrimage to all devotees.
There is a strong rapidity and a determination to ensure cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October, 2014, we took a resolution to fulfil Bapus incomplete mission of Swachh Bharat and a clean India.
Bapu spent his entire life working for this one thing and tried his best.
The collaboration between the people in the rural and urban areas is beginning to transform.
Swachh Survekshan 2018, the worlds largest survey, will be conducted between 4th January and 10th March, 2018 to assess the achievements made in urban areas in terms of sanitation standards.
This survey will be conducted in more than 4000 cities across the country.
I'll talk to the citizens and know their response.
The Swachhata App will also be analyzed on the usage of Swachhata App and upgradation of various service centres.
In order to transform the city's sanitation into a people's habit, it will be checked if all arrangements have been made in the city to become a city's habit.
Don't want the government to do the cleaning.
Citizens and Citizens' Organisations have a great responsibility.
I urge all the people to take part in the Swachhata Survekshan in the coming days.
Try not to leave your city behind, so that your street and village do not lag behind.
On the basis of this survey, cities will be ranked - if your city is more than one lakh people, if there are few lakhs of people in the rankings across the country then it is your dream to achieve the highest position in the local ranking.
Come, with this resolve, once again we remember Bapuji and we can utilize the best possible initiatives with the determination of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, some things may seem very small but as a society, our personality has a far-reaching impact.
Today, I would like to share one such thing with you in this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
For decades Muslim women were being treated with injustice, but no one even discussed it.
There's no such law in many Islamic countries.
But the Muslim women in India had no right to go to Haj without males.
I have directed the Ministry of Minority Affairs to ensure that all women applying for Haj alone are allowed to go.
Generally, the elections are being held on the occasion of Haj pilgrimage and I would like to give them a special opportunity to consider those women who have applied to go alone to avoid this menace.
India's development journey has progressed on the basis of her talent by the strength of our women power.
I am confident that our women and men must get equal rights and equal opportunities and we must strive to move forward together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic celebration for us.
However, it will be remembered on 26th January, 2018.
This year, leaders from ten ASEAN countries will come to India as chief guests for the Republic Day celebrations.
This time, on Republic Day, there are not 10 chief guests.
This has never happened before in the history of India.
2017 was special for ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN has completed 50 years and completed 25 years of Indias engagement with ASEAN in 2017 itself.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us that on 26th January these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will come together.
My dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, in a way our country is a country of festivals.
There's not even a day that's not connected to the festival.
We've just celebrated Christmas, and the New Year's coming.
May the coming year bring happiness, prosperity and happiness to all of you.
Let us move forward with new zeal, new zeal, joy and new determination and lead the country forward.
Makar Sankranti is celebrated this month as the sun moves towards the north of January.
This is a celebration of nature.
Sankranth in Rajasthan, Magha-Bihu in Assam, Pongal in Tamil Nadu and all festivals are special in its own way and they have their own importance.
These festivals are celebrated between 13th January and 17th January.
All the names of these festivals are different, but the basic principles are the same.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, dear people.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
At the age, she is very older than us, she is a witness to every step of the country and every era.
I had the privilege of talking to Didi on the phone before my arrival abroad.
It was a lovely conversation like brothers and sisters talking with love.
I don't usually talk about personal conversations like this.
Modiji-Ladadi, Pranam.
I'm speaking to Narendra Modi.
I extend my best wishes on the occasion of birth anniversary of Modi ji and Didi.
May Didi recover well, may Didi's blessings be with us all.
I was calling for Didi before I went to America.
It was a pleasure to hear the phone call from Lataji-Modiji.
When will you go and return
Everyone at home...
Lataji, I believe that the blessings of my parents and the blessings of the listeners are there.
You don't know what you are.
I know that as soon as you come, the picture of India is changing.
Modiji yes.
My mother is very happy with this love of Modi ji and Didi.
I am extremely grateful that Modi ji and Didi always remember me.
Once again I extend my birthday greetings.
Modi ji, when he came to Mumbai this time, he was very happy to meet him.
Modi ji, but I will be back soon.
Modi ji, come home and eat something Gujarati from Didi's hand.
Lataji, of course.
I'll consider it lucky.
Modi ji - Pranam Didi.
Lata ji bow down.
Greetings on Modi ji and Didi ji Namaste.
Modiji Namaste.
My dear countrymen, from today onwards, the period of celebrations has come once again with a new zeal, enthusiasm and new determination.
The country will be filled with the glow of festivals for weeks now.
Everyone in the family will join in the festivals.
This is what is called the dark under the light.
Perhaps the words are not mere words, but an order for all of us, a vision, a motivation.
On the one hand, while many houses are illuminated, on the other hand, look at the darkness in front of them.
When this darkness disappears, when it lights down, the real pleasure of these festivals is there.
They collect dresses, sweets and food from people's homes and find the needy and deliver them.
This time, in this season of festivals, can you try to light the darkness below the light with due awakening and determination
The smile on the faces of many poor families will double your happiness in festivals, your face will shine more, your light will be more bright, your light will be more shining.
Can we welcome Lakshmi in a new way this time
In our culture, women are considered as Lakshmi because women bring good fortune and prosperity.
There will be amongst us many daughters who have shining the name of family, society and country with their dedication and dedication.
Can we organise a programme to honour these laxmis of India on the occasion of Diwali
We have many daughters and daughters who do extraordinary things.
Our society should recognize such daughters, honour them and take pride in their name.
All of us can publicise this as the whole world has made a mass movement called Selfie with daughter.
Likewise, this time a mass movement called Bharatki Lakshmi will be organized.
Promoting India's Laxmi is to strengthen the path of prosperity for the people of the country and the country.
My dear countrymen, I have already said that it is my good fortune to interact directly with many people who are not familiar with the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Last day, a student from a distance from Arunachal, Alina Thyung sent me a very interesting letter.
My country is Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time, when I got the results of my examination, people asked me whether I had read the book Exam Warriors.
After that, my experience was very good.
I thought it would have been better if I had read that book before the exam.
And this little girlfriend has given me a job.
But I have an appeal to you to help me.
I must read it.
I must think about it and try to write in my words, in my own way what I feel right about it.
Once again I express my gratitude to this young friend of Arunachal, student Alina Tayang.
Look.
This time, just as Vijay was discussed in the European Open, the speeches of Colonel Up Daniel Medvedev were also discussed, and there was good publicity in social media.
I saw the speech, and I saw the game.
The simplicity and diligence of Dan Madvedev, 23, attracted everyone.
Of course, it attracted me too.
Shortly before this speech, he had failed to win the Grand Slam on 19th occasion, and Rafael Nadal, the historian of Tennis.
If someone else had been there, he would have been sad and disappointed.
His words were happily welcomed by the audience.
Nadal commended Champya Nadal in Dan and how Nadal inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis and said how difficult it was to play with him.
The zeal and modesty of the winner had to be seen in one game.
If you don't hear the words of Dan Medvedev, I'd like to tell you all, especially the youngsters, to watch that video.
Out of this, people of all ages are very much inclined to learn and these are great moments beyond the defeats.
Victory is not a big deal.
Life is a victory.
It has been described in our countrys sciences in a very beautiful manner.
The thoughts of our ancestors are surely appreciated.
It has been stated in the academic sessions that Loksaya Lochanandam, a student vendor, has said: "Haratina Chetamsi, a combination of vegetarian vegetarian vegetarian vegetarian vegetarian vegetarian vegetarian vegetarian.
In fact, this young sportsperson has captured the mindset of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, especially young friends, what I am going to say is directly for your good.
There will be debates, parties and opponents, but some things will be of great benefit even before it grows up.
When it's too big, it's very difficult to stop some things when it's too wide.
But at the very outset, if we stop it very carefully, we can save a lot of things.
The habit of tobacco addiction is due to its nicotine.
Eating it during childhood affects brain growth.
But today I would like to tell you about a new subject.
You must be aware that e-cigarettes have been banned in India recently.
Unlike normal cigarettes, e-cigarettes are an electronic device in a way.
A type of chemical smoke is generated when the nicotine substance is hot in the e-cigarette.
Like the other cigarettes, it is mixed with aromatic chemicals to prevent it from spreading odour.
Even if Father is a chain smoker at home, he has seen that he is trying to stop other people from smoking at home and wants children not to have a habit of smoking cigarettes and beedi.
He wants not to smoke cigarettes and smoke at home.
He knows that smoking and tobacco causes a big harm to the body.
However, the issue of e-cigarettes is completely different.
People don't know so much about e-cigarettes.
The accident is also illiterate, so sometimes the e-cigarette gets access to the house just like it is funny.
If someone smokes around us, you know we can smell it.
Even in his pocket, cigarette packets can be detected by smell.
But that is not the case with e-cigarettes, so many children and youngsters may not be aware or fashionable and may be proud to be walking around in their books, offices, pockets and pockets, and they are becoming victims of it.
Youth is the future of the country.
This new method of intoxication is prohibited in the country by e-cigarettes so that the dreams of our families do not go away, so that the lives of children do not go waste, so that the habit of this disease does not spread roots in the society.
I urge everyone to abandon the misery of tobacco and not to misunderstand the e-cigarette.
You remember Fit India, right
Fit India is not meant to go to the gym for two hours in the morning and late in the morning.
Stay away from this for Fit India.
Our Mother India, our country is a great Vasundhara.
Many human sacrifices are being raised on this planet.
India was the birthplace of such unusual people, the land of action.
They are dedicated themselves for others, but for themselves.
Such a great personality is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
This is a matter of pride for all Indians, and Pope Francis will proclaim Maryam Thresia as holy on October 13.
Sister Maryam Threshya, 50 years of her narrow life, has done well for mankind and is an example all over the world.
My dear countrymen, India is not only proud of the fact that while we celebrate Gandhi 150, 130 crore people have resolved to get rid of single use plastic.
India has shown great stride in the field of environmental protection and hence the entire world is looking at India.
I am sure you will also be part of the mass movement to avoid single use plastic on 2nd October.
Everywhere, people play their own role in these three corners in their own way.
But a young man in our country has made a very different move.
When I turned my attention to his actions, I called him and tried to understand and understand his new methodology.
He said this could be beneficial for the country and the people.
Shri.
It was a new word for me when I heard the first plaguing.
Perhaps this word might be used a little overseas.
However, in India, Ripudman Dalvi gave a big propaganda to it.
Come, let's talk to him.
130 crore people will take a step in this regard and our India will take 130 crore steps in the direction of salvation from the One Time Application Plant.
Thank you very much once again, Reepudaman ji.
Many congratulations to you, your team and this new vision.
I'd like to remind you of something in advance.
But it's time for some people to start training, it's time to plan some programs.
My dear countrymen, you will be reminded of my statement from the Red Fort on 15th August that you will have to travel to 15 places in India by 2022.
Make a plan to stay at least 15 places for a night or two nights.
You see, understand, feel India.
My dear countrymen, once again I extend my best wishes to all of you for the various festivals of India full of diversity.
Yes, yes.
On the occasion of Deepawali, it should be kept in mind that the fire should be broken and the people should not be in danger.
And take precautions.
Together with enthusiasm, let us celebrate the festivals with new dreams and new resolve.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Greetings to my dear countrymen.
Just a short while ago, I had the opportunity to interact indirectly with the boys from Karnataka.
He urged the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of India at a function organized by the Times Group on the occasion of Childrens Day, the Vijay Karnataka Diwas.
And they published the letters they chose.
I was very happy to read those letters.
These little children also know the problems of the country.
They also know about the discussions taking place in the country.
Kirti Hegde from the north east appreciates Digital India and Smart City schemes and the child says that our education system has to be changed and the children of today don't like classroom reading, they love to know about nature.
If we provide knowledge of nature to the children, then it can be of immense benefit in the future to save the environment.
Reeda Nadaf, a child from Laxmeshwar, writes, She is proud to be the daughter of a soldier.
What Indian should be proud of our soldiers
And it's natural to be proud of the soldier's daughter.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has written that the school is 5 km away from home, so we have to leave early at home and it's too late to return home.
She says she cannot spend time with her friends and she wants to have a school nearby.
But I really liked what the establishment wanted to get those letters to me, so I could read those letters.
I've had a good experience.
My dear countrymen, it's 2611 today.
26 November is our Constitution Day.
The Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India on the same day in 1949.
The Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950, so we celebrate that day as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They worked for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
Those who read about this discussion will feel proud of the thoughts of those who were dedicated to the nation.
Can we imagine how hard they have worked in creating the Constitution of our country full of diversity
How discretionary and visionary they must have expressed when the country gets rid of the slavery chain
There's no field in life that doesn't touch, no matter what nature is.
Equality and compassion for all is the hallmark of our Constitution.
It is our duty to keep the Constitution literally.
Whether it is a citizen or a ruler, we must move forward in the spirit of the Constitution.
The message of our Constitution is that no one should be harmed in any way.
In this Constituent Assembly, 17 different Committees were constituted based on key issues.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar was the Chairperson of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution.
He was an important participant.
On December 6, we remember and remember him as usual, on his Mahanirvana Diwas.
Baba Sahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and strong is unforgettable.
December 15th is the holy day of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Sardar Patel became a technician of the country from the son of a peasant and he performed an extraordinary task of stripping the country on one stairway.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
The advisory committees formed for the welfare of fundamental rights, fundamental rights, minorities and tribals were also presided over.
He recalls and bows to the brave citizens, police and security personnel who have lost their lives.
This country will never forget their sacrifice.
Terrorism is taking a terrible shape in every part of the world today as a day-to-day event.
We have been suffering from terrorism in India for the past 40 years.
Thousands of our innocent people have lost their lives.
Terrorism has challenged humanism.
This is the land through the message of non-violence and love to the world through Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi.
Terrorism and terrorism are making a cruel attempt to undermine our social relations.
Therefore, the need of the hour is to make humanitarian forces more vigilant.
My dear countrymen, the Navy Day will be celebrated in December.
You all know that our culture has grown on the banks of the river.
This country has an infinite bond with the oceans.
When we looked at history, 800-900 years ago, during the rice cycle, the Coast Guard was regarded as the most powerful naval force.
Their navy had a huge role in making them economically super-powerful in the growth of the Chola Empire.
Several examples of coastal naval operations and exploration journeys can be seen in a collective manner.
Very few people are aware that most of the naval forces in the world had supplied women in very late warships.
However, a large number of women had played an important role in the cooking navy, even 800-900 years ago.
The women even took part in the war.
Cola rulers knew very well about shipbuilding.
When we talk about the Navy, one can forget the capabilities shown by President Shivaji Maharaj and his ability to build a naval force.
The Konkan coast was in the land of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud Jamjira and Golden Fort associated with Shivaji Maharaj were either on the seashore or on the seashore.
The security of these forts was awaited by the Maratha Navy.
The Maratha Navy had large ships and small boats.
Their navy was capable of attacking any enemy and defending the country from enemies.
How can we not remember Kanhoji Agra when we talk about the Maratha Navy
He brought the Maratha Navy to a new level and built bases of Maratha Naval Forces at various places.
After independence, our Indian Navy showed their valour at various occasions, be it in the liberation movement of Goa or in the war of India-Pakistan in 1971.
When we talk about the Navy, the war is in the eye, but the Indian Navy has come forward with the same enthusiasm in humanitarian matters.
Sumitra, who helped save the people immediately, handed over many of the fishermen to Bangladesh safely from the sea.
Three ships of our naval forces immediately arrived in Sri Lanka in May-June this year and helped the government and the people there.
On 21st November, when a trading ship was robbed in the Western Gulf, INS Trikand arrived for assistance.
Whether it is for delivering healthcare services to Fuji or for providing immediate relief and humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring country, our naval forces are doing a proud job and we are always proud of our security forces and respected them.
Whether it is the Army or the Navy or the Air Force... all Indians bow down to the courage, valour, valour, bravery and sacrifice of our soldiers.
They sacrifice their youth for the country to live comfortably and peacefully for the hundred and fifty crore people.
The Army Flag Day is celebrated on 7th December every year.
This is a day of pride and respect for the soldiers of the country.
I am glad that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to organize a programme from 1st to 7th December, to reach out to the citizens of the country to inform people about the Armed Forces and to make people aware.
Children and adults should wear a flag all week.
There must be an advance of respect for the army in the country.
Calling soldiers in schools and colleges, they can learn about the army from them.
Our new generation can make it a good opportunity to learn about the army.
This opportunity is to earn money for the good of all the soldiers of our Armed Forces.
This wealth is being utilised through the Soldiers Welfare Board to provide assistance to the families of the heroic soldiers, to the injured soldiers and to rehabilitate them.
Let us also contribute ourselves for their good.
I would like to tell our farmer brothers and sisters something.
The soil is a great part of the earth.
Everything we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the food chain is connected to the entire soil.
Imagine what will happen if there is no harvest soil in this world.
I'm afraid when I think.
In our culture, we have thought about it a long time ago, so we have been aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
On the one hand, in our culture, on the one hand, we are trying to have devotion and gratitude towards agriculture, on the other hand, scientific schemes have been part of our lives to keep the soil nutritious.
Two things were important in the lives of the farmers of this country - devotion to soil and preservation of soil in a scientific manner.
We are proud that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and are interested in modern sciences and are trying to make appropriate decisions.
I have heard about the farmers of Tehu village in Bhorad Block in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The yield of soil has come down gradually, with the yield of soil declined.
Some of the farmers of the village understood the seriousness of the situation and reiterated their suggestions on how much chemicals, other vegetation, micro nutrients and organic plants should be sown in time.
You will be surprised to know what kind of changes have taken place because of the advice given to you about the health of the soil.
And soil has also increased.
Farmers have started feeling that if we want to think about crops then we should first think about the land and if we are ready to save the mother Earth then the land will wait for us.
Our farmers have produced more than 10 crore soil health cards across the country to know the soil well and to grow accordingly.
We have devotion to the Mother Earth, but do you think how harmful it is to the health of the Mother Earth with chemicals like urea
All types of scientific methods have proved that due to excessive use of urea, the environmental damage is severe.
Can our farmers and the children of our soil make a decision that by 2022 we will utilise half of the urea used in the agriculture sector by 75 years of independence
We are beginning to feel global warming and climate change.
There was a time when it was cold before Diwali.
Now, in the beginning of December, the cold has moved slowly.
The 8-year-old barbarian boy made Visil his weapon.
At 5 a.m. in the morning, he went to the houses of the village and woke up the people and started teaching them not to defecate in the open space.
Kumhari village is freed from open defecation due to this child who teaches about cleanliness every day in 30-40 houses.
The younger child Tushar has done a very inspiring job in promoting cleanliness.
Our divyang brothers and sisters are determined, capable and brave.
We've got something to learn.
Today, they are doing well in all spheres.
Whether it is in sports or in any competition or in any social activity, our Divyangjans are not far behind.
Our divyang sportspersons won 4 medals at the Rio Olympics with remarkable performance.
Different types of competitions are being held across the country.
The last day, the 17th National Para Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in this and showcased their skills.
One of them is Jigar Taker from Gujarat and 80 percent of his body has no muscles.
He was chosen by the Sports Authority of India 2020 Paralympics as a result of his skills.
He is one of the 32 Para Swimmers trained at Centre for Excellence, Gandhinagar.
My greetings to Jiger Thakur... and my best wishes to him.
Today, Divyangjan can reach any area and he is particularly concerned about opportunities.
Our effort is to ensure that everyone in the country becomes capable and a society involving everyone should be formed.
After a few days, Id-e-Milad-Un-Nabi will be celebrated.
On this day, the Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Sahib was born.
My heartiest greetings to all the countrymen.
This proposal is very good, but I think it's something to add to this proposal and change it.
Our village elders always say.
Forget sadness, don't forget happiness.
Can't you guarantee your role in this
Come, let us share good wishes on the Narendra Modi App, on the MyGov or on the Positive India (Hashtag Positive India) Social Media.
Let's recall what inspires others.
Remembering good things will have a feeling of doing good.
It'll give you the energy to do good things.
Let us see the strength of this united movement and its consequences together.
There'll be a lot of opportunity to talk about.
PM on 29th October, 2017
Even though the sun and water are important in Chhath Puja, the vessels and poultry made of bamboo and mud are essential for the worship.
In this festival of faith, the message of worshipping sunrise and sunset is full of unique culture.
The world will honour and worship the adults.
But the Chhath Puja culmination gives us a message of worship to those who are sure.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also associated with this festival.
Before the Chhath, people are very enthusiastic about cleaning the entire house. People are very enthusiastic about rivers, lakes and ponds, worshipping places, i. e.
It is a celebration of sun bath or Chhath puja, environment protection, disease prevention and discipline.
It is natural for anyone to take pride in this great heritage of India.
You might be happy to know that this kind of business has taken place in a store of Khadi and Handloom.
During Deepawali, Khadi Gift Coupons sales registered an increase of about 680.
The total sale of Khadi and artisans has shown an increase of nearly 90 this year as compared to last year.
It shows that today youth, women and people of all age groups like Khadi and handloom.
I can imagine how much benefit the wealthy families, the poor families and the families working in the handlooms will be.
He says we should also remember our brave security forces.
We want to bring home sweets to the Jawans.
Once again I got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with the brave security personnel deployed on the border.
This time I was unforgettable to celebrate Diwali with security forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces are waiting for the country to face the extremely difficult and difficult situation on the border, honouring all the soldiers of our security forces for fighting, dedication and sacrifice.
If we get the opportunity, we must listen to their proud stories to know the experiences of our soldiers.
Many of us are unaware that the soldiers of our security forces have played an important role not only in our borders but also in maintaining peace across the world.
As the Peace Keeper of the United Nations, they are raising the size of Hindustan all over the world.
Last day, on 24th October, UN Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone remembers the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace in the world and their active role.
We believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam means that the whole world is our family.
Due to this belief, India has been actively participating in various major UN initiatives since its inception.
India has always emphasized on women's equality and the declaration of human rights of the United Nations is a living example of this.
It was originally proposed in the continent that all men and women were born free and equitable, and as a result of the efforts of Indias representative Hamsa Mehta, the volume was acknowledged that all human beings were born free and equal.
Looks like it's a very simple change, but it's a healthy thought.
The United Nations Peacekeeping Mission is one of the largest contributors to India under the United Nations umbrella.
India has always participated actively in UN peacekeeping missions.
For the first time, many of you know this.
More than 16,000 Indian security forces have served in UN peacekeeping missions.
Now about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with the UN peacekeeping processes, India is the third largest in the world in this regard.
Till August 27, Indian soldiers have served in about 50 missions in 71 peacekeeping missions across the world of the United Nations.
These missions were in many parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Labanon and Sudan.
In Kongo and South Sudan, more than 20,000 patients were treated in Indian Army hospitals and rescued innumerable people.
The security forces of India not only saved the people there in different countries but also conquered their minds through people-friendly measures.
Indian women have also played a leading role in peace.
Nobody knows that India is the first country to send women's police forces into the UN peacekeeping mission in Libya.
This step of India is a source of inspiration for countries all over the world.
After that, all the countries started sending their women's police force.
You will be surprised to know that Indias role is not only in peace but also in training the peacekeeping community in about 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha have conveyed the message of peace and harmony throughout the world.
Peacekeeping operations are not simple.
The soldiers of our security forces have to work in the vicious territories.
You'll have to live among different people.
We need to know and understand different conditions and different cultures.
We need to change ourselves according to local needs and conditions.
Today, when we remember our brave UN peacekeepers, who can forget Captain Gurbachan Singh Salari
In his memory, all Indians will chest with pride.
In 1989, at the age of seventy-two, he was made the Commander of the Operations Force in Namibia and served the country's Freedom Foundation.
General Timmai Cyprus, the head of the Indian Army, led the United Nations Peacekeeping Force and sacrificed everything for peace.
As a peacekeeper, India has always conveyed the message of peace, unity and harmony throughout the world.
We believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move forward as a creation of a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our holy land was illuminated by the nobles who served humanity selflessly.
Sister Nivedita, who is known as Bhagini Nivedita, was one of those unusual people.
While Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of Nivedita.
The word 'Nivedita' is completely dedicated.
Later, she dedicated herself to her name and made her name an embodiment.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
They are ready to dedicate their lives to the service of the poor through the influence of Swami Vivekananda.
Sister Nivedita's mind was hurt by the atrocities in the British regime.
Not only did the English slave our country, but they tried to make us mentally slaves.
They were constantly striving to create disadvantage amongst us by embracing our culture.
Bhagni Nided re-established the pride of Indian culture.
Revolutionary poetry of the famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati (new lady) is famous for women empowerment.
It is said that Bhagini is inspired by it.
Jagdish Chandra Bose, a great scientist who was a Bhagni Nivedita, worked with him.
They helped spread the research of Bose through articles and conferences.
The special beauty of India is that in our culture spirituality and science are rich in each other.
Sister Nivedita and Jagdish Chandra Bose are strong examples of this.
Hundreds of people died when a terrible plague struck Calcutta in 1899.
Sister Nivedita started work on drains and roads without considering her own health.
Sister Nivedita was a woman who came out to serve the poor despite her comfortable life.
Inspired by their sacrifices, people came forward to cooperate in service delivery.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on the occasion of birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the greatest heroes and heroes in building a New India.
Your concern is that the disease that preceded adults, the disease that has spread in the evening of life, has recently started to appear in children.
It is surprising to hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
But our lifestyle has changed to lifestyle.
Today these diseases are said to be lifestyle disorders.
The main reason for occurrence of such diseases in youngsters is physical activity in lifestyle like lack of physical activity and change in the ways of food habits .
Society and families have to pay attention to this.
If you think about it, you'll find no need to do anything special.
It is only necessary to make small things accurately and systematically habituate them and make them their own.
Instead of climbing and descending on a lift, make a habit of climbing and sleeping.
After dinner, take the whole family with the kids and try to spend some time.
Yoga for Young India and Yoga for Youth India.
Because I'm used to it, I'm saying that a person of any age can do it easily.
It's simple because it cannot learn, it's simple to say wherever it can be done.
It doesn't need special equipment or fields.
There are several studies on how Yoga is beneficial in controlling diabetes.
We need to make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of our lives, not as a medium of medicine.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I have received good news from the games in the past few days.
Our sportspersons have swept the country in different games.
India won the Asia Cup hockey crown in Hockey.
Our sportspersons played a very good game and that is why India became Asia Cup champions after 10 years.
Earlier, India had won the Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to the entire team and the Sports staff who have helped them.
After Hockey, India also heard good news in Batminton.
Batminton Star Kidambi Srikanth has made Indians proud by winning the Danish Open Crown Play.
After the Indonesia Open and the Australian Open, the Super Series Presidency captured the crown.
I convey my best wishes to our young friends for this achievement and enhancing India's pride.
Friends, FIFA Under 17 World Cups were held this month.
Teams from all over the world came to India and exhibited their skills at the football field.
I also had a chance to go to see a game.
Players and audiences were very excited.
World Cup competitions were successfully conducted and all teams showed their best performance.
India was not able to win the crown, but the youngsters of India embraced everybody.
The entire world, including India, enjoyed the festival of this game, and the tournament was an attractive and fascinating tournament for football lovers.
The future of the football is bright.
I once again extend my best wishes and good wishes to all the sportspersons, to all those who have worked with them.
Some send photos of children's missions in this regard, some will be the story of youngsters' collective efforts.
A team of non-governmental organizations called the Ecosystem Protection Organisation (ESO) came to clean the Chandrapur Fort.
In this two hundred-day long work, people continued to work on cleaning the fort as a team without fatigue.
I am amazed to see the picture that those who are disappointed with the surrounding filth will be disappointed in the minds of those who are disappointed with the dream of cleanliness, I would like to tell you that you will see the youth of the Ecosystem Protection Organisation, their sweat, their enthusiasm and their determination in those active pictures.
It will turn your despair, your faith.
This sacred effort for cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, co-existence and humanity.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
By eating together, the feeling of unity and equality in people's minds emerged.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages to the real life - convey the name of the soul, work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev wrote to tell him what to say.
In the coming year 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
Come, let us try to move forward on the path of his message and teachings.
My dear countrymen, after two days, on 31st October we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he has laid the foundation for modern India.
We can learn a lot by travelling through the extraordinary life of that great son of India.
His expertise was to bring thoughts into action.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had laid the foundation stone of India's work on a staircase.
He assured that millions of Indians should be brought under the umbrella of a nation, a Constitution.
He was able to overcome all obstacles in his determination.
He had set a goal and moved forward to that goal.
He could have done this task of uniting the country.
Everyone was an equal nation in his vision.
I would like to say that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel always inspires us.
These words of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring and relevant to our vision of New India.
That is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
I would like to urge you all to participate in this festival of mutual brotherhood, Radio for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali's vacation, with a new imagination, with a new determination, all of you will rejoin everyday life.
My best wishes to the countrymen for their dreams.
The Mann Ki Baat programme, which is telling you through Akashwani, has been completed in three years.
Today's the thirty-sixth episode.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I can say a little about those who send their minds to every corner of the country but I get a lot of treasure.
Mostly inspires me.
A lot of things are about reforms in government matters.
Sometimes there will be personal complaints and sometimes it will attract attention to social problems.
Whenever I say Mann Ki Baat, I remember Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
I am sure that after three years, sociologists, universities, researchers and media persons will analyze this and bring to light the attacks on all subjects.
I am sure that this discussion will be of greater use to Mann Ki Baat in the future and will provide a new energy and new energy.
In Mann Ki Baat, he said that whenever we eat, we should take as much as we need, and not waste as we like.
However, letters came from all corners of the country, from social organizations, from the youth that they are already doing this.
After that, many people have come forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Not only in India but in the entire world, Selfida with Doter has become a big pioneer.
This is not just a problem in the social media.
Every girl has a new self-confidence and a new pride.
All parents wanted to take selfies with their own daughter.
All the girls started feeling that they have great importance and importance.
I was discussing with the Central Tourism Department last day...
I told the tourist destinations that wherever they go, they should send a photo related to 'All India'.
Millions of photographs, paintings from all corners of India, in a way, are a big treasure for those working in the tourism sector.
In Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that the small event is a mass movement.
It's been three years since I remembered that events in the last three years have appeared in my mind.
The country is moving ahead in the right direction.
It's a big capital for any country, a big power.
I salute the people with my heart.
Once I had talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat and said that Khadi is not a cloth, it is a contemplation.
Young people are increasingly interested in Tail Khadiya... in blankets, swords, swords, curtains.
The sale of Khadi has increased, so the house of the poor is directly related to employment.
The Khadi rebate is being paid from 2nd October and is very low.
This will give strength to the poor of our country and we will do it.
Increasing interest in Khadi has increased the enthusiasm of the people working in the Khadi sector to think in a new way of taxation for those associated with Khadi and Khadi in the government.
How can we bring new technologies, how can we increase productivity, how can we bring solar energy
The ancient heritage has been decayed for 20, 25, 30 years... to think of how to revive it.
A variety of things have been added to us.
Opportunities for many have been created.
The Khadi Gramodyog Division in Pampore, Kashmir revived its closed training wing and Kashmir has a lot to contribute to this sector.
The resumption of this Training Centre will help the new generation to do innovative work, weaving and creating new products.
Normal people have started giving Khadi products as gifts to others.
We have a direct experience of how an object can be encouraged naturally.
My dear countrymen, we have decided in Mann Ki Baat last month that we will celebrate the 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti.
It is said that cleanliness will connect with the masses.
Our Honble President began this and the nation joined it.
Today, the elderly, people, men, women, cities and villages have become a part of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
I express my gratitude to the President of India.
People from all walks of life have considered this as their work and all are connected with it.
Whether it is in the field of sports, film industry, education sector, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, labourers, government employees, police and soldiers, the survey has been associated with it.
There has been a change in public spaces to prevent others from polluting the public place and those working there are beginning to feel some pressure.
It is a matter of great pleasure that in the first four days of the campaign of Swachhata Hi Seva, more than 75 lakh people have joined the work related to more than 40,000 startups.
We've seen one more thing this time, we clean up one place, and others are careful not to be ugly.
But if sanitation becomes a habit, it must become an emotional one.
This time, along with Swachhata Hi Seva, fishes also took place.
More than two and a half million children participated in the Swachhta related articles.
Thousands of children painted colorful pictures.
I don't forget to express my gratitude to the media when it comes to cleanliness.
They pursued this mass movement with utmost sanctity.
They joined this in their own way and contributed immensely to the creation of a progressive environment.
A few days ago, someone had turned my attention to the work of the 18-year-old Bilal Dar of Srinagar.
When you talk about Brand Ambassador, you will think that he will be a hero in the sports sector.
Bilal removes plastic, polythene, utilized bottles and other waste material and thereby generates little income.
Bilal's copper ration gave him a vehicle and uniform, and he went to other places to teach people the lessons of cleanliness, motivate them, and stayed after them until the results were seen.
Bilal Dar is a little boy from his age, but he's inspired by all those who are interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that the history of the future is born in the womb of todays history, when we talk of history, it is natural for me to remember the great men.
This month of October is a month to recall many great men.
We have been faced with many hardships for the country, from Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, who gave us the guidance, who gave us the guidance for the 21st century.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal Jisa.
What was the central point of all these great men
There was a common thing - live for the country, do something for the country...
Gandhiji, Jaiprakash ji and Deendayal ji were far away from the corridors of power, but for a moment they lived with the people and worked for them...
Deendayal Upadhyaya and Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about the last man in the society.
Sardar Saheb united the country.
We have to run to unity and take the unity forward.
You can experience the diversity of this India, touch it, enjoy it.
You can see that these diversities of our country will work as a major curriculum for the development of your personality.
Days of holidays are the days of Diwali... we have a habit of traveling somewhere in the country.
Tourist journey is natural.
But it is a matter of concern that we don't see our country, we don't know the diversity of our country, we don't understand it, we don't understand it, we don't understand it, but we're starting to like traveling abroad under the influence of colour.
The people of West India do not know what is in Eastern India.
How variety is our country
Considering the fact that Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam ji had said that when they went on madness in India, they got a new inspiration to see, understand India, live and die for them.
All these great men travel across the weight.
At the beginning of their work, they tried to know and understand India.
He tried to embrace India.
As a student, can we assimilate our different states, different societies, people, their ways of life, their traditions, their dresses and their food habits to understand and understand their understanding
It is not just because we see the value addition to tourism, but because we understand it like a student and try to become a part of it.
In my own experience, I have had the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of the country.
In more than 450 districts, I've had the opportunity to stay at night.
Today, when I am entrusted with this responsibility in India then the experience of those journeys is very useful to me.
I'm comfortable understanding things.
I appeal to you that you have experienced this vast India's diversity not as a seal of unity, but as a storehouse of our immense strength.
It has the dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of food habits are there
You'll never have to repeat if you spend your whole life in this way every day.
This is a major strength of our tourism sector.
During these vacations, not only do you want to go out of the house, but also go out for a change, know something, understand something.
India is inclusive of the diversity of millions of people.
Your life will be more prosperous with these experiences.
The limits of your thoughts will be broad.
Who is a greater guru than experience
Normally, the time of the journey is from October to March.
People are leaving.
I believe that if you go this time, you will take my call forward.
Share your experiences wherever you go, share pictures.
Send photos on Hash Tag Incredible India.
If you can interfere with the people of the place where you go, send them pictures.
Not only of buildings, but also of natural beauty, but also of people's lives.
Write a good article about the journey.
Send to MyGov, send it to the NarendraModi App.
I believe that it will be good for all Indians to know about the seven places and seven things that are the best seven tourist destinations in your state.
If you can, go to those seven places.
Can you give me some information about it
Making films about such good places, making videos, propagating and encouraging them - the government will accept your findings.
You can also get a motivation to promote tourism from October to March.
I invite you for that.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
I'm a man like you.
You must have noticed something that happened in the past and people have seen a divine example of women power and patriotism.
The extraordinary fact is that the husbands of wealth and treasure are sacrificed by serving the Mother India.
Can we imagine what the mood will be if life is lost at this young age
But Swami Mahadik, the penny of the sacrificed colonel Anand Mahadik, took a firm resolve in this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
For 11 months, he was trained well and changed his life to realise the dream of his husband.
His penny treasure took a firm decision and joined the army.
Let us be proud of this mother power and it is natural for all the people to respect these heroes.
I convey my best wishes to those two sisters.
They are inspiring and energetic in the hearts of millions of people of the country.
My best wishes to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is a great opportunity for our younger generation between Navratri Festival and Diwali.
FIFA U-17 World Cup is taking place in our country.
I'm sure there will be soccer rings all around.
Football will enhance interest among all generations.
My dear countrymen, Navratri is now.
It's time to worship Durgam Bai.
The atmosphere is full of poor and pure fragrance.
All around is the atmosphere of spirituality, of festivals and devotion.
It is believed to be a festival of power.
When India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022, we will move forward by formulating a five-year roadmap to realise the dreams of freedom fighters, the resolve of 125 crore people, the sizeable determination, the sizeable effort and determination.
Thanks a lot.
English rendering of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 27th August, 2017
My heartiest congratulations to my dear countrymen.
On the one hand, when the country is immersed in festivals, on the other hand, it is natural to hear the news of violence from any part of Hindustan on the other.
Our country is a country of Buddha and Gandhi, a country of Sardar Patel, who lived for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have acknowledged the values of public life, non-violence and respect for each other.
Since childhood, we have been saying that non-violence is paramount.
I have said from the Red Fort that violence will not be allowed in the name of faith, whether it is religious belief or political belief or belief in traditions.
In the Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us, there are provisions for justice for every person.
The law enforcement will not allow the country to be allowed, and no government will allow it, whether it is individual or society.
Everyone will have to bow before the law.
The law will determine responsibility and punish the culprits.
Our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not confined to food, lifestyle or costumes.
We can see diversity at all levels of life.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Considering our cultural heritage of millennia old and cultural traditions, considering social traditions, historical events, there will be no day celebrated in 365 days.
If we look at all our festivals then we can see that there is no festival associated with the timelines of nature.
Everything is connected to nature.
Many of our festivals have been associated with the farmers and are directly related to the fisheries.
Today, when I talk about festivals, for the first time, I would like to tell you "world mourning".
Yesterday, the festival of 'Savatsari' was celebrated in the Jain community.
Kurushan is celebrated in the month of Bhadra in the Jain community.
The last day of the Kurukshan celebrations is a day of celebration.
This is indeed a wonderful legacy.
The festival is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
This is known as the festival of 'Khamavani' and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other 'Mapami Dukdam'.
Our scientific compassion has been described as 'Karma Veerasya Bhushna', meaning 'Karma Veeran'.
The forgiving man becomes heroic.
Mahatma Gandhi always used to say, Forgiveness is the character of a strong man.
Mentioning the significance of forgiveness in the drama 'Marchant of Venice' written by Shakespeare, Mercy Essay Blast, It Blasseet Him That Gives Him That Texas, which means forgiveness and forgiveness, is the blessing of God.
My dear countrymen, this is the time to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi in every corner of India.
Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations take place for ten days.
This festival is a symbol of unity, equality and hygiene.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Ganesh Festival.
Now it is time for the celebrations in Kerala.
One of the most colorful festivals of India is the festival of Onam in Kerala.
This is socially and culturally important.
Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival offers a message of love and harmony in the society and brings new enthusiasm, new hopes and new faith in the minds of people.
Now this festival is becoming a focal point for fun and frolic.
Navaratri Festival in Gujarat and Durga Puja Festival in Bengal have become an attractive tourist destination in a way.
Our festivals are an opportunity to attract foreigners like this.
We have to think about what we can do on this subject.
These will also be celebrated as Eidul Suha after a few days.
In addition to the festivals being a symbol of devotion and faith, we have to make it a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
My dear countrymen, the definition of modernization is changing.
A variety of experiments take place in every family.
Look at how big a change is, how cheerful a change is.
As I said, the country is full of intellectual awakening.
I'm glad to know someone's new invention.
Someone said that an engineer collected some soil and merged it with it so that he was trained to build a Ganesh idol.
When the monster is poured into a small pitcher's water, it merges into the water quickly.
He didn't stop for this.
Three years ago, the Swachhta Mission will be launched and it will be three years on 2nd October.
Its results have started to appear.
Toilets accounted for 39 per cent, to 67 per cent.
More than two lakh thirty thousand villages have been declared Open Defecation Free.
Many have lost their lives.
But after the flood, when the water broke, the waste was spread everywhere.
We can create an atmosphere of cleanliness across the country.
After constructing toilets, you can add your name to the portal and also the name of the family that helped you.
You can write articles in different languages, no age limits.
You can make a short film on your own mobile.
A two-three-minute short film that inspires cleanliness can be made.
In any language, it could be a quiet picture.
Please join yourself in this.
You will see how bright this 2nd October Gandhi Jayanti is.
After this 15-day long erosion, after the Swachhata Hi Seva programme, on 2nd October, when we commemorate Gandhi Jayanti, it is a matter of great pleasure for us to pay homage to His Excellency Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to clarify a special responsibilities for you.
I look forward to your message with greater eagerness than you look forward to the Mann Ki Baat.
Everything you say gives me a chance to learn something, so I'm waiting with curiosity.
There's a chance to change what I'm doing.
I am sure your little things are useful for me to think many things with a new perspective.
"Prime Minister, I'm speaking indecently from Pune.
I once went shopping with her in the mall.
She spent two thousand rupees simply for a sari and spent 450 rupees for a pizza.
But he argued with the driver of the auto captured to go to the mall for five rupees.
On the way back, he purchased vegetables and saved Rs. 4-5 for his name.
I felt terrible.
We don't even ask questions about the price in bigger places, but we also argue with the brothers and sisters who depend on us for a little bit.
They're incredible.
You must mention this in Mann Ki Baat.
Madam, I am grateful to you for giving me a great message through this heart-wrenching telephone call.
I am sure that if my people continue to have this habit in the behaviour of the poor, they will definitely abandon it.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the country is celebrating Sports Day.
This is the birthday of Major Dhyan Chand, the great hockey player, who performed magic in Hockey.
His contribution to Hockey was stable.
I am saying this because of the desire to connect our country's younger generation with sports.
Sports must be part of our lives.
If we consider ourselves to be the youngest country in the world, we need to see our children in sports.
Sports is Physical Fitness, National Alertness and Personality Enhancement.
What's more than this
Sports is, in a way, an important medicine for the unity of minds.
Sports Talent Survey Portal has been prepared by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports to identify talents and talent them.
Any child in the country who has made any profit in the field of sports can upload the video if he wants his own biodate.
The portal will be uploaded tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports.
May you all be happy to know that the FIFA U-17 World Cup will be held in India from 6th to 18th October.
Twenty-four teams around the world are going to make India their home.
The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of those six girls who work in the navy will inspire us all.
These six girls left for a small boat called INS Tarini to cross the sea.
This is called Navica Sagar Parikrama.
They will return to India after months of roaming around the world.
These six children travel bravely among the waves in the ocean for the first time in the world.
My best wishes and blessings to these girls.
My dear countrymen, we also celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
He was the President.
But he himself said he was a teacher.
He was an academic, a diplomat and a enthusiastic teacher in all respects, although he was the President of India.
I bow down to him.
The great scientist, Albert Einstein, said that it is the Supreme Court of the Teacher to Awaken Hoy in Creative Expedition and Knowledge, that is, the greatest benefit of a teacher is to enjoy creativity and knowledge among his students.
Can we make a resolve this time when we celebrate Teachers Day
Can you make a move like a mission
Teach to Transform, ducate to mpower, learn to teach for change, strengthen and learn to guide.
Can we take this mission forward with this determination
Each one should take a pledge for five years, guide oneself to achieve it and enjoy being successful in life after achieving it in five years.
For this, an atmosphere must create our schools, our colleges, our teachers and our educational institutions.
When we talk of transformation in our country, we remember a teacher in our society as we remember a mother in our family.
Teachers have an important role to play in transforming.
It must have been in the lives of all the teachers that have been able to transform one's lives through industrious efforts.
If we strive together, we can play a big role in transforming the nation.
Let us move forward with the mantra of teaching for transformation.
Reproductive woman.
My name is Dr. Ananya.
I live in Mumbai and work for India Research Centre at Harvard University.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in economic inclusion and related social programmes.
I would like to ask you that after three years of this Jan Dhan Yojana launched in 2014, you would like to say that India is economically safer and even stronger and that empowerment and facilities are available to our women, farmers, workers and villages for slums
The move was launched on 28th August, 2014 as a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, on 28th August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will complete three years.
Thirty crore new families have been linked to this and bank accounts have been opened.
This is more than the total population of many countries of the world.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, our poor have invested about Rs. 60,500 crore in banks.
The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, or Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, has given birth to a new faith in the lives of the poor, either because of the simple prevalence of one rupee or three rupees.
When the poor was in danger, when the family's chief lost his life, some families received two lakh rupees in a few days due to insurance of one rupee.
I have come across hundreds of examples of how a scheme will transform the lives of an individual, how it will fill new energy and how it will fill new faith.
They can interview such people and inspire the new generation.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to you all for Michami.
Thank you very much.
Mankind's specialty is that rainy season attracts the mind very much.
As a result of changing climate and environment, there are very adverse conditions.
Over the past few days, in some parts of India, especially in the North Eastern States, Gujarat, Rajasthan and parts of Bengal, people have suffered a lot due to this year's hardships.
The State Governments are also making possible efforts to assist the flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organizations and citizens working with the spirit of service are doing their best to help people in this environment.
Soldiers, Air Force, NDRF, Paramilitary Forces, etc. from the Government of India are working with all their lives to assist the flood victims.
People's lives are terrible due to floods.
The NDRF team was deployed.
Climate warnings are approximately due to the growth of technologies and the progress made in environmental sciences.
As per the climate indicators, if the timelines for our actions are made gradually into a habit, we will be able to avoid major losses.
When I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of our country are preparing for it more than me.
I heard your speech on Chartered Accountants Day and I was very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched on this day last month.
I am glad to hear that a person living in far-flung hills, in the north-eastern regions, who lived in the forest areas, was afraid of addressing them, and now I feel that things are easier than ever before.
It is observed that the time is shorter to reach each other from one place to another and the busyness of the highways is very low.
Pollution has come down due to the speed of the trucks.
Goods are moving fast.
The pace at which this transformation took place, the faster it moved from one to the other, the new registrations took place, has created a new faith in the entire country.
Once upon a time, economists, management experts and technologists will look at the implementation of GST in India as a model before the world and write a paperwork.
A case study will be set up for all the universities in the world.
Because such a massive change, with the participation of millions and millions of people, has brought us to the summit of victory, that we can successfully move forward in such a big country.
The world must learn about it.
All the states have a role to play in the implementation of GST and all the states have a responsibility.
All the decisions were taken by the States and the Central Government together.
What a big dream of One Nation-One Tax has been fulfilled
I was able to see how the officers from the village to the center worked with dedication and how the government and traders had created a cordial atmosphere between the government and the consumers and how they had played a major role in enhancing their trust.
I heartily congratulate all the Ministries, all departments and all officers of the Central and State Governments in this regard.
GST is an excellent example of the success of India's social power.
It's a history.
In a way, it is the pursuit of social reform.
Once again I offer my heartfelt condolences to millions and millions of Indians for making such a big effort to succeed.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of the Revolution.
On August 15, 1947, the country was free.
Thus, in the month of August, many incidents have been associated with the freedom struggle.
This year we are going to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
Our new generation must know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, people gathered together, tried and suffered.
The ladders of history inspire us to build a grand India.
India's people's hearts are united against the British rule.
At the request of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians were dedicated to fighting their lives with the mantra of 'Work or Die'.
Millions of youngsters from across the country gave up their studies and gave up their books.
They're out of the way when they hear the sound of freedom.
On 9th August, when Mahatma Gandhi launched the urge of Bharat Chodo, the British Government had sent all the big leaders to jail, which was the second generation leader of the country, Dr.
Men like Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan were the frontlines.
There was a lot of popularity behind all this success, peoples talent, peoples determination and peoples struggle.
This effort, from 1857 to 1942, reached its peak in 1942.
Within five years, in 1947, the British would have to leave India.
I'd like to connect you with the mathematics.
We got freedom in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It has been almost 70 years.
The governments have come.
It was a victory.
Hopes also awakened.
As in 1942 to 1947, it was the crucial years to achieve a resolve.
From 2017 to 2022, we have come together for five years to achieve our goals with determination and let us celebrate the 15th of August, 2017 as an opportunity for our resolve.
May there be millions of resolves.
We will try to fulfil crores of resolves.
We have to make a resolve in that regard.
2017 must be our dream year.
It must be a part of this August resolution.
Today, it is not necessary to work or die, but to join the dream of a New India, to work with the mind and the body to achieve success.
We have to make a decision that can be realized in the next five years.
Youth organisations, student organisations, NGOs and NGOs can organize social discussions.
Let's bring new ideas forward.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
What can I contribute as a person
With technology, come forward with video, post, blog, articles and new ideas.
Make this goal a mass movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will also launch the uit India uiz for the youth.
This problem is an attempt to connect the youth with the proud history of the country and introduce them to the freedom fighters.
You must propagate it and bring it to the people.
This time too, I invite you to inform me about your suggestions on the MyGov app or on the Narendra Modi App.
I will read it myself and try to tell you about it in time as long as I get it on August 15th.
I'd like to finish it in 40-45-50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I would like to say one more thing today.
India's economic system has a socio-economic philosophy.
We don't ever see it cheaper.
Our festivals and festivals are not just occasions to make us happy.
Our festivals and festivals are an attempt to social reform.
It connects individuals and communities.
Thousands of jobs are associated with this festival, such as Rakhis, Rakhis, Rakhis sellers, sweets sellers etc.
This is why the families of our beloved brothers and sisters live.
We light the lamps for Deepawali - it is not just a celebration of light, it is not just a celebration or decoration of houses.
It is directly related to the poor families who make earthworms.
But today, when I talk about the festivals and the economic conditions of the poor associated with them, I would like to talk about the environment as well.
Sometimes I think that the people of this country are more aware and more active than ever.
In the last one month, citizens who have been aware of the environment write letters to me.
They have requested that the environment friendly Ganesh at Ganesh Chaturthi should be predicted and people should have the opportunity to plan a scheme to like a soil-free Ganesh.
I'm grateful to these alert citizens.
This time I'm predicting this.
I'm sure you'll be with me in this regard.
This will help its craftsmen and poor artists, who will be employed in building idols.
The poor will fill their belly.
Come, let us connect our festivals with the poor, let us connect our festivals with the economic values of the poor, let us celebrate our festivals with the economic festivals of the poor, let us try this.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, be it education in the country or in the economic sector or in the social sector or in the sports sector, we persistently see the daughters of our country bringing laurels to the country.
We, the people of this country feel proud of our daughters.
Our girls showed the best performance at the Women's Cricket World Cup last day.
The pressure on their faces was evident.
I've judged things in another way in that conversation.
I said, look, there is a lot of hope in this period of media.
Whether you win the game or not, you have won the hearts of 125 crore people.
The young generation of our country, especially our daughters, actually work to enhance the glory of our country.
I once again congratulate the young generation of the country, especially our daughters, and wish them the very best.
My dear countrymen, I remind you of the August Revolution, the 9th of August and the 15th of August.
Remembering the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022.
Resolve all the countrymen, prepare five years plans for dreams for all the countrymen.
We have to take the country to new heights, take it, take it.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let us move forward with the hope that the future of the country will be bright.
The weather is changing.
Weather has become comfortable due to heavy rains in many parts of the country.
After the rains, the cold winds have been relieved of the heat in the past.
Whatever the hurdles in life, however stressed in public life or in public life, the rainy season changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great pride and joy in many parts of the country.
Now in many parts of the world Lord Jagannath's chariot is being celebrated.
Those who have learnt about BabasahebAmbedkar must be aware that he praised the temple and traditions of Lord Jagannath as they involve social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
A word called juggernet in English must be known to somebody that means a chariot that cannot be stopped by anyone.
Looking at the interpretation of this juggernaut, this word has emerged from the chariot of Lord Jagannath.
Let us understand from this how the world has given its own importance to Jagannathan's chariot.
Everyone celebrated Ramzan's holy month with admiration.
Now Eid is here.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to everyone on this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is a month of holy charity and a month of joy.
In this holy month of Ramzan, I have noticed an inspiring incident in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
The families of about 3500 Muslim brothers and sisters who live in that small village, in a way the brothers and sisters of the Muslim family are more than the population there.
During this Ramsan, the villagers decided to construct toilets together.
Spend 17 lakh rupees for the other needs of the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for making this holy occasion of Ramzan an opportunity for the betterment of the society.
Each of their actions is very inspiring.
The most important thing is that they have made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
Three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala - were already declared Open Defecation Free States.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana were declared as such.
I express my gratitude to the government, authority and the general public of these five states.
Only then will the habit of body and mind change.
That's how cleanliness is.
Some bad habits are part of our nature.
I noticed a very good incident the other day, and I would like to tell you.
The Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh is an incident.
What was the goal
10,000 toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen will be happy to know that the common man and the government have successfully completed 10,000 toilets within 100 hours.
71 villages are Open Defecation Free.
In and in letters, in the sky.
Recalling the emergencies of the Emergency, Shri Prakash Trichy wrote that June 25 was a reminder of the dark period in the history of democracy.
This vigilance of light towards democracy is commendable.
Democracy is not just a system, it is also a culture.
The price of freedom is the constant awareness of the Attendance Is the Price of Liberty.
Continuous awareness is needed in terms of democracy, and therefore, it is important to remind you of things that affect democracy.
And we must move forward towards the good things of democracy.
On June 25, 1975, it was an unforgettable night of a democratic believer.
In a way, the government was turning the country into a caravan.
They suppressed the voices of protest.
Jayaprakash Narayan, the dignitaries of the country were imprisoned.
The judicial system could not escape the terrible shadow of the emergency.
Newspapers were completely ineffective.
Students from today's journalism and those associated with democracy are constantly trying to enhance the awareness of the people towards democracy in the wake of the black age.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
In a year when Atal ji had declared an emergency, he had written a poem, and he had described the state of mind in that poem.
My dear countrymen, all the Hindustan and the world are proud today.
On 21st June, 2017, we had a meeting in the world.
From the sea to the mountains, people welcomed the sun rays in the morning because of Yoga.
There must be some Hindustani who doesn't feel proud of it.
Yoga was not preceding, but when it was circulated by the rod of Yoga, it became the key to bringing the world together.
Most of the countries of the world have made Yoga day an opportunity.
In China, people performed Yoga on a large scale and people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level in Peru, the world heritage site of Machu Pichola.
People performed Yoga under the shadow of Eiffel Tower in France.
A week long event was organised at 70 locations in a small country like Singapore.
10 stamps on International Day of Yoga were released by the United Nations.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organised at the United Nations Headquarters.
This was attended by UN officials and diplomats from all over the world.
This time Yoga has once again created a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about fifty five thousand people worked together to create a new world record.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
Our Armed Forces like BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CISF, all of them have made Yoga a part of their work with their duty.
Some television channels also propagated.
Your Excellency, the Prime Minister said that in recent times, you have said in Kerala that instead of presenting buffaloes at different places, good books should be a gift to memories.
This was started during your reign in Gujarat but in the recent past, the use of buffaloes is very much visible.
Can't you do anything
Can't you do anything to replace books with bubbles all over the country
He said it was Khadi's calculation to encourage Khadi.
As I was in Gujarat, this programme continued, but after leaving, I left that habit.
But, in this programme of Kerala, I was raised again in this regard.
Now, an information has begun to come down.
Let's gradually make it a habit.
Bucca's life is too short.
You're leaving after you have it.
Welcome to Khadi's Kailash but it benefits many poor families.
Expenditure will be low and it will be useful in the right manner.
It's been many years, but the queen Elizabeth has kept Kales given by Mahatma Gandhi.
There are many kinds of letters, many kinds of people are sending letters.
While reading a letter the other day, I'm sure to tell you about it.
Aurulmozhi Sharavan, a familyman from Madurai, sent me a letter south of Tamil Nadu.
You should know what was in that letter.
Considering the learnings of the children, I was thinking of some economic activity and I thought that the family would get some financial help.
I took loans from the bank under the MUDRA scheme and started the work of buying goods from the market.
That is, the Government departments will look into the registration of e-GM.
They wrote to me that it's very interesting.
They say, "I got the money under the Mudra scheme, started the business and in the e-jam, I got the order from the Prime Minister's office, from the PMO.
It was a new news for me too.
They pointed out what they had bought in the PMO - they bought two thermos and received Rs. 1600.
This is empowerment.
This is the opportunity to promote the industry.
It has transparency, empowerment, and has industry stakeholders.
Government e Market Place-Jame.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other we can also honour our talent in Space Sciences.
Today, India is not only on the planet but also on the atmosphere.
Two days ago, 30 Nano satellites were launched along with the satellite of ISRO-CartoSat-2 series.
These satellites consisted of India and 15 countries including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
India's Nano-Satellite Movement will greatly help in agriculture, agriculture and natural resources.
We must remember that just a few days ago, ISRO JISAT successfully launched 19.
This was one of the most heavy satellites India has ever launched.
The newspapers in our country compared it to the weight of the elephant.
It can only guess what our scientists have done in the environment.
On 19th June, a thousand days of the Mangalyaan Mission were completed.
When we successfully discovered the Mangalyaan Mission, this mission was aimed at a total of six months.
Indias badminton sportsperson Kidambi Srikanth Indonesia has made the country proud by winning the Open.
T.
Usha's Usha School of Athletics has got an opportunity to connect with the inauguration of the synthetic track.
The more we connect with sports, the more we sportsmanship increases.
Sports play a very important role in personality development.
Sports has a great significance in overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
Children should also be encouraged if they are interested in sports in our family.
We all have to dream for the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season and the sustainable atmosphere of fervor, all together present a new experience.
I once again extend my best wishes to all of you, and let me tell you something else in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
English rendering of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 28th May, 2017
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramzan has begun.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and around the world, especially to the Muslim community.
In Ramzan, prayers, spirituality and charity are very important.
Ours is a country that believes in God, denies God, idolaters, and those who oppose idolatry.
All thoughts, all manner of admiration and traditions have enjoyed the art of living together.
Religions, castes, ethnicity and traditions all give us the message of peace and harmony.
The sacred month of Ramzan will help us move forward on the path of peace and harmony and harmony.
Once again I extend my best wishes.
I am glad that many people have experienced me.
I was enthusiastic to tell you what you have to say directly.
I couldn't read everything, I couldn't hear everybody's messages.
But I've seen everything together... some have tried to learn music, some have tried to learn a new narrative, some try to learn new things from the U tube, some try to learn a new language.
I'm very glad to hear a phone call.
I'm talking Daksha Kathal.
I had left the reading habit.
But during this vacation, I decided to read something.
When we started reading about the freedom struggle, we realized how many struggles India had to fight for freedom, how many sacrifices it took, how many freedom fighters had spent years in prisons.
I am inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has suffered a lot in his young age.
Therefore, I urge you to send a message to the new generation on this subject.
I am glad that the new generation wants to know our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Numerous great men gave up their youth in prisons.
During the freedom struggle, the last great men in prisons did a lot of literary work.
Their penance gave strength to India's freedom struggle.
I went to Andaman Nicobar once a year ago.
Cellular went to jail.
This is the birth anniversary of the hero.
Veer Savarkar wrote a book titled Mahi Janmatha in prison.
The poems were written on the prison wall.
He was locked in a small cell.
A light and sound show that takes place is very inspiring.
People from all the states of Hindustan and speaking all languages dedicated their lives in this Cellular Jail in Andaman with the passing away of Kalapani.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday.
What does it mean to connect with nature
Connecting nature is to preserve a better planet.
Where is this better than Mahatma Gandhi's words
Mahatma Gandhi had often said, We need to take care of the unseen world.
Nature has a power.
You must have experienced that when you get tired, when you pour a glass of water on your face, it's very vibrant.
When we get tired, if we open the windows of the house, and open the doors, we breathe in the wind that passes through.
When we are in touch with these five pentagons that are built in the body, we have a new spirit in our body and a new energy is generated.
We've experienced all this, but we don't listen to it, it doesn't touch a corner.
Now, when you're in touch with nature, you must be careful if there's a new chain in you.
Therefore, the Global Movement to Communicate with Nature on 5th June must be a step forward for each one of us.
We are beneficial in protecting our eastern environment.
We will also benefit from saving the environment for the future generations.
It should be recalled that Atharva Veda is the greatest guidance on the environment and it was written thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth is said to be the Son of God.
It is said in the Vedas that our humility is the cause of our soil.
The earth is our mother, and we are our children.
In our country, many festivals and numerous admirations are associated with the environment.
Be it educated, uneducated, urban or rural, or tribal communities, love for nature is a part of social life.
We have to explain it in new words and explain it in detail in new judgments.
Some extraordinary reports from the States are published.
In most of the states, there is a big advancement in the field of vegetation as soon as the rainy season begins.
Millions of trees are planting.
Schoolchildren, social organisations, NGOs and circulators are moving ahead.
This time too, we have to promote tree plantation and contribute ourselves to it.
June 21st is a special day all over the world.
This day is observed as World Yoga Day.
Within a short span of time, June 21 has reached every corner of the world, connecting people with each other.
On the one hand, many separation forces in the world take a shape, when India contributes a lot to the world.
Through Yoga, the world is being harnessed in a rock.
Today, as the body connects the mind, the mind and the soul, Yoga connects the world with each other.
Two days ago, I had written to all the governments and leaders of the world about Yoga.
Last year, I had announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some awards.
In this regard, some steps were taken gradually.
I have received some suggestions on this and I congratulate those who have sent these suggestions.
It's a very funny word.
Grandpa, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Mother, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Gran
The event will provide a new level to Yoga tomorrow and tomorrow.
Yesterday, tomorrow's film will be a pleasant tomorrow's promise.
I invite you all.
There's still about three weeks left to be a worldly day.
This is a healthcare scheme in a way.
I invite everyone to be part of it.
When you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the Chief Servant, I got the opportunity to speak for the first time on 15th August at the Red Fort in Delhi and I talked about cleanliness.
Since then, I have been going to different parts of Hindustan.
Where is Modi going
I am grateful to him for seeing this thing.
You'll understand when you hear this phone call.
Namaste Modiji, I speak Naina from Mumbai.
Modi ji, wherever you go, I regularly see people paying special attention to cleanliness in TV and social media.
In Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively taken up Swachhata as a mission according to your call.
Not only adults, but also children are also awake to cleanliness.
Children who blame people on the road can be found somewhere.
Media also gives great importance to it and recently I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat a few days ago.
What's greater pleasure than cleanliness is connected to my journey
There may be a habit of making all other preparations to welcome the Prime Minister, but now cleanliness is a big thing.
It makes everyone happy and inspiring.
"When Modi ji decides his journey, ask those who invite me, where will cleanliness be at what level
How many tons of garbage will you dedicate to me, so I'll decide whether to come or not.
"The idea is very good, but I have to think.
Instead of giving gifts, we have to become an entrepreneurial entrepreneur that we will build so many garbage in the form of gifts.
How many people can be saved from disease.
What a humanitarian cause
Wealth of these wastewaters is a resource without being treated as waste.
Don't see it as a waste.
If we start seeing these wastewaters as wealthy, new methods of waste management will come up for us.
Youth associated with start-ups will also come up with new initiatives and new instruments.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, is determined to set up a major venture in terms of Waste Management Grid with the help of people's representatives in the cities.
On the occasion of World Environment Day on 5th June, we are going to provide appropriate warehouses to collect solid and liquid waste in about 4,000 cities of the country.
There will be two kinds of trash, one green and the other blue.
The kitchen waste, green skins, food wastes, eggs and leaves are liquid so that they can be invested in green nests.
All this is beneficial in the field of agriculture and it will be reminded of what to do in the field of agriculture .
Secondly, unnecessary papers, iron pieces, glasses, dresses, plastics, polythene, broken doubs, rubber goods, etc. are all dried up in a way.
The responsibilities have been taken over by Versova Residents Volunteers.
Brothers and sisters, today I would like to tell you something very happy that the Risi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become an open defecation free area in connection with the Swachh Bharat Mission.
I congratulate all the people of the Racific Block and the rulers there.
I congratulate the mothers and sisters there.
My dear countrymen, in the last fifteen days, the figures of the present government are going on everywhere in the newspapers, TV channels, social media.
Three years ago, you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the Chief Servant.
Very many surveys have been conducted, very many polls have been held.
I see this as a very healthy thing.
This three-year work has been changed in all respects.
People from all walks of life analyzed this.
This is a very good method of democracy.
Citizens should be responsible in democracy and people should be given accounts of their work by the government.
I would like to thank those who have made outstanding suggestions.
Proactive criticism strengthens democracy.
This analysis is very important for a nation that is awakening.
My dear countrymen, I am an ordinary citizen like you and as a common citizen, the impact of good and bad public is on me as a common citizen.
As I have said, it is important that I have an impact on my mind as an ordinary citizen.
Two days ago, in Rashtrapati Bhavan, Honble President of India, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker of India, Smt.
I am grateful to the President and the Vice President and Spokesperson for giving importance to Mann Ki Baat in accordance with the fact that they are at such a high position.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given a new status.
Some friends also interacted with me during the working of the book on Mann Ki Baat.
He said that he wants to prepare a sketch on the subjects that were discussed in Mann Ki Baat and artistic Ambassador Akbar Sahab Mann Ki Baat to shower his love without paying a single rupee.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahab.
My dear countrymen, the next time Mann Ki Baat will shower rain all over the country, the weather will change, the results of the exams will begin, the new teaching life will begin... when the rain comes, a new fragrance and fragrance will spread.
We can move forward in this environment by expressing love for nature.
My best wishes to you all.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 30th April, 2017
Greetings to my dear countrymen.
Children's curiosity, the ambitions of the youth, and the experience of the adults, are all attentive.
Normally, it's people's nature to advise others.
On the train, when someone coughs while going to the bus, the nearest man says, "Do it, do it."
Advice, opinion is in our nature.
In the first instance, when suggestions were received about the Mann Ki Baat, he heard the voice of advice and received something to learn, and at that time the team felt that it would be a habit for a lot of people to send it.
But when we tried to analyze it minutely, it really filled our minds.
Those who say these opinions, and those who try to reach me, actually do something.
They are striving according to their intellect, strength, capability and surroundings to do a good thing.
When I noticed this, I thought, these suggestions were unusual.
Last time I had expressed my anguish over wasting food in Mann Ki Baat.
This is an example of how things are happening with the cooperation of society.
It's the last day of April.
May 1 is the founding day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the people of both the states.
Nature has changed all the rules of sports.
This time we had to experience the warmth of May-June in our country in April.
While taking the initiatives of Mann Ki Baat from the people, many people have sent suggestions on what to do during this summer.
Everything is prevalent, not new, but it is beneficial to repeat it on time.
Many friends starting from Karti are worried about birds.
They said they should put water on the balcony and the terrace.
Young children in the family are very enthusiastic about this.
Once they notice why they want to keep water, they'll go ten times a day to see if they've got a vessel, if it's water.
He'll see if the birds are coming.
We feel that this is a game, but in reality it is a good experience to wake up the past in the minds of children.
He lived till he was 103.
On the occasion of his 100th birth anniversary, the Bohra Samaj Burhani Foundation launched a massive campaign to save the birds.
I got the opportunity to start with.
They distributed around 50,000 tools to the world.
The Guinness Book of World Records found its place.
Sometimes when the newspaper givers, milkmen, vegetables, postman and others reach the doorstep, they forget to ask us whether we want water or not.
Young friends, I want to tell you something.
Many of our younger generation are happy to live in a very comfortable condition.
Parents also grow up safely.
But I would like to tell you as a friend how your vacation should be.
New places, new experiences, new talents...
Sometimes see things on television, or read them in books, or listen to the familiars... and feel the same thing...
Let the experiment be positive, let's get out of the hungry palace.
If we belong to a middle-aged family, we belong to a happy family.
You can see that you have never had the joy of playing in life.
Have you imagined how a big change will be brought about in their lives when children who lead such a life in the society get a chance to play with you
This experience will teach you a lot of things.
Go to the forests.
Perhaps summer gatherings will be organised, personality development gatherings will take place.
There will be several developmental initiatives.
Everyone will be busy in their world with the help of technology.
Social life is a culture, it is a force.
Another thing I said is about skill, and you don't want to learn something new.
Today is the time of competition.
It will be in a rigorous effort to buy the highest marks and any coaching classes will go on vacations and will be in a critical position for the next examination.
But it should be kept in mind whether the inner humanity is immaterial and it should be kept in mind that it is away from humanitarian qualities.
Can we have a little more focus on skill development
Stay away from technology and spend some time with yourself.
Learn some musical instruments, learn 5-50 words of a new language, namely, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi...
Try to learn something you don't know. You'll have some benefit.
New places, new cities, new villages...
But look wherever you go, look like a curiosity, understand, discuss with people, ask them... and enjoy seeing it there.
Try and settle yourself.
Don't waste time for travel.
Spend three to four days at a place.
Then I went to another place and stayed there for three to four days.
We can learn a lot of things through this.
Share me pictures where you're going.
Share your experiences using the hashtag incredible India.
Friends, this time the Government of India has given you a good opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from silos.
They don't need money.
They're beginning to rely on digital transactions.
Do you also think that you can earn money through this
The Government of India has a plan.
You must have downloaded the Bhim app.
Ten rupees will be invested in your account from the government.
One day, if we get twenty people together, we'll earn 200 rupees by the afternoon.
Businesses and students can earn through this.
The project is scheduled till 14th October.
Your own role has been in shaping Digital India.
You will be a guardian of New India.
Holidays, vacations and monetary opportunities.
Please introduce digital payments.
Normally in our country there is an atmosphere of hatred towards VIP culture.
However, now I realize that it is so deep that no matter how big a person in the country, the government has decided not to roam around with red lights in the car.
In a way, VIPs became a symbol of culture.
It is understood from the experience that even though the red light was on the ship, it entered the minds of the people and intelligently created the VIP culture.
Now the red light's gone, so no one can claim that the red light in the head is gone.
I got a very interesting phone call.
I understand people are worried about red lights.
The Government wants to talk about prohibition of red beacon lights.
I read in the newspaper, every Indian is a ranked VIP.
I felt very proud.
Thank you for that.
Instead of VIP, EPI means Ever Person Ease Important, everyone is important.
Let's work together.
My dear countrymen, I always want to remind you of our history, our culture and our traditions.
This will give us energy and inspiration.
This year, we are celebrating the 10th birth anniversary of Ramnujacharya, the 125 crore Indians.
We are immersed in other things so that we can only remember it for centuries.
Century is very important for other countries of the world.
Through his own behaviour, he drove away those who counted as untouchables.
Thousands of years ago, he organised a campaign to make them enter the temple and successfully visited the temple.
How lucky we are for the great men born in our society to eliminate the evils of our society in all ages
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya, we will inspire the spirit of strength in organizing social unity.
The Government of India will release a stamp on 1st May to commemorate Swami Ramanujacharya.
Swami Ramanujacharya is respected and dedicated to the nation by offering floral tributes.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow on 1st May, there is another significance.
Only a few people know that today we are indebted to Baba Saheb for the benefits and dignity of the workers.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb and Ramanujacharya then we remember the great Karnataka Sannyasi and social reformer of the 12th century Jagat Guru Basaveshwar.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to attend a function.
I got the opportunity to release his narratives.
In the twelfth century, in the Kannada language, he is deeply concerned about teaching and teaching.
In Kannada, he said, "Kaya Kave Kailas.
This means that you can reach the glory of Lord Shiva through spirituality.
That means heaven can be achieved by acting...
I've often said Shreyev wins.
On the importance of labour, I often recall what Dattapant Thangdi ji, the founder and thinker of the Indian Masdur Group, said.
Today, when we talk about the workers, it is natural to remember Dattopant Thangdi.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate the Buddhist festival.
People from all over the world associated with Lord Buddha will celebrate it.
Ashoka's life in India is an excellent example of his journey from war to Buddha.
It is a privilege to see that the United Nations is celebrating Vesak Day on this great mountain of Buddha Purnima.
This time it is being held in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have the opportunity to honour Buddha in Sri Lanka.
His memories will be renewed.
My dear countrymen, in India, every effort has been made to move forward with the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas (Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas).
Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas is not only in India but also in the global context.
Especially in our neighbouring countries.
India-South Asia satellite will be launched on May 5th.
The capability and connectivity of the satellite will help in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
It will help in formulating the framework of natural resources, whether in terms of telemedicine or education or in terms of deeper technological connectivity or people-to-people contacts.
This is an important step of India to enhance cooperation with the entire South Asia.
An invaluable gift.
This is a great example of our commitment to South Asia.
March 26 is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic struggle against injustice and a wonderful victory for the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh.
Today, on this great day, I extend my best wishes to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on the auspicious occasion of Independence Day.
Rabindranath Tagore's memories are traditional to all of us.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore also wrote the National Anthem of Bangladesh.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore was that he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913, but was also given the status of Nighthood by the British.
However, Rabindranath Tagore is one of the greatest men who raised their protests during the British massacre in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919.
It was an event that had a deep impression on the mind of a child aged 12.
The child who laughed at fields and sports during his childhood, made Jallianwala Bagh a new inspiration in the life of a cruel massacre.
The 12-year-old boy in 1919 was Shaheed Bhagat Singh, our beloved and inspiration for all of us.
On 23rd March, the British hanged Bhagat Singh and his friends Sukhdev and Rajguru.
We know that even at the time of death, it was a pleasure to serve Bharatmata on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru and not a fear of death.
All the dreams of life have been dedicated to the freedom of India.
These three heroes still inspire us.
We cannot narrate the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru by words.
And the British Empire was afraid of these three men.
The prison was locked up, the hanging was sure, but the British had the idea of what about them now.
That's why he killed 23 people who were to be hanged on March 24.
They did it without anyone knowing extraordinary.
Then they brought their bodies to Punjab today and burnt them without any knowledge of the English.
A few years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I felt a tremor on that land.
I would certainly say to the youth of the country - if you get a chance, you must go to Punjab and go to the shrines of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagwan Singhs mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
It was a period of rising independence, its intensity and its propaganda.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for the armed revolution.
A reflection of Gandhiji's thoughts and style in India's freedom struggle was seen in Champaran.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and became a new inspiration for the country.
Today, whatever form of Mahatma Gandhi is in our mind, we cannot assess the Satyagraha of Champaran on that basis.
A man who returned to Hindustan in 1915... for just two years...
It was just a beginning.
Let's guess how hard he's gonna have to do at that time, how hard he's gonna have to do.
Champaran Satyagraha was an opportunity to recognise Mahatma Gandhi's organisational capabilities and the ability to make the country public.
Mahatma Gandhi, through his behaviour, mobilised, inspired and driven the British Empire to fight the poor, illiterate and illiterate people...
Champaran Satyagraha shows us this wonderful power, so that we can recognise the importance of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we think about Mahatma Gandhi a hundred years ago, when we think about Gandhiji who had made Champaran Satyagraha then Champaran Satyagraha is a big subject for any person who started his public life.
This is the strong foundation of a New India, the desire and efforts of 1. 25 billion people towards transformation.
New India is not a government hypothesis, it is not a democratic party's performance.
New India is the call of 1. 25 billion people.
This is the imagination of how 100-5 crore people want to build a grand India.
There is an idea, an excitement, a vision, a desire.
They do it like quiet servants, as penitent as they do.
There are many who go to everyday hospitals and help patients.
You know, there's a lot of people running for blood donation.
If someone is hungry, there are many who think about feeding them.
We can say that our country is Bahuratna Vasundara.
Our veins have the imagination of serving God.
And if we look at it with social consciousness then how powerful it is to be formed when we look at it.
When we talk about New India, we have to think about it, analyze it and look at it from a different perspective.
If the 100-25 crore people decide, if the path is set with determination, if one step after the other then the dream of a New India will be realized in our eyes.
All this should not be done through the budget, through government schemes and government funds.
If all citizens decide that we will observe transport laws, and that they will fulfil my obligations with due responsibilities, if every citizen does not use petrol or diesel a day a week...
You can see this dream of New India being realised in this country with 1. 25 billion people.
This means that all citizens obey their civil liberties and obey their duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you.
In the last few months, people in our country have been participating in the Digital Revolution of Digital Payments and have been curious about how money can be transferred without money.
Even the poorest of the poor are trying to learn it, and gradually the people are moving towards transactions without money.
Digital Payments have been followed by a number of methods following the cancellation of notice.
It's been two and a half months since the BHIM App, but it's been downloaded by about one and a half million people.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against corruption and corruption.
A hundred and fifty million people, if they want, don't wait for it for a year.
I can do it in six months.
Let's do this in our daily lives.
You will be the heroes in the fight against corruption and corruption.
Several Digital Fairs have been organized to educate the people and to create awareness among the people.
100 programmes will be organized across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
There were presentations in it.
Twelve lakh people have received gifts for consumers.
Seventy thousand people have received gifts for traders.
Everyone is determined to move forward with this method.
On 14th April, Dr.
As planned earlier, on 14th April, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb, this Digital Festival is going to end.
There's a big program when it's over a hundred days.
There's a provision for mega disposal.
Let us propagate the BHIM App in the days that remains to mark the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Make ourselves contribute to reducing the sum incurred by payment notice.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time Mann Ki Baat gets a lot of suggestions from the people, but the need for cleanliness is rising every time.
Girls from Dehradun, Gayatri, who studied in class 11, conveyed their greetings and best wishes to you all for the first time in this election.
I want to tell you my Manki Baat.
I want to say that people must understand how important cleanliness is.
I'm going through a river every day, in which people wear plenty of garbage, polluting the river.
Brothers and sisters, look at the pain that a child studying in class II is suffering from river pollution.
The child is so angry to see the shells in the river.
I see this as a good sign.
New awakening has taken place in the country since the launch of Swachhta Abhiyan.
Hate to waste is rising.
Whether it is awake, active partnership, people's progress... it's important.
I want to tell all those who listen to Gayatri in my Manki Baat today that the message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
The things you see are filled on the plate, you can't eat it all.
It doesn't matter to tell anyone.
Mothers say in our homes when they pray to the children, son or daughter, take them everywhere.
Secondly, if you can save a little from this, it will be economically beneficial for the family.
It's a good thing to think for society, but it's beneficial for the family.
I don't urge you to do this, but I urge you to get awake.
I know the youngsters who are doing great work in this regard.
They've made a mobile app for this.
People call it somewhere when they know it's swallowed up and then they store it and use it properly.
This work is being done by the youth of our country.
We can see people like this somewhere in all the states of Hindustan.
We can inspire their lives to avoid eating.
As much as you can eat.
Look, it's the way of change.
Those who are cautious about health always say - keep a little empty stomach and keep the plate a little empty.
When we talk about health, we have to recall April 7, the World Health Day.
Universal Health Coverage (UNHC) is aimed at health for all by 2030.
This time, the United Nations is focusing on Depression on World Health Day on April 7.
We also know the word depression, but if you make the meaning of the word, some say it's depression.
According to an estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world are under depression.
Formation of a psychological atmosphere starts with the liberation.
The first mantra is to say it openly rather than end depression.
Tell your friends, parents, brothers, teachers what is in your mind.
Sometimes loneliness, especially children in the hostel, will be more difficult.
The nature of our country is that we have grown up in our family, a large family is interconnected, which reduces the risk of depression.
Otherwise, not when everyone gets out together, but if I don't come, if I'm telling you to be alone.
Let those who can speak openly to him have a chance to stay with him.
Make smile and motivate him to talk, bring it out if it's hard inside.
It's a good idea.
Depression causes physical and mental disorders.
As diabetes becomes the master of all kinds of diseases, depression also deprives us of all the capabilities of fighting, daring and deciding.
If you cannot open your mind to yourself then seek help from someone who is serving closely.
Help with your heart, share your condolences.
If you try to understand someone's grief, if you do it with service, then a new confidence will emerge in you.
By connecting with others, by helping someone and serving selflessly, you can also reduce the weight of your mind.
Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is also very helpful in emancipation from tension, freedom from mental stress, and the movement towards cleanliness.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
Recently, the Union Government took a major decision.
It should be welcomed that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
The responsibility of the family is to take part in the economic responsibilities of the household, because of all this injustice has to be done to the newborn.
Therefore, the central government took a big decision.
India has taken such a big decision for our sisters.
My dear countrymen, on 5th April, the festival of Ram Navami is celebrated on 9th April, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
May the lives of these great men be inspired and be the strength to swear for a New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shakla Pratipada, Year End Renaissance and New Year is coming and I extend my greetings and good wishes to all of you on this New Year.
After spring, agriculture is the beginning of cultivation and it is time for the farmers to get the benefits of their work.
This New Year is celebrated in many ways in different parts of our country.
The New Year is being celebrated in the names of Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi as New Year in Andra and Karnataka, Sindhi-Chand for Sindhis, Navreh in Kashmir, Samvatsarpuja in Awadh region, Jud-Shital in Mithila in Bihar and Satuvani in Magadha.
India is a country full of diversity.
My best wishes to you all on this New Year.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 21st February, 2017 at 11.
New leaves are coming to the trees after the rice season.
The flowers bloom.
Gardens and gardens become green.
The color of the birds begins to attract the mind.
Not only the flowers, but also the sun shining fruits are seen in the branches of the trees.
The gardens of manga, the result of the summer, begin to appear in the spring.
The Amir Khusro funds are very interesting about the moments that are changing.
Written by Amir Khusro: Fool Rahi Sarasom Sakal Bun, Ambawa Foot, Tesu Fulecoil Boley, Dar-Dar (which is flowered flowers, flowers, flowers, singers, peaks) When nature is pleasant, man enjoys himself when the leaf is comfortable.
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri, Holi celebrations all fill human life with happiness.
Many people don't know about the achievements of ISRO by writing on the brightest Narendra Modi App.
So they want to know about the launch of 104 satellites and the interceptor missile.
Bhubaneswar, I thank you very much for reminding me of Indias pride.
Whether it is to fight poverty or to avoid diseases or to connect with the world, to gain knowledge, technology and science have also marked its role.
February 15, 2017 is a day of pride for India.
Our scientists have created an opportunity to raise the glory of India in front of the world.
We all know that many unprecedented missions have been successfully completed in the last few years.
After the success of Mangalyaan on Mars, the ISRO has established a world record in the space of space.
104 satellites from different countries like USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland and India have been successfully launched through the ISRO Megadowt.
Together with 104 satellites into the atmosphere, India is the first country in the world to write history.
It is especially heartening to note that PSLV is successfully launched for 38th time.
This is not only an ISRO but also a history of the whole of India.
The cost-effective and efficient environmental mission of ISRO is amazing all over the world.
The world appreciates the success of Indian scientists with an open mind.
Brothers and sisters, one of the 104 categories is the greatest.
Our satellite has sent some pictures as soon as it gets there.
It's started its work.
It is a matter of great pleasure that the entire leadership of this mission has been carried out by our young scientists and our women scientists.
The role played by the youth and women is an important component of the success of ISRO.
I convey my best wishes to the scientists of ISRO in the name of the people of the country.
They have always kept their goal of bringing ecosystems to the service of the nation for the common man, and new pillars are being laid in their crown.
India has successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor missile in the security sector.
You will be happy to know that only four or five countries of the world have achieved this goal.
The scientists of India showcased this.
The advantage of this is that even if the missile targeting India is 2,000 kilometers away, the missile will destroy it within the atmosphere.
We are happy to see new technologies and new scientific temperaments.
Curiosity has played a major role in human development.
An attempt to know the universe, the creative laws, the human minds continues.
New science and new technologies are born out of it.
All the technologies and new forms of science are born in a new era.
My dear young friends, we speak of the hard work of scientists and scientists, and often I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should increase the passion for science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Today's scientists become the cause of a new change in the life of future generations.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say, "A science did not exactly explode from the sky.
All sciences are developed and built upon experiences.
Revered Bapu also said, "I express my heartfelt condolences to the enthusiasm, teaching and dedication that led them to the discovery of modern scientists following the truth.
"Science seeks to utilise those principles in order to address the needs of the common man, what media should be, what technology should be, because it is considered to be the greatest contribution of the common man.
It was analysed how such inventions should be used to identify, exhibit and enlighten people, how these inventions should be beneficial to the common man, how to produce more and how to commercially utilize them.
Sometimes problems show the importance of science to find peace.
All arrangements are in accordance with technology.
In a way, technology becomes an integral part of our lives.
In the recent past, the Digi-Dhan Yojana was very important.
In particular, younger generations are habituated to making digital payments on their mobile phones.
I see this as a good luck.
In our country, we have received immense support in the recent past for 'Lakhi Grahak Yojana' and 'Digit Dhan Vyapar Yojana'.
For nearly two months, fifteen thousand people get a thousand rupees a day.
Through these two schemes, the country has got approval for the launch of Digital Payments in India as a peoples movement.
Under this scheme, more than one lakh consumers have received Rs. 1 lakh each.
More than 4000 traders received an award of Rs. 50,000.
Farmers, traders, small traders, other professionals, homelands and students are enthusiastic about this and they are benefiting from it.
Asked whether only youngsters come or older, the awardees include 15-year-olds and 65-70-year-olds.
Shri Anand ji from Mysore is happy to write on the Narendra Modi App and he received a thousand rupees as a gift under the 'Lakey Grahak Yojana'.
So I thought they deserved me a thousand rupees, and I gave them a thousand rupees.
I am very happy that your name and your deeds give us joy.
All of you have done inspiring work.
In Maharashtra, a young friend, Pooja Nemade is a Post Graduate student, who shared his experiences with others about how they use the RuPay card e-wallet in the family and how they are happy to use it.
On completion of 100 days of Laki Grahak Yojana, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
On 14th April, a massive award of Rs.
Forty-five days remaining.
Remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar, can't you do this
The 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar is over.
Remembering him, you should teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
Teach me how the money's activity is going, especially the small traders around.
Give special importance to the Bhim App for the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar this time.
Go home and bring the BHIM app to 125 crore hands.
This drive over the last two-three months has been successful in many townships, in many villages and in many cities.
Farmers in our country have worked hard and produced food grains to break records this year.
All indicators are that our farmers have broken records in the past.
It seemed daily to see the crops of the farms being celebrated today as well as Vaisakhi.
This year, more than 2,700,000 tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
The farmers of my country listened to the voices of the poor and about 290 lakh hectares of farmland have been cultivating different kinds of pigs.
The government is constantly trying.
A function of senior officers of 23 States under the leadership of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India was held in Telangana yesterday.
We can see wealth from waste.
It's proven.
If a household with six categories has a standard double kitchen toilet, it will be filled in about six years.
After that the waste can be sent back to the second hole.
In six to twelve months the dirt in the ditch is completely decomposed.
It is completely safe to handle such waste, as a fertilizer, an important round of NPK.
Farmers know the NPK fertilizer very well.
Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, which is very nutritious, is considered to be a very good fertilizer in the agriculture sector.
As the government takes this step, others must have taken such steps.
At the government level, several departments regularly observe Swachhata Diwas.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development, in collaboration with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, is going to strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan in the first week of March.
The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation along with the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation is leading the Swachhta Abhiyan in the second week of March.
We all know that whatever good happens to any citizen of our country, the whole country will be proud to scale new heights, and confidence will increase.
I once again congratulate all team players.
The nation is proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends.
I have always believed that brothers and sisters with disabilities are capable, determined, courageous and imaginative.
We'll get to learn something from them for a moment.
Whether it is about playing games or about aeronautics, women in our country are not far behind.
Together they are moving forward, they are making the country proud by achieving achievements.
Our women have won silver medals in the Asian Ragby Sevens Trophy in the past few days.
My best wishes to those players.
World Women's Day is being celebrated on 8th March.
Today it's not just a government program.
The thoughts of the people towards the past ethics that have been going on for years have changed.
Listening to the news that the girl was born was turned into a celebration, it was a pleasure.
In a way, positive thinking towards girls has become a cause for social recognition.
It was learnt that child marriages were stopped due to a specific public outreach in Gudalur district of Tamil Nadu.
Nearly 175 child marriages have been prevented so far.
Bank accounts have been opened to more than fifty thousand and sixty thousand girls under the SAUNIA Samriddhi Yojana of the District Administration.
Under the Convergence Model in Katwa district of Jammu and Kashmir, all sections have been included in the 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' programme, and in addition to organizing Gram Sabhas, efforts are being made to ensure that the district administration and orphan girls are adopted and their education is ensured.
In Madhya Pradesh, a mass movement is being organized to educate girl child in every village and every household under the aegis of 'HargharDastak' in Madhya Pradesh.
Rajasthan, our child, our school, the Apana Bacha Apna Vidyalaya, has been implemented to motivate the re-scholarship and re-scholarship of the under-school girls.
In short, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme is taking several forms.
I see it as a good sign.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
On the one hand, when our country is enjoying the rainy season, on the other hand, there is a festival or festival in every corner of India.
This will continue till Diwali.
Perhaps, our ancestors have pursued the tactics, the economics and the shaping of social life in a way that society cannot be obstinate in any environment.
In the recent past, we have celebrated many festivals.
Everyone can find solutions to these problems from the life of Shrikrishna.
Despite all these significance, take charge of the chariot in the battlefield.
Sometimes pick up the mountain, sometimes pick up food.
That is, Krishna has a new feeling of everything.
So, when I talk to you today, I pay attention to the two lovers.
One is a philosopher, a charming and charming charm.
The Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan left the Yamuna coast and lived in Dwarka on the coast of Gujarat, and Mohanan, born on the sea shore, finally reached Delhi on the coast of Yamuna.
Whether it is the importance of selfless service or the importance of knowledge or the importance of smiling at the bottom of all the heights of life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 100th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
A new pillar has been established in the history of mankind.
The duty towards service, service and service was always a part of his life, which was always associated with Mahatma Gandhi.
He gave examples of service in his own life.
Mahatma Gandhis personality, society, humanity and humanity were all this.
He emphasized on social harmony in his own way everywhere, be it the Financial Family in Africa, the Tolstoy Family, the Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit several important places related to the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi had given importance to organisationalism with a sense of service.
We have to bring about the emotions of social service, social development and social organisation in our practical life.
In the true sense, this is the tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the real essay.
There must be a lot of opportunities like this, and we'll be together.
But what is Gandhi 150
As an individual, what can be shared in these efforts
Imagine what value addition you can have.
We have a ladies club.
Let us continue to do things in the modern ladies club, but all the members of the Ladies Club should work together to do something.
We can do a lot of things.
Set up old books, distribute to the poor, distribute knowledge.
130 crore people will have 130 crore concepts and 130 crore initiatives can be launched.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat.
The Salt Satyagraha in Dandi during the freedom struggle was a great path.
In Delhi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
I urge you to visit any place related to Mahatma Gandhi in the days to come.
It can be Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaranak, Ashram of Wardha, and somewhere in Delhi related to Mahatma Gandhi.
When you go to a place like this, you must share your picture in the social media and inspire others.
This time, in the Indian Pavilion at Venice Benale, there were exhibitions showcasing many interests related to Gandhijis memories.
Out of these, the Haripura panels were specially attractive.
You will be reminded of the fact that the congress was held at Haripura in Gujarat and the election of Subhas Chandra Bose as the President was recorded in the history.
These art exhibitions have a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura Convention of Congress, the then Principal Nandalal Bose was invited to Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan Kal Bhawan in 1937-38.
He wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people of India and showcase his artwork in the Mahasammelan.
In addition to his artistic constitution, Nandal Bose was also made a charisma.
Nandal Bose visited the villages near Haripura and finally painted some pictures that showcase the life of rural India.
These valuable artefacts were a major discussion in Venice.
Once again, I extend my best wishes to Gandhiji on his 150th birth anniversary and also appeal to all Indians to make a resolve.
For the country, for the society, there is something else that needs to be done.
This will be a good, realistic, relevant businessmanship for Bapu.
My best wishes to Mother India, in the last few years, we have been running a programme called Swachhata Hi Seva for almost two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will begin on 11th September.
This time we have to give special importance to plastic.
On 15th August, I had reminded from the ramparts of the Red Fort that how zealously and enthusiasticly 125 crore people had organised a mass movement to eradicate wastage.
Likewise, we have to stop using single-use plastics together.
People from all sections of the society are very excited about this issue.
My brothers and sisters from the business community have placed a board in front of the shop in which those who come to buy goods should bring the bag.
It can also save money and play their role in protecting the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when we commemorate his 100th birth anniversary, we will not only dedicate to him an Open Defecation Free India but also lay the foundation for a new mass movement against plastic across the country.
Let's turn it into fuel.
What is greater inspiration than Gandhiji
My dear countrymen, our cultural linguistics are in a way enlightened.
We will get what we want in our lives.
I would like to say a great deal through a Sanskrit translation.
It's written centuries ago, but it's still very important.
It is a very nice synonym: Prithvivam Trini Ratnani Jalmad, Subhas Tammoiva Pashanakhandeshu Ratna Sanskrit, i. e.
Fools call the stone a jewel.
Our culture had great glory.
We have also turned the knowledge of that day into science.
The awareness about the need for nutrition is transforming the country into a mass movement through modern scientific methods.
People are fighting against malnutrition through new and attractive methods.
Accordingly, in the harvest season, Anganwadi sevaks collect one grinding cereal from the people.
This grain is used to make warm food for children and women.
After this, the person becomes self-dedicated to this goal and becomes a fighter of that peoples movement.
All of us must have heard about an event called Annaprasham in every part of India.
It's the first time we're gonna give the kids a meal.
Not liquid food, thick food.
Sometimes people donate food.
When there is a birthday, auspicious day or a memorable day in the family, the family members take nutritious and tasty food to Anganwadi or to school and those from their families provide self-salvation to the children.
They share their happiness and share others.
It is a good combination of service and happiness.
Friends, there are many such small things that can be successfully fought against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness about nutrition, malnutrition and the poor and the rich suffer.
The month of September will be observed throughout the country as a nutrition month.
You must be part of this, add something new, and your role may be part of it.
It means that if you can save oneself from malnutrition then we save ourselves from malnutrition.
Everything I've visited in the past weeks, man vs.
I have never thought that there will never be a chance to touch the minds of the youth of the world.
What's happening
He went to Bhutan last week.
Since I have had the opportunity to go everywhere as the Prime Minister, since then, whenever I have got the opportunity to sit close to everyone due to the celebration of International Day of Yoga, somebody has been asking me something about Yoga on 5th March.
There will not be a big leader in the world who has not discussed Yoga with me, but this is my experience all over the world.
The Discovery Channel is scheduled to be broadcast in 165 countries.
It is time for global discussions on environment, global warming and climate change, I firmly believe that this episode of Discovery Channel will help in introducing the world on issues such as Indias message, Indias traditions, and the sympathy for nature in Indias cultural journey.
Today people want to know about the steps taken for climate conservation and creative environment in our country.
You've been shooting several times, what happened
I ask with a lot of curiosity.
Look, there's no secret in it.
I'll tell you the secret because there's a question in the minds of many.
It's no secret.
The truth is that technology has been used efficiently in the interaction with Bear Grills.
Whatever I say, its interpretation continued in English, and he was listening to it through a small instrument which was not connected to the ears of Bear Grylls.
I mean, he was listening to me in Hindi but he was listening to me, so it was easy to talk, this is the wonder of technology.
After this show many people talked to me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You and nature must go to wildlife.
I've told you earlier, I repeat, I want to go north-east of India.
You have to spend some time there.
My dear countrymen, the environmental concerns and anxiety in India is naturally visible.
Last month, I had the opportunity to launch the Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, it was only half of it.
Tiger Summit and Tiger Summit held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010 for tigers.
Concerned over the decline in the number of tigers in the world, he made a resolve.
By 2022, the number of tigers in the world should be doubled.
But this is a New India, and we are achieving our goals soon.
We doubled the number of tigers in 2019 itself.
The number of tigers in India has not only doubled the number of protected areas and community reserves.
The Gir forest has taken several steps one after the other.
In 2007, it was decided to appoint female guards there.
Infrastructure has been increased to promote tourism.
When we talk about nature and wildlife, we talk about conservation.
We have to think of sympathy beyond protection.
Our sciences have very good advice in this regard.
Listen to what is said in our scriptures centuries ago, the forest deforestation has been saved since the forest deforestation has not existed and if there is no forest, tigers are forced to enter human beings and are killed.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893
This young sannyasi who captured the human race all over the world has established India's glorious personality in the world.
On September 11, 1893, the words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda made the world obliged to change his vision towards India.
Come, let us strive to live with the true strength of India that Swami Vivekananda saw as the India of Swami Vivekananda.
But I'm not going to enter the details.
Wait till August 29.
We will strive to get rid of plastics at home and abroad with all our might.
I am confident that this movement will continue to be full of social media.
Come, let us move forward with a new zeal, with a new resolve, with a new strength.
We can move forward by expressing our inner joy with the spirit of service.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 21st January, 2017 at 11.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to everyone.
Our Republic Day, January 26, was celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in all parts of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, is in a way a cultural festival that makes the future generations aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities.
However, the deeper and widespread discussions cannot be held in our country, however, however, the duties of citizens and the rights of citizens should be discussed.
Within two minutes, it demonstrates a social outlook, determination and respect for the martyrs.
Everyone has a natural respect for the armed forces in our country.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been honoured with various bravery awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
Can you do something that is very enthusiastic about social media, especially appealing to the youth
On the one hand, when we were happy to hear the joyous and enthusiastic celebrations of January 26, the heroes of our armed forces, who were guarding the security of the nation in Kashmir, were brave.
I pay homage to those heroes and bow down to them.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I regularly clarify my mind through the programme Mann Ki Baat.
The months of January, February, March and April are the days of exams in every family.
When I came to know about this topic, many teachers, parents and students sent me messages, asked questions, suggested, pained and mentioned the problem.
I would like to share with you the thoughts that have come to my mind after seeing all that.
I received a telephone message from a child called Creator.
Listen, creatively, "Sir, I want to tell you that there is a very scary atmosphere in our home, neighborhood and society at the time of exams.
And that is why the children are being encouraged instead of being encouraged.
Only a few people who are happy with the exams.
Exam for more and more people is an opportunity to stress.
That's when good happens inside us, it's coming out.
There is a feeling of strength in the society's festival.
The best shows up.
During the exams, the entire family must create an atmosphere of enthusiasm among friends and neighborhoods.
You'll see pressure turning into plashers, and pressure becomes happy.
Encouragement makes the mind weightless.
Look, it's going to change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, examinations are conducted in these three four months.
You must understand that the power to call memories is the best in the calm mind.
If you're tense, all the doors will be closed, the outside will not come in, the inside will not come out.
There is a hindrance to the thought process, so it becomes a burden.
I am telling you from my experience that if there is mental stress then we will forget that if there is peace then we cannot imagine that things cannot be imagined then it will be very useful.
The problem is not that you don't know, it's not that you didn't study.
But when your psychological pressure suppresses your wisdom, your knowledge, your learning, your psychological pressure subdues it all.
Looks like a life-threatening problem.
You'll think the exams you're going to write are the tests of a year-long study.
P.
J.
If he had been disappointed because of that defeat, if he had failed with life, India would have got such a great scientist, if he had achieved such a great President.
So the competition has grown, and the pressure of the students has increased.
Marks and mark sheets are of limited use.
It's not all in life.
Life goes on depending on how much knowledge you gained.
If you believe in these things, the markwall will be rolled after you, and you will never need to follow the mark.
In life, you will be benefitted by knowledge, skills, self-confidence and determination.
Look at his experience, knowledge and success.
So the weight of the market stops us from going the right way.
But if you pay attention to the market, you'll gradually limit yourself to certain things.
This is a very psychological battle.
In fact, competition is not useful for leading a life and it is necessary to compete with oneself to lead a life ahead.
How better is the day to come than the other day
How is it better to have a chance to come than what happened
Often you've seen it in the playgrounds, and you'll know it quickly, so let's give you an example.
It is the uniqueness of their lives that they compete for themselves in terms of most successful sportspersons.
You didn't sleep because of the stress of the exams before, did you sleep now
Secondly, you're worse than him.
Third, equal.
Just keep in mind how to do better than you did before, how to do it.
Beautiful parents have expressed their views on the role of parents.
He said that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
Because mothers are more vigilant about the future of children in their homes, are illiterate and simplify a lot of things.
If you learn to approve, more problems will end there.
So I have to tell parents that you do something like this to the children sometimes.
Have you ever thought of giving the children an atmosphere of laughter during the course of the examination
Look, the atmosphere will change.
A very interesting phone call came.
Because I did something like that when I was a kid, and I tried to shit once I was a kid.
I made a lot of preparations for that.
I tried to find ways for it, and I lost a lot of time for it.
"You're right.
Sometimes, if you don't believe in your own talent, you'll examine whether I wrote it to the next man or not.
Perhaps the name is correct, it's wrong that the next man wrote it.
And when you see it, you'll write ourselves wrongly and lose yourself.
I mean, it doesn't matter much.
It's kind of a liar, so don't.
The shit makes you filthy, so don't shit.
"What is the Prime Minister asking the children to play at the time of the exam," I would be angry.
It is generally understood that students are careless about learning from sports.
This idea is wrong.
This is the basis of the problem.
If there is a comprehensive development, there is a life outside the books, which is very vast.
It's time to learn to live.
It's time to shape life.
It's called maintenance.
In my view of the exams, there are three things that are important: the right rest, the second sleep for the body, and the third intellectual activity, and the body has a big part.
So the rest of the body needs a chance to work.
Have you ever thought of seeing the sky in front of you, of seeing the trees and trees, of making your hearts cheerful
Long breath goes very slow to stress.
We don't have to stay in the room for a long breath.
Some feel like sitting late at night, learning too much - that's not true.
You must sleep as much as you can.
So you won't lose time to learn.
A patron who came to see me about it asked me, how many hours do you sleep
I asked you back, brother, are you a doctor
He said that while addressing at the time of election, your shutdown sound is related to sleep.
If you sleep enough, your vocal code will be relaxed.
He gave me a big medicine that didn't think about sleeping, volcanic code and my voice.
It doesn't mean to sleep.
So don't do that.
If you can, follow it, don't do it if you can't.
Otherwise, it would be a burden and I would like to advise the parents of your family not to be burdened.
Remembering your own determination, believing in your own capabilities and going to exams.
My best wishes.
Festival of exams to win all exams.
And the exams won't be exams.
Remember this spell and proceed.
My dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on 1st February 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the Coast Guard officers and jawans for their service to the nation.
The Coast Guard is the 4th largest coastal force in the world with 126 ships and 62 aircraft manufactured in our country.
In keeping with this idealism, the Coast Guard remains relaxed day and night in favourable environments to protect the country's maritime boundaries and coastal environment.
Last year, the Coast Guard has taken a major role in cleaning the coastal shores of our country with their responsibility.
Thousands of people participated in it.
It is a matter of gratitude for them to think about maritime hygiene along with coastal security.
Very few people are aware that not only men in the Coast Guard in our country, but women also work successfully with shoulders.
Our female officer pilot in the Coast Guard is not only acting as observers but also controlling the hovercraft.
Today, maritime security is a very important issue in the world and therefore, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all those who have worked as the great maritime security of India on the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard.
The Spring Panchami Festival is being held on 1st February.
Spring is recognized as the best basket.
Spring is known as King of Leather.
In our country, the festival of Vasant Panchami Saraswati Puja is celebrated.
This is considered an opportunity to worship tricks.
Not only this, it's a celebration that inspires the heroes.
Mera Range de Basanti Chola is a source of inspiration.
I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on the auspicious occasion of this spring festival.
My dear countrymen, the Akashvani of Mann Ki Baat also offers new shapes in their own way.
After my Mann Ki Baat last month, Mann Ki Baat has started listening to local languages.
I once again congratulate Akashwani for this thing, since they have started inspiring and congratulations to the people of our country.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to connect with you.
Hundreds of good luck.
Today is an occasion in life to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion.
Jesus Christ said, 'The poor don't want our recognition.'
St. Luke specially says, "Jesus not only served the poor, but also congratulated the poor and this is the real empowerment.
A story related to this is very famous.
Because the others gave them a lot, but the widow gave them all their services, today 25th December.
Two days ago, I had the opportunity to mark the beginning of several development works in Banaras, the land of Malaviaji.
I laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Care Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Care Centre being built there will be very beneficial not only for Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is the birthday of our former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country can never forget Atal ji's contributions.
Under his leadership, we have also raised the strength of the nation in terms of immense power.
As the leader of the party, as a member of the Lok Sabha, as a minister and prime minister, Atal ji established a great ideal.
On the occasion of Atal ji's birthday, I bow down to him and pray to God for his health.
As an activist, I had the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are showing up.
I shared an old video this morning when I filmed, and I know how I had the good fortune to showcase the year of Atal ji's love as a small worker.
Today, on Christmas Day, the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes as a Christmas gift.
In a way, this project was launched on November 2nd.
An atmosphere of excitement has emerged across the country, whether it is village or city or educational, whether it is cashless or illiterate, how cashless payments can be made, how to purchase goods without money.
Everyone wants to learn and learn from each other.
To encourage this, to strengthen mobile banking and to become a habit of e-payment, the Government of India is launching incentive schemes for consumers and small traders today.
This is not only for a day but it will continue for 100 days starting from today.
Every day 15,000 people receive a thousand rupees.
For hundreds of days, millions of families are going to receive prizes worth crores of rupees and you are eligible to receive prizes when you use digital payment methods such as mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI and USSD.
Digi-Dhan Business Yojana is mainly intended for traders.
This scheme is meant for all sections of society, especially the poor and the lower middle class.
Therefore, those who buy more than Rs. 50 and less than 3000 will receive such awards.
Those who buy more than three thousand rupees will not receive this present.
The poorest of the poor can get a feature phone using USD, ordinary phones, goods, goods, and money, so they can be the beneficiaries of this scheme.
These 30 crore people will soon be part of the gift scheme.
I know that all the youngsters around you will be aware of these things and if you ask them, they will tell them everything, you will have children studying in your family, 10 and 12, and they will tell them very well.
It's as simple as you send a message on a mobile phone to the Watts App.
My dear countrymen, the knowledge about how to use technology, how to do e-payment and how to make online payments is expanding at a rapid pace.
In the last few days, cashless transactions, i.e., non-rupee trade, have increased by 200-300 times.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
The business community is very well guessing how big this decision is.
Digital payment trading professionals, while encouraging online payment mode instead of notes in their businesses, also exempted income tax.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
Someone has said that the Government of Assam has decided to rebate 10 percent of the tax on account of digital payments and licensing fees.
The branches of Gramin Banks are receiving at least Rs. 50,000 from the Government if they make two digital transactions between January and March with 75 of their customers.
As on 31st March, 2017, 100 Digital Transaction villages have been announced to receive Uttam Panchayata for Digital Transactions as a gift of Rs. 5 lakh from the Government.
They also announced the Digital Farmer Shiromani Yojana (DFSY) for the farmers and will provide Rs. 5,000 to the first 10 farmers who have made digital payments to purchase seed fertilizers.
While appreciating the Assam Government in this regard, I congratulate all the governments for such initiatives.
Many organizations have adopted successful methods to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in the village.
In a few days from now, 1000 POS machines have been set up in fertilizer markets to facilitate the farmers of GNFC-Gujarat Narmadawali Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited (GKL) farmers and 5 lakh chakras have been distributed to 30,000 farmers through digital payments.
The most interesting thing is that in comparison to last year, GNFC's fertilizer sales increased by 27 percent.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have made great strides in start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
Along with new ideas and new technologies, our youth should give a lot of importance to this sector with new schemes.
So, we can become a partner by taking all our strength in the country's struggle to get rid of corruption and corruption.
My dear countrymen, every month I ask people to share their views and tell you what to say.
MyGov and the Narendra Modi App this time, in thousands of opinions, 80-90 per cent were about the withdrawal of funds in the fight against corruption and corruption.
Some people have given a detailed account of the difficulties and inconveniences faced by the people.
Another companion wrote that it was so good, for the good of the country, so sacred, and so many other ways of treachery and all the new ways of treachery.
I am grateful to the people for writing so many letters and helping me.
The emotion of Guru Gobind Kaval is the same in every corner of the country.
We can all recognize it.
When people suffer, when they suffer, who are those who don't feel pain
I feel the same pain as you are.
I can clearly state that if the hundred twenty five crore people stand together, nothing is impossible, people are the image of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude and gratitude to the people for taking part in this great campaign against corruption and corruption.
The law is the same for everyone.
Whether it is an individual or an organisation or a political party, all must abide by the law.
Those who cannot directly support corruption and corruption are trying their best to find out the government's shortcomings.
This government is for the common people.
He is constantly trying to find out the opinions of the people.
What is the problem of the people, what is the problem due to which law, what is the solution to it
As a timely and emotional government, it sees how many laws have to be amended keeping in mind the comfort of the people and the goal is to reduce suffering for the people.
On the other hand, I have already stated that this is an extraordinary fight, on the eighth day.
For 70 years, what powers have been mixed with betrayal and corruption-free financial transactions
What's their strength
When they are determined to fight such people, they are also embracing new methods every day to defeat the government.
When they adopt new methods, the government has to adopt new methods to defeat those methods.
You're gonna give me ten - because it's decided that the corrupt, the fraudsters, will be deprived of the crime.
On the other hand, all kinds of liabilities are being carried out, and all kinds of new methods are discovered and other information letters have been received from many.
In this regard, I would like to heartily congratulate my dear countrymen.
Many times more information is received from ordinary people than what is available in the government system.
Success often comes because the common people are awake.
Can anyone imagine the danger that the vigilant people of my country are facing to bring such weaknesses to light
They say, "Modiji, don't weaken, don't stop, don't stop, don't move, don't go back to target.
I would like to especially thank those who wrote this letter because they have faith in their letters and blessings.
I took it out, created a powerful Benami Property Act.
In the days to come, the law will also start working on it.
Whatever is to be done for the good of the nation, it will be a priority.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I have said that in the midst of these hardships, our farmers have broken the record last year in the field of agriculture.
It is a good privilege for agriculture.
In the last few days, India has made pride in many fields in the world economics and as a result of the continuous transition of our people, Indias rise in the global ranking through various indicators is visible.
India's rank has risen in the World Bank's Doing Business Report.
Indias ranking in Top Prospective Host Economics for 2016-18 is third in terms of the Global Investment Report issued by Dutch.
India has jumped 32 ranks in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have moved up 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and the Logistics Performance Index of the World Bank has increased by 19 ranks in 2016.
India is progressing at a rapid pace despite several other reports.
However, it gives a lot of pleasure to see some good things happening in this situation.
The government is committed to the people with disabilities.
I personally tried to accelerate this movement.
I aimed at achieving the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities.
Our divyang brothers and sisters became stronger for our efforts and trust when we won four medals at the Paralympics.
They not only elevated the pride of the country but also surprised the people with their talent.
Our divyang brothers and sisters are an invaluable wealth and power like every citizen of the country.
I am very happy that after passing this Act for the betterment of the people with disabilities, I will increase the opportunities for Divyangjan to get employment.
Reservation limit for government jobs has been increased to 4 per cent.
Through this Act, special departments have been created in respect of education, other facilities and complaints of persons with disabilities.
It can be guessed from the fact that in the last two years, the government has organised 4,380 shibirds in the last two years, how sensitive the government is towards the Divyangjans and distributed equipment to 5,500 brothers and sisters with disabilities at a cost of Rs. 352 crore.
The new legislation has been passed in accordance with the will of the United Nations.
Earlier, the Divyangjans were seven kinds.
Thalassemia, Parkinson, dwarfism, and my young friends.
The news from the games over the past few weeks has made us proud.
As Indians, it is natural for all of us to be proud.
The Indian Cricket Team has won 4 percent against England.
Some of these young sportspersons were felicitous.
Test Captain Vrind Kohli gave good leadership along with good batting.
Indian Cricket Team offshore bowler R.
Junior Hockey team captured the World Cup.
The Junior Hockey team won the World Cup after fifteen years.
Many congratulations to you on this achievement.
This achievement is a good fortune for the Indian Hockey team.
Last month, our ladies and gentlemen were surprised.
India's women's hockey team also won the Asian Champions Trophy, and now a few days ago, India's women's hockey team won the bronze medal at the 18th Asian Cup.
Cricket heartily appreciates all the players of the Hockey team.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month we were celebrating Diwali.
Some wrote poetry, some painted films, some painted cartoons, some made videos.
I mean, how many houses had become military posts.
I'm surprised to see how imaginative and visually impressed I still see these letters.
With your participation, the book is ready with your imagination of the country's army and your perspective towards security forces.
A young man wrote to me, Majesty, all the festivals like Holi and Deepawali for our soldiers will be held on the border.
Every minute you think of the safety of the country.
But on the occasion of celebrations, there will be a reminder of the house.
But to be honest, it didn't happen this time.
It's a celebration, it's not home.
It was a feeling that we are also celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
When the nation stands with the soldiers, the army's strength grows 125 crore times.
A few days ago, the heads of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir also came to visit.
They were conferencing people in Jammu and Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 people from every village in Kashmir valley.
I got a chance to talk to them for a while.
However, it was quite natural that the situation in the valley, the legislation and the future of the children came to an end when the conversation grew.
I am very happy to note that I have fully fulfilled the promise made by me to all those rural heads from the Kashmir Valley.
They went to the village and even made people far away.
A few days ago, when the board examination was conducted, about 95 percent of the children of Kashmir participated in the examination.
So many children participated in the board exam that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education and for a bright future.
Addressing the nation at 8:00 pm on 8th November, the Prime Minister said that a grand initiative will be taken to bring about change in the country.
The more important it is, the more important it is to be implemented, the more it has to be implemented, the more it has to be faced in our normal life, the more it has to be done, the more it has to be done, the more it has to be done, the more it has to be done, the more it has to be done, the more it has to be done, the more it has to be done.
I have said that it will take 50 days to come out of the impact of this decision and that is the greatest decision that can be returned to normalcy after 50 days.
The 500 and 1000 letters, such a large country, so many currency and billions of papers, are watching this decision the world over, all economists are analyzing and evaluating it.
25 billion people of India are trying to overcome the difficulties and succeed.
There may be a question mark before the world.
It is an honour to the 125 crore Indians.
We believe that this decision will be successful and our country will be transformed into gold.
It's because of you that the citizens here, you people, and you can't miss this path to success.
All components of the Central Government, State Governments, Local Local Bodies, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank officials, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are working with complete dedication.
In the midst of a variety of mental conflicts, they are very quietly regarded as a patriotic mission and are working as an effort to transform it.
Starting in the morning, he works without even knowing when the night is complete.
Despite all this trouble, the officials of the bank and the post office work.
When it comes to humanity, it seems they're two steps ahead.
An accident occurred in Khandwa
Suddenly there was a need for money
It was heartening to note that a bank official was there, and he himself went to the old man's house and delivered enough money for treatment.
Numerous stories like this can be traced through daily television, media, newspapers and others.
The poor are being misled, enthused and invested in their accounts, or are trying to save their lives by doing something else.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
He said, "Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare.
From Tarali village in Talluk, Talluk, in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
This will give a boost to the people, and a cashless economy is very important for nation building.
I am with the country in this regard.
It is heartening to note that you have withdrawn the letter of 500 and 1000.
I would like to thank you in your heart because nobody thought that you would make such a big step when you said your father would be a day.
Removing the number of 500 and 1000, he taught good lessons to criminals and corrupt people.
Every Indian cannot have a better day.
People from all over the world also learnt to talk about Chai Pe Charcha.
But I didn't know I'd be married to the Chai Pe Church.
On 17th November, I came to know that there was a marriage with Chai Pe Charcha in Surat.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl gave tea only to those who came to her wedding.
There were no processions, no food programmes - because of the withdrawal of the data, there was little difficulty in the money.
People find the best ways in a toxic situation.
People are finding their own ways.
You see this change.
Big people with relations, who don't think they're going to ask them, they don't pay the exact amount, their farming will be far behind.
It's 50 percent of all municipalities.
However, this time, on the 8th of this decision, everyone ran away to shut down their old papers.
3,500 crore have been incurred in 47 cities this year.
You'll be amazed and happy to hear it, and this week only thirteen thousand crore have been distributed.
There will be many such examples that can have a direct impact.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers are strong links to the economy of this country.
On the one hand, because of this new change in the economic system, all citizens are cooperating with it in the midst of difficulties.
Under the Mudra scheme, there is considerable progress in lending to them.
Under the MUDRA scheme, lakhs and crores of rupees have been given to such small people because millions of people do these small businesses and boost the trade of crores of rupees.
But it was natural for them to have difficulty in this decision.
But now our small traders use technology, mobile applications, mobile banking, credit cards to serve their customers and businesses are being traded on the basis of trust.
I would like to tell the small traders that you too have the opportunity to enter the digital world.
You can also download the bank's app on mobile phones.
Put the POS machine on your credit card.
I invite you for that.
I am confident that this technology can be used in the entire business of your village.
No one can exploit you.
You, I know, my young ladies and gentlemen, liked my decision.
I know you support this decision.
I know that you are very much involved in taking this issue forward in a very useful manner.
Friends, you are my real soldiers, my good friends.
It is a wonderful occasion for us to serve mother India and take us to the economic height of the country.
My young men, can you help me
Perhaps you don't know the eldest of your family, the parents, the father-in-law, the uncle-mother.
You know what the app is, you know what online banking is, you know how online ticket booking is.
It's normal for you, you use it.
Today, however, the country wants to do a great thing as a society without a sense of vision.
A society that doesn't seem to be able to do a hundred percent.
But can't we become a little noticed society
Once you start a slightly slightly obscure society building will not be far away.
You are aware of the opportunities that are available today for the naked society, for digital banking or for mobile banking.
All banks are providing online access.
All the banks in India have mobile apps.
All banks have their own valet.
Walter means e-persons.
Various types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, millions of poor families in India have two cards.
The utilisation of a very small Utilized RuPay card has increased by 300 times since the date of 8th.
Like the prepaid card on the mobile phone, the prepaid card is available to the bank to spend money.
Not only this, technology is simplifying so it doesn't need a big smart phone.
I have stressed on making these arrangements more simpler.
All banks try to do that.
My young friends, despite all this, there is a great generation that doesn't know anything.
I know you're all working on this great thing.
I can see your creative messages on the Watts App - seals, poems, short stories, cartoons, new imaginations, game jokes.
But, my dear young friends, I tell you again, I need your help in this regard.
Your mobile phones will be equipped with all the technologies for online expenses.
Moreover, teach at least ten families at least half an hour, one hour, two hours a day, how to use this technology, how to download the bank's app, how to spend the money in your account, how to give it to the debtor.
Once you teach people how to use the RuPay card, the poor will bless you.
Teaching ordinary people all this, perhaps they will get rid of all worries.
I don't think it will take long for all the youngsters of India to work in this regard.
Within a month, we can present a new India before the world.
You can do this on your mobile phone, you can go to ten houses daily, you can connect ten houses with it every day.
I invite you, come on, not just support, but we can become a force of this change, and we must relax.
We will take this war forward to liberate the country from corruption and corruption.
The country carried out a revolution.
My dear young friends, once again I urge you to take this initiative forward.
I urge all schools, colleges, universities, NCC and NSS to do this thing simultaneously.
Let's take this forward.
We've got the opportunity to do a great service to the nation.
You shouldn't miss this opportunity.
You must have seen that the most famous artist of this century, Amitabh Swachhta Abhiyan, is leading a very heart-wrenching journey.
Cleanliness seems to have spread under him and that is why he remembered his father's birth anniversary as well.
He has written a narrative of Harivansh Rai ji's poetry: "I am a soft body, a joyful mind, a comfortable life.
" (Mitti Kaa Man, Masti Kaa Man and Kshan Varman Jeevan), his son, Shri Amitabh ji's veins are swelling in the veins like blood.
He has written to me through the poetry of Harivansh Rai ji - a clean body, a clean mind, a clean India.
I respectfully bow to Harivansh Rai ji.
Thank you very much to all of you.
Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and happiness in every corner of India.
India is a country celebrating 365 days of any festival in any corner of the country.
We have seen the courage to end untimely festivals.
The changes in festivals have been naturally adopted as per the needs of time and society.
Do it with festivals.
Our ancestors had associated these things with festivals in a very scientific manner.
Today, the world is discussing the environment.
Whether it is trees or plants or rivers or animals or mountains or birds, it is a celebration of responsibility for all.
It means that even in our country there was a tradition of celebrating holidays with brahmanda and science.
Today, when we celebrate Deepawali, as I have said, our celebrations also provide information and knowledge.
This Deepawali Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamaya is a message from darkness to light.
All parts of the house are cleaned up.
We have to enlarge this nature and tradition.
Deepawali is no longer confined to the border of India.
In a way, in every country of the world, we remember and celebrate Diwali in a different way.
Many governments of the world, parliamentarians and rulers of that place are taking part in the Diwali celebrations.
The festival of Deepawali will be celebrated in the eastern countries, in the west, in the developed countries, in Africa and in Ireland.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepawali is shared in a film with a flashlight.
On the occasion of the Deepawali celebrations in London, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom organised a ceremonial ceremony involving all communities.
What's in the picture...
Deepawali greetings to the Prime Minister of Australia, the Prime Minister has urged the people of different cities of Australia to join the Diwali celebrations.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had visited New ealand last day.
He said he wants to return to Deepawali soon.
It reflects that this festival of light is becoming a catalyst for bringing the world from darkness to light.
Parents are requested to stay closer to the adults when they break the corpse, not to be confused, but to avoid the danger by worrying about the mind.
In our country, the festival of Diwali will be a bit longer.
Celebration of Chhath Puja in the eastern part of India is a big festival.
Whether I talk about Deepawali or talk about Chhath Puja, in fact it is an opportunity for all of you to convey your best wishes.
But it is also an occasion to express gratitude and thank the people of our country.
Our soldiers have sacrificed their lives for peace and peace due to the events that have taken place in the past few months.
As we celebrate Diwali, our soldiers suffer all kinds of hardships, some in the desert, some in the Himalayas, some in the Himalayas, some defend industrialists, some defend airports...
How many responsibilities do you hold
Words, birds, swords, colors, numerous imaginations...
I can imagine how proud the soldiers of my country are.
Happy, smiling and smiling because of you, I tell you the truth that you sleep peacefully because of my liberty and the gift of happiness because I sleep peacefully because you have the mountains and the sky and the garden of India. As I salute you, so I and the calm down.
My dear countrymen, a sister Sivani, who is full of the houses of her parents and husbands, has given me a message on telephone.
Come on, let's hear what the military family says.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I am talking about Shivani Mohan.
Our army brothers and sisters get a lot of encouragement through the launch of this Deepawali Message to Jawan.
I'm from a military family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and husband's father were officers in the army.
I mean, my family is full of soldiers.
Brothers and sisters, it is a good message that the officers across the border are getting a lot of encouragement and encouragement for all of them in the Army Circle.
Their families and their wives sacrifice a lot with the Army Officers and Solgiers.
In a way, the entire army gets a good message and wishes you all the very best.
My dear countrymen, we can see that the soldiers are not only on the border but also in all walks of life.
Our soldiers are working nationally in every sphere of life, if they face natural calamities, if they face disobedience, if they face enemies, if they dare to bring back the misguided youth.
It was Sikkim, now Himachal Pradesh and Kerala on 1st November.
The name of his village is Badhan.
He was there and there was talk of constructing toilets.
Some families saw that due to financial hardship, there was no possibility of toilets being constructed.
Vikas Thakur worked and gave 57 families a thousand rupees in their own pockets and gave them strength to achieve cleanliness.
It gave Himachal Pradesh the power to make open defecation free.
In the forests of far flung areas of Kerala, there is no wolves, but a village that can hardly reach on foot throughout the day.
People don't even go there.
The cadets, the volunteers of the National Service Scheme, and engineering students have decided to collectively construct toilets there.
Things are going on in every state at a fast pace.
Just a few things I've taken.
I would like to congratulate the citizens of these states for their role in eliminating the darkness of filth from all over the country as part of this noble cause.
My dear countrymen, the schemes of the government will be very high and if the second such project comes after the first project then the first project has to be abandoned.
Normally, no one pays attention to these things.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always guided us.
You decide on this criteria.
We have to face the awakening hopes of the poor of our country now, that is the need of the hour.
Now there are toilets for girls and boys in schools, too.
It is no longer possible to be the 21st century and remain dark in the village.
Therefore, the programme of electrifying the village from darkness is progressing successfully.
Efforts are being made to provide a smoke-free life to 5 crore households.
Small merchants, small businessmen, vegetable traders, milk sellers, smugglers etc. were caught by the gangsters.
MUDRA Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account etc.
Deposit to Aadhar-Loude Bank directly and direct funding to eligible persons
It's an opportunity for ordinary people to get rid of the middlemen.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great personality of this country, who has made India's unity a lifeline.
31st October is the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb on one hand, the birth anniversary of the active Mahapurush of the countrys unity
I think he succeeded in it, and he united everyone.
On the same day, we can say that Indira Gandhi was slaughtered and that was the fate of the nation or the fate of the country.
The cruelty of Sardar Saheb and Sardar Saheb on the occasion of the birth anniversary of that great man who lived for the sake of unity gives us a pain in history.
Stay away from the thoughts of others, from the actions of others, from the country and the country.
Sardar Saheb's journey of life has started in the fight for the farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sardar Saheb had an important role in bringing the freedom struggle to the farmers.
Now sometimes we're listening to the name Amul.
Even today, people outside India are familiar with all its products and products, but very few people know that the idea of the cooperative Milk Producers' Union is the outcome of Sardar Saheb's divine vision.
He emphasized this thought in 1942.
How it was, it appeared to us as a cornerstone of the happiness and prosperity of the farmers.
I salute Sardar Saheb with honour.
On this Ekta Diwas, wherever we may be on October 31, we must remember Sardar Saheb and understand the vision of unity.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is a key to this festival of Deepawali and it is a festival of light.
The knowledge and advice given by Guru Nanak Devji is a guide not only for Hindustan but for the entire human race.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev was service, honesty, good for all.
Guru Nanak Dev Bhai Lalo was made his colleague when he was immensely immersed in folklore, casteism and supremacy.
If we want to move forward with the mantra of SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas, then who will be better guided than Guru Nanak Dev
Guru Nanak Dev Ji is also bowing down to this festival.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Diwali in the name of the soldiers of the country.
May your dreams and imaginations succeed in all things.
May your life be happy and peaceful.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 25th September, 2016 at 11.
My dear countrymen, I salute all of you.
In the past, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri sector in Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these heroes and pay homage to them.
The loss was lost to the son, the brother lost, not only the families who lost the husband.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We're proud of our army.
Parents and politicians have a lot of opportunity to speak.
All parents want all schools and colleges to be fully functional.
They want their crops, their fruits and vegetables to be marketed all over India.
I mean, economic business is also going to be right.
Business has been going on well over the past few days.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path of peace for our problems, the path of progress and the path of development.
We need to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we will find peace in all the problems together and will prove the right path for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the Paradise in Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
The government will have to take certain steps to implement the law.
I would like to tell the security forces that our strengths and regulations are being used for the peace of the people of Kashmir, for the sake of a comfortable and peaceful life, they should be followed properly by our security forces.
Sometimes people who think differently than we think, take new suggestions.
In recent times, I have got a lot of opportunity to learn from social media.
From every corner of India, one gets an opportunity to know and understand the feelings of all kinds of people, which promotes the strength of democracy.
Last day, a child named Harshavardhan of class II presented a different thought to me.
He wrote, "After the terror attack in Uri, I felt very sorry I wanted to do something."
But I don't know what to do, but a little boy like me can do it.
Yes, the child presented it with a creative perspective.
But when the 1965 war was over, we were led by Lal Bahadur Scientists, so there was an excitement, anger and patriotism.
Everybody wanted something to happen and thought of doing something.
Lal Bahadur Shastriji tried his best to touch this emotional level in the country.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and inspired the common man of the country how he should work for the country.
The Laal Bahadur scientist showed that there could be other ways to show patriotism between bombs and guns.
Mahatma Gandhi, while leading the struggle for independence, when the struggle took place, when it seemed necessary for a stakeholder movement, he used a very useful way to bring that power back to constructive things in the society.
Let us and the armies fulfill their responsibilities, let the administrators perform their duties, let our countrymen, all the stars, with the spirit of patriotism, play a creative role, the country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Karthik wrote to me the Narendra Modi App, and the alternates who went to participate in the paralysis wrote history, their performance was the victory of the human spirit, the Human spirit.
Not only you two, we have negotiated an emotional relationship with our sportspersons who participated in the Paralympics in all of the country.
Perhaps more than sports, the Para Olympics and the achievements of our sportspersons have transformed the human vision into a perfect attitude towards the Divine.
I will not forget the words of our victorious sister Deepak Malik.
When she won the medal, the sister said, I have defeated the disability through this medal.
These words have great power.
This time, in the Para Olympics, 19 ladies and gentlemen from our country participated.
In comparison to other sports, the sports persons with disabilities are much greater than physical fitness and sports skills.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have achieved 4 medals in the highest ever achievement - two gold, one silver and one bronze, the second gold medal in the Paul Volt, 12 years later.
He was losing his hand because of the electric shock.
Just imagine what a man would have done to get a second gold medal at the age of thirty-third and then at the age of thirty-three.
Mariappan Tangvelu won the gold medal at the High Jump.
Tangavelu lost his right when he was only five.
Poverty was not a barrier to his determination.
He doesn't live in a big city, nor in a middle-class family.
Whether it leads a life full of suffering or physical hardships, it has won medals for the country through determination.
If it's Lat Deepamali, it's rocked and rocked in a variety of wins.
Varun C.
Bronze medal was awarded at the Bhiti High Jump.
It is also important that in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, we have been inspired to look at our divyang brothers and sisters.
Our sympathy must be awakened and our vision for the Divyangjans should also be changed and very few people are aware of the extensive performance this time in the paralysis.
A few days ago, the Olympics match took place at the same place.
Is it possible for anybody to think that even the Records of the General Olympics have broken the Divyang people.
And this time too.
In the days to come, India is trying to create an ease of doing business for the Para Olympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
I told the people I was there, and people were surprised.
That day I got the opportunity to release a book, in which some of the success stories of the lives of differently abled persons were collected.
There were very enthusiastic events.
I believe that the establishment of a World Record on the soil of Navsari in India is a great thing.
Within 8 hours, 600 persons with disabilities have been able to access machines.
I got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It means that the country has taken a hundred and five crore steps towards cleanliness.
We have been able to see what is happening in the right direction and how good the results are and what is happening through a little effort.
Whether it is the road, the bus stand, the railways, the schools, colleges, the religious institutions, the hospitals, the children to the elderly, the poor villages and the peasants and the women play their role in the cause of cleanliness.
Friends from the media also played a creative role.
In order to respect health, parasites, especially mothers and sisters, the shrine that is dedicated to the open space should be eliminated.
So Open Defence Free (ODF) has begun a mass movement of open defecation.
A healthy competition is being held between the States and the States and the districts.
The states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will soon win the path of salvation from the practice of open defecation.
Come on, let's move forward with determination.
I would especially like to present a scheme to the young friends who are using technology in the recent past.
Everyone has the right to know what is peaceful in your city in terms of cleanliness, for which the Indian government has given a number - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019.
By calling this number in 1969, you can not only understand the condition of construction of toilets but also apply for construction of toilets.
You're gonna benefit from it.
Moreover, a Swachhta App has been launched to know about Swachhata related grievances and grievance redressal.
You should make the best use of this, especially the new generation.
The Indian government has requested the corporate world to come forward.
Sponsor young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
Swachh Bharat Fellows can be sent to the districts.
In today's era, hygiene has been linked to cleanliness and hygiene is essential for it as well as an alternative model.
It must also be part of the waste to wealth.
Therefore, with the Swachh Mission, we must turn to the West to Compost.
Fertilizer has told the companies to be ready to buy waste-made compost.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, mayors and commissioners from all over the country are going to hold serious discussions on cleanliness and hygiene.
What can we do with technology
How do we get jobs
Discussions will be held on issues such as:
I see new news about cleanliness.
Recently, I was informed that students from Gujarat Technological University went to 107 villages and made awareness campaigns for the construction of toilets.
A team of Wing Commander Paramvir Singh, on a journey of 2800 kms from Devprayag to Gangasagar in Ganga, disseminated the Swachhta message.
Each department of the Government of India has prepared a one-year time table.
I would like to appeal to the stakeholders to engage in the activities undertaken by these departments without any hesitation in their respective areas.
All about cleanliness is taking place recently.
Initially, a survey of 73 cities was conducted and the cleanliness level was presented to the people.
It is now the turning point of 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh.
This time we are lagging behind, the next time we will have a confidence in every city that we will do a little better.
The coming October 2 is the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It's been two years since the Swachh Bharat Mission started.
This will also illuminate the light of Diwali in the house of the poor and this time it will be on Sunday, 2nd October.
Wouldn't yourself be involved in eliminating waste as a parrot for 2 hours, 4 hours
In the memory of Mahatma Gandhi and Laal Physicists, we can determine to do something important for our country.
Joy of Giving Wheel is going to be celebrated in different cities from 2nd to 8th October, 2018 in collaboration with the CEOs.
It is aimed at storing food, dress, etc. for the needy.
Today is the centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.
The universal, universal and intimate theory is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about the welfare of the last person at the end.
How can the poorest of the poor benefit from development
Let us focus on how the poor can benefit from the development of society, governments and everyone's attention.
I respectfully bow down to His Majesty Pandit Deendayal Upadhyayaji, who was an inspiration for all of us, who was rich in our fortunes.
My dear countrymen, I started Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the occasion of Vijayadashmi.
I have sincerely tried not to celebrate the work done by Mann Ki Baat.
This Mann Ki Baat should not be a program of political turmoil and accusations.
How can a common man in this country inspire me
That is, Mann Ki Baat is not a debate 15-20 minutes ago, but a new opportunity for social transformation.
Anyone else will be more happy than this.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 21st August, 2016 at 11.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the birthday of Hockey wizard Dhyan Chand on 29th August.
He played an important role in winning the gold medal in Hockey in the Olympics in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
All of us like Cricket, have heard of Bradman's name.
He said about Dhyan Chand that His Scores Gols Likes (He receives Gols as he does).
Dhyanchandji Sportsman Spirit was a living example of patriotism.
Once upon a time in Kolkata, an opponent was beaten by a hockey stick on the head of Dhyan Chand.
So there was 10 minutes left to finish the game.
He said that in 10 minutes, Dhyanchand opened three goals and responded by the goals.
My dear countrymen, whenever the time comes for Mann Ki Baat, several suggestions are received in the MyGov or in the Narendra Modi App.
Full of diversity.
But this time everyone wants to say something about the Rio Olympics.
I am very hoping that the Prime Minister of India will have to say something about it with a passion for the common citizens to be so close to the Olympics.
There is so much love and awakening among the citizens of India in terms of cricketless sports.
Our daughters have once again proved that they are not behind anyone in any way.
It seems that girls from all over India have taken up the mission of making India proud.
Shikhar Thakur wrote in MyGov that we could perform better at the Olympics.
He wrote, "My best wishes to you all for the first time in our two medals in Rio.
But I would like to invite your attention to whether our performance is good.
Our parents still focus on studies and academic issues.
Society still considers sports to lose time.
This thinking needs to be changed.
We need to increase the enthusiasm of the society.
Nobody can do this better than you.
We can't deny that we can't perform a performance like we wanted.
In some cases, our sportspersons showed great performance in India, but the good performance here was not as expected.
We have only two medals in the medal list.
But if you don't get a medal, you'll see that in many cases our films show a good performance.
You see, our Abhinav Bindraji reached the fourth position in the shooting, and he lost his medal in a very small difference.
That's what happened in Tennessee about Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopane's pair.
We have performed well in the athletics.
For the first time in 32 years after heat, the liquid Babar was eligible for the Track and Field Facility.
It is heartening to note that the women hockey team has reached the Olympics after 36 years.
For the first time in 36 years, Men have reached the lookout stage in the hockey.
Our team is very strong.
Many sportspersons, like Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal and Anu Das, were good at their performance.
But, my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we do as we have done, perhaps we'll be disappointed again.
We will prepare a framework on how we can be better.
2020, 2024, 2028.
What can we do in the field of sports, what can we do in the state governments and such committees, and what can we do in every state
States should choose one or two of their own strengths.
I also urge the Sports Associations to neutrally analyze them.
I appeal to every citizen of India to send me an opinion on whichever interest I want.
We are fully prepared.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is the Teachers Day.
I spend a lot of time with the students on Teachers Day for years and spent time like a student.
I learned a lot from the little kids.
For me, 5th September was Teachers' Day and Teachers' Day.
But this time, I want to attend the G-20 Summit, so I have decided to express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat.
Teachers have as many positions as your mother has in life.
I've seen teachers who are more concerned about their own.
They dedicate their lives to their pupils, to their students.
Now, after the Rio Olympics, we have heard about Pullela Gopichand.
On Teachers Day, I salute Pulla Gopichand, his dedication to his penance and sports, his way of rejoicing in the success of his students.
We always feel the contribution of teachers in our lives.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, paid floral tributes to Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnanji's birthday is being celebrated as a Teachers Day.
I remember many stories of my teachers because our heroes were teachers in our small village.
He still seems to teach me in the classroom.
I can say he's still giving me the Currents Course.
It would be wonderful to see his handwriting at the age of nineteen and write such beautiful letters at this age.
My letters are very bad and if I see someone's good letters, I feel very respectable.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Ganesh is approaching.
The Ganesh changes the divisions... let there be no divisions in the lives of our country, our society, our family and each one of us.
Lokmanya Tilak, who started the Ganesh festival, made this religious festival an occasion to awaken the country.
Even today, the festival of Ganesh is being celebrated not only in Maharashtra but in every corner of India.
All the youngsters will be preparing and enthusiastic for this festival.
Some people are still trying to emulate the emotions that the world's architect put forward.
General issues are discussed, articles are held, flower festivals are held.
In its vision, the topics touching society are presented in a artistic manner.
In a way, Ganesh Festival is a major initiative of public education.
Lokmanya Tilakan Swadesh has inspired us to have a birthright.
But we live in a free India.
It is true that the festival is the strength of society.
The festival provides a new life to the lives of individuals and society.
Life is impossible without a festival, but it has to be shaped in time.
This time many people have specially written to me about the festival of Ganesh and Durga Puja.
You should use Ganesh ji made of mud in the village pond.
The idols made of the Plaster of Paris are not suitable to the environment.
He and many others have suffered a lot.
I also urge you to build statues of Ganesha and Durgadevi and return to our ancient traditions.
Ganesh is disintegrating.
So we shouldn't make a disintegrated Ganesh.
I don't know how much I'm saying you will accept, but this isn't what I'm saying, many people say.
Many such institutions work hard to create and propagate a mud-like tube.
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
If we make the river in the lake, it will merge back into it, there will be no harm to the environment.
Ganesh Chaturthi greetings to all of you.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna will proclaim Mother Teresa as sacred on 4th September.
Mother Teresa spent her entire life serving the poor of India.
It is natural for all Indians to feel proud that Mother Theresa, who has served the poor throughout her life, is getting a sacred status.
The Government of India is sending an official delegation under the leadership of our External Affairs Minister, Smt. Sushma Swaraj for 125 crore people on this occasion of 4th September.
We can learn something from saints, sages, sages, sages and great men.
We keep earning, learning, doing something nice.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then how big it will change.
Manpower is considered to be another form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments, made a successful effort to clean the Ganga and connect people with it.
On 20th of this month, a meeting of Village Heads of Government was held at Allahabad on the banks of Ganga.
I convey my best wishes to the concerned Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India for this initiative.
I express my gratitude to the Chief Ministers and the five States on the great pledge to clean the Ganga by harnessing the manpower.
My dear countrymen, sometimes things touch my mind and I have a special respect for those people who have formed those ideas.
On 15th July, more than one lakh students from more than 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote letters to their parents.
Some wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi, some wrote in Chhattisgarh.
They told their parents in that letter that they need toilets and toilets in their homes.
They asked them to make toilets if they didn't celebrate their birthday this year.
This is what inspires us.
A 16-year-old girl from Kopal district of Karnataka, Ms. Malama, who swore to her family.
The family was unfinancial.
The child stood firm in his rigidity.
Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village who knew that Satyagraha was being carried out for the cleaning of the dam, arranged a toilet at a cost of Rs.
The strength of the girl Malama and the head of a village like Mohammad Shafi deserves to be appreciated.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians are determined.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
This information will be obtained on the website.
The awards will be given to the winners on Gandhi Jayanti Day on 2nd October.
I want to tell the TV channels that you too should urge you to make a film like this and make a competition.
The creativity and waste generation will be strengthened, new seals will be obtained, new methods will be known and new inspiration will be given.
All this will happen through the collaboration of people and ordinary artists, whether a big studio or a big camera is required to make a film.
The President may be wondering if he wants to inaugurate a radio channel.
But it's not a radio channel, it's a big step.
We have Bangladesh in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal still exist with the same cultural heritage.
Here Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Betar will share their programmes and people from both sides will enjoy the programmes of Akashwani.
The contribution of Akashwani in building personal relations is very big.
This was inaugurated by the President of India.
I also thank Bangladesh for their cooperation with us in this regard.
I convey my best wishes to Akashwani for their participation in overseas investment.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the job of becoming Prime Minister, but I am a man like you.
Sometimes some emotional events touch my heart.
Such emotional events give a new energy and inspiration, which inspires the people of India to do something.
Millions and millions of mothers of India who have laid down their lives to help others with their own hardships.
My dear countrymen, we were suffering due to shortage last year, but this month of August was filled with difficulties due to continuous rains.
Some parts of the country have been flooded again and again.
State governments, central governments, local institutions, social institutions and citizens have made a lot of effort to do whatever they can.
But I heard some other news in the news about the flood, and it had to be remembered more.
The month of August this year will recall the strength of unity and how big a change can be brought about if we move forward together.
In August, 2016, the parties, with strong political dilemmas, uninterrupted parties, nearly 90 parties across the country and all the parties in the Parliament have passed the GST Act together.
Its credit belongs to all parties.
This is an example of how big a thing can be achieved if all the parties move together in one direction.
Likewise, all the political parties in the country spoke in one voice about the developments in Kashmir and the situation there.
I believe in the power of 125 crore people.
This morning, I had the opportunity to spend my life with some youngsters living in Delhi.
I hope that in the coming days, all the youth of the country will immerse themselves in the colors of the zeal of the games of Olympics.
The whole world will be in the games.
In the coming days, we must do something to encourage our sportspersons anywhere.
I will surely send messages to sportspersons on the website of Narendra Modi App.
Come, let us all together try to enhance the dignity and dignity of all our sportspersons and appreciate their efforts.
On this occasion of talking to you about Rio Olympics, you can hear a poem by sending Suraj Prakash Upadhyaya, a student of Punjab Central University interested in poetry to me.
There will be other poets like this, they must have written such poems, some may have written some more, some may have composed poems.
I would like to share the poetry that the sun sent me with you.
Remembering me on the anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam, a young man named Mr. Angith Karke.
Therefore, Mr. Angie has inspired him to write down what steps your government has taken to realise the dreams of Abdul Kalam.
The next century will be technologically guided.
If someone tries to capture it, it will appear somewhere far away in new apparatuses, and if we want to collaborate with technology, we have to come forward.
Therefore, we can also adopt research and innovation as the hallmarks of technology.
Innovation, periment, entrepreneurship etc.
If we establish the second generation of net generation innovation, our children will join it.
That is why the Government of India had started the Atal Tinkering Abbs.
10 lakhs and another 10 lakh rupees for the next 5 years.
Likewise, the incubation centre is directly related to innovation.
In order to build self-sufficient incubation centres as much as we need, we can create a systematic mechanism for start-ups to experiment with innovation.
Construction of new incubation centres and upgradation of old ones is essential.
We have to face many problems in our daily life.
The mind wants to recover quickly when there is a disease, so it takes some antibiotics.
You'll be free for a while, but you'll have to stop taking antibiotics without consulting the doctors.
We don't eat antibiotic until the doctor doesn't write.
We don't travel through such foxes.
Years will pass for this war, new medicines and scientific exploration.
Until then, these diseases continue to create new problems.
Therefore, we must always be cautious about this.
Brother, take this antibiotic.
Eat 15 pills and the doctor will tell you to eat it in five days.
The doctor should finish the course by taking pills as much as he wants.
Even if you take more medicine than necessary it will be beneficial for the bacteria .
Therefore, the number of pills that the doctor prescribes for the day is a big deal to follow.
In medical terms it's called antibiotic resistance.
Therefore, it is necessary to follow the rules to use them as they use antibiotics.
Our government is committed to defending antibiotic resistance.
You might have seen a red line on top of it, which has provided information about the antibiotics sold today.
I urge you to take special care of it.
I would like to add another topic to health.
I am concerned about the lives of pregnant women in our country.
It cannot be said that during and after pregnancy, blood deficiency, childbirth-related infections, high blood pressure, and what kind of difficulties would destroy their lives.
In view of these things, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, in the last few months.
As a part of this mission, all the pregnant women on 9th and 9th of every month will be provided free screening at government health centres.
I would primarily request the geneticists that one day in a month, i.e., the 9th day of the month, cannot provide this service free of cost for the poor mothers.
I'm sure you'll be part of it.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
Social discussions are taking place in this regard in the country and the world.
India has been focusing on this thing for centuries.
Kurukshetra is discussing the trees of Lord Krishna at the battlefield.
It has also been stated in the Supreme Court that there is no medicinal herbs and no medicinal herbs.
The tree donates the tree and treads the entire world like its own treasures.
So parents who want their own good will have to grow good trees and protect them like children.
Whether it is Geeta or Shukracharya or Mahabharata's Discipline Mountain or Mountain, there are some people who live by themselves in these ideals in today's generation.
A few days ago, I took care of a daughter, Sonal, in Pune.
It touched my mind.
Trees are fulfilling the responsibilities of children all over the world, says the Mahabharata Discipline, Soneel has taken a mission of fulfilment not only the wishes of his parents but also of the society.
Kisan Ghandu Mahatra of Narayanpur village of Kejunar Taluk in Pune, Maharashtra, performed the marriage of his grandfather Sonal in a very inspiring manner.
I saw the picture in social media.
I didn't see the groom's luxury at the wedding, but I wondered that only plants were visible.
It was a picture that touches the mind.
Sonal is a pioneer and this idea is hers.
You will see how excellent nature love has been expressed by offering gifts to married people.
In other words, Sonal's marriage has become an eternal story of nature's love and I wish Sonal and Mr. Maharjee all the best for this innovative endeavour.
This can be transformed into a natural populace of tree plantation.
I am told that on 1st July this year, the Government of Maharashtra has planted about 1. 5 crore trees across the state and decided to plant three crore trees next year.
It is not simple to plant 25 lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the land of Rajasthan know how hard it is.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover by 50 by 2029.
Gujarat also has a glorious tradition of the Forest Festival.
This year, several names like Gujarat Maav forest, Ekta forest and Martyrdom Forest have been ordered to plant millions of trees in the forest festival.
But for me, the journey to South Africa was a pilgrimage.
It is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela in the context of South Africa.
When we hear the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world, it is the face of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
During my visit to South Africa, I visited the Phoeni Settlement, where Mahatma Gandhi's residence is known as Sarvodaya.
I was fortunate to travel by the train travelling by Mahatma Gandhi from Pieter Maritburg station and this was the event that gave a seed to make a Mohandas Mahatma Gandhi.
I would also like to say that this time I have got the opportunity to meet many great personalities who have laid down their lives for equality and equal opportunity in society as a whole.
He spent 20-22 years in prison with Nelson Mandela, fighting with his shoulder, and he spent his whole life in jail.
I am fortunate to see the great friends of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ahmad Kathara, Mr. Laloo Chiba, Mr. George Besos and Mr.
Even after such a great penance, you can't see the feelings of achieving, capturing and becoming.
I have seen in them a manifestation of the duty laid down in Geeta.
There is no spell of equality and equal opportunity for any society and government.
Their thoughts are quite natural.
They told me about an incident, a sculpture from Bangalore.
I read in an article the story that a woman was cheated on a chit mail and she succumbed to 11 lakh rupees.
As a woman, I feel very sad about her family.
I'd like to know what you're saying about this kind of chit-ford mail.
Within a few minutes, I realized he had left everything behind.
You might have been misunderstood sometimes.
They're gonna be so funny.
But I had a very pleasant experience in this past.
A few students from Aligarh come to me.
The boys and girls were very excited.
They came as a big album and drenched their faces.
He has done artistic painting at the station.
Not only this, in the rural areas, plastic bottles and oil utensils found in the midst of silk trash have been collected and planted and planted virtual gardens.
And on one side of the railway station, this vertical garden has been built in plastic bottles and given a new look to it.
My dear countrymen, the years of festivals have also come in our country in the years to come.
Just imagine, don't you give a sister a gift that protects her life And not only will there be women who cook food in our house.
She'll be the daughter of a poor mother.
This is the true meaning of Rakshabandhan.
My dear countrymen, many of us are born in the post-independence period.
I was the first Prime Minister to be born in the post-independence era.
Let the entire nation be filled with the spirit of freedom fighters, let us once again reflect the humility of freedom.
Let's all create an atmosphere.
And instead of a government programme to celebrate Independence Day, it should become a programme for the people of the country.
We must celebrate our own like Diwali.
I would like you to do something good in your patriotism and inspire yourself in patriotism.
Definitely send pictures of it to the Narendra Modi App.
Create an atmosphere of its own in the country.
You might want that thing in your mind to be presented from the Red Fort with the same vigor.
I invite you to the ideas that come to your mind as your representative, as your Chief Servant, if I want to say these things from the Red Fort.
I don't want the Prime Minister to be the Prime Ministers words from the Red Fort.
And nowadays, the platform of technology is comfortable enough for you to get things up to me.
I am grateful to Akashwani for introducing Mann Ki Baat in local languages at 8 PM.
Several of these suggestions are helping me in the work of my government.
Perhaps it's a week to start the rainy season, so we're worried too.
Almost all parts of the country are experiencing severe heat of summer.
Climate change enhances such problems.
The widespread forest cover was low and trees were cut.
In a way, human beings destroy nature and destroy themselves.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
Discussions on environment are taking place around the world.
In the recent past, the forests of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and the Himalayan valleys have become volcanoes and you must have realized this thing.
I have got the opportunity to interact with the Chief Ministers of 11 states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha who have been suffering from Summer Initiatives in the past.
I listened carefully to every country.
Normally, there has been no such subtle discussion in this regard regarding how much the central government has allocated and how much it has been spent.
In a way, the fact that water conservation, environment, drought degradation, animal husbandry and drought-affected areas have shown excellent work for the entire country was also a matter of embarrassment to the Indian government's officials.
I told NITI Aayog, "I want to adopt best practices from it and take steps to implement it in other states.
Some States, especially Andhra and Gujarat, have been fully utilised for technology.
I want NITI Aayog to carry out successful experiments in the States.
Democratic participation in such issues is a major component of success.
Perhaps, if there is a comprehensive plan, we can make significant changes in timeframe by using appropriate technology.
Irrigation is also important.
Their target is to incorporate 2-3 lakh hectares of land annually on micro-irrigation.
Lok Suraj Jal Suraj Abhiyan has been implemented in Chhattisgarh.
In Madhya Pradesh, about 22,000 ponds have been added under the Balram Talab Yojana, which is not a small figure.
They were aimed at water conservation and in some states, small particles were constructed and 10 and 20 kilometres water conservation projects were implemented.
It's a good experience.
I would like to say that no drop of rain water should be wasted till June, July, August and September.
We should think about what should be the place for water conservation.
God has provided water according to our needs and nature has fulfilled our needs.
We'll be careless when we see a lot of water and when it's rainy season, we'll be worried without water.
In the recent past, the media was talking about the problems of water availability.
I believe that the media should guide water conservation, expand its operations and participate in the ways to address water scarcity.
I invite them for that.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a New India.
We must create a transparent India.
Our programmes have to be carried out in all corners of India in a uniform manner without a single footprint.
We have to make little changes in our old attitudes.
But today the situation has completely changed.
The world appears to be a booming vision of cashless society.
Electronic technologies can be used to send and manage money from all over the world.
When we get together, we can get back to money as a society.
You might have seen that RPA has already given CARD along with the Jan Dhan account.
In the coming days, this card can be used as Credit Debit Card.
No need for money or counting or anything from the pocket.
This is the Bank on Mobile - Universal Payments Interface Banking Transaction (PIBT) which will constantly transform the system.
Money Transaction will be very easy on your mobile phone.
Perhaps, if this is easy to do, RPA CARDs don't always have to walk with them.
In addition, the post offices have also been activated for banking services.
Illegal transactions will continue.
The impact of politics will be very low.
So, my countrymen, I want- let's start this.
Once we start, we can easily move forward.
We might have thought about a lot of mobile phones in our hands about 10 years ago.
That's how we can become a society without money.
It would have been better if it hadn't happened without footprints.
My dear countrymen, sometimes when the Olympics Competition comes or when the game starts, we will be far behind in the Gold Medal.
I've got silver.
Each one must encourage and encourage our sportspersons to participate in the Rio Olympics.
During the last week, we were all worried about the outcome of the elections, especially the outcome of Assam.
Encouraging sportspersons and encouraging our sportspersons, these things provide great courage and strength to each other.
India has to place its own seal before the world with the sportsman spirit without rolling everyone in the rocks of chivalry.
The results of students who have worked hard throughout the year in 10th and 12th grades are being followed one by one.
There is a lot to do in life to tell those who have not been able to win.
A Mr. Gambhir from Madhya Pradesh.
Gharib Patel presented a great deal of trouble to me.
33 percent of the markets were not happy.
Everybody was telling me I lost 90 percent of my marks.
I don't know what I felt like putting a weight on my mind.
I carefully read your letter.
I think, perhaps, this pain is not yours.
Like you, there are millions and millions of students, because there's an atmosphere like this.
Can we find satisfaction in all matters and lead society towards the direction of satisfaction and peace
Your relatives, assistants and friends are on this 89.
I have written Anand Giri Goswami from Jodhpur about the same subject.
He says people from my neighbourhood don't accept our results.
If it had been a little better - I don't remember all the poetry, but I wrote a poet reading a long time ago, and I painted a painful picture in the gloom of life.
Some said it would be better if it was yellow instead of blue.
Some said it would have been better if it was there instead of putting this record here.
Anyway, it would have been nice if at least one or two had seen a picture of my pain.
Everyone's talking about the tutchup.
Like you, millions of students are like this.
You are capable of fulfilling the needs of the people.
I'd like to tell you that you don't lose balance in such a situation.
Everyone expresses his needs.
But stay firm on your own side and try to fill a little more beautifully.
But if we are not satisfied with the availability, then the new goal will never be fulfilled.
The strong foundation of success is the foundation of great success.
The unsatisfaction derived from victory will not be the threshold of success.
It happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard of Santoor's instrument.
There was a time when Santoor Vadodara was associated with folk music in the Kashmir Valley.
But a man named Pandit Shiva Kumar embraced it as the greatest instrument in the world.
Shehnai- Our music world was very limited.
Most of them were at the doorsteps of the Maharaja's courtyards.
But when Ustad Bismulakhan was placed in Shehna, it became a worldwide instrument.
It is true that the cost is too low for the patient to be sick, but if the disease falls, the cost of recovery is very high.
If anybody can help the poor, it's only cleanliness.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
There has been a special championship with Yoga all over the world and there is respect and faith in it.
Yoga offers the power to lead a balanced life to a world that is under stress.
Every person should spend 20-25 minutes or 30 minutes in his lifestyle.
For this purpose, we have to motivate ourselves on 21st June.
Sometimes a social environment becomes the cause of change in the life of a person.
I hope you will take the lead wherever you may be on June 21.
If you are required in your neighbourhood, in your city, in your villages, in your schools, in your institutions, even in your office.
Start for a month from now, and look, you'll be participating in it on June 21.
I will be attending Chandigarh this time.
My dear countrymen, I have been in constant touch with you through this programme Mann Ki Baat.
I gave you a mobile number a long time ago, so you could hear Mann Ki Baat by calling Mrs.
But it's made more simpler.
You just need four seconds to listen to Mann Ki Baat.
If you call Missed in this number in 1922, you can hear Mann Ki Baat in any language anywhere.
My dear countrymen, once again my greetings to you.
Don't forget the water I told you.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
Mann Ki Baat is an occasion to be awaited and awaited as ever.
This time too many letters, commands, phone calls have been received, so many stories, suggestions, inspirations...
People were discussing books on science, technology, innovations, history, culture, business, life history, etc.
People asked me to discuss other books.
But I'll have to say I can't waste time to read a lot of books.
Let us start a regular book corner on the Narendra Modi App and write and discuss it whenever we read a new book.
You can propose a name for this book corner.
I would like this book to become an active platform for readers and writers.
Many experts have made good efforts in the field of water conservation.
People share knowledge about traditional methods.
For example, the zeal shown by the villagers in the village of Aara Karam in Ormanji Block, a little away from Ranchi in Jharkhand, has become an example for everyone.
The beautiful state of north-eastern India, Meghalaya has become a land of its own water.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, very little water is required, but the farmers are being given the importance of non-lossing farming.
I specially congratulate the Government of Haryana for discussing with the farmers, removing them from traditional farming and inspiring them to cultivate less water.
It's time for festivals.
Festivals also take place during festivals.
These fairs should also be used for water conservation.
People from all sections of the society come to the fairs.
In these fairs, the message of water conservation can be given in a very good manner, exhibitions, street dramas and the message of water conservation along with the festival can be very unprecedented.
Friends, some things in life fill us with enthusiasm.
Especially children's achievements and their actions give us new energy.
So I'd like to talk about some children.
They are Nidhi Baipa, Monish Joshi, Devamshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Priti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aryantesh Ganguli, Hrithik Alamada.
I'll talk about them and fill your minds with pride and enthusiasm.
We all know that the word Cancer is one of the most frightening things in the world.
I don't want to be a champion after winning medals.
But it was a rare opportunity for them to become champions before participating in the competition.
That's the champions of life struggle.
The World Children's Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
In their lives, they were successful in fighting cancer and in the competition, competitions like shooting, chess, swimming, race and football were held.
All these champions of our country have won medals in tournaments.
Some of these sportspersons have won more than one such medal.
My dear countrymen, you must have been proud of India's victory in the sky beyond the sky.
Chandrayaan 2.
From Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Sanjeev Haripura, Kolkata and Mahendra Kumar Daga, Telangana and P.
2019 is a good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists launched ASAT in March.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this.
On July 22, the country was proud to be in the air from Chandrayaan 2 Sriharikota.
The launch of Chandrayaan 2 has filled people with pride, enthusiasm and joy.
The Chandrayaan 2 mission is unique in many ways.
You will be happy to note that Chandrayaan 2 is completely Indian.
But it must always be remembered that we have the ability to survive.
I am very hopeful that Chandrayaan 2 will motivate the youth of the country to turn to the world of science and invention.
Finally, science opens the path of development.
On the surface of the moon, we are awaiting the launch of Lander Vikram and Rover Pragyan as alphabets.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with the students and friends of the country an attractive competition with the youth.
I would like to invite the youngsters of the country to a quiz competition and the curiosity related to space, Indias science mission and scientific technologies will be the key to addressing issues.
I urge young friends and students to participate in this issue and make it attractive, joyous and unforgettable through your participation.
I specially urge schools and guardians and enthusiastic principals and teachers to make every effort to make their school successful.
Encourage all schools to join this.
This will be a historic event in their lives for the successful students.
However, we must participate in this issue, get the maximum mark, be successful.
Inspire more and more friends.
Dear friends, you must have noticed something.
Our Mann Ki Baat has gained momentum from time to time in the Swachhata Abhiyan.
When they performed their skills from the walls of over-bridges and schools to the huts, people joined them, it became a big step.
You must have seen how Prayag Raj was decorated with street paintings on the occasion of Kumbh.
Yogesh Saini and his friends played a major role in this regard.
It is our great need to develop the culture of waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move from waste to gold.
My dear countrymen, the last day, I read an attractive narrative on MyGov.
Bhai Mohammad Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir, belonged to this commander.
He wrote - It is a pleasure to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I participated actively in organizing the Back to Village for Community Mobility Programme in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
This programme was organized in June.
I think such programmes must be done every three months.
At the same time, arrangements should be made to monitor the program online.
I understand from this programme how indomitable and enthusiastic the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development.
For the first time, a large number of officers have come directly to the villages and the officers who have not seen the villagers have come to their houses to understand the hurdles in development and to solve the problems in the country for a week.
I was busy in raising the income of the people.
They sought to see how the service of the administrators has impacted the lives of ordinary citizens, and the rural people have opened their minds to their problems.
Discussions were also held on issues such as literacy, male ratio, health, waste management, water conservation, electricity, water, girl child education and issues of senior citizens.
Friends, this programme was not a government function like the officer roaming around the village all day long, but this time the authorities spent two days and one night in Panchayat, which gave them the opportunity to spend time in the village.
He added a lot of things to make this event even more attractive.
Under Khelo India, a sports tournament was organized for children.
He also distributed sports kits, job cards of National Employment Guarantee Scheme, ST, ST category certificates etc.
Such programmes and peoples participation in these programmes are calling for the rule of Saddam, our brother and sister of Kashmir, and understanding that the strength of progress lies beyond the strength of bombs and guns.
It is clear that those who want to hatred on the path of development and want to create obstacles cannot achieve their immense goals.
My dear countrymen, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandre, the winner of the Gyanpeeth Award, spoke in his poetry about the glory of the month of Shravan.
In that, he said, "Hodige Madige Agyedu, the land of immortality, Magna, is a separate bond between the prey and the current of rain, and the earth is immersed in its beauty.
People from different cultures and languages of India celebrate the month of Shravan in their own ways.
In this weather, when we look around, the earth looks green.
We can see a new energy around us.
On the other hand, many observe fasting regularly and eagerly wait for fun and frolic like Janmashtami and Nagapanchami.
In the meanwhile, Rakshabandhan Festival, a symbol of brother-in-law's love, has been going on.
In this regard, more than 4 years of devotees took part in the Amarnath Yatra.
From 1st July till now, more than 3 lakh pilgrims visited the Pavitra Amarnath cave.
More than 60 days in 2015, more people have participated in 28 days this time.
I especially congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their spirituality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
The people who return from the journey have changed the zeal and thought of their own people in the state.
All these are very helpful for the pilgrimage in the future.
On the other hand, it is time for heavy rains in many parts of the country.
My dear countrymen, it is very difficult to decide where to start Mann Ki Baat and where to stop.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
There is no dearth of festivals in our country.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country that enjoys economic prosperity through festivals.
Festivals are an opportunity for the poor in the society to become economically viable.
You know I use technology very well, so I get a lot of information.
Ganesh V.
Savesh Warker wrote to me that this season is a tourist season.
A lot of national and foreign tourists are coming to visit.
People celebrate Christmas holiday.
Sometimes we hear things disappointing in many corners of the country.
It is the strength of the country that millions and millions of people do something good in their own way, just like the World Bank.
It creates new opportunities for education and employment.
When the whole world was attracted by Yoga and celebrated International Day of Yoga, we believed in the strength of India and took pride.
This imagination reflects in our minds when we see India's vast vision.
Today, the word Swachhata is heard in the houses.
Increasing participation of people in it.
That's a service.
I've made a little effort in my own way.
I can't do everything alone.
My dear young friends, in the Red Fort on 15th August last year, we had started a first-hand discussion on Start-up India and Stand-up India.
Thereafter, it was discussed in the government departments.
Can India become a start-up capital
New start-ups and new innovations in the manufacturing sector, in the services sector and in the agricultural hygiene were discussed so as to provide a great opportunity to the youth in the States.
If you think so, it's wrong.
Youngsters from any corner of India are talented and give them an opportunity.
Start-up India and Stand-up India should not shrink in just a few cities.
It should spread to every nook and corner of India.
I urge the state governments to expand this.
On 16th January, I will discuss this with you with clarity.
I will welcome your suggestions.
My dear young friends, January 12 is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
There are millions of people like me who are inspired by Swami Vivekananda.
Since 1995, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti is being celebrated as the 12th National Youth Festival.
This year it is being celebrated in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th to 16th January.
A small India is going to be created there - a young India.
In a way, you can see the sting of dreams.
The power of decisions can be seen.
Would you like to share your suggestions on this youth festival with me
I believe that this is the result of your initiative.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.
You're a person working in this field
That's why you can understand it, and you've suffered a lot of trouble.
Sometimes arbitrators, sometimes disabled, sometimes disabled, sometimes so many words.
Every word has its own significance.
This year, the Government of India started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
I hope you take it.
Have we started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan
This will facilitate the development of all types of infrastructure and facilitate them.
Whether it is school, hospital, government offices, bus stations, railway station ramps, parking, lifts, braille scripts, they need innovation to facilitate them.
Technologies are needed, system requires sensitivity.
The effort is already on and the people's participation is on.
People like it.
Files shouldn't be stolen before that.
In fact, plans are for the common man and for the weak.
The Government of India has conducted an investigation in the past about how to benefit the rightful heirs of the schemes.
Subsidy is given to gas cylinders in our country.
It wasn't even checked if the data was maintained properly.
That's why the government has made some changes.
The mission is to bring subsidy directly to the bank account of the beneficiary through the worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme through Jan Dhan Account with Aadhaar.
I am honoured to say that this is the worlds largest successful Director Benefit Transfer Scheme, which has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
On the one hand, Aadhar Card Campine, Jan Dhan Account Opening on the other, and coordinating the Central State Governments to prepare the list of beneficiaries and linking them with bank accounts through Aadhaar.
Money is now being directly credited to the workers' accounts at various places.
There were complaints about the scholarships of the students and efforts have been made to resolve them.
About 40 crore rupees have been directly transferred to beneficiaries' accounts through various schemes.
About 30 to 40 projects have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
My dear Indians, January 26 is the golden moment of the Republic of India.
In the Parliament, two days were passed for a special discussion on the Constitution.
It was a good experience.
Most of us are aware of the obligations at the time of election, and we are convinced by advertising and wall-writing that voting is our duty.
Why don't we talk about duties and duties in everyday life as in the election time
Shouldn't the country celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar organise discussions in schools, colleges, villages, cities and organisations based on duties
If 125 crore people take one step after another and fulfill their duties then it will be a historic one.
Let's start discussions.
You might have got a chance to go somewhere.
Festivals have their own importance in social life.
The news of natural calamities continues to come from every corner of the world.
We have never thought or imagined these evils.
We are now experiencing the rapid impact of climate change.
The Centre also works with the shoulders.
But in the face of such misery, we have to think about the need for change.
That's a good beginning.
Today, I received a message from Jalandhar in Punjab on the phone of Lakhwindar Singh. I am talking from Lakhwindar Singh and Jalandar district of Punjab.
"I was very happy to hear your question, Lakhvinder Singh.
The main reason for my happiness is that you are doing organic farming.
Moreover, with organic farming, you understand the problems of farmers.
But it's not right to think it's just happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the nature of all of us Indians, and we are following the traditional way of burning the crop residue.
First of all, we didn't know about such losses.
Everyone does it, we do it.
Secondly, I didn't train how to do this.
But your concern is true.
But these aren't real.
The ruins of the crop are also valuable.
Secondly, the surface of the Earth is swept away by setting fire to it.
We can't survive, even if the heart is strong.
Likewise, the earth burns not only the ruins but also the skin of the mother.
Animals can also be utilized for their food, which also saves our land.
Not only that, put the fertilizer from the same land on it, it gives double profits.
Once I got the opportunity to talk to farmers who are cultivating bananas.
They shared a good experience with them.
Hector had to spend five thousand, ten thousand and fifteen thousand to change the ruins of the banana after harvesting.
The ruins of the banana will remain as long as the tractor brings them to the people who want to change them.
However, some farmers buried these ruins of banana into pieces up to 6-8 inches.
Last time in Mann Ki Baat, I had talked about organ donation.
He also spoke about the helpline of 'Chathcha' for organ donation.
Many prominent personalities including film star Ravina Tundon also participated in the function.
We can save many precious lives with organ donation.
In a way, organ donation provides immortality.
When the organ is transplanted from one body to another, the organ gets a new life and that life gets a new life.
What's more important than this
A National Level Registration of Organ Transplantation for Organ donors for patients waiting for transplantation started on 27th November.
I am confident that there will be widespread awakening in every region and in the true sense the best possible help for the needy.
Everyone has to come forward for this.
As I have mentioned earlier, December 3 is being celebrated as International Day of Disability.
Physically and mentally disabled persons are the owners of perfect will and courage.
They feel sad when they're ridiculed.
We'll start crying when there's little trouble.
When we think of how they live, our pain feels so light.
How do they live
Their determination, their way of life and their zeal to make the challenges capable is commendable.
Today, I would like to talk about Javed Ahmad.
He's 40, 42 years old.
In 1996, militants shot him in Kashmir.
Even though he was a victim of militant guns, he survived miraculously.
But one of his kidneys was destroyed and one part of the intestine was lost.
The spinal cord was severely damaged.
He's lost his ability to stand on his own feet forever, yet he doesn't fail.
The wound of terrorism didn't beat him.
How to revamp physically handicapped appliances, what arrangements should be made in public places and government offices
Is Javed's life capable of inspiring every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Javed Ahmad Ji, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
Though I am not only talking about Javed due to lack of time, similar inspirational lamps are rising in every corner of India.
Our country is big.
There's a lot of government-based things going on here.
More than one experience changes our perspective of government systems throughout life.
They are doing a lot of social work in India.
Millions of people work around us like this.
If you see the sick with love, what's the greater pleasure
Are they participating in the griefs of society
I congratulate all those who worked in such a way in the name of 'Jamunami'.
Besides discussing 'e' books, one of the youngsters should tell the students of classes 8, 9, 10 or 10 in the nearby schools, what is happening here and what is happening there.
And, in fact, you are becoming a good teacher of a society.
I warmly welcome you all to nation building.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is concerned about climate change.
A friend who guided me to share this uncomfortable experience had sent me an ink to know and see.
But one thing they've done wouldn't be the same as other educated people.
They are working with solar energy to provide light to the poor in their area.
They fought against darkness and made their name unnamed.
They built a plant of solar illumination through a group of women.
They pay only a hundred rupees per month to local resident goods.
We know what big people in the world are doing about climate change.
Thank you very much for the e-News.
But the beginning is very good.
In a short span of time, 66 lakh people have been able to get Rs. 40,000 crore (Rs. 42,000 crore) through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Be it a washerman, a journalist, a supplier, a supplier, or a supplier, or a supplier, it will be really beneficial for all the workers.
Abhishek shared his happiness too.
There's a lot of things going on in front of me.
The other is from Mumbai to Shailesh Bhosla.
8. 5 lakh (8.
During our Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, I had said that a new entrepreneurship is coming up with this scheme.
But Shailesh Bhosle has succeeded in getting this done.
But most people don't know enough about this plan.
How should the programme be structured
How about the logo
But I'm expecting more suggestions.
A lot of basic plans are needed.
It will also be an honour for the active participants.
And other awards have also been announced.
My dear brothers, the month of winter has begun.
Everybody should join in the exercise by creating a good atmosphere in the family and making a festival.
Through the festival of exercise, you will be able to realise how much virtue of consciousness is being created.
The body will be more dynamic all day.
Well, it's nice to have a good weather.
My dear countrymen, I once again wish you all the best.
Jai Hind.
For the first time on 3rd October last year, I had the privilege of presenting Mann Ki Baat.
One year through Mann Ki Baat.
Our ancestors used to say that the voice of the people is the voice of God.
From my experiences in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I can say that this thought of our ancestors has great strength and truth because I have experienced it.
Several topics are beginning to come from the bottom to the government.
And, it is true that the basic principle of governance is that information should come down from the bottom to the top of the guidelines.
Did anyone ever think that this would be the source of knowledge of Mann Ki Baat
But it happened.
So Mann Ki Baat gave us an opportunity to express the strength of the community.
The whole world was amazed when I said selfie with daughter one day.
It was a quiet revolution.
People from every corner of India have sent millions of pictures.
Perhaps the tourism departments of the Government of India and the State Government have not thought that we have so much wealth.
Mann Ki Baat became a platform and people took up the work without spending a single rupee for the government.
I am happy to mention Gandhiji in my first Mann Ki Baat programme on October 1 last year.
Referring to Gandhi Jayanti, I urged the people to celebrate the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2, encouraging and promoting Khadi products across the country.
There was a time called Khadi for the nation.
Couldn't it be Khadi for fashion now, according to the change of time
I wanted to buy khadi to the people and wish to do something.
I am happy to say that Khadi sales have almost doubled after that.
It didn't happen with government advertisements.
This was not the achievement of lakhs and crores of rupees.
An experience of manpower, a victory.
Once I said in Mann Ki Baathi, the poor man's house smokes trembling, the children cry.
Shouldn't they have a cooking gas cylinder
Today, I can say with great pleasure that 30 lakh families in our country have abandoned LPG subsidy.
I have seen that a retired school teacher on the channel is standing in the queue to refuse a widowed woman's subsidy.
It's hard for the middle class and the lower class to abandon subsidy.
But such people have abandoned subsidies.
Isn't this a quiet revolution
We can't see the people's power in this.
Out of this framework, governments must incorporate a very powerful, dynamic and determined society outside the framework of our government.
What else is there to enjoy
I thought of conducting a new experiment this time in Mann Ki Baat.
There will be no place in India where people do not have phone calls.
This is a comfortable experience.
People of all ages have sent messages.
I wanted to hear some messages myself and I liked it.
My team is taking action for the rest.
All departments of the government will certainly consider your suggestions.
But one thing surprised me and enjoyed me.
Maybe we're all neutral.
But my experience is different.
These fifty thousand people said their own way.
How much people of the country think about it more creatively, how much wealth it is for the country
Perhaps only one or two phone calls from the background of serious complaints.
It was a matter of great pleasure that more than 90 per cent of our energy contributes to a variety of energy.
They must be listening to the radio.
He sent me a message from Alwar in Rajasthan.
My message to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, is: Please urge the people of India to use the Maximum Mann Ki Baat for Diwali.
This will not only benefit the environment but also provide employment opportunities to thousands of silkworm brothers.
I believe that your emotions like Lord Acharya will reach and propagate in the corner of India.
I say to the countrymen, if we implement the words of Lord Acharya in the forthcoming festivals, its flame will be illuminated in their homes, but the light will be spread in the houses of the poor.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the Army.
Our forces, which are protecting the oceans and commodities.
The war with Pakistan ended 50 years in 1965.
The exhibition was organised in India Gate, Delhi.
What wasn't there
If you want to make history, it is important to know and understand the milestones of history.
History binds us to our roots.
If we lose ties with history, then the possibilities of history will also be fully reflected.
Don't hurry like me.
I was back in two and a half hours.
The kid was right.
And I've heard the criticisms of what happened.
I didn't feel that it was a bad thing, and even in the good Parliament I saw that there was talk of cleanliness in India.
On the one hand, Parliament on the other, a child on the other, both speak of hygiene, what is a greater good fortune for a country
This revolution of ideas is creating an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt and awareness about cleanliness.
This will force governments to work.
When we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will have to take up this task for the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi has said
If there is a time for cleanliness and freedom to choose one of these, then I will choose cleanliness first and then I will be free.
Gandhiji gave more importance to cleanliness than freedom.
Gulshan Aaror Mygov from Delhi.
In this context, he said that he wants to know about the birth anniversary of Deen Dayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men always inspire us.
Our work is not an assessment of which great men were followers of thoughts.
Every person who lives and dies for the country is an inspiration for us.
These days, there are opportunities to remember many great men.
On 25th September Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, on 2nd October, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Jaiprakash Narayan on 11th October, and on 31st October, many such names are mentioned by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 2nd October, I would particularly urge you to move forward.
Whether it benefits or gives equal importance to handloom with Khadi.
The weaver brothers are doing a lot of studies.
The Khadi will be brought to the house of the poor widow.
Therefore, this Deepawali must be harvested in the houses and bodies of each one of you.
Look, last time the sales have almost doubled.
My dear countrymen, I am delighted to have a heartfelt feeling.
I share it with you.
When I went to Calcutta in May, the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose came to see me.
Everything was his niece.
For a long time, I got the opportunity to spend sports with the family of Subhas Chandra Bose.
My name is Bhargavi Kanaye.
I would like to inform you that the younger generation should be made aware of the registration of voters and that is why in the days to come, the participation of the younger generation will increase and the participation of the younger generation in government elections and governance will increase in the future.
Thank you, Bharagavi said that the list of voters is enrolled as well as the voting process.
I would like to especially congratulate the Election Commission of India on this issue.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Electoral Commission was only a regulator, but it has changed considerably over the last few years.
This is a very good change, but it doesn't matter if only the Election Commission works.
Generally, I want to say that the election is the first day to vote and water.
One, a seven-year-old Kshitij Pandey is studying at Kendriya Vidyalaya in Banaras Hindu University in class VIII.
I would like to add scientific temper and interest to the children of our country.
He's only 9 years old.
Asked her father, she said she's been saying all this since she was 5.
I asked, where did you learn
And I felt like sharing with you.
We're doing a lot of things you don't know on TV or through the newspapers.
My time has to be adjusted with it.
Friends in Akashwani have to wait for me for half-three hours.
It's a month's transmission now.
It was the beginning of Germany that citizens of Hindustan were inspired by radio about the freedom struggle.
The Azad Hind Radio was launched every week through the news bulletins.
He broadcasts in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urudu languages.
I have also completed one year by presenting Mann Ki Baat through the skyline.
We'll meet next month at Mann Ki Baat.
Let your suggestions continue.
Your suggestions are beneficial for the government.
It starts with a change.
Your partnership is precious, precious.
Once again my best wishes.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with the people of India, through Akashwani, on 30th August, 2015, at 11 a.m.
I have an opportunity to present to you all the things that are in your mind.
South Indians are celebrating on this occasion and on this occasion, I celebrated the holy festival of Rakshabandhan throughout our country.
The Government of India has implemented new schemes for social security for the common man.
In a short span of time, all decent friends have adopted these schemes.
I had requested our sisters to implement security schemes on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan.
I see this as a good sign.
My best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan.
Today, a year before I had spoken to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was made available to people in large numbers.
The main source of income is in the banking sector and the bank friendly scheme has been formulated to bring this App to the poor.
Today, more than a lakh bank friends are operating all over the country.
This has provided employment to the youth.
You will be happy to hear that within a year, about one lakh thirty thousand financial awareness camps have been set up to link the banking sector with the economy and the poor.
I've put these things in front of you, and it's your duty to continue this relationship.
All our accounts must be efficient.
In the past, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
Their voice voices, their conversations, i.e. the generosity and generosity of the Sufi tradition, are the rhythms of music.
I am glad that they have invited me to Bodhgaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, went to Bodh Gaya.
You will have the opportunity to go to Bodhgaya with these scholars all over the world.
It will be a pleasant moment for me, my dear farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to repeat my thoughts again.
These topics have been discussed long ago.
You must have heard me in Parliament, heard me in public meetings, Mann Ki Baat.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have nothing to fear.
I don't give anybody such a chance.
We were running an ordinance.
The Ordinance is scheduled to expire tomorrow, 31st August.
I've decided to expire if the term is over.
My farmer brothers and sisters, "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan", I would like to inform you that this is not just a seal but also a mantra for us.
I have another thing to say.
Two days ago, the war in 1965 completed 50 years.
Whenever he remembered this war in 1965, he used to remember Lal Bahadur.
At the same time, he will also remember the mudra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
At the same time, it is quite natural to remember all the martyrs who laid the foundation stone of the Tricolour Flag of India, its glory and glory.
I salute all those associated with the war victory of the 65th.
We also salute the heroes.
We have been inspired by these tricks of history.
Last week, as I had the opportunity to interact with the people of the Sufi family, I had the opportunity to interact with leading scientists of the country for hours and listen to their suggestions.
India has been performing well in various fields of science and I am very happy.
In fact, our scientists are doing great things.
How do we get such research among the masses
How to use these principles on a practical basis
I have said in the last Mann Ki Baat that our students should be guided to science.
I felt there were many opportunities and possibilities after this discussion.
I would like to say something special to my dear young friends.
In recent times, India has had a number of guests from across the world.
Why not connect our festivals with cleanliness
This year, the beginning of the rain was good.
In our country, there is a lot of foodgrains, oilseeds and pulses.
The poor need food grains and oil to cook vegetables.
However, this time the crops are very pleasant and this year there has been an increase of nearly 50 in food grains and 33 in oilseeds.
I specially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters who have been responsible for this.
My dear countrymen, July 26 has been recorded as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The more the farmers of the country have relations with the land, the more they have relations with the army and the country.
In the Kargil war, each of our soldiers has sent hundreds of enemies.
As a result of all their collective sacrifices, India is able to raise her head to the world today.
And that is why I salute our brave soldiers on Kargil Vijay Diwas.
Smt. Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai has sent a number of suggestions.
I believe all of you will send good instructions.
I'd like to clarify my point of view.
I don't want to give any advice, but I don't want to find any way out of the state governments, central governments or local bodies.
Two days ago, I noticed the sight of a vehicle accident in Delhi and the scooter was lying on the way after 10 minutes of the accident.
He didn't get any help.
Likewise, a lot of people write to me on these subjects, you talk about road safety issues and make the masses aware.
Be it the Hoskot Niwas Akshay of Bangalore, Prasanka Kunjee of Mudubidri in Karnataka, I don't remember the names of all of you.
Every minute in our country, an accident is happening every day.
A death is taking place every four minutes in road accidents.
The most tragic thing is that nearly one third of the deaths are young people between the ages of 15 and 25, each death seizes the entire family.
Another thing that I suddenly remember is that of a small army of government officials in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh and my heart was touched by their work.
'Brother No. 1' is the best brother to give his sister a toilet on the day of Rakshabandhan.
Inspire all such brothers and sisters to make toilets for their sisters so that mothers and sisters in the entire district do not have to defecate in open space.
Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh is a small village inhabiting workers.
The people of that village have started and completed the campaign to construct toilets in the last few months.
Now no one in that village will have to defecate in the open space.
Bhavesh Dheka writes to me about the problems faced by the North-Eastern states from Guwahati.
In the States of Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim, it has been decided to organize seven-day camps and a team of Central Government officials will go to the North Eastern States.
The results of this effort will be achieved in the days to come.
It is very keen to lose his apprehension towards science.
In a way, science and technology are excellent in development.
Our IAS officers have come up in large numbers to learn a lot of things and sometimes they have to interact with children in schools or colleges around 2-4 hours a week and their experiences are their strengths.
We have started it and in the coming years, our villages will get 24 hours of electricity.
Children in the village should not have difficulty while studying in exam days.
If we want to set up small and big industries in the villages then we need electricity.
Today, if they want to charge mobile phones then they should go to the next village.
The facilities available in the cities should be accessible to the villages.
That is why Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana was launched.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I wanted to talk about every Indian.
And the months of August and September are our celebrations.
We have a lot of festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
Sitting in the midst of the sufficient, he had heard a lot of things and said things to the families of 130 crore people in a peaceful atmosphere.
Sometimes it becomes a motivation for those who want to do their own things.
I just used my words, but I didn't think I didn't. It's you.
I felt an illusion.
Anyway, the last chance has come.
In a family environment, the Mann Ki Baat, the little and little things.
In a way, let us continue this programme by giving birth to a new zeal to change in society and life by giving birth to a new zeal.
A lot of messages came in the past months and people said that the absence of Mann Ki Baat is embarrassing.
Sometimes I feel it's a journey from my 'self' to Samasthi.
This is the journey from I to Nami.
For me, my conversation with you was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people started asking a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath during the elections.
For me, I had the opportunity to meet with me.
I went to see me in a way.
Sometimes my thought process gets inspired and sometimes it stops motivating.
People are also suggesting solutions to the challenges faced by the nation and the society.
In letters, people talk about problems, and also talk about peace, some suggestions, some imagination, some obvious or indirect.
That is, in a way, I can feel in your words a sign of how peace is provided to society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror for the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of self-power, strength or prowess among the people.
We have to unite that strength and that achievement, give them a chance, and implement them.
Mann Ki Baat says that 130 crore people want to unite in a strong and active manner in the progress of the country.
You can imagine how happy I feel when I analyze these things and how much energy I get.
This belief was the foundation of your faith.
With this feeling, let's continue the Mann Ki Baat.
Therefore, not for the country, that election was not for the sake of self-interest, it was an election for the protection of democracy.
Perhaps, in any country of the world, the people there would not have voted for democracy only without taking into account their remaining rights, powers and requirements.
That's how the country met in 1977.
In India, more than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and we feel that this number is normal.
But considering this as a worldwide population, more people have voted in India than any other country except China.
The number of people who voted in 2019 is more than the total population in the United States, almost double.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
This reflects the vastness and vastness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections were the largest democratic elections in world history.
You can imagine the scale at which resources and manpower were required to conduct such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and other officers have been able to conduct this election day and night.
Nearly 3 lakh members of the Armed Forces performed their responsibilities to perform this majestic mission of democracy successfully and 20 lakh police personnel from different states performed their duty and worked hard.
As a result of their hard work, more people could vote this time than before.
Nearly 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh electronic voting machines and more than 17 lakh Visakhapat machines have been deployed across the country to cast their vote.
You can imagine how long it will be.
No voter will be able to utilize his right to vote, which is why he did all this.
Polling stations have been set up only for a woman voter in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
You would be surprised to know that the electorate had to travel for two days to get there.
This is the honour of democracy in the right way.
The world's highest polling station is also in India.
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahore-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh .
In this election, the percentage of votes for women and men was almost equal.
There is another fact that this time there are 78 women members in the Parliament who have less history.
I compliment the Election Commission and everyone associated with the turnout programme and bow down to the alert voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have often heard me say "book for books".
I said, "Use a book instead of flowers" to welcome people.
Since then, people have started giving books somewhere.
In his stories, the entire psychological emotions of India are incorporated.
While reading the story of 'Damage' he wrote, my mind turned to the economic imbalance in society.
I remembered the days when I was young.
How the discussion took place overnight on this subject came to mind.
The son of Jamindar, Ishwari and Bir of a poor family can learn from this story that if you don't care, then you will not understand when you will be caught in the grip of corruption.
A sensitive boy's love for his grandmother is a fitting feeling at his young age.
We can see that in fact, human sensitivity has reached paramount when it comes to Grandma by buying a 4-5 year old Hamid Festival and a harvest harvest that can be used from the cottage.
After losing the crop, the farmer, Haldu, is glad he won't have to sleep in the fields in the extreme cold.
These stories are almost a century ago, but we still feel their aesthetics.
K.
Mr. Murlidharan also carries out a small tea-slaughter P.
Today, this library is a guide for all, including tribal children.
A successful experiment was the popularity of Gujarat in the name of Wanche Gujarat.
Millions of people of all age groups participated in this venture to read books.
In today's digital world, it is time for me to appeal to you during the period of Guru Gobind ji and give you books for a while in your daily activities.
You must write about the reading book in the Narendra Modi App and let all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about a challenge not only today but also in the future.
I was reading your views on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov... seeing a lot of people writing about the problem of water.
Apart from Pawan Gaurai of Balgavi and Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, others like Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf have written to me about water related challenges.
Water has great significance in our culture.
Bless us with your mother's blessings and grace be upon us.
Water scarcity affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water available in the rainy season will be collected throughout the year.
Just 8 percent.
It's time to find peace for this problem.
We will find peace with the peoples participation, with the capabilities, cooperation and determination of one crore and thirty million people with the power of the people, like other problems.
New Jal Shakti Mantralaya has been created in the country with maximum emphasis on water.
This will enable decision making for all water related issues.
A few days ago, I decided to do something different.
I wrote letters to the villagers across the country.
I wrote that to save water, to store water, and not to lose every rain, people in the village called for a meeting, to sit with the villagers and think.
I am glad that they have done it and on 22nd of this month crores of people have performed Shramdaan in thousands of Panchayats.
The people of the villages resolved to store every drop of water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell you the story of a Sarpanch.
Listen to the message given by the villagers of Lupung Panchayat in Katakmandi block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand: My name is Thiruvanantha Kumar Ravidas, when the Prime Minister wrote to us for water conservation, we did not believe that the Prime Minister had written such a letter to us.
The people there are ready to play their active role in water conservation once again.
I convey my best wishes to all the rural heads and all the rural heads for their zeal.
The people of the village now feel that they are competing to construct a temple for water in their village.
As I said, social effort can bring about qualitative changes.
There cannot be any 'strategy' across the country to tackle the problem of water.
Several initiatives are being taken in various ways for this purpose.
But everyone's aim is to save water, water conservation.
Drainage lines are being repaired in Punjab.
This effort will help in avoiding the problem of water consumption.
The construction of a tank in Timaipalli, Telangana has transformed the lives of rural people.
Small ponds built in the agricultural land of Kabirdham in Rajasthan have made a big difference.
I read about a social initiative in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20,000 women organised to revive the river Nag.
He also read about the women of Gwal who have worked hard for rain water harvesting in collaboration with each other.
There are several such efforts and I am confident that if we make a strong effort together, we can make the impossible possible.
When people gather, water will be preserved.
I say that the water is touching, and the touch of the water will create a new life.
A Water Conservation Movement can be organised to protect every drop of water.
We can talk about water related issues and also spread water conservation practices.
I particularly urge people from different walks of life to spread different propaganda for water conservation.
Everyone in the film sector, in the sports sector, in the media or in the media or in the people associated with social organisations or those associated with cultural organisations, who narrate stories and sing narratives should lead this mass movement in their own way.
We can awaken society, unite society and join society.
Look, we can see a change in our eyes.
I urge you all to share your knowledge about the traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to visit Porbandar, the birthplace of venerable father, then there should be another house behind his father's house where there is a 200-year-old reservoir, which still has water.
There is an arrangement for stopping rain water.
I always say that those going to Kirti Mandir must see the water storage.
A variety of such water storage systems will be available in many places.
You can also share your share with the HanShakti4alShakti hashtag.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you for one more thing and thank the people of the world.
If all those who love Yoga as soon as the sun rises in every corner of the world welcome the sun, then it is a journey till the sun sets.
Heads of nations, Prime Ministers, eminent people, ordinary citizens showcased how they celebrated Yoga in their country.
That day the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that a healthy and sensitive person is required to build a healthy society that is sure to be Yoga.
Therefore, the promotion of Yoga is an important aspect related to social service.
Shouldn't such a service be accepted and respected
It was a pleasant occasion for me to announce the Prime Ministers Award for outstanding stakeholders in promoting and promoting Yoga in 2019.
You cannot imagine how they have played an important role in spreading Yoga in the field of Yoga.
Japan Yoga Niketan, where many institutes and training courses are conducted.
Miss Italy.
We have very inspiring examples.
Whether it is a matter of Yoga or not, can Indians remain behind
Behar Yoga Vidyalaya at Munger was also honoured and they have been dedicated to the cause of Yoga for the last decade.
Likewise, he also honoured Swami Rajarshi Muni and established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Yes, yes.
I'll wait for your suggestions.
It is a great journey for me to associate your thoughts with Mann Ki Baat.
Come, let's sit together, share your thoughts.
I'm listening to what you have in mind, keeping it in mind, I'll understand it.
Sometimes I'll try to live with your feelings.
You must be blessed.
You're my inspiration, you're my energy.
Come, let us together share the happiness of Mann Ki Baat and carry forward the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Hello, my dear countrymen.
These brave heroes sacrificed themselves for the 150 crore Indians.
These brave sons kept watching day and night to make people sleep peacefully.
At the same time, the invaders have been answered in their own language.
You must have seen how the attack took place within 100 hours.
The army is determined to wipe out terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, we were able to see an exciting response from their families through the medium of martyrdom, which will further boost the spirit of the entire nation.
The feelings expressed by the Father of the brave Jawan Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar during this time of his grief are inspiring for all of us.
The nation salutes the bravery of the martyr Prasanna Saheb's wife Meenaji in Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
I swear to add one of my own sons to the CRPF.
The same feeling is seen in every house of our heroic, courageous martyrs.
I want to tell the youth that the feelings expressed by these families should be understood and understood.
This is an inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, the War Memorial that we have been waiting for in this long period of our independence is being witnessed.
It is natural for people to get curiosity and curiosity in this regard.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has expressed happiness at the completion of the National War Memorial at Sh. Omkar Shetty, Clothing in Karnataka.
I was surprised and pained that there was no National War Memorial in India for so long.
We needed a war memorial to emulate the bravery of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the sake of the nation.
I decided to have a memorial like that.
I am happy to note that the decision to build a National War Memorial is being completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, that is, on 25th February, millions of Indians will dedicate this National Military Memorial to our Armed Forces.
The country will make a small attempt to repay the debt.
This new memorial has been built near the heart of Delhi, i.e., India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I am confident that going to this National Military Memorial will be equivalent to going to a pilgrimage.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of national gratitude to the great martyrs of the nation since independence.
The design of the memorial demonstrates the immense courage of our brave soldiers.
The National Military Memorial is designed in three circles, covering the journey from the birth of every soldier to martyrdom.
The flame of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier.
The second cycle reflects the courage and courage of the soldiers.
This circle shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the greatest martyrs of the country have been recorded in the golden letters.
And then there is a protective cycle, which exhibits security.
There's a row of dense trees in this circle.
I also had the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation in October last year.
It was also a reflection of the idea that the country should be grateful to the police personnel and men who are constantly working for our security.
I am sure you will visit the National Military Memorial and National Police Memorial.
Whenever you come, you must share the pictures taken from there in the social media that may it inspire others, may it inspire others to see these monuments in a sacred place.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, I have received thousands of letters and comments from you people.
Incidentally, Janshadji Tata's birthday is on 3rd March.
Two personalities are from different family backgrounds that have enriched the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata through Mann Ki Baat is in a way reflecting the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have enhanced the pace of not only Jharkhand but the entire country.
People are grateful for their contribution towards the entire nation.
Do you know why the British spurned the path of cowardice
Because even the British who built such a great empire were afraid of him.
Birsa used his traditional arrow and bowl to shake the British rule used by guns and cannons.
Birsa Mae fought not only for political freedom but also for the socio-economic freedom of tribals.
He did this in his short life.
He lighted like the sun in the darkness of the reproached, and of the exploited.
He sacrificed his life at the age of 25.
India's heroic sons like Birsa Munda have been born in all parts of the country.
There will not be any corner of India that has not played its part in this centuries-long freedom struggle.
If the individuals like Birsa Munda make us aware of our ignorance, the personality like Jamshedji Tata has given the country a great institution.
He knew that India needed scientific technologies to become an industrial hub.
Today, the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, called the Indian Institute of Science, was a result of his long vision.
Not only this, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
The meeting between Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekananda was held on a ship in the middle of his journey to America.
It is said that this discussion has led to the establishment of the India Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, the birth of former Prime Minister of our country, Mr.
As you all know, this day comes only once in four years.
Morarjibhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country, the owner of a simplest and peaceful personality.
Morarjibhai had the privilege of presenting the budget as the largest number of times in the Parliament of India.
He had to pay for it in old age.
The government arrested him and imprisoned him.
However, when the Janata Party won the elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The 44th Amendment has enacted a law to publish proceedings in Parliament and in the Houses of Parliament in the Press.
Some of the powers of the Supreme Court were restored and the fundamental rights enjoyed by Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution could not be abolished even during the Emergency.
It provides that the President can declare the state of emergency if requested by the Cabinet and cannot extend the state of emergency once more than six months.
In 1975, announcing the Emergency and killing democracy would not repeat it in the future.
The coming generation will always remember his great contribution in maintaining the glory of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my respects to that great leader.
My dear countrymen, this time, like every year, people are enthusiastic about Padma Awards.
These are those who bring positive change in the lives of others in different ways through their own spirit.
It was a great thing to bring a rare painting closer to the new generation.
I gave a presentation to the former President of America, Mr. Barack Obama, on the artwork of Tree of Life, built by Abdul Ghafoor.
The Padma Awardees are known as Shabbir Said Gomata of Marathwada.
Listening to the Tao Porchon-ynch of America, you will be surprised to know that Linch is now a big institution for Yoga.
Dear people, this year, 12 of the awardees of Padma Awards are farmers.
Normally, very few people associated with agriculture have come to the list of Padma Shrishirs who are directly cultivating.
This is the life-style of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I am going to tell you something compassionate, I have seen this in the past few days.
Brothers and sisters, in the last five months, nearly 12 lakh poor families have been benefitted from this scheme.
I have seen how this is bringing about a big change in the lives of the poor.
If you know someone who's filthy to treat because there's no money, tell them about this plan.
This scheme is meant for such poor people, my dear countrymen, we are going to start exams in schools.
In the next few weeks, examinations of various education boards, class II and Class II will be started across the country.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are going to appear for the examination.
A few days ago, a big programme was organized at the Town Hall in Delhi to discuss the issue of exams.
With the help of technology in this town hall, I have been able to interact with millions of students, parents and teachers across the country and abroad.
I speak every month with millions of families in a way through the radio.
Sometimes when I talk to you and read your letters and listen to your suggestions on the phone, I think you are part of my family.
It gives me a feeling of comfort.
Friends, elections are the biggest festival of democracy.
Mann Ki Baat has been telling you for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat on January 2019
The country received a sad news on the 21st of this month.
Shri Sri Shivakumar Swamiji was disabled at Siddhganga Monastery in Tumkur district of Karnataka.
Sivakumaraswamy had dedicated his life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwara has taught us - Kayakave Kailas - to perform his duties with utmost diligence is equivalent to being in Kailasa, the habitation of Lord Shiva.
Shivkumar Swami ji was a follower of this vision.
He worked for the social, educational and economic upliftment of thousands of people in his 111-year career.
He was a learned scholar in English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He tried his best to provide food, housing, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
He was a pioneer of good for the farmers.
The Siddhganga Monastery usually used to hold cattle farming fairs.
I have often got the good fortune to receive the blessings of the venerable Swami ji.
On this occasion, Kalam Saheb had heard a poem about revered Swami ji.
Once again, I pay my respects to that great soul.
My dear countrymen, on January 26, 1950, the Constitution was introduced in our country.
That day, our country, for the Republic.
Yesterday we celebrated Republic Day.
But I'd like to tell you something else.
This day is being celebrated as National Voters Day on 25th January, 2018.
People all over the world are surprised to see the massive election process in India.
It is natural for the citizens of our country to feel proud of the Election Commission as our Election Commission is doing so well.
You must have heard that there is only one polling booth for a voter in the Gir forest in Gujarat.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commission for its relentless efforts to strengthen our democracy.
The Election Commission of India, the Security Officers and other officers of all the States, congratulate the Election Commission of India, for ensuring free and fair elections to participate in the voting process.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country.
This will be the first time that youngsters born in the 21st century will utilise their voter rights in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have a chance to take responsibility for the country.
They are going to determine the country's brotherhood.
It's time to mix your dreams with the country's dreams.
I urge the younger generation to register as a voter if it is the age of voting.
And we have to think that voting is our obligation.
If there is no reason to vote in life for any reason, it must be painful.
I'm sorry to see something wrong happens in the country.
Our country is the greatest Vasundhara.
One of those great souls was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On 23rd January, the entire nation celebrated his birth anniversary in a different way.
During Netaji's birth anniversary, I had the privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to the heroes who laid down their lives for India's freedom.
Since independence in the Red Fort, some rooms and buildings have been closed till date.
These locked rooms in the Red Fort have now become a beautiful museum, a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.
Every stone of this museum is filled with the aroma of our glorious history.
Everywhere in the museum, the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle reflect and inspire us to go to history.
At the same venue, the British administration had filed a case against the brave sons of Bharatmata - Colonel Prem Sahagal, Colonel Gurbaksh Dhilan and Major General Shanwas Khan.
I gave it to the museum to keep the hat and let the visitors visit the hat and inspire patriotism from it.
However, the bravery and patriotism of our leaders must continue to be brought back to the new generation in different ways.
A month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, 75 years ago, as part of a programme to highlight the Tricolour Flag.
Likewise, in October 2018, the Red Fort has been hoisting the Tricolour in the Red Fort and everyone is surprised because the flag is being hoisted on the 15th of August.
Now it was the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Azad Hind Government.
Dilli Chalo, Tum Me Khoon Do, Mim Tum Asadi Dunga (Go to Delhi, give me blood, I will give you freedom), Netaji gained space in the hearts of all Indians.
The need for files related to Netaji has been rising over the last several years to make it available to the public.
I'm glad I could do that.
I remember the day when Netaji's family members came together at the Prime Minister's residence.
We talked about Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy to note that there has been an effort to develop several places related to the great leaders of India in Delhi.
It is heartening to note that there are 26 Alipur roads connected with Babasaheb Ambedkar, Sardar Patel Museum and Kranti Mandir.
If you come to Delhi, you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we talk about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life in Mann Ki Baat.
He also chose the radio to interact with the people, and in 1942, the Subhas Babu Azad Hind Radio was launched.
I understand that this radio station has been broadcasting news bulletins every week in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
The Radio Station will be inaugurated by Gujarati M.
R.
Vyas has played an important role.
Normally people liked programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio.
Those programmes were immensely inspiring for the freedom fighters.
Visual Kala Museum is also built in this Kranti Mandir.
We have tried to describe Indian art and culture in an attractive manner.
The museum has four historical exhibitions, with more than 450 paintings and other artworks of three centuries old.
The museum has exhibited excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avnindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Rai and Silos Mukherji.
I urge you all to go there and keep in mind the writings of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You might be wondering why I would like to hear the great writings of Gurudev Tagore while talking about art.
Perhaps you might have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
He has painted animals, birds and birds, painted a lot of natural scenes, besides, he has imbibed human nature and art in Kanwas.
It is important to mention that Gurudev has not given name to many of his writings.
He used to think that those who see the paintings he painted should understand the painting themselves and the message he has given in it from his own perspective.
His pictures have been displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
Our great souls have conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Saint Ravidas was such a great soul.
February 19 is the birth anniversary of Sant Ravidas.
The dohas of Sant Ravidas ji are very famous.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the sacred land of Varanasi.
Through his messages, he has been trying to convey the significance of those who work and work for the rest of their lives.
Our space programmes have contributed to several young scientists of the country in the space programme.
Today, we are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students are entering the sky.
On January 24, the art of our students was launched.
Sounding rockets made by students in Odisha are also being set up in the new record.
Space missions have been launched in the last four years since independence to 2014.
We have established the world record of launching 104 satellites through the same aircraft.
We are going to ensure India's presence in the moon through Chandrayaan 2 soon.
Our country uses space technology to protect the lives and property of the people.
Whether it is climate forecast or rail or road safety, space technologies are getting a lot of help.
The naval equipment has been distributed among our fishermen brothers and sisters, which is helpful in economic recovery along with their safety.
We use space technology to deliver government services to the people and to ensure its accountability effectively.
Around 40 lakh houses in 23 States have been geo-tagged under the Housing for All scheme of Housing for All.
Moreover, under Manrega, about three and a half crore land wealth has been tagged.
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country.
Through our competitive satellite launch service, India today launches satellites not only of developing countries but also of developing countries.
Children are always attractive to the sky and stars.
Our space programmes provide an opportunity to children to think very well and to go beyond the limits that they consider impossible today.
It's a vision for our children to watch the stars and motivate them to find new stars.
At the Khelo India Youth Games held in Pune in January, 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 games.
This time, in Khelo India, sportspersons from all the states have performed well in their own way.
Life of many medal winners is a powerful inspiration.
In wrestling, the young player won the Akash Gorkha Silver Medal and I read that Akash's father, Akashji, was working as a guardian at a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
Sonali Helvi is a resident of Satara, the captain of 21 women's cavalry team in Maharashtra.
She lost her father at a very young age and her brother and mother encouraged Sonali's talent.
Normally, girls will not be encouraged to participate in sports like Kabbadi.
But Sonali chose baggage, showed the best performance.
Abhinav Shah, 10, from Asansol, is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshata Baswanikamati, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka won gold medal in weightlifting.
When we talk about India's creation, we must recall that the vision of New India is Youth Power.
While narrating these stories of Khelo India, it should be recalled that New India is not only the contribution of people in big cities but also the contribution of youngsters and children from small towns, villages and villages, and young sports persons.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about the beauty of your name.
Have you ever heard of a competition to make toilets beautiful
Over the last one month, more than 50,000 toilets have participated in this unique competition.
I urge all the Sarpanches and the rural heads to lead this movement in their Panchayats.
Definitely share the picture of your Swachh Sundar Shauchalay with Mylathar on social media.
Friends, on 2nd October, 2014, we have started a memorable journey to make the country dirt-free and free from open defecation.
My little friends, the days of the exam are coming closer.
Amsul Sharma MyGov, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written that I want to talk about exams and exam warriors.
Thank you, Amsul ji, for taking this matter into consideration.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the Examination Season.
I would like to discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat today, but I would like to interact with students from all over the country at 11. 00 AM on 29th January, 2019, along with students, parents and teachers.
This time, students from other countries are also participating in the event.
In this Exam Pe Charcha programme, I will talk to my young friends on all aspects of the examination, especially the stress-free exam.
I will certainly put some of these suggestions and suggestions in front of you at the Town Hall.
You must join this program.
You will be able to communicate it directly through social media or NAMO App Ludeau.
My dear countrymen, January 30 is the commemoration of my venerated father.
At 11 a.m., the entire nation will pay homage to the martyrs.
We must pay our homage to the two-minute martyrs wherever we may be.
Remember the venerable Bapu, let us move forward with a determination to fulfil his dreams, build a New India, and perform his duties as citizens.
This journey will be successfully carried forward in 2019.
Greetings to all of you. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
The year 2018 is about to end.
We are entering by 2019.
Obviously, we can hear the discussions about the year ahead with the discussions over the years.
Whether it is the life of an individual or of a society, whether it is the life of a nation, everyone has to look back and look forward to it as much as possible.
This is the result of the achievements of experiences and the confidence to do something new.
Besides bringing about changes in our own lives, we must think of what we can contribute to taking the country and society forward.
Many congratulations to all of you on the occasion of 2019.
As a result of the resolve of the people of the country, the value of cleanliness has gone up by 95 per cent.
After independence, for the first time from the Red Fort, the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government was unveiled.
The country received the Champions of the Earth Award, the highest environmental recognition of the United Nations.
Indias efforts in solar energy and climate change have been recognized globally.
International Solar Alliance (ISA) was the first major convention of the International Solar Alliance in India.
Our country has had an unprecedented excellence in the Ease of Doing Business Ranking.
Our girls have enhanced the country's pride by nurturing the world with the help of naval militarism.
The country's first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the field of waterways.
Bogibeel Bridge, the longest rail-road bridge in the country, was dedicated to the nation and the first and 100th airport in Sikkim was inaugurated in Pakyong.
India won the Under-19 Cricket World Cup and the Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India has won many medals in the Asian Games.
India has also performed well in the Para Asian Games.
Our Mann Ki Baat will be extended by 2019 when all the social initiatives of India are being listed.
This has been possible due to the untiring efforts of 130 crore people.
I am confident that this journey of Indias advancement and progress will continue in 2019 and our country will scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, we have lost some of our brethren who are specialists in December.
Dr. Jayachandran was known as one of the cheapest treatment providers for the poor.
Similarly, on December 25, Sulagiti of Karnataka heard the death of Narasamma.
Sulagiti Narasamma was helpful in the delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
They have provided services to thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the remote areas.
There are many inspirational people like Jaichandran and Sulagiti Narasamma.
They have dedicated their lives for the betterment of all in society.
When we talk about healthcare, we want to talk about the work done by doctors in Bijnor, North India.
Some of the party workers told me that some young doctors in the city had been camping and treating the poor.
The Heart Lungs Critical Centre (HLC) is conducting medical camps every month where there is a provision for free diagnosis and treatment for many diseases.
Today, hundreds of patients are using this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctors, who are selflessly serving, must be appreciated.
Today, I can say with great pride that the Swachh Bharat Mission has been successful only through social effort.
A few days ago, I was told that more than 3 lakh people had joined the cleanliness drive in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
City Corporate, Services Organizations, School-College Students and all the people of Jabalpur participated in the Swachhta Mahayana.
I'm Thebetterindia.
Whenever I get a chance, I will definitely go to Thebetterindia.com and try to know about such inspirations.
I am glad that many such websites introduce us to many stories that inspire life of people with distinction.
com is an effort to promote positivity and make the society more sensitive.
Similarly, yourstory. com tells us a lot about young innovators and the success stories of industrial enterprises.
Combine your positivity.
I believe that more and more people know about our heroes who are bringing about changes in society.
It's easy to spread negativeness.
But, in our society, we have very good things, which can be achieved only through the collective efforts of 130 crore people.
Hanay is a 12-year-old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanna practised self-sufficiency and learnt about the various stages of the exercise.
I wish them a bright future for all the countrymen.
My best wishes and blessings to Hannah.
Likewise, a 16-year-old boy and Rajini were also discussed in the media.
You must have read it.
Rajni Junior Mahila Wrestling Championship won gold medal.
As soon as he won the Rajni medal, the boy went to the nearest milk shop and drank a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni Medal was wrapped in a cloth and placed in a bag.
You must be wondering why Rajni drank a glass of milk.
The kid who did it was honouring Jasmersing and selling luxury at a stall in sin.
Rajni said his father suffered a lot of hardships and suffered a lot of hardships in bringing the girl to this floor.
Jasmer Singh goes to work every morning before Rajini and his brothers wake up.
When he informed his father about his interest in learning royal boxing, he arranged all possible things and encouraged his daughter's zeal.
Rajnik wrestling took over the old gloves, because at that time the family's financial condition was very bad.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni didn't get excited, she had to learn wrestling.
He has won a medal from Serbia.
This month, the 20-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni in Pune has become the world's fastest man on the bike.
The child travels 300 kilometers a day on a bike of 159 days.
The boy's zeal in walking on a bike is sure to be appreciated.
Achievements like this will not inspire us to hear such talent.
Many congratulations to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
The fragrance of emotions like Ekta, Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat in diversity is filled with our festivals.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not different, where individuals and prosperity are the same.
A good example of our close relationship with nature is the calendar, the Panchamganga based on festivals.
This will provide information on the planets and stars of the planet along with festivals throughout the year.
It's decided by whom the calendar is forbidden.
Celebrations and festivals are celebrated on the basis of planetary constellations in many parts of the country.
Gudi Padwa, Chedichand and Ugadi are all celebrated with the lunar calendar while Tamil Puttan, Vishu, Vaishakham, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakhi and Bihu celebrate these festivals on the basis of sunrise.
In our festivals, the feeling of crawling rivers and water is particularly inherent.
The Chhath festival is associated with sunrise in rivers and lakes.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people are immersed in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals and festivals teach us the lessons of social values.
On the one hand, they have an ancient significance, on the other hand, all festivals share the lessons of life and the inspiration to live in harmony with each other in a natural way.
I wish you all the very best in 2019 and wish you all the very best to celebrate the upcoming festivals with your heart.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh Mela.
People from all over the world come and participate in Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh is a crowd of faith and devotion.
Together, millions of people from within the country and outside come together.
The legacy of the Kumbh has been enriched in our great cultural traditions.
Perhaps you will be eagerly waiting for the world famous Kumbh Mela, which is being celebrated in Prayagraj since January 15th.
The Saint-Mahatmalayas have already reached for the Kumbh Mela.
It is a great proof that the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity has been included in the list of global significance.
A few days ago, Ambassadors of many countries saw preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
There, the nation's flags of many countries have been raised.
People from over 150 countries are expected to attend the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj.
This is a great learning, especially for the youngsters.
I went to Prayag Raj a few days ago and saw preparations for the Kumbh Mela taking place enthusiastically.
This time, cleanliness is also very important here.
There will be cleanliness along with devotion and the message will reach far and wide.
This time, devotees can also visit Akshayvad after the holy rituals at the Sangam.
This symbol of the faith of the people had been shut down in the fort for hundreds of years, so the devotees could not see even if they wanted.
This time everyone has been allowed to enter there.
You must also attend the Kumbh Mela, share the pictures of different levels in social media, so that more and more people get inspired to go to the Kumbh Mela.
May the Teachers Kumbh be a great honour of Indian philosophy.
May the Kumbh of Faith be the glory of Nationality.
May the Kumbh of artistic literature be the Mahakumbh of creative powers.
My dear countrymen, the Republic Day celebrations on 26th January is also a great moment in the minds of the people and on that day we remember the great personalities of our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the centenary year of the revered father.
President of South Africa Mr.
Cyril Ramaphosa will be the Chief Guest at Republic Day this year.
The revered Bapu and South Africa had an infinite relationship.
Mohan, the Great Spirit was from South Africa.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa with strong opposition to colourful discourse.
He set up Phoenix, Tolstoy Farms, where the voice of peace and justice all over the world has sunk.
He had the patience and motivation to stay in jail for so many years.
Writing about Mandela Bapu, Mahatma is an integral part of our history because he started the inventions here.
This is where he showed his firm belief in justice, where he raised the philosophy of Satyagraha and the methods of fighting.
He saw Bapu as a role model.
Bapu and Mandela are not only a source of inspiration all over the world, but their ideals always inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a conferencing of DGPs was held at Kevadia on the banks of Narmada in Gujarat, where the Statue of Unity is the world's highest statue.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the nation.
He always lived up to the integrity of India.
Sardar Saheb had thought that India's strength depends on its diversity.
Recognising Sardar Saheb's emotions, the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, conveyed his congratulations to Sardar Saheb on the occasion of the Unity Award.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna.
For a long time in his life, his workplace was North India and he was shot at Namdet in Maharashtra.
The land of birth in Patna, the land of action in North India, the last moment of life in Namded.
In a way, he was blessed throughout the year of India.
Guru Gobind Singh ji attained the position of Guru Gobind Singh ji at the age of 9 after the martyrdom of Guru Tej Bahadur ji.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji had the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
He was the owner of a calm and simplistic personality, but whenever an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, Guru Gobind Singh ji insisted on doing injustice to them and raised his voice for the poor and the weak. That is why:
He was a divine man full of heroism, valour, sacrifice and religious compassion.
He had supernatural weapons and science.
He was a warrior and was also known by many languages including Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Parsi, Hindi and Urdu.
I once again bow down to Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, many good things happen in the country but there is no detailed discussion about them.
As part of the drive to uit Right India, health tours are being organised across the country.
The event will be held by 27th January.
It is commendable that I am trying to spread awareness and awareness among the people beyond this.
When India is clean, it will be prosperous.
Nutrition is essential for good health.
To start with this thing.
It is important to learn the lessons of the importance of food from childhood.
Come, let us move forward with new zeal, enthusiasm and determination to scale new heights, move forward, change ourselves and change our country.
MyGov includes Amshukumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Amritsar and Vikas Yadav from Patna, similarly, Monica Jane from Delhi in the Narendra Modi App, and Prasanjit Sarkar from Burdwan in West Bengal, and musicologists from Nagpur.
They say that people are usually connected to you through modern technology, social media and mobile apps.
I'd like to tell you a story.
It was in 1998.
I was an organiser of Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
It was May.
It was a little Daba.
I don't understand.
Seeing my response, he said, "Look, sir, listen to the radio."
Recently, Akashwani conducted a survey on Manki Baat.
Some of these Facebook responses are interesting.
Average 70 of the surveyed persons usually hear Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat has created a positive thinking in the society.
Mann Ki Baat has encouraged many people.
There were wide-ranging discussions on India Positive.
I am happy to see that radio becomes more popular because of Mann Ki Baat.
If the leader gets a mike, millions and millions listen, then what do you want
Finding out that there's no politics in this program.
At the beginning of Mann Ki Baat, it was decided that there should not be politics in it, this should not be the benefits of the government, it should not be Modi.
I was inspired by all of you for implementing this resolution.
Small stories of 130 crore people will remain intact.
This country will scale new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
When I read a letter, a feeling like that makes me feel like myself.
With two words, I share it with you in my experience.
When will a government get the strength to promote Selfie with Doter in a small village in Haryana, not only across the country but also abroad
Famous celebrities from all sections of society, known as celebrities, have joined it and awakened the society in a new language that todays generation understands.
Mann Kibat is not about the government, it is about the society.
Manki Baat is a matter of aspiration for progress.
The life of India is not politics, nor is it power of monarchy.
India's vibrant social justice is the strength of society.
There are thousands of levels in social life, one of which is political.
If everything becomes political, it's not good for society.
Sometimes political events and politicians work in politics and other talents of society and their livelihoods are suppressed.
Thank you very much for the phone call.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is an easy job for me.
People's letters come before all the Mann Ki Baats.
I want to see the maximum number of letters and comments before the Mann Ki Baat.
I hear a lot of phone calls.
As Mann Kibat's episode approaches, I read your ideas and inputs very carefully during the journey.
So whenever you read a letter, the environment of the writer, his emotions, become part of my thoughts.
That letter isn't just a paper piece for me.
I have been leading the life of a loser in the last 40-45 years, I have gone to most of the districts of the country, I have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
The proposals of the letters not to be included in the Mann Ki Baat are also being taken into consideration in the respective departments.
I would like to thank my friends from Akashwani, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV channels, social media etc.
It is because of their efforts that Mann Ki Baat can reach more and more people.
Akashwani team is preparing to broadcast all the episodes in many languages.
Some people listen to Mann Ki Baat in the same fashion, in the local language, in the same fashion.
Thus, they become Modi for 30 minutes.
I convey my best wishes and thanks to them for their talent and skills.
I urge you all to listen to this program in local languages.
I would like to express my gratitude to the friends of the media who have listened to Mann Ki Baat every month in their channels.
A person in politics is not happy with the media, but he feels that he gets very little coverage and if he gets a coverage then he says that it is a negative coverage.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
I'll be doing it in every family.
It's easier to understand if we don't get through the old sheep of our own life.
I don't know that a person has left his thoughts and accepted and accepted his thoughts.
The specialty of today's youth is that they don't do things that are self-confidenced and if they believe in something then they leave everything for it and follow it.
Sometimes people talk about the compassionate departure of families with youngsters.
In fact, the limit for talking to more families and youngsters is very small.
It is said that don't do that about things that are learning too long, or about habits and lifestyle.
I have been trying to interact with the youth through social media through various programmes.
I'm trying to learn from them what they're doing, what they think.
They always have the treasure of ideas.
They are very vibrant, newly discovered and concentrated.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I am trying to connect the youth with their problems and their problems even more.
There are often complaints that youngsters are asking more questions.
I'm telling you that the youngsters are asking questions.
We feel that today's youth is very important and they think big things.
Big dreams and great achievements are good - finally this is New India, New India.
Some say the youngsters want to do many things at the same time.
I'm asking you what's wrong with this.
Many things are being done simultaneously because they're capable of multi-tasking.
Whether it is social initiatives, start-ups, sports or any other sector, we are youngsters who bring about big changes in the society.
Youngsters who dare to ask questions and see new dreams.
If you bring the thoughts of the youth to the ground, and give them an open environment to express them, then there can be progressive changes in the country and they do so.
My dear countrymen, Vineetaji of Gurugram has written on MyGov that in this Mann Ki Baat, I would like to mention the Constitution Day.
It is a humorous statement that the day is great because we entered the seventies of our constitution.
Thank you very much for this opinion.
The Constituent Assembly took two years and 11 months and 17 days to fulfil this historic task.
Just imagine, within three years, these great personalities have given us such a wide and comprehensive constitution.
Today's Time Management and Productivity are examples of the fact that they have created the Constitution at such an unusual pace.
This will inspire us to fulfil our responsibilities on record time.
The Constituent Assembly was the confluence of the great talents of the country and all of them were committed to empowering India and giving it to the Constitution that empowers the poorest of the poor.
When India completed 60 years of its Republic in 2010, a grand tour was organised in Gujarat with an elephant beyond Constitution.
It was an opportunity to remind the youth of awakening about the Constitution and connecting them with various stakeholders of the Constitution.
By 2020, we will complete 70 years as Republic of India and 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us take our constitutional values forward and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
He used to say that even though Indians are different, we must be the most patriotic.
India First India is the first Dr.
It is proposed to celebrate this opportunity in all the State Governments and Union Territories.
This way it will be celebrated in all the countries of the world.
Along with this, a train will also run on the way to holy places related to Guru Nanak Devji.
In the last few days, when I was attending this related meeting, I remembered the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Saheb.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, the Gurudwara had suffered major losses.
Our journey will continue.
As much as you are connected, our journey will be deeper, it will make everyone happy.
Sometimes somebody's got a question in their minds - What did I get with Mann Ki Baat
Your noble wishes are my great wishes.
Come on, let's go further through this journey.
31st October is the birth anniversary of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Like every year, the youth of the country is ready to run for the unity of the country.
The weather is too comfortable now.
I urge you all to participate in the Radio For Unit with enthusiasm.
About six and a half months before the independence, the world's most famous international publication The Time Magazine became a picture of Sardar Patel on the cover page of rhetoric published on 27th January, 1947.
They gave a picture of India along with the main article, which was not the same as we saw today.
It was a picture of India that was scattered in many parts.
There were more than 550 countries in those days.
The English had no interest in India.
He says how he did rescue operations during the floods in Ahmedabad in the 1920s.
Bardoli tells us how he gave direction to the Satyagraha.
From farmers, workers to industrialists, everyone was able to trust him and his loyalty and commitment towards the nation.
On 31st October, the commemoration of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be more special and the Statue of Unity will be dedicated to the nation by paying homage to Sardar Patel.
Established on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, the height of the statue is twice the USA's Statue of Liberty.
This is the world's tallest skyscraper statue.
It is a matter of pride for all Indians that the world's tallest statue is in India.
Sardar Patel, who was associated with the soil, will be a decoration of the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we celebrated Infantry Day.
I salute all those who are part of the Indian Army.
I salute the families of soldiers for their courage.
But do you know why we, the people of Hindustan, are celebrating Infantry Day
This was the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army landed in Kashmir and drove Kashmir away from the hijackers.
This historic event is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an interview with Sam Manek Shah, the greatest military officer of India.
In that interview, Field Marshal Manek Shah is talking about the time he was a field marcher.
At that time, in October 1947, Kashmir was launched.
31st October is the commemoration of our former Prime Minister, Smt.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Dr.
My dear countrymen, who doesn't like games and sports
Spirit, Strength, Skill and Stamina are all important in the world of sports.
This is not the result of any sportsman's success.
In the recent past, two meetings were held in memory.
First is an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
Similarly, in Argentina, there was an opportunity to meet the winners of the Youth Olympics 2018.
In the Youth Olympics 2018, our youth have shown the best performance ever.
We have won 13 medals and three medals in the Mix event.
This is the story of Indian Sports which touches new heights every day.
India is creating new records not only in sports but also in areas where no one has ever thought of.
He lost his father when he was 8.
He lived in the orphanage for the next eight years.
After leaving the orphanage, he cleaned DDC buses to move forward and worked as a waiter on the coastal coasts of Delhi.
Today, the same Narayan International has won gold medals for India.
Not only this, look at the heights of excellence in sports in India.
India has never won any Olympic Medal in Judo at the Senior level or at the Junior level.
But Tababi Devi won a silver medal in Judo at the Youth Olympics and composed history.
Tababi Devi, a 16 year old sportsman, lives in a village in Manipur.
The child's father is a worker, and the mother runs fishing.
Sometimes this kid's family had no money to buy food.
Even in such a scenario, the zeal of Goddess Tababi didn't touch the castle.
And then he composed history by winning medals for the country.
There are numerous stories like this.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
The enthusiasm of all young sportspersons is the essence of New India.
My dear countrymen, we successfully organized the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2017.
As a comparatively successful tournament, the entire world appreciated it.
This year, India is fortunate to host the Men's Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will be held from 28th November to 16th December.
In the minds of all Indians, whatever game plays, there will definitely be a chase with the hockey in any game.
India has offered great hockey players.
Whenever there is talk of world hockey, the story of Hockey will be incomplete without these great sportspersons of India.
The whole world knows the Hockey wizard Major Dhyan Chand.
Subsequently, Hockey has undertaken a long journey from Balwinder Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj.
Even today, teams of Indian sportspersons continue to inspire the new generation of Hockey through their success due to their dedication and dedication.
Sports is a good opportunity for lovers to see thrilling games.
We should not only go to Bhubaneswar, but also encourage all the teams.
But in the new era, in a new way, in a new generation, with a new enthusiasm, with a new zeal, we are coming forward to do these things with new dreams.
Some teach children, some teach adults, some are engaged in cleanliness, some are helping farmers.
There is no desire behind doing all this, but it has dedication, determination and selflessness.
He also learnt to play wheelchair basketball on his own to help the wheelchair basketball team of a young person with disabilities.
This spirit, this dedication is an activity in the mission mode.
Wouldn't any Indian take pride in it
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I looked at the suggestions related to Mann Ki Baat, I got an attractive note of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pondicherry.
He has written in the MyGov, Please tell me in Mann Ki Baat how the tribals of India and their lives and traditions become the best example of co-existence with nature.
We must learn from them what is the need to make traditions a part of our lives for sustainable development.
Mr. Manish ji, I congratulate you for putting this issue before the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
It is a matter of great pride that inspires us to look at our glorious past and culture and today Western nations, particularly in the world, talk about environmental protection and seek new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees, plants and flowers like gods and goddesses.
In the Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship the tree named Alvar and Arjun with respect.
In a desert like Rajasthan, Bishnoi community has shown us how to preserve the environment.
Especially for protecting trees, they don't want to give up their own lives, but they don't want to harm even a tree.
The Witnesses of Arunachal are supposed to have a direct relationship with the tigers.
They look like their own brothers and sisters.
People from the Varli community of Maharashtra see tigers as guests and for them the presence of tigers will bring prosperity.
The Goud tribes of Central India are blocking fishing in some parts of the river Ketan during fisheries.
They see these territories as dependents on fish and they get good fish because of their preservation.
Toda, a small and vibrant society in the isolated areas of Nilgiri in south India, is traditionally building their homes because of the things available in that area.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living very peacefully and with one another, but if someone harms their natural resources, they will not hesitate to defend their rights.
It is not surprising that our early freedom fighters were among the tribal communities.
Come on, let's show them respect.
My dear countrymen, we talk about those who do extraordinary things for the society in Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother Bhai Gurubachan Singh of Punjab.
One ordinary teacher was the marriage of a farmer, Gurubachan Singh.
But you will be surprised to know that a common farmer like Bhai Gurubachan Singh told the bridegroom's father that the condition he put forward is the real strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told them that I have to promise you that he will not burn the vaccine in the field.
You can imagine how big social force it has.
Gurubachan Singh ji said this thing is simple, but this incident tells us how elaborate his personality is, there are many families in our society that make personal things a matter of social good.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh ji has presented such an example to us.
I read about another village of Punjab, the Kallar Majra near Naba.
People of Kallar Majra instead of lighting the doorsteps, they merge it to the ground and use technology for it.
"Greetings to Shri Gurubachan Singh Ji.
Congratulations to people from all over the world who have made great efforts to keep the atmosphere clean.
You live as the real inheritors of Indian traditions of healthy lifestyle.
Om Dhauva Shantipuram Shantipuram, Shantipurthvi Shantipurthvi Shantiyam, Apahara Shanti Vishayav Shantivara Shantireva Shantireyam, Shantireyam Shantireyam, Shantireyam, Shantireyam, Shantireyam, Shantireyam Shanti or Shantihara, it means peace in all the three worlds, either in water, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the medicines, in the plants, in the gardens, in the unconscious, in the entire universe.
May there be peace in the living creatures, in the heart, in me, in the particles of the world.
For India, the First World War was a big event.
Clearly, we had nothing to do with the war.
Yet our soldiers fought bravely, played a very big role and carried out great martyrdom.
When the Indian soldiers came to war, they showed the world that they were not behind anybody.
In the First World War, the world has witnessed a stage of destruction.
It is believed that more than one crore soldiers and almost equally ordinary people have died.
Through this, the whole world understands the importance of peace.
In the last hundred years, the definition of peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony are not merely a war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, we need to work together and work together.
Development of the poorest of the poor is the real symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, our Northeast is different.
Its natural beauty is unique and its people are very talented.
Our north-eastern region is now renowned for very well-being.
Organic farming in the North-East has grown considerably in terms of organic farming.
A few days ago, Kirtiket Future Policy Gold Award 2018 was conferred on Sikkim to promote sustainability.
It means food and agricultural organisations are provided.
The award for the best policy making in the sector is equivalent to that of Oskar in the region.
Not only this, our Sikkim state has won the award in the backdrop of 51 nominated policies of 25 countries.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is ending.
There's a lot of change in the weather.
In a way, Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhayadooj and Chhath, the month of November is the month of festivals.
May your progress be an important part of the progress of the country, let it be an opportunity to move forward on a mission mode in your life and make a resolve.
