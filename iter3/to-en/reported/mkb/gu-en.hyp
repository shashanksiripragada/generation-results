Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
My dear countrymen, today is the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
Deepawali greetings to all of you.
This shloka says, Light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destroys the opposite intellect and shows the intellect.
My best wishes to such a Divya Yojana to remember this insolvency, who could have better ideas than that, let us spread light, spread positiveness and pray for the destruction of the spirit of enmity.
Today Deepawali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that it does not only include the Indian community but now the governments of many countries, the citizens of that country and the social organisations of that country also celebrate the festival of Deepawali with full joy.
In a way, India stands there.
Friends, Festival tourism is also an attraction of its own in the world.
There are immense possibilities of festivals that our country is home to.
Our effort should be to spread such festivals like Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu and also to include other states and people of other countries in the joy of festivals.
There are several festivals of our own in every state and region that the people of other countries are very fond of it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided that this insolvency will do something different.
Let us all celebrate the women power and achievements of India, i. e.
And immediately after that, innumerable inspiring stories on social media came to light.
The Kodipaka of Warangal has written on Namo App that my mother is my strength.
Since my father died in 10th century, my mother had taken up the responsibility of our five daughters.
Today we are in a good business for five brothers.
My mother is God for me.
It is universal for me and that is the true meaning of India's laxity.
Ramesh ji, I salute your mother.
Deepika Swamy, who is active on Twitter, says that for her Major Khushbu Kanwar is the Laxmi of India, the daughter of the bus conductor.
India's Laxmi is her daughter for poetry.
He is proud that his daughter makes beautiful paintings.
He has won a very good rank in the CLAT examination.
Medha Jainji has also written that for an old woman of 2 years, she has been drinking water free of cost to travellers on Gwalior Railway Station.
Medhaji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of India's Laxmi.
Many stories have been shared by the people.
You must read, get inspiration and share yourself if there is any inspiring story around you.
I also salute all these laxmis of India.
It seems as if its foundation was laid in the 19th century itself.
How beautiful words, how good things and how excellent ideas are there in this poem of Kannada.
Panindra Permegondnu Himavanthunu, Panininda Bhrigu Perchidanupaninda Janakarayanu Jaswadedu Arthat, Himwant, i.e., Parvaraja, due to her daughter Parvati, Bhrigu Gupta enjoyed fame because of her daughter Laxmi and King Janaka because of her daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride and it is because of the greatness of these daughters that our society has a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, the 12th November, 2019 is the day on which 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
Guru Nanak ji's influence is not only in India but in the ancient world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters reside in some countries of the world who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I will never forget my visit to the Vancouver and the Gurudwara Mein Tahairan.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can tell you about, but for that, many bindings of Mann Ki Baat should be done.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji conveyed his message to the remotest places of the world.
He was one of the highest travellers in his time.
He visited many places and wherever he went, he won the hearts of everyone with his ease, humility and simplicity.
Conscious of goodwill and equality, he visited north or south, east or west, wherever he visited the saints and sages.
It is believed that the famous saint Shankar Dev of Assam was also inspired by him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi.
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Devji was there.
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Devji had travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji himself had solved the problem of water there.
In Bidar, Guru Nanak Jira Saheb is a famous place that reminds us of Guru Nanak Devji.
Guru Nanak Devji visited Kashmir and surrounding areas in the north during an unhappy period.
It established a very close relationship between the Sikh community and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also visited Tibet where people considered him Guru.
He is also venerated in Uzbekistan wherever he visited.
He gave a place in the hearts of lakhs of people who followed his teachings with full faith and are still doing it.
Just a few days ago, ambassadors from around 85 countries had gone to Amritsar from Delhi.
He visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar and all this was the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
Thereafter, several ambassadors had portrayed it on social media and shared their good experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember the 31st of October.
This day marks the birth anniversary of the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who served the nation in the spirit of unity.
While Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to connect people together, on the other hand, he used to collaborate with those who had ideological differences.
He was a true man of Details.
At the same time, he was a master of organised skills.
He was welcomed in the formulation and formulation of schemes.
Whenever we read and hear about Sardar Saheb's working style, we find out how compulsory his organisation was.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country were supposed to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 121.
He also used the opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city, which was responsible for the overall system of the session.
And we have ensured that no one will suffer from water.
Moreover, he was also observed that the goods or slippers of any representative should not be stolen at the place of the session and you would be very surprised to know what Sardar Patel did.
He contacted the farmers and urged them to build Khadi plants.
On the other hand, Khadi sales have also grown substantially.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Patel did a great job of uniting the sermons.
It was also a special feature of Sardar Vallabh Bhai who looked at every event.
On one hand, his focus was on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other states.
On the other hand, his attention was on Durasudur Lakshadweep.
Well, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts then his role in integration of the country is also discussed in some specific states.
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947, our neighbours looked at Lakshadweep and sent the ship along with its flag.
Just like Sardar Patel knew, he immediately started stern action without wasting time.
Immediately after his orders, the tri-color was flown and every mindset of the neighbourhood to capture the Lakshadweep was ruined.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliar brothers to personally ensure that the development of the Lakshadweep remains necessary.
Today, the Lakshadweep is contributing to Indias progress.
It is also an attractive tourist destination.
I hope that all of you will be visiting these beautiful islands and seas.
My dear countrymen, the 31st of October, 2018 was dedicated to the nation and the world, the Statue of Unity in the memory of Sardar Saheb.
This is the tallest statue in the world.
The Statue of Liberty, located in the USA, is twice the height.
The tallest statue of the world fills every Indian with pride.
The height of every Indian is greatly elevated.
You would be happy to know that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists had come to see the Statue of Unity.
This means that on an average, eight and a half thousand people visited the magnificence of the Statue of Unity.
Friends, This Statue of Unity can be a subject of study for the tourism industry for the country and for all the states.
We all testify to how within a year a place develops as a world famous tourist destination.
People from India and abroad come there.
Transportation, lodging, guides, environment friendly arrangements are developing at the same time.
A very big economy is developing and people are developing facilities as per the needs of the tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, Who would be such an Indian who would not be proud of the fact that in the past, the Statue of Unity has given an important place to the top 100 tourist destinations of the world in terms of time magazines.
I hope that all of you will take some time out of your precious time to see the Statue of Unity.
This is my insistence.
Friends, You are aware that the National Unity Day is celebrated on 31st October every year since 2014.
This day gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country from any evil.
Ekta Run for Unity is also being organised on 31st October every time.
This will include people from all sections of the society, from all walks of life.
Anyway, nowadays, there is a mourning and public sentiment for the marathon.
The Run for Unity is also a unique feature.
Running is beneficial for all of this mind, mind and body .
Here, the spirit of Fit India is realized by running here.
At the same time, we are also connected with the objective of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not only the body, but also the mind and the culture, for India's unity, it connects India to scale new heights.
And therefore, whatever city you live in, you can get associated with the Run for Unity in your vicinity.
I hope that all of you will run on 31st October for India's unity and for your fitness.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has bound the country on the lines of unity.
This mantra of unity has turned into a culture in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we must continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every stage at every stage at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and vigilant to strengthen the unity and mutual understanding of the country.
If we go around, we will find many examples that have been working continuously to increase mutual goodwill.
But sometimes it becomes such that the effort of the society gets rubbed with memories very soon.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court had made a statement on Ram Janmabhoomi.
Just remember those days when there was an atmosphere.
The interested groups were playing games to take advantage of the situation themselves.
What kind of language was being spoken to produce heat in the environment
Efforts were also being made to fill the gap in different voices.
Efforts were made to reduce tension in the environment.
We must always remember that it gives us great strength.
That day, that moment is a duty for all of us.
This is an example of how the voice of unity can give strength to the country.
Today, I also pay my tributes to him.
But it is also a pleasant and interesting experience.
I have heard these things, so I think I have heard you too.
You can imagine that the world's tallest battlefield or the temperature of which goes from zero to 50 degrees minus.
Oxygen is also called merely in the air.
In contrast to such challenges, it is no less than a milestone.
In such a vicious scenario, our brave soldiers not only take out their chests and protect the borders of the country but they are also running a clean Siachen campaign there too.
I compliment the people of our country for this wonderful commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that it is difficult to rot too.
In such a situation, waste segregation and management are an important thing in itself.
We all know that Siachen is a snow-covered region that is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, running a cleanliness drive means ensuring clean water for people living in the under-privileged areas and also using water from rivers like Nubra and Shyok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is a celebration of a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially in insolvency, we have to buy something new and bring something from the market.
Once I had said that we should educate ourselves to buy local items.
If we get the requirements from our village then we do not need to go to the taluka.
There is no need to go to the district if it is available in the tehsils.
We will try to buy as many local items as possible.
The Gandhi Symposium will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I have been urging that if we buy something made by the hands of our weavers brothers and sisters of Khadi then we should buy something.
This insolvency bill must have purchased a lot before the insolvency bill.
But there will be a lot of people who think that if I go after Diwali then perhaps I will get a little cheaper.
There will be a lot of people who will still have to buy.
So with the wishes of Deepawali, I would urge you to come forward to buy local items and buy local items.
You see, we can also play an important role in realizing the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all on this auspicious occasion of Diwali.
In Deepawali, we are bursting a variety of shocks.
But there is a fire in some inconvenience.
Any injury occurs.
I urge you all to take care of yourselves and celebrate the festival with great joy.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Perhaps there would be an Indian who would not be proud of our armed forces, our armed forces.
Every Indian, whether it is in any field, caste, religion, creed or language, is always ready to express his happiness and support towards our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion Indians celebrated the Parakram Parv.
We recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers gave a befitting reply to those who visualised the Praxi War under the guise of terrorism on our nation.
Our Armed Forces have organized exhibitions at different locations across the country so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation, know what our strengths are, how we are capable and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by risking their lives.
Like the Parakram Parv, the day reminds youngsters of the glorious legacy of our Armed Forces.
And inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. It is now certain that our soldiers will give a bitter answer to all those who will try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and prosperity in our country.
We believe in peace and are committed to encouraging it, but not at all by compromising with dignity and at the expense of the sovereignty of the nation.
India has always been committed and committed to peace.
In the 20th century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace in the two world wars and that was when we had nothing to do with this war.
Our vision was never on any other land.
It was our commitment to peace.
A few days ago, on 23 September, we recalled our brave soldiers from Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lancers who had liberated Haifa from the agitators on the occasion of the hundred years of Haifa in Israel.
It was also a milestone in the direction of peace by our soldiers.
Even today, India is one of the largest military deployments in the UN peacekeeping forces.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
One of the stake in which people are eagerly waiting for the Republic Day celebrations is the fly past in which our Air Force showcases their strengths in wonderful cars.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
Our Air Force has joined the brave and powerful air force of the 21st century today, with 6 pilots and 1 air warriors from a small start in 1932.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the air warriors and their families who have served for the country.
When the Pakistani attackers launched an unprecedented attack in 1947, it was the Air Force that ensured that the Indian Army and the equipment reached the battlefield in time to save Srinagar from the attackers.
The Air Force in 1965 also gave a furious response to the enemies.
Who does not know the freedom struggle of Bangladesh in 1991
The Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from the captivity of the 1970s.
In Tiger Hill, the Air Force dumped the enemy by firing bombs day and night.
Whether it is relief and rescue operations or disaster management, the country is grateful to our air warriors for their commendable work.
Their mindset has been wonderful in dealing with natural calamities and helping the people of the country from storms, storms, floods to forest fires.
Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equity in the country and has opened the doors of each of its departments for the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is giving women the option of Short Service Commission as well as the Permanent Commission which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15 August this year.
India can proudly say that not only male power but also female power are being contributed in the Armed Forces of India.
Women are not only empowered but now they are also becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, the past few days, one of our naval officers, Abhilash Tomy, was fighting for his life and death.
The entire country was wondering how to save a tommy.
You are aware that Abhilash Tomy is a very brave officer.
He was the first Indian to travel the world with a small boat without a single modern technology.
For the past 80 days, he had been moving ahead by maintaining his pace in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean. However, the terrible maritime calamity created difficulties for him.
I had met the Tommy earlier too.
Even after coming out of such a difficult situation, his courage was strong, his determination to do something like this once again is an inspiration for the young generation of the country.
I pray for the excellent health of Abhilash Tomy and their courage, their determination, sacrifice and victory will certainly inspire the young generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, every child knows the importance of 2nd October for our nation.
2 October this year has a special significance.
For two years from today, we are going to organize several events across the globe on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Whether it is Martin Luther King Junior or great scholars like Nelson Mandela, each one of them gained strength from Gandhijis ideas and fought a long battle to ensure equality and dignity for their people.
In todays Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another important work of revered Bapu which the people of the country should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a Constructive Programme.
Later, in 1945, when the freedom struggle was gaining momentum, he prepared a revised copy of those ideas.
Revered Bapu has placed his thoughts before the countrymen on a wide range of topics such as protection of farmers, villages, rights of workers, cleanliness, spread of education etc.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a philanthropist.
It was Bapu's specialty to get connected with the people and connect him with himself.
Everyone has experienced this as the most unique feature of his personality.
He made every individual feel that it is the most important and satisfactory requirement for the country.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement.
At the call of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle, every section of the society, every section of the society, every section of the society, had dedicated itself.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra, which is often known as Gandhijis Talisman.
In this, Gandhiji had said, I give you a gentleman. Whenever you suspect that if you start to dawn on you, then try this bitterness. Remember the faces of the poorest and weakest person you have seen and ask your hearts what kind of steps you are thinking of will be useful for the person
Would it benefit from this
Will this enable him to control his own life and destiny
Does it mean that it will provide Swaraj to crores of people who are hungry and who are unhappy with their souls
Then you will see that your doubts are curing and you are ending.
My dear countrymen, even today, one of Gandhiji's animals is equally important.
Today, the rising middle class in the country, its growing economic power, rising purchasing power can we remember Bapu for a moment if we go to buy anything
Can we remember that venerable Bapu ji
What would be the lucky thing that will benefit from your purchase in a straight or dangerous manner
And if the poorest of the poor benefits, then my happiness will be greater than that.
Remembering Gandhijis birth anniversary, whenever we buy something, whenever we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we must think that our every purchase requires a citizen of a country and in that too those who have sweated their sweat, who have dedicated their talents, all of them must be benefited.
This is the message of Gandhiji and I believe that the poorest and the weakest person, your small step in his life can bring a very big result.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji had said that if you do cleanliness then you will find freedom then perhaps he would not know how it would be.
Similarly, today we can feel that even with this small task of mine, I can make a huge contribution in the economic progress of my country, in the economic empowerment and in the fight against poverty. And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's era.
For example, if we consider buying Khadi and handloom products on specific occasions then it will help many weavers.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri ji kept the old or broken clothes of Khadi safe because somebody's hard work is hidden in it.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothes are made of utmost hard work, one of them should come to work.
This feeling of affection for the people of the country was inherent in the essence of his great personality.
Two days later, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri Ji along with revered Bapu.
As soon as the name of Shastri ji comes, the feeling of infinite devotion comes to the minds of the people of India.
His gentle personality always fills every citizen with pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had a special feature that he looked very humble from outside but he was firmly determined like a mountain from within.
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, whose portrait is a recognition of his immense personality.
As a result of his selfless penance towards the nation, during his brief tenure of one and a half years, he had given mantras to bring the soldiers and farmers of the country to the peak of success.
My dear countrymen, today when we are remembering revered Bapu, it is very natural that we cannot stay without talking about cleanliness.
A campaign called Swachhata Hi Seva started from 15th September.
Millions of people joined this campaign and I was also fortunate that I would donate sanitation to the children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to that school whose foundation was laid by Babasaheb.
Every class of people across the country joined this workshop on the 15th of this month.
Institutions also contributed to Rangcheng.
School students, college students, NCC, NSS, youth associations, Media Groups, Corporate Governance, all of them have donated sanitation work at a large scale.
I sincerely congratulate all these Swachhata lovers for this thing.
Let us listen to a phone call.
You have said a lot that cleanliness has its own importance in everyones lives and under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, toilets have been constructed in your houses and now you are getting convenience.
And perhaps the people associated with this campaign are not even imagined that you cant see because of being an enlightened person, but if you didn't have a toilet then you might have to spend your life with so many difficulties.
Perhaps, if you had not called upon the people to connect with this aspect then perhaps this sensitivity would not have come to the notice of the people associated with this movement of cleanliness.
I especially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful story not only in the country but in the entire world.
This time India is organizing the world's largest cleanliness summit in history.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, i.e. Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention and experts from all over the world are coming together to share their experiments and experiences related to sanitation.
The closing ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention) is scheduled to be held on 2nd October, 2018.
It is especially necessary to ensure the freedom, peace and justice of the deprived, the deprived and the underprivileged.
Dr.
In the Constitution provided by Babasaheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October 13.
A few days later, NHRC will complete 25 years.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but also enhanced human dignity.
Our beloved leader, the former Prime Minister of our country, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has clearly stated that human rights are not a concept for us.
Our National Human Rights Commission symbolizes the ideals of Vedic times.
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in curbing its misuse.
In this 25-year journey, it has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
For a healthy society, for the best democratic values, I believe that this is a very hopeful event.
Today, at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been constituted along with the work of human rights.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and bring them into practice - that is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
My dear countrymen, be it the month of October or be it the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan or be it the beginning of the birth centenary year of Rajmata Vijayaraj Scindia ji all these great men have been inspiring us all, we salute them and we salute Sardar Saheb on 31st October. I will talk in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
This year too, we should try to organise the Run for Unity in our villages, towns, cities and metropolis.
Run for Unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge you all to strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society through the Run for Unity on 31st October and that will be a great tribute to them.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, today the entire country is celebrating the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
For centuries, this festival has been a great example of social beauty.
There are many such stories in the history of the country in which one Rakhi had linked two different states or religions with the fiction of faith.
A few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is also going on.
The entire climate is elephants, horses, palanquins.
The joy of painting in the colour of Lord Krishna is something different.
Greetings to all the countrymen on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
My best wishes to all fellow citizens on Sanskrit Week.
I am extremely grateful to the girl Chinmayi who raised this topic.
Friends, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, Sanskrit day is also celebrated on the occasion of Shravani Purnima.
I congratulate all those who are trying to preserve, nurture and bring this great legacy to the people.
Every language has its own greatness.
India is proud of the fact that Tamil is the oldest language in the world.
And we all Indians also take pride in the fact that from Vedic times to present, Sanskrit language has also played a major role in spreading knowledge.
The repository of knowledge related to every sphere of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature.
You will be happy to know that residents of Mattur village in Shivamoga district of Karnataka Raj still use Sanskrit language for talks.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which many words are possible.
20000 metals, 200 per cent i. e.
And, therefore, a subtle sense or subject can be expressed in any subtle way.
That is, if a guru gives his disciple the knowledge of one letter then there is no such thing or money in the whole earth so that the student can take away the debt of his Guru.
Let us celebrate the Teachers Day with this feeling that knowledge and guru are incredible, priceless and priceless.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day.
At the same time, I thank you for your dedication towards science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, the monsoon brings new hopes to our hardworking farmers.
Weakness provides monsoon relief to dry trees and dry reservoirs in the heat.
However, sometimes it also brings down heavy rainfall and devastating floods.
There has been a situation of nature that some places have received more rainfall than others.
Just recently, we have seen that Kerala has had a terrible impact on the lives of people.
Today, the entire country is accompanied by Kerala in this difficult situation.
Our sympathies are with those families.
I am confident that with the courage and indomitable courage of the people of the state, Kerala will be reunited very soon.
But we also see humanity in times of disasters.
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something or the other for the purpose of making the lives of the common man normal, be it Kerala or any other district or region of India.
All the elderly and those associated with every field of work are contributing to it.
We all know that the Armed Forces personnel are dry in the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala.
They have left no stone unturned in saving the people trapped in floods.
Whether it is air force, naval force, ground force or BSF, CISF, RAF, everyone has played a major role in the rescue and relief operations.
I would also like to specially mention the hard work done by the brave soldiers of NDRF.
The topic on which people from all over the country have written the most is our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonpat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr.
Dream Banerjee, from Katihar in Bihar, Akhil Pandey, some numerous people have written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov urging me to talk about different aspects of Atal ji's life.
On the 16th of August, the nation and the world heard the news of Atal ji's passing away, and were shocked at the loss of lives.
A nation leader who left the Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, for the last ten years, he had gone far from active politics.
The kind of affection, reverence and grief that has emerged throughout the country for Atal ji showcases his great personality.
For the past several days, Atal ji's best aspects have come to the fore.
India will always be indebted to Atal ji for the 1st Amendment Act, 2003.
This transformation has brought about two major changes in India's politics.
Firstly, the stature of the Cabinet in the States was restricted to 15 of the Assembly Constituencies.
Secondly, the prescribed limit under the Anti-Pacific Act has been increased from one-third to two-thirds.
Along with this, clear guidelines have also been fixed to disqualify the participants.
For many years, the political culture of building big cabinets in India was home, which were made not for sharing of work but for the happiness of politicians.
Atal ji changed this culture.
These steps saved money and resources.
Along with this, efficiency has also increased.
Atal ji was such a visionary who changed the situation and implemented a healthy tradition in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In the year 2017, Atal ji changed the time for presentation of the Budget from 5 PM to 11 PM.
Thus, he brought our vibrant tricolor closer to the people.
I would certainly like to say that it would be an excellent tribute to Atal ji for the healthy democracy, for the best democracy, for the development of good traditions, for the consolidation of democracy and for taking forward discussions with an open mind.
Just a few days back, the Monsoon Session of Parliament has been completed.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and that of Rajya Sabha was 4.
And as a result, 21 bills and 14 bills were passed by the Rajya Sabha during this session.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of the youth.
Several important bills that benefit the youth and the backward classes were passed in this session.
You all are aware that for decades, like Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, there was a demand for setting up of OBC Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has made a solemn pledge to set up the OBC Commission this time.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Amendment Bill, 2018 to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will better protect the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
It will also prevent the offenders from persecuting the people of this class and irrigate faith in the Dalit communities.
No member society can tolerate any injustice against the women power of the country.
Therefore, by passing the Occupant Law Amendment Bill, the Parliament has prosecuted severe punishment for such offenders and the offenders will be punished for at least 10 years.
When rapers under 12 years of age will be punished with wounds.
A few days ago, he had read in the newspapers that a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh has completed the hearing in just two months and sentenced two criminals to death on one alert.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had sentenced the criminals to death after just five days of hearing.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts there have made such fast payments.
The Act will play a pivotal role in preventing crimes against women and children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
This time in the Chausing session, everyone has presented an ideal together.
Today, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, the attention of millions and millions of our countrymen is now on the Asian Games being held here.
Every morning, people watch the newspapers, TVs, news, social media and watch that an Indian player has won a medal.
Asian Games are still on.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
My best wishes to the players whose competitions are yet to be held.
India's players are showcasing excellence especially in boxing and wrestling, but our players are also bringing medals in such sports, in which we don't seem to be so good before.
This is not just a medal, but the proverbs of Indian sports and sportspersons.
This is a very positive sign that our daughters are among the increasing number of medal winners for the country.
Similarly, our youngsters in the age group of 15-16 are among the youngsters who have won medals.
This is also a very good indicator that most of the players who have won medals are from small towns and villages and these players have achieved this success through hard work.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the sports enthusiasts and pay my tributes to the great Hockey player Shri Dhyan Chand ji.
I urge all the citizens of the country to play sports and take care of their fondness as a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
If India is healthy then it will create a bright future for India.
Namaste Bhavna ji, I respect your feelings.
We all have seen the construction of houses and buildings from intestines but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago, a huge mountain which was an entire rock was given the shape of a magnificent temple, perhaps it was difficult to imagine but it was so.
And that temple is the Kailasnath temple in Ellora, Maharashtra, if anyone tells you that a pillar of more than 60 metres long granite was built about a thousand years ago and a laying of 80 tonnes of granite was laid on its top.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple at Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where this unbelievable blend of architecture and engineering can be seen.
He is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patan, Gujarat.
India's Bhumi Engineering Laboratory.
There were many engineers in India who made Alpine a visionary and presented examples of miracles in the world of engineering.
In our legacy of great engineers, we have also received such a gem whose work is still surprising for the people.
M.
They are not only revered in that part of the country but the rest of the country also remembers them with great respect and intimacy.
In his memory, 15th September is celebrated as Engineers Day.
After walking on his footsteps, the engineers of our country have made their own identity in the whole world.
When I talk of miracles in the engineering world, I recall the horrific episode of Kutch in Gujarat in 2017.
So I got the opportunity to go to a village where I got the opportunity to meet a maiden of more than 100 years of age.
They looked at me and were joking with us and saying, Look, this is my house.
In Kutch, it is called Bhungo.
I have seen 3-3 earthquakes in my house.
But you will not be able to see any harm.
This house was built by our ancestors according to the natural condition of this place as per the environment here.
And he was saying this thing with pride that I thought that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had created it according to the local conditions, due to which the common man was safe.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers' Day, we should think for the future too.
Workshops should be conducted at different places.
What new things should we learn in the changing times
You have to learn
Should we connect
What should students be taught
How should ero West be our priority
We must think of many such things when we celebrate Engineers' Day.
My dear countrymen, this is the atmosphere of festivals.
Besides, preparations for Diwali also begin.
With this feeling, many congratulations to everyone.
Thank you, I will meet you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
So, people are still waiting for rain at some places.
The vastness and diversity of India sometimes shows the form of a favorite dislike.
But what do we blame the rain
It is human beings who have chosen the path of conflict with nature and consequently, sometimes nature whispers to us.
It usually takes hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But on that day, the Kishtam had some other approval.
When they went inside the cave for good then suddenly due to heavy rains such water was collected near the entrance of the cave .
Their exit route was closed.
Because there was no road, they were stuck on a small cliff inside the cave.
And that too not for a couple of days for the entire 18 days.
On one hand, they were facing difficulties.
On the other hand, humanity in the entire world was demonstrating the human qualities saved by God.
People from all over the world were praying for these children to be safe.
The feeling of responsibility at every level was wonderful.
Whether it is the government, the parents of these children, the family members, the media, the citizens of the country, everyone has done a wonderful job of peace and patience.
Everyone was associated with their mission by becoming a team.
I believe that there is a subject like learning and understanding.
It is not that the parents are not sad, it is not that the tears do not come out of the eyes of the mothers, but the calm behaviour of patience and restraint society is a matter of learning for all of us.
It shows that when humanity comes to an end, wonderful things are created.
A few days ago, the country's beloved poet Neeraj ji took a farewell to us.
Everything of Neeraj ji can give us strength and inspiration to the Indians too.
Our school board had talked about the stress and calling of examinations given by us during the exams, and now it is your condolence message for students like me.
However, two months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth.
Because this is the time when the college has a very busy time.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam get out of school and go to college.
If February and March go to exams, papers and answers, the results are spent in enjoying holidays in the months of April and May, as well as in deciding the way forward in life, selecting professionals etc.
The attention of the students is limited to the graduates from home.
Students are tempted by professors from their parents' whips.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time we have to go out of our homes, leave our villages and get out of a protective environment and become our friends.
All these youngsters have to leave their homes for the first time and lead their lives in a new direction.
I would like to tell all of you that stay calm, believe in life and enjoy the innermost part of life.
To learn something new, such as new skills, new languages.
He has already succeeded in the MBBS examination of Jodhpur AIIMS.
Their fathers nurture their families by waste and waste.
I congratulate them for their success.
There are many such students who come from poor families and despite their opposite zeal, they have done something that inspires us all.
Then whether it is Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is a bus driver in DTC, or abhay Gupta of Kolkata who studied under the stretch on the footpath, the daughter of Ahmedabad, Afrien Shaikh, whose father runs an autorickshaw.
Or, a Divyang girl from Gurgaon, who is suffering from a hereditary disease called Spine Muscular Atrophy.
All of them have achieved such a success in the entire world by breaking every obstacle with their determination and courage.
If we want to be around us, we will get some such examples.
Any good event that takes place in any corner of the country inspires and inspires me.
And when I tell you the story of these youngsters, I remember the words of poet Neeraj ji and this is the purpose of life.
I was talking to two Indian youth in San Jose City, USA, once known as the Technology Hub.
I urged them to think about how they can use their talent for India and do something out of time.
He urged them to convert May Brain Drain into Brain Gain.
Both of them from Rae Bareli, IT professionals Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayee ji have made an innovative effort by overcoming this challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly developed a smart goal app using their professional skills.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village with the whole world but now they can access any information on their mobile phones.
The residents of Taudakpur village of Rae Bareli, Sarpanch of the village, District Magistrate, Taluka Development Officer, all made the people aware about the use of this app.
It has now become easier to keep an eye on the progress of the development works being carried out in the village by recording it through this App.
The App consists of a village phone directory, news department, list of events, health centre and recognition centre.
The Grameen feature of the App, FACT Rate among the farmers works in a way as a market for their products.
If you look at this incident very carefully then it will be recalled that the people of America who have lost their lives in the midst of the ethos of living in the United States, the youth who had left India many years ago also know the significance of their village, understand the challenges and are associated with the emotions associated with the village.
This is the reason that perhaps they could make the village properly and they could make it better accordingly.
This feeling of attachment to its village, its roots and of doing something for the country is naturally felt within every Indian.
However, sometimes because of some distance, because of some circumstances, a thin dust gets accumulated on it, but if they are touched by some small anxiety then good things will emerge again.
Pandharpur is indeed a unique journey in itself.
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which was on 23rd July this year, is celebrated as a grand festival of Pandharpur Vari.
Pandharpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Approximately 15-20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi, Varkari i. e.
Millions of workers are added to this journey, which is called Bari.
The dignitaries of great saints like Sant Gyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram, who laid down their lives in the palanquin.
Pilgrims are also called Lord Vithal , who is also called Vithoba or Pandurang .
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the underprivileged and the oppressed.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense respect and devotion.
Visiting the Vithoba Temple in Pandharpur and its monthly beauty, spiritual joy is a different experience.
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to once again experience Pandharpur.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still educating the people of Adana in Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against superstitions.
Then we get the message of goodwill, love and brotherhood from them whether it is their burden or dislike.
There is a mantra that society can fight against superstition.
These were the people who, from time to time, demonstrated the philosophy of compassion, equality and interest, ensured that our ancient families were ruined from our society and the values of compassion, equality and interest were irrigated.
We pay tributes to Tilak ji on his birth anniversary and on his death anniversary on 23rd July.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence.
He had the power and intelligence to show the British rulers the significance of their mistakes.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he insisted on sedition three times in 20 years and this was not a small thing.
Today, I would like to put an interesting event in Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad in front of the countrymen.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, perhaps more than 40 thousand people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad during that era.
And during this journey, I got the opportunity to interact with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
And Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was so impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji. When Lokmanya Tilak ji died on the first day of August 1920, he decided that he will build a memorial of Tilak ji in Ahmedabad.
Finally, the statue was completed and Sardar Saheb was inaugurated by Khud Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February.
And I am telling you about that time of the British.
Due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji, the tradition of Ganesh Utsav started.
The Ganesh festival became an effective medium for furthering the spirit of social awareness, collectivity, equality and equality among the people along with traditional faith and joy.
Anyway, there was a time when there was a summit to fight against the British, these festivals broke down the castes and sects and worked as a summit for all.
Over time, the popularity of these events has increased.
It shows what is the crease in our younger generation towards our ancient legacy and our brave leaders of history.
Today, in many cities, this kind of thing is being created that you see the gem of Ganesha in almost every street.
My dear countrymen, I had also requested you last time and today when I remember Lokmanya Tilak ji, I would urge you to celebrate Ganesh festival this time too, to celebrate it with full force, but to urge you to celebrate Eco-Friendly Ganesh festival.
And I would like to say that the items of Eco-Friendly Ganesh Festival should be put on MyGov and Narendra Modi App for wide publicity.
I will convey your message to certain people.
Lokmanya Tilak had expressed confidence in the countrymen and he had suggested that Swaraj is our birthright, and we will jump with it. It is still the time to say that.
So, Swaraj is our birthright and we will win it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and development outcomes.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in the air of freedom.
Chandrashekhar inspired many young people for the bravery and freedom of freedom.
Freedom kept his life on the horse but he never jumped in front of foreign rule.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to go to Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I salute the two great sons of Mother India Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days back, India's brave daughter and Kisanputri Hima Dass made a history of winning the Golden Moon in the 400m race in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship held in Finland.
In response to a letter from Indonesia to another daughter unity threat in the country, she has e-mailed me to prepare the Asian Games there.
The name of the country has been enhanced.
The World Para Athletics Grand Pre-2018 in Tunisia has won a Gold and Bronze medal.
His achievement is special because he has made his challenge a medium of action.
In 2003, due to road accidents, the lower half of the body of daughter Ekta Bhaiya has become impotent, but she has achieved this goal by not losing courage and strengthening herself.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathuniaji has also won the gold medal in the Para Athletics Grand Prema Discussion Frank in Berlin and along with Sunder Singh Gurjar also won the gold medal in Bhalafang.
My dear countrymen, several events in the history of August are full of festivals but sometimes diseases also enter home due to heat.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for this month of August that has inspired patriotism, and for many festivals that have been going on for centuries.
Once again I will definitely meet for Mann Ki Baat.
Thanks a lot.
Just a few days ago, a historic cricket match was held in Bengaluru.
You must have understood a little that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan's first international match and it is a matter of pride for Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two teams performed well in this match and Rasheed Khan, the other Afghan speaker from Afghanistan, performed well in the IPL this year. And I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, had tagged me on his Twitter, the people of Afghanistan are very proud of his hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to showcase their skills.
Rasheed represents the best in Afghanistan.
It is the world's asset of cricket and at the same time he wrote in a funny manner that no one should give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us.
It is very natural to remember because this was the first match but I will remember that match for some special reason.
The Indian team did something that is an example for the entire world.
He did what a winning team could do while taking the trophy of the Indian team.
During the trophy of the Indian team, the Afghan team, which was playing the international match for the first time, invited the Afghanistan team and posted photos with both the teams.
We can experience what is the sportsman spirit, what is the sportsmanship.
Sports is a very good way to unite society and discover the talent that is there in our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan teams.
I hope that we will play with each other in the same way as well as with the entire sportsman spirit.
My dear countrymen, this is the fourth Yoga Day on 21st June.
The whole world is at once seen.
Be it the Europian Parliament in Brussels or the United Nations Headquarters in New York, or the Japanese Naval Ships, everywhere people were seen performing Yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic Yoga programme and I was told that the women did the demonstration of several asanas.
On the high Berfila peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed Yoga together.
Yoga works to break and connect all boundaries.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries went beyond all forms of discrimination - caste, religion, region, colour or sex and made this occasion a grand festival.
If people from all over the world were enthusiastic and participating in Yoga Day programmes then why should not it be enthusiastic in India
It is a matter of pride for the country when 1. 25 billion people see that our country's security forces have studied Yoga in all the three places of Navy, Army and Air Force.
Some brave soldiers performed yoga somewhere in Sabarina and some soldiers performed Yoga on the snowy mountains in Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force embarrassed everyone by performing Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet between the sky and the earth.
The sight was that he did not sit in the plane but did Yoga in the air.
Whether it is school, college, office, park, high building or field of sports, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
A sight of Ahmedabad was touching the heart.
About 50 Divyang brothers and sisters have established the world Kirtiman by doing Yoga at one place.
I believe that Ajayog is working on a wellness, revolution.
I hope that the movement of wellness from yoga will go forward.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives.
Many people have written to me on MyGov and Narendra Modi App that this time I will talk about Doctors Day in Mann Ki Baat on 1st July.
We remember the doctor in difficult times, but this is a day when the country celebrates the achievements of our doctors and thanks them immensely for their service and dedication towards society.
We are the people who worship God as God, who believe in God as God, because mother gives us life.
Mother gives birth to us, and sometimes a doctor gives us re-born.
The role of a doctor is not confined to treating diseases only.
Today doctors not only have medical expertise but they also have a lot of experience about the impact on our health.
Indian doctors have made their mark all over the world with their capabilities and skills.
In the Medical Profession, along with Maharath, Hardwarking, we are also known for solving our doctor complex medical problems.
With the help of Mann Ki Baat, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all our doctors on behalf of every Indian.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate people who have been born in this land of India.
India has been a prosperous history when there is no such month, no such day in which there is no historical event.
Look, every place in India has its own heritage.
There are some saints, some great man, some famous person, everyone has his own contribution, he has his own greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, you would be aware of Gujarat's KabirVad.
When I was working there, I had done a very big national session of the people associated with the tradition of Saint Kabir.
You people know why Kabirdas ji had come to Maghar
At that time there was a belief that those who die in Maghar do not go to heaven.
The body that leaves it in a narrow bottle goes to heaven.
Maghar was considered infamous but Sant Kabirdas did not believe in it.
He worked to break the same beliefs and superstitions of his time and hence went to Maghar and saluted them there.
Sant Kabirdas ji emphasized on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his witnesses and compassion.
They were their ideals.
We see these ideals in their creations and inspire them in today's era.
One of his friends is: - Kabir Soi Peer Hai, if you don't live on the nerves, Soka Peerte means that the true Peer Sant is the one who knows and understands the pain of another, who doesn't know the pain of another, he is desperate.
Kabirdas ji gave special emphasis on social equality.
He used to think far ahead of his time.
At a time when the world was falling and the time of conflict was going on, he gave a message of peace and harmony and worked to remove the differences of opinion among the people.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God.
Wherever he went, he took several initiatives for the betterment of the society.
A system of cooking free from social discrimination where people of every caste, sect, religion or community can come and eat, Guru Nanak Dev had started this anchor system.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2017.
I want all of us to join it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
I also urge you people to think about how to celebrate Guru Nanak Dev Jis 550th Prakash Parv in the entire society and around the world, how new ideas, new ideas and new ideas, how to think about new ideas, how to prepare them and with great pride all of us can make this Prakash Parv an inspiration.
India's freedom struggle is very long, very wide and full of innumerable martyrs.
It is a history associated with Punjab.
In 2017, that horrific incident of the Jallianwala Bagh was also completing 100 years, which had put humanity in shame.
Who can forget the dark day of April 13, 11, when pills were carried out on innocent, unarmed and masses by crossing all limits of cruelty using power.
Victory is always about peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Raman Kumar from Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that Dr.
ShyamaprasadMukherjee's birthday and he wants Dr.
Talk to the countrymen about Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
Raman ji first thank you very much.
It was very good to see you in India's history.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields but the areas that were closest to him were education, administration and parliamentary affairs.
Very few people would be aware that Kolkata was the youngest Vice Chancellor of the University.
On the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed Convocation at Kolkata University in Bangladesh.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industry Minister of India and in a sense he had laid the foundation stone of India and industrial development, had built a strong base, had developed a strong platform.
The first Industrial Policy of India, which came into being in 1948, brought out the print of his ideas and vision.
Mukherjee had dreamt that India should be industrially self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every field.
He wanted India to develop big industries and also focus on MSMEs, handicrafts, textiles and cottage industries.
The All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handicrafts Board, All IndiaHandloom Board and Khadi Village Industries Board were established between 148 to 150 for better development of cottage and small enterprises.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee had a huge contribution.
He was dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
As a result of their understanding, wisdom and activity, a part of Bengal can be saved and today it is a part of India.
Dr.
Remembering the message of unity of Shyamaprasad Mukherjee, let us be associated with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and for the progress of India.
My dear countrymen, in the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video call.
I got the opportunity to know directly from them about the changes that are taking place in the lives of people ahead of the files.
People talked about their resolve, their happiness and their achievements.
Girls in far-flung villages are providing services ranging from pension to passports to old people through common service centres.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh collects sitafal and does business by making it ice cream.
Like the Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing affordable medicines in nearby villages.
I don't know how many things were there, there is no point in the country where people don't have to talk about their success.
In such a scenario, when the common man comes up with new hopes, new zeal and incidents that have come down in his life then he is not the leader of the government.
Even a small girl from a remote village becomes an inspiration for 1. 25 billion Indians.
With the help of technology, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been extremely pleasant and inspiring and it not only gives me satisfaction to work but also encourages to work more.
There is a new joy, a new enthusiasm and a new inspiration to give life to the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined this video bridge program and you have done the job of giving me new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you.
I always feel that if we look around us then something is good somewhere or the other.
There are people who do good.
We can also experience the aroma of goodness.
In the past, one thing has come to my mind and it is a unique combination.
While there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
Now you would be wondering what is the relation between these two very different businesses
However, it is such that corporate professionals and IT engineers have come together in Bengaluru and they have made a simple prosperity trust and they have activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
He joined the farmers and made plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Today, they are not only growing vegetables but also getting marketing of their vegetables through trust.
Farmers who produce grains are also associated with it.
On the one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing and on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure that farmers share in profits.
I thank these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am glad that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, technocrats and engineering have adopted the path of connecting the farmers outside their borders, connecting the villages and connecting the fields.
Once again, I would like to share with the young generation of my country their innovative experiments, I might not have known anything, some might not have known, some might not have known, but millions and millions of people are doing something good.
GST will complete one year.
The dream of the people of the country One Nation, One Tax has changed in reality today.
One nation, one tax reform, if I have to give credit to the maximum number of people then I give credit to the states.
GST is a very good example of cooperative federalism where all the states together took decisions in the countryside and then such a huge tax reform was implemented in the country.
Till now, two meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can take pride in the fact that people from different states sit there, people from different states sit there, people from different states have different priority but in addition to all the decisions taken in the GST Council till now, all these decisions have been taken with unanimous consent.
Before GST, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is being implemented in the entire country.
GST is a victory of integrity and a festival of integrity.
Earlier, there were frequent complaints from the Inspector State regarding tax matters in the country.
With the introduction of GST, check posts have been stopped and the movement of goods has accelerated. This not only saves time but also benefits the logistics sector.
Perhaps GST is the world's largest tax reform.
Such a massive tax reform in India was successful because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST was ensured through Jan Shakti.
It is generally believed that such a big reform, such a large country, such a large number of people takes 5 to 5 years to stabilize them completely. However, the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the festival of honesty is the result of the participation of the people of the country.
It has been dedicated to 1. 25 billion Indians.
Once again, after completing Mann Ki Baat, I have been waiting for Mann Ki Baat to meet you, to talk to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaste
Once again I got the opportunity to be present before you through Mann Ki Baat.
You must be well aware that a group of six women commanders of the Navy had been on a sea trip for several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama ji, I would like to talk about it.
These six daughters of India, their team have returned to India on 21st May after travelling across the world through the sea for more than four days and welcomed them very warmly.
He travelled across different oceans and many seas, cutting the distance of about twenty two thousand nautical miles.
This was the first such event in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters and hear their experiences.
If we want to travel to the development of the human race, progress has emerged from some or the other adventure.
In the past, you must have seen that some new things have been taken into account for those who have been roaming around the Mount Everest and for centuries the people of Everest have been challenging the human race and the brave people have been accepting that challenge.
On 16th May, a group of five tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakanth Madvi, Kavidas Kathmode, Vikas Soyam, embarked on the worlds highest peak.
I congratulate the people of Chandrapur, my small friends and heartiest congratulations.
At present, the 16-year-old Shivangi Teacher became the youngest Indian woman to be Everest on behalf of Nepal.
Congratulations to Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya Everest became the first Indian father-son to surrender.
It is not that only the youth are roaming Everest.
Sangeeta Saheb marched to Everest on 1st May and Sangeeta Bahl is more than 50 years old.
There are also some people who have demonstrated that they have not only skills but also sensitivity.
For years, people have been roaming around Everest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I heartily congratulate all these entrepreneurs, especially daughters.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, when I talked about Fit India a couple of months ago, I didn't think that it would get such a good response.
Such a large number of people from all walks of life will come forward in support of it.
When I talk about Fit India then I believe that the country will play as much as we play.
On social media, people are sharing fitness challenges and tagging each other.
Today everybody is joining this campaign of Fit India.
Whether it is the people associated with the film, the people associated with the sports world, the common man of the country, the army personnel, the school teachers, the entire echo is echoing around - Hum Fit to India Fit.
It is a matter of happiness for me that Captain Virat Kohli of the Indian Cricket Team has given me the challenge and I have accepted that challenge.
I believe that this is a very good thing and this kind of challenge will inspire us to keep fit and fit others.
Chhavi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that the sports that used to be a part of the lives of every child, the streets and the streets are going to be lost today.
These games were specially part of summer vacations.
There are two types of games in traditional sports.
It is outside the house as well as inside the house.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in this game.
The same game is known by different names in different places.
I belong to Gujarat.
I know that there is a game in Gujarat.
It is played with codes or seeds or pieces of Ambali and with a square board of 88.
This game was played in almost every state.
We were also playing this game.
Who will be amongst us who has not played Moi Dandiya in his childhood
Moi Dandiya (Gilli Danda) is playing from villages to cities.
It is known by different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
In Orissa it is called Gulibari and in Maharashtra it is called Vittidalu.
Some sports had their own climate.
Like there is also a season to chew kites.
When all kites fly, when we play, we can demonstrate the unique virtues we have in us.
You must have seen that many kids are temperate, but they become very thrilled while playing.
They express themselves, the big ones who look serious, the child who is hidden in them while playing goes out.
Traditional sports have been created in such a way that along with physical capabilities, our rational thinking, concentration, awareness and zeal are also greater.
From children to grandparents, grandparents and grandparents, whenever there is a romance then what is called a papaya is called a journal or a journal goes away somewhere.
Many sports also make us aware about society, environment etc.
Today, it is necessary that schools, shrines, youth organisations etc. come forward and promote these sports.
We can make a huge archive of our traditional sports by crowd sourcing.
My dear countrymen, the next five years, our country will officially host the World Environment Day celebrations.
This is an important achievement for India and is a testimony to Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change.
This time the theme is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to all of you to understand the spirit of this theme and its importance to ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on our wildlife and on our health.
Go to the World Environment Day website wed-india 2018 and see that many suggestions have been made there in a very interesting manner, and try to bring them back to their daily lives.
When there is extreme heat, when there is floods, when there is no name for stopping rains, when there is extreme cold then everybody talks about global warming, climate change, but what does it work
In the last few weeks, we have seen that there has been dust-blown rain in different parts of the country along with heavy winds.
There was loss of lives and loss of lives.
All these things are essentially the result of the changes in the climate drive.
Our culture, our traditions have not taught us to struggle with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature and live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi narrated this in his own way to tackle the menace of life.
When India played a key role in the CoP21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the entire world through the International Solar Alliance, it was in all its roots that Mahatma Gandhis dream was realised.
On this environment day, let us all think about whether we can do something to keep our planet clean and green.
How can we move forward in this direction
Can we become innovative
We can set a target of providing record trees this time and not only planting trees but also maintaining them until they grow up.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends
You must remember that on 21st June, not only you, but the entire world will remember on 21st June.
21st June is celebrated as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparations months ago.
Today, there are reports that in the entire world, preparations are being made to celebrate 21st June as International Day of Yoga.
Yoga for Unity and Harmonios Society is a message that the world has experienced repeatedly in the last few years.
Yoga leads to courage, which protects us like a Said Father.
A feeling of forgiveness arises as if a mother belongs to her children and mental peace becomes our lasting friend.
Bharathuri has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our children, our sisters, our spiritual brothers, the earth itself becomes our bed and our knowledge becomes hungry.
When all these qualities become a partner, the Yogi triumphs over all kinds of fears.
Once again I urge the countrymen to build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation ahead of our heritage of Yoga.
Today is 2nd May, the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Pandit ji.
The memory of this month of May is also associated with another thing and that is Veer Savarkar.
This was my month in 1985 when the Indians showed their strength to the British.
Our soldiers and farmers showed their bravery in many parts of the country were committed against injustice.
Sadly, for a long time, we used to call the 185 incidents a mere rebellion or a sepoy insurrection.
In fact, if this incident was observed in a negligible manner then it was also an attempt to push our self-respect.
It was Veer Savarkar who fearlessly wrote that whatever happened in 1985 was not a rebellion but the first war of independence.
The brave Indian House of London, including Savarkar, celebrated its 50th anniversary with pomp and show.
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the month in which the freedom struggle started before independence.
Savarkar jis personality was full of specialties
He was a devotee of both armament and science.
Generally, Veer Savarkar is known for his bravery and his struggle against the British Raj, but apart from that, he was also an illustrious poet and social reformer, who always emphasized the spirit of goodwill and unity.
A wonderful description of Savarkar ji has been made by our beloved respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Atal ji had done so much painting.
Savarkar carried both poetry and revolution.
Along with being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary.
Our daughters, who were compelled to buy garbage from their homes, are now learning the work of sewing and wearing clothes to cover the fold of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters, full of hope and confidence, for their bright future.
He has shown that success can be achieved even in the midst of all odds, if you are determined to do something.
And this is not just a matter of Sikar but you will see all this in every corner of India.
If you look at the neighborhood then it will be seen how people overcome the problems.
You must have experienced that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some of the people present here.
These discussions are also of politics, social, movies, sports and sportspersons as well as of the problems faced by the country- such problems should be solved in such a way - but most of these things remain confined to discussions only. But there are people who move forward in the direction of bringing about change with their work, their hard work and their relationship.
Shriman D.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the past five decades.
Today, you will be surprised to know that more than 70 children are filling their lives with education.
He opened a school called Asha Ashwasan for children living in slums, wherein he spends 50 of his income on selling poor tea.
It provides education, health and food to all the children coming to the school.
I am D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his hard work, his relationship and giving a new direction to the lives of the poor children.
He has defeated the darkness of his life.
Who does not know this version of Thamso Ma Jyotirgamya, but has shown it to live.
Prakash Rao.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the entire nation.
There will be a series of such inspirational events around you.
There will be innumerable incidents.
Let us move forward with positiveness.
There is so much heat in the month of June that people are waiting for rain and in the hope of looking at the blue sky in the sky.
People will also wait for the moon after a few days from today.
The meaning of seeing the moon is that Eid can be considered.
The festival of Id after a month of fasting during Ramzan marks the beginning of the celebration.
I am confident that all the people will celebrate Id with full enthusiasm and especially children will get good inspiration on this occasion.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of goodwill in our society.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
One countries of the world, including India, participated in it.
When such a grand event is organised, thousands of sportspersons from all over the world are participating in it, can you imagine what kind of atmosphere it is
Emotions, emotions, enthusiasm, hopes, aspirations, aspirations and aspirations - who can keep it away when there is such a climate
Our sportspersons also performed well in the hopes of our countrymen and won a medal one after another.
Be it hooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton, India has performed a record.
26 Gold, 20 Silver and 20 Bronze India has won 66 Medals.
This success makes every Indian proud.
It is a matter of pride and happiness for the medal winners.
It is a festival of great pride for the entire country, for all the countrymen.
Perhaps the words will also be reduced to express this feeling.
But I would like to listen to you from these players.
That is, there were several things this time, which happened for the first time.
Do you know that all the doctors from India have won medals in the Commonwealth Games this time
Manika Batra won medals in all the events that Manika Batra took.
She is the first Indian woman to win Indias Gold in the Individual Table Tennis.
India has the largest medals shooting.
Indian Para Power-lifter is the only Indian medal winner in the Sachin Chaudhary Commonwealth Games.
The games of this time were special because most of the medal winners were women athletes.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting or shooting, women sportspersons have done amazingly.
In Badminton, only two Indian players Saina Nehwal and P.
V.
Indus had happened.
Athletes participating in the Games came from different parts of the country, from small towns.
They also contribute to their friends who retained their courage in every situation.
I congratulate all of them along with those players.
Last month, during Mann Ki Baat, I had called for Fit India with my countrymen, especially with our youth. And I had invited everyone to join Fit India and lead a Fit India.
A gentleman, Mr. Shashikant Bhonsle has written in a swimming pool sharing one of his photographs that My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written - I feel myself happy and healthy through the morning walk.
And it further says - Four me - fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt that there is a lot of fitness in Devnathji.
Cine artist Akshay Kumar has posted a video on the Twitter.
Many other youngsters have also shared their experiences by connecting with Fit India efforts.
I believe that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
21st June is the majesty of International Yoga Day and now the whole world has accepted it.
You should also prepare from today.
And you must have seen that an animated video in which I have been told is becoming very popular.
My young friends, you will now be in the midst of anxiety about holidays after getting out of the dizziness of exam, exam and exam.
How to observe holidays and where to go
Outside the four walls, paperwork provides an opportunity to live and experience life away from computers.
My young friends, today I urge you for a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, be it Sports, HRD or the Department of Drinking Water - the Ministry of three-fourths of the Government has launched a Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
The college students, the NCC youth, the youth of NSS, the youth of Nehru Yuva Kendras who want to do something for the society, the country and the country, the students who want to learn something in the transformation of the society, who want to make an appointment in the society, who wants to get rid of something in the society with a positive energy, all of them have this opportunity. And when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will be happy to do something before and I will also tell you that the best be the best performer in the college, who has done the best work in the college, all of them will be awarded at the national level.
This internship will be given a certificate by Swachh Bharat Mission to every successful intern.
Not only that, the interns that will complete it very well, the UGC will also provide them two credit points.
Once again I invite students, students and youngsters to take advantage of it for internships.
You can register for the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship by visiting MyGov App.
I hope that our youth will further pursue this movement of cleanliness.
I also want to know about your efforts.
Your-Maidens must send stories, send photos, video.
Let us make this holiday an opportunity to learn a new experience.
I have seen that in the past, he was talking about the youth of Delhi who are selfless about the education of poor children.
This campaign, which started from 15 children in slums near the Gita Colonies of Delhi, is now connected to 12 thousand children in the capital today.
Youths and teachers associated with this campaign are engaged in this tireless effort of social change by removing free time of 2 hours from their busy schedule.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become an inspiration for the farmers across the country.
His organised efforts have changed not only the fate of his own but also of his own field.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand is mainly the crop of ragi, rajgra, maize or barley.
Being a hilly area, farmers cannot afford the right value.
But instead of selling the crop directly into the market, the farmers of Capkot taluka adopted the path of value addition and adopted the path of value addition.
He started making biscuits from this fertilizer and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative institution in Munar village and have also started a biscuit manufacturing factory.
Seeing the courage of the farmers, the system has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being transported not only to fifty Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kaushalya.
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has reached to Rs. 10-15 lakhs, but at the same time, more than 100 families have also been forced to go out of the district due to employment opportunities.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there is a need to war with water in the world in the future.
Everyone says this, but is it our responsibility or not
Do we not think that conservation of water should be that social responsibility
Over the centuries, our ancestors have shown this thing alive.
He gave priority to Mahatma Gandhi, one drop of water.
They have discovered new ways to save one drop of water .
Some of you who might have got the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu, there are temples in Tamil Nadu where irrigation system, water conservation system and drought management have been written in the big temples.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will get to see big instruments everywhere.
If you go to Rajasthan then you must visit Chand Baw in Jodhpur.
It is one of India's largest and most beautiful habitats and it is worth noting that it is in the region where water scarcity remains.
April, May, June and July are such a time that there is an excellent opportunity to store rain water and if we make preparations in Advanced then we get the benefit.
The MGNREGA budget also works for water conservation.
Everyone has made their own efforts in the direction of water conservation and water management during the last three years.
Approximately 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water management from the MGNREGA budget every year.
In the year 2017-18, I have been spending about 55 of the total expenditure of Rs. 64 thousand crore, or about Rs. 35 thousand crore on water conservation.
Over the last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted in large quantity through these types of water conservation and water management measures.
The MGNREGA budget for water conservation and water management has been immensely benefitted by some people.
The people who worked for thousands of MNREGA on the river Kuttumperur in Kerala revived the river by working hard for 70 days.
Ganga and Yamuna are water-filled rivers but there are some areas in Uttar Pradesh as well as two small rivers named Sasur Khadari of Fatehpur district have dried up.
The district system has expedited a number of soil and water conservation works under MGNREGA.
With the help of the people of about 40-45 villages, the river Khadari which had dried up has been revived.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, agriculture, villages, this is a great success.
I would like to say that once again April, May, June and July are before us, let us take any responsibility for water conservation, let us also formulate some schemes.
When Mann Ki Baat is there then I get messages from all sides, letters and phone calls.
We celebrate Ravindra Jayanti every year, but many people do not know about the philosophy of the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore's peacefully, beauty and integrity.
In the Mann Ki Baat programme, discuss the subject so that people can know about it.
I thank Ayanji that the attention of all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat has attracted this attention.
Gurudev Tagore was a person full of wisdom and wisdom, which left an indelible mark on everyone.
Rabindranath was a brilliant personality, a multi-dimensional personality, but one of his teachers could experience it every moment.
He wrote in lyrics, "He, who has the knowledge has the responsibilities to impart to the students.
I don't know the Bangladeshi language, but when I was small, I had a very early habit - from childhood and from East India the radio starts very soon.
When the delays started in western India, I was supposed to be in the morning till about 5:30 in the morning, Rabindra Sangeet started, I used to have a habit on the radio.
I was used to listening to Rabindra Music early in the morning when I got the opportunity to listen to these poems like Anandlok and Agunar and Poreshmoni.
You too must have influenced his poems and poetry by Ravindra Music.
I offer my homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated with full respect and respect all over the world.
The social aspect of daily life is that when a person is hungry then he also feels hungry for others.
When he is thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an occasion to recall the teachings and messages of Pyagbar Mohammad Sahib.
It is our responsibility to walk from their lives on the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a person asked Pyagbar Sahib, what is the best work in Islam
Pyagmber Saheb said - Bringing a poor and needy person and meeting everyone with goodwill, whether you know him or not.
He believed in knowledge and compassion.
He was not arrogant.
He used to say that egoism alone defeats knowledge.
Payagambar Mohammad Saheb believed that if you have more than required goods then it is important for you to give it to a needy person and therefore donation in Ramzan is also very important.
People donate money to the needy in this holy month.
Payagambar Mohammad Saheb believed that a person is infinitely affluent with his soul, not with wealth and wealth.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showed the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions around the world.
This Buddha Purnima recalls the responsibility of all of us to remember Lord Buddha, to walk on his path, to make a solemn pledge.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are human values that require the highest in the world today.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar asserted that Lord Buddha was inspired by his social philosophy.
Baba Saheb had empowered millions of people, be it Dalits, oppressed, deprived or underprivileged through the Constitution.
This cannot be a big example of compassion.
This compassion for the suffering of the people was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries and they used to follow the rich ideas of Lord Buddha and it was happening every time.
We have inherited the teachings of Lord Buddha throughout Asia.
This tradition of Buddha is associated with us in many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar. And that is why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist Tourism, which connects important places of South-East Asia to Indias special Buddhist destinations.
I am also glad that the Government of India is a part of the reconstruction of several Buddhist temples, including the centuries old magnificent Ananda Temple in Myanmar.
Today, everywhere in the world, there is a feeling of intimidation and human suffering and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to eradicate hatred.
I wish Buddha Purnima all those who have faith in the principles of compassion and have faith in Lord Buddha spread across the world.
I seek blessings from Lord Buddha for the entire world so that we can fulfill our responsibility to build a peaceful and compassionate world based on their teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Lafing Buddha, it is said that Lafing Buddha brings good luck but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in Indias defence history.
You would be wondering what is the relationship between smiling Buddha and India's military power
You must remember that 20 years ago, on the evening of 11th May, 18th, the then Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji addressed the nation and his words filled the country with pride, valour and happiness.
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 18th May, atomic tests were conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan on the western side of India.
Indias testing was successful and in a way, India showcased its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked as an exhibition of its military power in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has told the world that the power of inner strength, inner strength is essential for peace.
Similarly, when you are strong as a nation, you can remain peaceful with everyone.
The month of May, 18 is not important for the country only because atomic tests were conducted in this month, but the way it was done is important.
He showcased the entire world that Indias land is a land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can scale new heights and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra: Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan.
In view of this, we will also be able to enjoy the journey that Atal ji had started, we will also be able to enjoy it.
My dear countrymen, when I meet again in Mann Ki Baat, I will talk about more.
Thanks a lot.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the auspicious festival of Ram Navami.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Ram Navami.
We have seen in his life the power of Ram in the life of venerable Bapu.
In the past 26 January, when all the dignitaries of ASEAN countries were present here, they had brought a cultural troop with them and it is a matter of great pride that most of these countries were presenting the Ramayana before us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are producing equal inspiration and influence not only in India but also in ASEAN countries in this part of the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, this time too, I have received all your letters, e-mails, phone calls and comments in large numbers.
I read what Kamal Thakkarji wrote about the online correspondence of Sanskrit on MyGov.
It was a great pleasure to see your love for Sanskrit along with being an IT professional.
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about the efforts being made in this regard.
I would also appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat who work in the context of Sanskrit, to think about what can be done with reference to Kamal ji.
Mr. Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Baraker, District Nalanda, Bihar, you read the comments on NarendraModiApp.
The concern that you have expressed on the decreasing ground water level is very important.
ShrimanNalShastriji, Karnataka
You have also urged everyone to keep water for the animals in the summer summer.
I have conveyed your feelings to all the listeners.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji, he says that I talk to the youth about their health this time.
They feel that our youth is physically weak in comparison to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time we should talk to everyone in detail about health - Fit India.
And you can also drive the Fit India movement along with all the youngsters.
During his visit to Kashi, the French President has written to Mr. Prashant Kumar of Varanasi that all the visions of this visit were touching, impressing.
And he urged that all the photographs, all the videos should be published on social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had put these pictures on social media and NarendraModiApp on that day.
Now, please lick them and retweet them, send them to your friends.
From Chennai, Andha, Jayesh and many children have written to me about the Gratitude Cards behind the book Exam Warrior.
And, yes, I would like to tell all the children that your letters drive away the tiredness of my day.
All these letters, all these phone calls, comments, whatever I have read from them, all these things have been heard and there are many things that have touched my mind. Even if I talk about them then perhaps for months I will have to keep saying something continuously.
This time most of the papers are children who have written about examinations.
He spoke of his plans for holidays.
Water is anxious for animals and birds during summer.
Farmers have received letters from brothers and sisters regarding Kisan Melas and farming activities across the country.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions on water conservation.
Our festivals, our culture, our traditions are shared during the festivals.
That is, the things of our mind also change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the things of our minds change somewhere in the life of somebody.
And why not
In these things, in your experiences, in these examples, all the inspirations, all the energy, all the intimacy and the country has the courage to do something.
They have the power to change the weather throughout the country.
When I get to read in your letters how Ahmed Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karimganj in Assam, has built nine schools for poor children through his will power, then this country's indomitable will power is visible.
In his mission, Saddule collected money through home sales and donations.
Several travellers who travelled in their cab donated freely.
An engineer girl gave her first pay
Thus, after twelve years of collection of money, Sadul Laskar brought the colour of his efforts and today due to his hard work and determination, he has become a 30-bedded hospital in Punari village near Kolkata.
This is the strength of a New India.
Today, the vision of India has changed the world over.
Today, in the entire country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, in every class, this belief has been raised that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward.
A positive atmosphere of hope and aspirations has been created.
This self-confidence, this positiveness will fulfil our resolution of a New India and will fulfil our dreams.
My dear countrymen, for the next few months, it is very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why several letters have come in the context of agriculture.
This time, I also saw a video of the discussions with the farmers on Doordarshan's DD Kisan channel and I feel that every farmer should connect with this DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan and should look at it and implement the experiments in his field.
Be it Mahatma Gandhi or Shastri Ji or Lohiaji or Chaudhary Charan Singh ji or Chaudhary Devi Lal ji, all considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and common mans life of the country.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastriji reiterated the need for conservation of plants, trees and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of mass movement on a large scale to ensure better income for our farmers, better irrigation and all of them, and to increase food and milk production.
In his speech in 1971, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji emphasized the need for farmers to use new technology and innovation.
I went to the Krishi Unnati Mela in Delhi recently.
My interactions with the farmers and the scientists there, knowing about the experiences related to agriculture, knowing about innovations related to agriculture, all this was a pleasant experience for me. But the thing that influenced me the most was the hard work of Meghalaya and the farmers there.
This low-lying state has done a very big job.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have produced record production over the last five years during 2015-16.
He has shown that when the goal is determined, the determination is strong and there is a resolve in the mind, then it can be proved and demonstrated.
Today, the hard work of the farmers is being supported by the technology, which is giving a lot of strength to the agricultural producer.
In the letters that I have received, I was seeing that many farmers had written about the feeling of money and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, A major decision has been taken in this year's budget to provide fair price to the farmers.
It has been decided that the price of support for notified crops will be announced at least one and a half times of their cost.
Efforts are being made to connect the local mandis of the villages with the Wholesale Market and then with the Global Market.
Farmers do not have to go very far to sell their produce so that 22,000 rural haats of the country will be upgraded to the required inter-market and connected to APMC and e-NAM platforms.
That is, in a way, a system is being created for direct connectivity of any market in the country with the fields.
My dear countrymen, this year will mark the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How can the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is not only our resolution, but also how can one and a half crore Indians pay a best tribute to Gandhiji by joining hands
How can we recognise new activities for this
I appeal to all of you to share your thoughts about it with everyone through MyGov.
What is the logo of Gandhi 150
You suggest how slogans or mantras or proclamations are.
Together we have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and take inspiration from him to take our country to new heights.
Thank you, Thank you very much. And I believe that Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat are both complementary to each other.
Today, in the field of health, the country has moved ahead with a conservative approach.
Every work related to health in the country was only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, when all departments and ministries, be it the Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Women Child Development or State Governments, are working together for a healthy India and the emphasis is being laid on affordable health along with the preventive health.
Preventive health care is also the cheapest and the easiest.
And the more we become aware of the preventive health care, the more it benefits the individual, the family and the society.
The first requirement for a healthy life is hygiene.
As a result, sanitation coverage has doubled to nearly 80 in the last four years.
Besides, work is being done at a comprehensive level to create health wellness centres across the country.
It is the result of all of us's commitment that Yoga has become a mass movement today and has reached every household.
The International Yoga Day of this time has saved less than 100 days for 21st June.
On the last three International Yoga Days, people participated in the country and everywhere in the world with great enthusiasm.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends and all for Yoga from now on.
Innovative ways, Yoga has to be popularized in children, in youth, in the elderly, in all age groups, in men or women.
Although the country's TV and electronic media do different programmes in terms of Yoga during the year, but can we create awareness about Yoga in the form of a campaign from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
Yes, I need Yoga professionals but some people have also made me a Yoga teacher through their creativity and made me a 3D Animated Video doing Yoga.
I will share that video with all of you so that we can study asanas, pranayama along with us.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level to ensure that healthcare is within reach and nutritional, affordable and accessible to the common man.
Heart stent prices have been reduced to 85 for heart patients.
The number of MBBS meetings in the prevailing 4 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being set up in different states to provide better treatment and healthcare to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened in each of the three districts.
All of us will see mass efforts to get rid of B.
Years ago, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
For them, industry was an effective medium to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when the Make in India campaign in the country is successfully running, Dr.
Today, the vision of Ambedkar ji, who had dreamt of India as an industrial power, is an inspiration for us.
Today, India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the world's largest foreign direct investment - FDI is coming to India.
The whole world is seeing India as a hub for investment, innovation and development.
This was the idea that the growth of industries would be possible only in the cities due to which Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar relied on urbanization of India.
He did not want a person to lead his life in poverty.
At the same time, he also believed that poverty cannot be eradicated by just sharing the poor.
Today Mudra Yojana, Start Up India, Stand Up India Initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
Babasaheb Ambedkar talked about ports and waterways in the 1930s and 1940s when only roads and railways were being talked about in India.
He is a Dr.
Babasaheb was the one who saw Jal Shakti as a nation power.
He emphasized on the use of water for the development of the country, various river valley authorities, various water related commissions - Babasaheb Ambedkars vision.
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built at various coasts of India and inter-market is being strengthened at old ports.
During the 1940s, most of the discussions took place in the context of the Second World War, the Cold War and the Partition.
Ambedkar in a way laid the foundation of Team India Spirit.
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism, and stressed on working together with the Union and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of Cooperative Federalism, Cooperative Federalism and Competitive Cooperative Federalism in every aspect of governance, and most importantly, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me associated with the backward classes.
He has shown us that it is not necessary for us to move forward that a large or an immortal family is born, but those born in the poor families of India can also dream of, they can strive to fulfil their dreams and succeed.
Yes, it has also happened that many people have visited Dr.
We tried to push them back and we made every possible effort so that the boys of the poor and backward families cannot move forward, nothing can happen and nothing can not be achieved in their lives.
But the pictures of a New India are quite different.
An India that belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the backward.
Under this, there will be separate programmes on Rural Development, Poor Welfare and Social Justice across India.
I urge all of you to take part in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, there will be several festivals in the coming days, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi.
It is a day to remember the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavir on his Jayanti.
The life philosophy of Lord Mahavir Ji, the messenger of non-violence, will inspire all of us.
Greetings to the people of India on Mahavir Jayanti.
The discussion of Easter reminds us of the inspiring teachings of Lord Jesus Christ who gave the message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion to the civilized humanity.
While Punjab and West India will celebrate the festival of Vaisakhi in April, Judicial and Satvini in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and Pola Vaisakh in West Bengal will have joy and joy in these days.
All these festivals are somehow connected with our farming and food providers, through these festivals, we thank nature for the invaluable gifts that we produce.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat February, 2018
My dear countrymen, today Namaskar starts with a phone call Mann Ki Baat.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science and keep writing something about it.
We have seen that the colour of the sea appears blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no colour of water.
Have we ever imagined that whether it is river or sea, why does water become colorful
This question came to the mind of a young boy in the 1920s.
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India.
The name of Raman comes before us.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light skettering.
One of his discoveries is known as "Roman Effect".
We celebrate National Science Day on 28th February every year as it is said that the event of light skating was discovered on this day, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand there has been a tradition of great scholars Bodh Gayana, Bhaskar, Brahmaputra and Aryabhatt on the other hand we are proud of the superb and charaka in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana are Indias pride.
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, the famous particle Boson was also named.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend an event in Mumbai - to inaugurate the reading Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles happening in the field of science.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor, the deprived or the needy.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I had urged the scientific community to help in making the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters easier.
Can Artificial Intelligence facilitate access to healthcare services and modernize diagnostics
A few days ago, with the Israeli Prime Minister, I had the opportunity to attend the inauguration of 'I Create' in Gujarat, Ahmedabad.
There was a young man who developed a digital instrument that if one cannot speak, he is in the interaction while writing his own words through the instrument and he can communicate in the same way as the person who can speak.
I believe that we can use artificial intelligence in many ways.
Science and technology values are indispensable.
It is not good or bad in terms of value.
Any machine will do what we want.
But, it depends on us what we want to do with machines.
Human pursuit becomes important here.
Use of science for the welfare of mankind, experiment to attain the highest levels of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who invented the light bulb, has failed several times in its experiments.
It is a coincidence that today I am in Auroville, the workplace of Maharishi Aurobindo.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
In this way, he questioned every aspect of life as a great saint.
Find answers and wait for humanity.
The emotion of asking questions again and again is important to know the truth.
This is the true inspiration behind scientific research.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I extend my greetings to all our scientists and scientists.
I convey my best wishes to our younger generation, be inspired to discover truth and knowledge and be inspired to serve society with the help of science.
Friends, During the crisis, several times I get many messages about safety and disasters. People keep writing something or the other.
From Pune, Shri Ravindra Singh spoke on the subject of Occupational Safety in his Comment on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He has written that safety parameters on factory and construction sites in our country are not so good.
On the 4th of March, India is the National Safety Day, the Prime Minister spoke of safety in his Mann Ki Baat programme, so that people are aware of safety.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important - one Proactiveness and the other Preparedness.
Safety is of two types - one that is essential on time, safety during distortion and the other that requires daily life, safety in affordable life.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life and cannot achieve it then it becomes difficult to achieve it during disasters.
We have often read the boards written on the roads - 'Vigilance Hatti' - a loss of accidents, a mistake, a joy of snatching away from the world, not to be safe from security, not to be safe from security, not to be affordable, these words have never been used in our life.
We can safeguard our lives if we remain vigilant and comply with the required rules, but we can also use the society with great accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that there are several sources of safety at the work place but whenever we want, we cannot follow it.
I urge the municipalities, municipalities who have Fire Brigade, to go to different schools once in a week or once in a month to drive them in front of school children.
Fear Brigade will also have a habit of being cautious and the new generation also gets its teachings and it does not cost much. In a way, education remains a sequence.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading the country in liquidity management.
Apada Mitra has also been initiated to train volunteers in flood and cyclone hazardous districts.
Training and awareness have a big role to play.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year due to Lou-Heatwave.
Thereafter, workshops were organised for the prevention of NDMAHTVE and campaigned for creating awareness among the people.
A good outcome has emerged from everyones participation.
The death toll from Lou in 2017 was surprisingly reduced to about 20.
It can be observed that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people working in the society, be it social organisations or be it awakening citizens. I want to proclaim those who are deprived of any kind of illness and are engaged in relief and rescue work within the minutes.
And the number of such misconduct heroes is no less.
(BIMSTEC) A Joint Disaster Management Exercise of Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal was also conducted in this country, which was the first and largest human experiment in itself.
We have to become a risk-conscience society.
In our culture, we always talk about values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of safety and safety.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
This means that what was the arrangement for providing information
Because we are not naturally aware and for this, our ears are heard after sitting in the air, but none of us feels that this suggestion is for me.
A unique experience is in every sphere of our life.
We should not think that Safety is for anybody else, if we all become aware of our safety, then the feeling of security of the society is also included.
The GobarDhan scheme aims to clean the villages and generate wealth and energy by converting cow dung and solid waste to compost and bio-gas.
Some European countries and China use cow dung and other biodegradable wastes of animals to produce energy but India is not using its full potential.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, we are now moving in this direction.
The target is to utilize biogas based energy for waste, agricultural waste and kitchen waste.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, in rural India, farmers, sisters and brothers will be encouraged to see cow dung and waste not only as waste but also as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will greatly benefit the rural areas.
It will help in keeping the villages clean, improve livestock health and increase productivity.
Biogas will increase self-sufficiency in energy matters for cooking and lighting.
Farmers and livestock will be helpful in increasing the income.
New jobs will be available for waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc.
An online trading platform will also be created for smooth facilitation of 'Gobar Dhan Yojana' which will connect the farmers with the buyers so that the farmers get the right price for gobar and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially our sisters living in rural India, to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating self help groups and cooperative societies.
I invite you to participate in this movement of Clean Energy and Green jobs and in the direction of converting waste into wealth in your village and making Gobar-Dhan.
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard about music festivals, food festivals, film festivals and festivals.
However, a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, in which the first 'Garbage Festival' was organized in the state.
The objective behind this festival organised by Raipur Nagar Nigam was to create awareness about the various ways of creating awareness about cleanliness and creating awareness about the city's waste.
During this festival, several activities were undertaken, ranging from students to the elderly.
Different types of waste waste waste was created.
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of waste management.
There was a music performance on the theme of cleanliness and Art work was done.
Inspired by Raipur, different types of waste festivals were also held in other districts.
Innovative ideas, discussions and poetry were read by each one of them.
An atmosphere like a festival was created in the context of cleanliness.
Particularly the manner in which schoolchildren took part was amazing.
I congratulate the Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of entire Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which the importance of waste management and cleanliness was displayed in this festival.
International Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
There are many programmes in the country and the world.
On this day, women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the past are also being felicitated with the 'Nar Shakti Puraskar'.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life.
We are a part of that tradition where men were identified by women, Yashodanandan, Kaushalyanandan, Gandhariputra, this was the identity of a son.
Today, our women power has introduced self-confidence and self-confidence with their actions and has made themselves self-reliant.
He has not only taken the country forward but has also taken the country and society forward and taken it to a new destination.
In fact, the dream of a New India is that where women are empowered, strong and equal partners in the overall development of the country.
In the past, a great personality had given me a very beautiful suggestion.
He suggested that there are several programmes to celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, which will honour the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village-city.
And can we talk about a long life in this thing I felt good, I was delivering it to you.
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, about 15 lakh women and 15 lakh women have organized a month-long cleanliness drive.
Beginning 26th January, 2018, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
Can you imagine what a big event this is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is such a power that will transform the cleanliness drive in normal life and the culture of cleanliness into the habit of the common man.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in News that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and there is a lot of joy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all are well aware that Elephanta island is 10 kilometres away from Mumbai in the sea.
I was surprised to know that despite being close to Mumbai and such a huge tourist destination, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years since independence.
For 70 years, the darkness in the lives of the people of Rajbander, Morbandar and Sethbandar, three villages of Elephanta Island, has now become dark and their lives have become illuminating.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am happy that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lighted with electricity.
This is a new beginning not only for electricity but also for development.
What could be the moment of satisfaction and happiness more than that when the lives of the countrymen are illuminated and there is happiness in their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, We just celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now this is the specialty of this month that the golden emergence of the joyful wheat and the glitter of the man whose heart is blossoming with the frozen crops of the month of March.
But all of us are also very fond of this month's Holi festival.
On 2nd March, the entire country will celebrate Holi with joy.
The importance of Holi is equally important because this day is a day to burn and destroy evils in the fire.
Holi is auspicious occasion to be a part of each other's happiness and happiness and convey the message of love unity and brotherhood.
Greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Holi.
May this festival be filled with colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first Mann Ki Baat of 2018 and two days ago, we celebrated the Republican Festival with great enthusiasm and for the first time in history it was such that heads of 10 countries were present at the function.
My dear countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter on the NarendraModiApp and has urged me to touch the topics written in his letter.
He has written that Kalpana Chawla, who lives in the space on February 1, is the death anniversary of Chawla.
He left us in the Columbia Spacecraft accident but inspired millions of youngsters around the world.
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji for starting his long letter with the departure of Chawla.
It is sad for all that we have lost Kalpana Chawla at such a young age, but he has conveyed this message to thousands of youngsters from all over the world, especially India, that there is no limit to women power.
Whether it is desired and determined, if there is a strong desire to do something then nothing is impossible.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that today women in India are progressing rapidly in every sphere and increasing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the honour of women in our country, their place and their contribution in the society has surprised the entire world.
There has been a long tradition of Indian enemies.
Many of India's adversaries have contributed to the creation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreya, there are many names.
Today, we talk of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, but in our scriptures centuries ago, it has been said in Skandapuran: Dasputra Samakanya, Dasputrana Prabharadhan. Yat Fal Palamarthya, Tat Abhya Kanyakaya.
The more virtue it will get from 10 lakhs, the more virtuous it will be from a daughter.
This reflects the importance of women in our society.
And then, in our society, women have been given the status of Shakti.
This woman power binds the entire nation, the entire society, the family, the unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given many more examples.
He has written that it is an inspiration for our brave Defence Prime Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to fly to the Sukoi 30.
He also mentioned that under the leadership of Vrika Joshi, the Indian Navys women crew members are circumnavigating the globe on INSV Tarini.
Three brave women have become Bhavna Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi fighter pilots and are undergoing training in Sukhoi-30.
Under Capacity Building, All Women Crew flew from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and Parat Delhi to Air India Boeing Jet and all the ladies.
Honble President has taken a new initiative in the past.
The President visited a group of exceptional women who showcased the first thing in their respective fields.
This is the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Everest, the first woman train driver of Passenger train, the first woman fighter, the first woman bus driver of the country, the first woman to reach Antarctica, thus the first ladies of every field.
Our women powers have achieved extraordinary achievements and established a record by breaking the root cause of society.
He demonstrated that a new path can be built by crossing all odds and obstacles on the strength of hard work, bond and determination.
A path that will inspire not only our contemporaries but generations to come.
It will fill them with a new zeal and enthusiasm.
A book on Women Secretary, First Ladies has also been prepared so that the entire nation can know about these women powers, take inspiration from their lives and works.
It is also available in the form of e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, women power of the country has an important role to play in the positive transformation in the country and the society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
One railway station and women empowerment, you must be wondering what is the relationship between these two
Mumbai's Matunga station is India's first station with all women employees.
Whether it is a Women Staff or a Commercial Department, a Railway Police, a Ticket Chakra or an Innovator or a Point Person, the staff of more than 40 employees belongs to women.
This time, many people, after watching the Republic Day Parade, wrote on Twitter and on other social media that one of the key features of the parade was the BSF Biker Continent in which all the women were participating.
He was experiencing courageous experiments and was also surprised by the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our women power is leading.
When it comes to tribal women, a definite picture emerges in their minds, with forests, footsteps, and with swords, women walking on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women power has created a new image before the country.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is affected by Maoism, has created a terrible climate of violence, bombs, guns, pistols and Maoists.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant in such a dangerous area by driving e-rickshaws.
In a short span of time, a lot of women have joined it.
On the one hand, while self-employment work has been done to empower them, on the other hand, the image of the affected area of Maoism is changing.
And it is also strengthening the work of conservation of environment.
Over the centuries, continuous efforts have been made at the individual and social level in our country against social evils and evils.
Just a few days ago, Bihar took an interesting initiative.
More than 13,000 kilometers of worlds longest human chain, Human Chain, was built to eradicate social evils in the state.
Through this campaign, people were made aware of the evils of child abuse and burning practices.
The entire state took a pledge to fight against crimes such as dowry and child marriage.
Children, adolescents, youngsters, mothers and sisters, all of them had participated in this gathering.
The human chain, which started from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, has continued to connect to the borders of the State.
In order to benefit all sections of the society in the true sense of development, it is essential that our society is free from these evils.
Let us collectively take a pledge to finish such evils from our society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the governance there and every person involved in the human chain who has taken such a special and comprehensive initiative towards the welfare of the society.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of Mysore and Karnataka has written on MyGov: The cost of medicines used to be Rs. 6000 per month on the treatment of his father.
He did not know about the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Kendra earlier.
But now when they came to know about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they purchased medicines from there, their cost of medicines has come down to 5.
He wished me to talk about it in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that the maximum number of people can know about it and take advantage of it.
For the past few years, many people used to write to me about this issue and used to tell me.
I have also seen several people's videos and social media that have benefitted from this scheme.
And it gives me great pleasure when I get this kind of information.
There is a deep satisfaction.
And I felt very good that Shriman Darshan ji had thought that whatever he had got, he would get it.
The objective behind this scheme is to make Health Care Affordable and to promote Ease of Living.
The medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper by about 50 to 0 of the branded medicines available in the market.
It helps the common man, particularly the senior citizens who take medicines every day.
The generic medicines sold in these are based on the prescribed standards of World Health Organization.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This not only provides affordable medicines but also creates new employment opportunities for the Industrial Entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available on Amrit Stores of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Hospitals.
The only objective behind all this is to make the poorest of the poor elite affordable health service available so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh Narendra Modi has shared a photo on the Mobile App from Maharashtra.
That photo was such that my attention was drawn towards those pictures.
The photo was such that a grandson was participating in the cleaning drive of the Clean Mora river along with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised a cleanliness drive to clean the river Mora under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Morana river had flown for the first 12 months but now it has become a seasonal one.
Other pains are that the river was completely filled with wild wounds, water wells.
A lot of waste was being put on the river and its banks.
Action Plan was prepared and on 13th January, a day before the Makar Sankranti, under the first phase of Mission Clean Morena, two coasts of Morana were cleaned at four kilometres in area.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than a hundred NGOs, college students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters participated in this mission of Mission Clean Mora.
This Swachhata programme was also continued on 20th January, 2018 and I was told that the campaign will run every Saturday morning till the river Mora is completely cleaned.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then there is nothing impossible.
Large changes can be brought about through mass movement.
I express my gratitude to the people of Akola, to the administration of the district and municipal corporation, to all the citizens engaged in making this work a Jan Andolan for their efforts and this effort will also inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you would have heard a lot about the Padma Awards these days.
Newspapers are also attracted to this topic on TV.
But if you look at it carefully then it will be a matter of pride for you people that how great people are amongst us and it will naturally be a matter of pride that how the common man in our country is reaching those heights without any impression.
Every year there has been a tradition of awarding Padma Awards but the entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone.
Transparency has come due to the complete process being online.
In a way, the selection process of the awards has been completely transformed.
Now the significance of the award is not only the identity of the person but the importance of his work is increasing.
You would be happy to know that Aurobindo Ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, dedicated his entire life to making sports for children.
They have been making sports from four decades of waste so that children can get science curiosity.
It is their endeavour to inspire children towards scientific experiments through baker items, for which they are inspiring children by showcasing films made in 18 languages across the country in 3000 schools.
What a wonderful life, a wonderful dedication.
One such thing is that of Karnataka's Sitava Jodti.
They are not called the goddess of women empowerment.
In Belagavi for the last three decades, he has contributed in transforming the lives of countless women.
He had dedicated himself to Goddess at the age of seven but later he spent his entire life for the welfare of Goddesses.
Moreover, he has done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family and tribal family of Madhya Pradesh.
He used to do ordinary work for livelihood but he was fond of making traditional tribal paintings.
Today, due to this hobby, they are respected not only in India but in the whole world.
His pictures have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who brought laurels for India in foreign countries, was recognised as Padmashri.
You will be pleasantly surprised to hear the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutty.
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of leaves of palm in the tribal region between dense forests.
He has built five hundred hectares of medicine on the basis of his memories.
He added that snake charmers can be used to make medicines.
Lakshmiji is continuously serving the society with her knowledge of medicines.
He was honoured with Padma Shri for his contribution to society.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils and vegetables in other households to build a hospital.
When he was 23 years old, his husband died due to lack of treatment and inspired him to become a hospital for the poor.
Today thousands of poor people are being treated freely in their hard worked hospitals.
I am confident that there are many such males and females in our Bahuratna Basundhara whom no one knows or knows.
The Padma Awards are a medium, but I would like to tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who are dedicated to the society around us, who work with some specialty, who have worked for the society sometimes and sometimes should be brought among the society.
They do not work for dignity, but their work inspires us.
Sometimes people in schools, colleges and colleges should listen to their experiences.
Beyond the awards, there should be some effort in the society as well.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
This is the 9th January when the venerable Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
On that day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between India and the Indians living around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, we organized a programme that invites all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin living around the world.
You will be happy to know that in this programme, Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, United Kingdom, Suriname, South Africa and other countries where our original Indian mayor is present, where the original Indian Parliamentarians have participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are not only serving those countries but also enjoying their strong relationship with India. This time, the European Union has sent me to Calander in which he has shown his contribution in diverse fields by Indians residing in various countries of Europe.
Our original Indians, who live in different countries of Europe, who are working in cyber security, who are dedicated to Ayurveda, who donates the minds of the society through their own music and from their poems.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for doing RECOGNISE to the people of Indian origin and through them to inform the people around the world.
30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu who has shown us a new path.
At present, we must take every step as to how true Bapus words were.
If we make a solemn pledge to walk on the path of Bapu, what can be a bigger tribute than what we can do
My dear countrymen, along with congratulations to all of you, I end my speech.
Mann Ki Baat December 2017
This is the last edition of Mann Ki Baat this year and coincidence that today is also the last day of 2019.
We and you have shared a lot of things throughout this year.
Many of your letters, comments and ideas for Mann Ki Baat always bring a new energy to me.
Years will change after a few hours but this sequence of our talk will continue even further.
In the coming year, we will do more innovative things, we will share new experiences.
My best wishes to you all for the year 2018.
Recently, on 25th December, the Blue Festival was celebrated worldwide.
People in India also celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm.
On this occasion of Christmas, we remember the great teachings of all the Christians. And what Isha Christ emphasized was Sewabhava.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values and lived his life on the basis of these values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji, a guru, a poet, a philosopher and a great warrior, worked to inspire people in all these roles.
He fought against persecution and injustice.
He exhorted people to break the barriers of caste and religion.
In these efforts, he had to lose a lot personally.
But he never gave place to the spirit of hatred.
Every moment of his life, the message of love, sacrifice and peace - his personality was filled with great traits.
Let us all take a solemn pledge and take inspiration from the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and from his inspirational life and strive to fulfil his life accordingly.
Those who were born in the year 2000 or after, will become eligible voters from January 1, 2018.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century the New India voters.
I congratulate these youngsters and urge everyone to register as your voters.
The entire India is keen to welcome you as the voters of the 21st century.
As voters of the 21st century, you will also feel proud.
Your vote will become the basis of New India.
Voting power is the biggest power in democracy.
Resolution is the most effective tool for bringing about a positive change in the lives of millions.
However, you can also become the builder of the 21st century India and it is starting from January 1.
And today, in this Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to our glorious youngsters, who are full of energy and determination for 18-25 years.
I am confident that the skills and strengths of these energy-loving youngsters will fulfil our dream of a New India.
When we talk of a New India, a New India that is free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Clean and free from poverty.
New India - where there is equal opportunity for all, where everyones aspirations are fulfilled.
A New India where we are the inspiration for peace, unity and harmony.
My New India Youth should come forward and chant how it will be a New India.
They will also set a path for themselves to connect those who are associated with them and keep on moving forward.
You should also move forward and the country should move forward.
Today, when I am talking to you, I got an idea whether we can organize a mock parliament in every district of India
Where these 18-25 year olds sit together and churn on a New India, find roads and make plans.
How can we achieve our resolutions before 2022
How can we create an India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi had made the freedom movement a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement for the glorious and divine India of the 21st century.
How to achieve Sankalp .
Today, many new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth is coming forward and getting successful.
I would like to know about all these opportunities, how this New India Youth should be found in one place and a system should be created so that at the age of 18, they can easily understand all these things about the world and get the necessary benefits.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had talked about the importance of positiveness.
I recall a shloka of Sanskrit. It means that a person full of enthusiasm is extremely strong because nothing can be done beyond enthusiasm.
There is nothing impossible for a positive and enthusiastic person.
People in English also say - Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.
In Mann Ki Baat last year, I had appealed to the countrymen to share your positive moments of 2019 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am glad that a large number of people gave a very positive response on the social media platform, MyGov and the NarendraModi App.
Lakhs of tweets were received along with Positive India hashtag (PoSI), which reached more than 1. 5 crore people.
In a way, the communication of positiveness that took place in India spread all over the world.
The tweets and responses that came were truly inspiring.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some of the countrymen have shared this year's events that had a special impact on their minds and had a positive impact.
Some people also shared their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I talk to the bodels.
Our insurance was one rupee premium per month.
This was done by my husband and he died in an accident.
We should know what was our situation at that time.
With this help of the government, we have benefitted a lot and I can hold a few meetings.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
Our village has passed National Highway since 2019 from Bhinnar village.
This will improve our roads and also increase our trade.
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja, Area Sadatganj, District Sadhanapur, Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bevan.
There was a problem of water in our area and for the past 40 years we had to depend on the pipeline of Armenia.
Now this pipeline has been made separately - independent.
So all these big achievements are in our year 2017.
There are many people who are doing such things at their own level which are bringing about a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India that we are building together.
Let us enter the New Year with the joys of these small ones, start the New Year and take a strong bulb towards Progressive India from Positive India.
When we talk about positiveness, I also feel like sharing one thing.
Recently, I came to know about the inspiration of the poster of Administrative Service in Kashmir, Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak.
He has secured first place in the examination of the Kashmir Administrative Service outside the brunt of terrorism and hatred.
You would be surprised to know that in the 10th century the terrorists burnt their ancestral homes.
Terrorism and violence were so much that their family had to leave their ancestral land.
For a small child, the atmosphere of so many violence around him was enough to create darkness and bitterness in his heart - but the fig did not let it happen.
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different path for himself - the path of public service.
It crossed the opposite situation and wrote its own story of success.
Today, he has become an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that no matter how bad the situation is, the clouds of despair can also be dispersed through positive actions.
Just last week, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
The zeal, enthusiasm, dreams and when I was listening to them, they want to make progress in what fields of life.
I also got inspiration from the time I spent with those daughters. This is the strength of the country. This is my youth. This is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is talk of famous religious places of the world, not only of our country but also of the Sabarimala temple in Kerala, it is very natural.
Every year crores of devotees come here to seek the blessings of Lord Ayappa Swami in this world famous temple.
Where such a large number of devotees come, where there is such a great importance, there is such a big challenge to maintain cleanliness.
And especially in the area that lies between mountains and forests.
But the Sabarimala temple itself is an example of how this problem can be transformed into a culture, how to find a way out of the problem and how the power of public participation is so strong.
P.
Vijayan, a police officer, launched a programme called 'Punyanam Punakvanam' and launched a voluntary campaign of awareness for cleanliness under the programme.
And this kind of tradition has been created that the journey of those travellers will not be completed unless they do any physical labor in the programme of cleanliness.
There is no big or small in this campaign.
Every traveller, considering a part of the worship of God, gives some time for cleanliness, works and works to eradicate dirt.
Every morning, the scene of cleanliness here is very wonderful and all the pilgrims get involved in it.
Some big CELEBRITY, no rich person, no big officer, every person becomes a part of this 'Punyanam Punakvanam' programme like a common traveler.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
The Swachhta Abhiyan in Sabarimala and the Punyan Punakvanam in it become a part of the journey of every traveler.
There, along with strict vows, cleanliness is also accompanied by a strong resolve.
My dear countrymen, on October 2nd, 2014, we have resolved that the incomplete work of venerated Bapu is Swachh Bharat, an India free from filth.
Revered Bapu continued to strive and strive for this work throughout his life.
And we all decided that when Bapu was 150th birth anniversary, we should do something about giving him a clean India of his dreams.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level across the country towards cleanliness.
Transformation is also taking place due to widespread public participation in rural and urban areas.
Swachh Survekshan 2018, the world's largest survey, will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the achievements of sanitation level in urban areas.
This survey will be conducted in more than four thousand cities with a population of about 40 crore.
The facts that will be examined in this survey include open defecation free in cities, collection of garbage, transportation system for lifting waste, scientific processing of waste, efforts made for behavioural change, capacity building and innovative efforts made for sanitation and public participation for this work.
During this survey, different teams will go and inspection the cities.
He will interact with citizens and react to them.
The Swachhta App will be used and analysis will be carried out in various service places.
It will also be seen whether such arrangements have been made by the cities so that the cleanliness of the city becomes the nature of the people and the city becomes the nature of the city.
Cleanliness should not be the case with the government alone.
Every citizen and civil society also has a huge responsibility.
And I appeal to every citizen to take part in the Swachhta Survekshan in the days to come.
And don't leave your city behind, don't leave behind your lanes.
I am sure that the use of green and blue wastes by separating dry wastes and wet wastes from home has become your habit.
In the Swachhta Survekshan to be held from 4th January to 10th March, 2018, you should not be left behind in this healthy competition of sanitation. It should become a subject of public discussion in every city.
And all of you must have a dream, Our City - Our Efforts, AMRI PRAGATI - Progress of the country.
With this resolution, let us once again recall the revered Bapu and make a solemn pledge for a Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that look very small but as a society our identity is being influenced far and wide.
Today, through this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share one such thing with you.
One thing has come to our notice that if a Muslim woman wants to go for Haj pilgrimage, she cannot go without 'Maharam' or her male guardian.
When I heard about it for the first time, I wondered how this could happen.
Who would have made such rules
Why such a difference
And when I went into its depth then I was disturbed - even after 70 years of independence, we were the people who used to apply such restaurants.
For decades, injustice was being done to Muslim women but there was no discussion about it.
Even in many Islamic countries, this rule is not there.
But in India, Muslim women were not empowered.
And I am glad that our government has focused on it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken such necessary steps and we have defeated this restriction by abolishing the tradition that has been going on for 70 years.
Today, Muslim women can go to Haj without dignity and I am glad that this time around 1300 Muslim women have applied to perform Haj without Mehram and women from different parts of the country - from Kerala to the North have expressed their desire to travel on Haj pilgrimage.
I say with full confidence and I firmly believe that the journey of development of India, the strength of our women power, their talents have moved forward and will continue to move forward.
We must constantly strive to ensure that our women also have equal rights and equal opportunities for men so that they can move forward together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for us.
This time, on Republic Day, there will be not one but ten chief guests.
This has never happened before in the history of India.
2017 has been special for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2017 and completed 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for our Indians that these great leaders of the 10 countries of the world will be present on 26th January.
My dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, in a way our country is a country of festivals.
Perhaps there will be a day in which no festival has been written.
Now we all have accepted Christmas and a new year is going to come.
May the coming year bring joy, happiness and prosperity for all of you.
Let us all move ahead with new zeal, new enthusiasm, new zeal and new resolve.
The month of January is the time for the sun to rise and Makar Sankranti is celebrated in this month itself.
Lohri is enjoyable in Punjab and North India, while UP-Bihar is awaiting khichdi and swimming revolution.
Say Sankranti in Rajasthan, Magh-Bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu, this festival is special in itself and it has its own importance.
Each festival is celebrated from 13th to 17th January.
The names of these festivals are different, but their roots are the same - linkages with nature and agriculture.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens on these festivals.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, countrymen.
Now we will talk again in 2018.
Thank you.
It was such a conversation that talks with a lot of enthusiasm, younger brothers and sisters.
Listen to the fact that even in this phase of AYUSH, Lata Didi is eager for all the things related to the country. And the satisfaction of life is also in India's progress.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam.
I am speaking Narendra Modi.
Lata Didi: Namaskar
Modiji: I did the phone because this time on your birthday...
When will you go and retreat
Modi ji: I will come back at 28th late at night and on 22nd at dawn and then it will be your birthday.
Lata ji: There are many people in the age but it is a big thing to get the blessings of those big ones who are bigger than their own work.
Modi ji: Didi, you are a very old man in your age and you are a big man in your work and you have achieved this goal by doing meditation and penance.
Lataji: Yes, I think that my parents have blessings and the audience has blessings.
I'm nothing.
Modi ji: Yes, today it is your humility, it is a great education for all of our new generations.
It is a great inspiration for us that despite all these clearances in our lives, the values and humility of your parents have always been given priority.
Lataji: G.
And I am glad that when you proudly say that your mother was a Gujarati.
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you ji: Give me something Gujarati.
I know that India's picture is changing due to your arrival and I am very happy with that.
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I see how busy you are and how much work you are doing.
What do we have to think
When you visited your mother's footsteps, I also sent someone to see her and took her blessings.
Modi ji: Yes.
My father was very happy because of your love.
Modi ji: But the time was so busy that I could not come.
Modi ji: But I will come very soon.
It will be my privilege.
Modi ji: Pranam Didi.
Lataji: Thank you very much.
Modi ji: Pranam ji.
My dear countrymen, the atmosphere of festivals will once again be filled with new zeal, new energy, new enthusiasm and new resolve.
Festivals are celebrated by N.
Festivals will be thrilling throughout the country for the next several weeks.
The house will be filled with happiness.
Perhaps it is not just a word, it is an order for all of us, it is a philosophy, it is an inspiration.
In some households, sweets get spoilt, while in some households, children go for sweets.
This is the land of Diu.
The real joy of these festivals is when this darkness is lightened when it is lightened.
We should also share happiness where there is a lack of happiness and it should also be our nature.
Let us also think of providing sweets, clothes and gifts to each other in our homes where delivery takes place.
Let us share such things in our homes that we don't work in a big way.
In many cities, the start-ups of young friends of several NGOs are doing such a thing.
He collects clothes, sweets, jewellery, everything from the homes of the people and discovers and delivers it to the needy.
Can we eradicate the darkness of this diwa with full awareness and determination in this festival
Your face will be shining, your happiness will double on the smiths and festivals of several poor families.
Your dedication will become even more illuminated and your Diwali will become more illuminated.
My dear brothers and sisters, Lakshmi ji is coming home in the form of good fortune and prosperity in Deepawali.
Welcome to Laxmiji in a traditional way.
Can we keep this time in our society, in our villages, in the cities and in our cities, in the honour of our daughters
Can we have public programmes
There will be a lot of daughters among us who would have been bringing about the name of the family, society and the country with their hard work and bondage.
Can we programme to honour India's Laxmi on this Diwali
There will be many daughters and daughters around us who are doing extraordinary work.
If a poor child is engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health then a doctor will be serving the society as an engineer.
Being a lawyer, he must have been trying to bring justice to someone.
Our society should identify, honour and take pride in such daughters.
Their honour programmes will be held across the country.
The promotion of India's Laxmi means paving the way for the prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had earlier said that Mann Ki Baat has a great advantage that I have the privilege of directly interacting with a large number of eminent personalities.
I am from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when the results of my exams came, some people asked me to read the Exam Warriors book.
I have not read this book.
But after returning, I read this book and read it twice or thrice.
My experience has been very good about it.
I felt that if I had read this book before examination, I would have had a lot of benefits.
My little student friend, thank you for writing this letter first.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors 2-3 times.
You have said that if I can take time out for a new version then I will definitely try to write something for my parents and teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to share their experiences on the issues related to stressless examinations.
So I will wait for your thoughts.
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend, student Alina Tiang of Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you are also aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of India through newspapers and TV.
But you are aware that I too am an ordinary person like you.
I am an ordinary citizen and that is why the impact of things that happens in a normal life also affects my mind in my life because I too have come from amongst you.
Just a short while ago, he was awarded 1st Grand Salem winner and Tennis legendary Rafael Nadal to the finals.
The audience welcomed their words with warmth.
Despite being defeated in difficult challenges, he praised his rival Nadala and gave a living example of sportsmanship.
However, on the other hand, the winners also appreciated the Daniel Games.
The passion and humility of the winners were both visible in the same match.
If you have not heard the statement of Daniel Medvedev then I will tell all of you, especially the youngsters that you must see this video.
The thoughts of our ancestors are really commendable.
We are said in the scriptures: i.e., when a person has a combination of eligibility and humility, then who cannot win his heart
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, I am doing this directly for your good.
The debate will continue, the party will continue to run, but if some things are stopped even before it increases then it will be of immense benefit.
It becomes very difficult to stop the things that grow very much and become very widespread.
But if we get awakened in the beginning and stop it then a lot can be saved.
My heart says that with this feeling, I must talk to the young friends especially today.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit addiction.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure increases to people who consume tobacco.
This is what everyone says.
Intoxication of tobacco is due to nicotine present in it.
Its consumption during adolescence also affects the development of brain .
But today I want to talk to you about a new topic.
You must be aware that there has been a ban on e-cigarettes in India recently.
E-cigarettes are a kind of electronic device different from the common cigarettes.
In e-cigarettes, nicotine consumption is done through hot and chemical wastes.
We understand the dangers of ordinary cigarettes very well, but a misconception about e-cigarettes has been created.
There is a misunderstanding that there is no threat to e-cigarettes.
Aromatic chemicals used to be obtained so that foul odour does not spread like the rest of the cigarettes.
We have seen around us that even if the father is a chain smoker, he stops the rest of the household from smoking, he wants his children to not get cigarettes.
It is their endeavor that no member of the family should smoke or smoke.
They know that smoking and tobacco causes heavy losses to the body.
The pinnars also know and the visitors also know.
But the issue of e-cigarettes is very different.
There is not so much awareness among people about e-cigarettes.
Sometimes the e-cigarette quietly enters the house in curiosity and sometimes the magic shows and the children show each other.
Look, I will take out the smoke from my face, see, without putting fire, without burning it, I will take out the smoke.
Once the adolescents and youngsters of the house get stuck in their tune, then gradually they become addicted to this addiction and become victims of this evil.
In fact, e-cigarettes obtain many harmful chemicals which have a bad effect on health.
You are aware that whenever someone smokes around us, we get to know about it.
Even if there is a packet of cigarettes in its pockets, it can be detected by the smell.
However, this is not the case with e-cigarettes, so many youngsters and youngsters are sometimes seen roaming around in their books, in their offices, in their pockets and in their pockets with great pride as well as as as fashion statements.
Young generation is the future of the country.
E-cigarettes have been banned so that this new drug addiction cannot ruin our young country.
Do not waste the dreams of every family and do not waste the lives of children.
This disease, this habit cannot be rooted in the society.
I urge you all to leave the addiction of tobacco and do not keep any guarantee regarding e-cigarettes.
Let us together build a healthy India.
All this has to be saved for Fit India.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great privilege for all of us that India has been the birthplace and workplace of exceptional people who have dedicated their lives for the betterment of others and not for themselves.
This is our Mother India, this is a multi-faceted land.
Many humans emerge from this land.
India has been the land of birth and work of such exceptional people.
And these are the people who have dedicated themselves, not for themselves but for others.
A similar destiny is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will proclaim Mary threshold on October 13.
The work done by Sister Marium Thesis for the betterment of mankind in the short span of 50 years is an example for the entire world.
Whatever work Sister Thresia did, it was completed with dedication and commitment.
Those who are still leading their lifestyle and missions.
Once again I pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially my dear brothers and sisters, for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world that today when we are considering Gandhi 150 then 130 crore Indians have pledged to free themselves from single use plastic.
Today, the vision of all the countries is immersed in India in the direction of environmental conservation, the kind of leadership that India has made in the entire world.
I am confident that all of you will be a part of the campaign to get rid of single use plastic on 2nd October.
Thirty-six people are contributing to this movement in their own way.
But we have launched a very unique campaign for the youth of our country.
When I noticed his work then I tried to know about his new experiments by talking to him on phone.
It may be that these things can also be used by other people of the country.
Mr. Rupudan Belviji is making a good effort.
For the first time when I heard the word 'plogging' then it was new to me too.
Perhaps in foreign countries that word has been used in some measure.
But in India, Rupudan Belvi ji has very much publicised it.
Friends, This time, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports is also organizing Fit India Plogging Run.
We have heard about how this programme should be done and what is happening in the programme.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step in this direction then our India will move 130 crore steps in the direction of getting rid of single use plastic.
Once again, many-many thanks to Rupudhan ji.
We want to move forward to transform our lives into national interest.
One thing is a desire to be remembered early.
However, I will certainly do it in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, but today I am asking you to do it earlier so that you get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember that 31st October marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We have to run on that day for the unity of the country in the thousands of villages of India, children, elderly, all the people, all the schools, colleges, all the thousands of villages.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that by 2022, you will go to 15 places in India.
Make a programme to stop at least 15 places and if that happens then stay for one night or two nights.
You see India, understand it, feel it.
How many diversities we have, and when these festivals are celebrated on the occasion of Diwali, people definitely go there and therefore I will again urge you to visit any such 15 places in India.
And how are these reforms
You would be happy to know that today we have 34 ranks and we had 65 ranks five years ago, so in a way we have made a big jump.
If we strive hard, we will make our place in the worlds premier destinations in tourism till the 75th year of our independence.
Yes, it is also necessary to see that on Diwali days due to cracks, etc. there will be no loss of any person in the fire.
You must keep all the precautions that should be taken for this purpose.
Happiness should also be there, joy should also be there, enthusiasm should also be there. Our festivals also bring a fragrance of the community and also bring a culture of collectivity.
Collective life gives a new strength, it is the fountain of a new strength.
Come, let us celebrate the festivals with enthusiasm and enthusiasm with new dreams and new resolve.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat November, 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to interact indirectly with the child friends of Karnataka.
Vijay Karnataka Akhbar Baldi of the Times Group, initiated an initiative to urge the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of India.
And then he published a few of them.
I read those letters, I felt very good.
These little children are also familiar with the problems of the country and the ongoing discussions in the country.
These children have written on a number of subjects: Kirti Hagde of North Kannada has pronounced Digital India and Smart Cities schemes and suggested that we need to bring about a change in our education system.
And if we give respect to the nature of our children then perhaps we can go ahead in protecting the environment.
Rida Nadafe has written from Laxmeshwar that she is the daughter of an army soldier.
And he has said, I cannot spend time with my friends as I am away from school, he has suggested that there should be a school nearby.
It was a good experience for me as well.
My dear countrymen, today is 26th November.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
In 1947, the Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India on this day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the day to remember those members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked hard for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
And whenever he reads these discussions, we feel proud that what is the idea of a life dedicated to the nation
Can you imagine how hard he would have worked to build the Constitution of our country full of diversity
You must have seen the philosophy and wisdom at a time when the country was freed from the slaves.
Keeping this Constitution in mind, it is our duty to create a New India by keeping in mind the views of the founding fathers and the great men of the Constitution.
Our Constitution is very broad.
Perhaps there is no area of life, no subject of nature that it has not touched.
Equality for all and sensitivity towards all is the identity of our Constitution.
It protects the fundamental rights of every citizen, the poor, the deprived, the underprivileged, the tribal and the women.
And keeps their interests safe.
It is our duty to follow the Constitution alphabetically.
Be it citizen or administrator, move forward in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.
In this Constituent Assembly, various committees were constituted on important topics.
It was one of the most important Committees of the Committees and was attended by Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Committee on Issues.
He was playing a very important role.
Today, the Constitution of India that we feel proud of today, is an indescribable reflection of Babasaheb Ambedkar's efficient leadership.
He ensured that the welfare of every section of the society is well-being.
On his Mahaparinirvana Diwas on 6th December, we salute him by remembering him as Kayam.
Babasahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and powerful is unforgettable.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels death anniversary is on the 15th of December.
Sardar Patel, who became the iron man of the country from the Kisanputra, did an extraordinary job of binding the nation.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
26-11 is our Constitution Day but nine years ago, on 26-11 the terrorists attacked Mumbai, how can the country forget it
This country will never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism has become a terrible form of occurrence every day in every part of the world.
We have been tolerating terrorism in India for the last 40 years.
There were several people around the world who were not prepared to take it seriously but today when terrorism is crossing its brinks then every government in the world is looking at terrorism as a major challenge that believes in humanism and trusts in democracy.
Terrorism has challenged the humanity of the world.
Terrorism has challenged humanism.
It is going to destroy human powers.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world together have to defeat terrorism.
Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi, these are the epics of this land that have given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and radicalization make a naked effort to disperse our social tensions by weakening them.
And that is why it is the need of the hour to become more aware of the humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, on 4th December we will celebrate Navy Day.
The Indian Navy is protecting and safeguarding our coastline.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You all are well aware that our civilization is on the banks of rivers.
Whether it is Sindhu or Ganga or Yamuna or Saraswati, both our rivers and marine economic and strategic goals are important.
This is our gateway to the ancient world.
This country, our land has a narrow relationship with the oceans.
And when we look at history, 800-900 years ago, during the Chaul dynasty, the Chaulanevi-Chulnauka period was considered to be one of the most powerful navies.
His navy contributed immensely to the expansion of the Chaul Empire, making it an economic super power of that time.
Chaul Naveen's zeal and innovation journeys are still visible in Sangam literature.
Very few people would be aware that most of the naval forces in the world had got permission for women on ships.
But in the Chaulanauka period and eight hundred and ninety years ago, women played a very important role and even women were involved in the war.
The Chaul rulers had a very rich knowledge of shipbuilding and shipbuilding.
When we talk of the Navy, who can forget the capabilities of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the navy
The coastal areas of Konkan, where the beaches are of immense importance, came under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Swarnadurg etc. were either on the coast or were surrounded by the sea.
The Navy was responsible for the protection of these forts.
Large ships and small boats were combined in the Marine Arm.
Their naval personnel were very skilled in attacking and escaping any enemy.
And when we talk about the Marine Arm, Kanoji Angeles cannot be remembered.
He brought the Marine Navy to a new height, and set up camps of Marine Navy personnel at many places.
After independence, our Indian Navy also showcased their valour at different times.
Be it the Liberation War of Goa or the Indo-Pakistan War of 11.
Even when there was a severe flood in Sri Lanka in May-June this year, three ships of our Navy immediately reached there and helped its government and its people.
In the month of September in Bangladesh, our Naval Ship INS Guideral also provided humanitarian assistance in matters of Rohingya.
In June last year, when the Bapu-New Guinea government sent us a message of talent and requested to save the fishermen of their fishing boats, our naval forces assisted us.
On the 21st of December, our naval ship, INS Trikand, had also arrived to assist in the release of a merchant vessel in the Western Akhara.
Our navy has always been taking pride in delivering healthcare services to the island of Fiji, providing immediate relief to the neighbouring country.
We, the people of India, always respect and respect our defence forces, be it the ground, the navy or the air force, every countryman salutes the courage, bravery, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
We can live the lives of 1. 25 billion Indians, hence the soldiers sacrifice their lives for the country.
Every year we celebrate the 7th December as the Armed Forces Flag Day.
This is the day to express our pride and honour for the armed forces of this country.
I am glad that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to run the campaign from 1st to 7th December to reach out to the citizens of the country and make people aware about the Armed Forces and make people aware.
The whole week small and big flags will put these flags on the chest .
A movement of honour towards the armed forces starts in the country.
We can also distribute the flag of the Armed Forces on this occasion.
You can post the experiences of those who are associated with the Armed Forces in their surroundings in their identification pockets with their courageous steps along with their associated video and photos armedforcesflagday.
You can gather information about the army from schools, colleges, armed forces and from them.
Our new generation can have a good opportunity to learn about the army.
This celebration also provides an opportunity to raise funds for the welfare of all our Armed Forces personnel.
The funds are spent on the rehabilitation of the families of the martyred soldiers, for the welfare of the injured soldiers, by the Soldiers Welfare Board.
Let us do something on this occasion that will enhance the morale of our armed forces.
Let us also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, the 5th December is the World Soil Day.
I also want to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters.
An important part of the earth is soil.
Whatever we eat is linked to this soil.
In a way, the entire grain is connected to the soil.
Even if we think that neither land nor plants will grow then what would human life have been possible
This is the reason why the organisms could have been concerned very long ago in our culture and we have been aware of the importance of our land since time immemorial.
In our culture, on the one hand, there is a simple effort towards farming, soil, devotion and respect among the people, on the other hand, scientific methods that keep nurturing this land are a part of our lives.
In the lives of the farmers of this country, both are important, in which devotion to the land as well as scientific conservation of the land.
I had heard about the farmers of Tohu village of Bhoranj Taluka in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The farmers of that area used chemical fertilizers and fertilizers before and because of that the health of their land was getting worse.
The yield was declining and consequently the income was declining and the productivity of the land was also slowly declining.
Some farmers in the village understood the seriousness of this situation and then they examined their land from time to time and advised them to use the fertilizers, fertilizers, micro nutrients and livelihood fertilizers as they were asked to use.
You will also be surprised to know that what was the result of the implementation of the schemes received by the farmers through land health and the guidance they received
These farmers have seen an increase of three to four times in the production of wheat in Ravi 2016-17.
Our farmers across the country have created more than 10 crore soil health cards so that they can properly grasp their land and make it unfinished.
We worship the Mother Earth, however, how do we harm the mother Earth with chemical fertilizers like urea
All kinds of scientific experiments have proved that urea is more harmful than required for mother Earth.
This is the need of the hour to once again raise awareness about the relationship between the mother and the child.
Can our farmers, our sons and sisters of our soil make a solemn pledge that the amount of urea they use today will they make half the use of it when it will be 75 years of independence in 2022
What kind of changes can be brought about in the lives of farmers
We all are beginning to experience global warming and climate change.
There was a time when cold had started before Diwali.
Today, December is knocking at the table and the cold is gradually rising.
But as the cold begins, we all feel that it does not seem good to get out of the junction.
But even in such a weather, people who are constantly awake can bring beautiful results and this example is inspiring for all of us.
This little child Tushar has done inspiring work in spreading the message of cleanliness.
It shows that there is no age for cleanliness or there is no limit to it.
Whether it is a small child or an elderly person, a woman or a man, cleanliness is essential for everyone.
And there is also a need to wipe the coin for sanitation.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters are determined to do so.
As a result, we learn something.
Today, he is doing well in every field.
Whether it is in the field of sports or competition or any social initiative, our Divyangjans are not lagging behind.
You must remember that our Divyang players won four medals by performing well at the Rio Olympics and also made champions at the Blind Tea Twenty Cricket World Cup.
There are several types of competitions across the country.
A few days ago, the 19th National Paraswimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in it and gave an introduction to their skills.
He also won the Golden Jubilee in the 70th National Para Swimming Competition.
He was selected by the Sports Authority of India for the 20-20 Paralympics Competition.
He is one of the 32 para-transferees who will be trained at the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I salute the passion of brother Jigar Thakkar and convey my best wishes to him.
Today, special attention is being paid to access and opportunity for Divyangjans.
It is our endeavor to empower every person of the country.
Building an inclusive society will lead to equality in society with equality and maternity and move forward together.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen and I hope that this festival of Id gives us a new inspiration to enhance peace and harmony in the society.
Forget sadness and do not forget happiness.
I think we should propagate this thing.
We have tried to recall several interesting events of the past year in our broadcasting fields.
Can you contribute in this
Can we share five positive experiences of our life this year
Remember others on such inspirational occasions.
If we remember good things then the spirit of doing good will emerge and the mood will emerge.
Good things provide energy to improve.
And I will strive to reach out to the countrymen in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, the details of your Hashteg Positive India.
My dear countrymen, I will be amongst you for Mann Ki Baat next month.
You will get a chance to talk a lot.
2nd October, 2019 on All India Radio
The Mahaparv Chhath, celebrated six days after Diwali, is one of the most relevant festivals in our country.
Traditional rules are followed in everything ranging from food and beverages.
The unparalleled festival of Chhath Puja is completely linked with nature and the prayer of nature.
While the sun and water are at the centre of the worship of the Mahaparva Chhath, the vessels made of bamboo and clay and the integral materials associated with the worship of the Kadamul.
The message of worship of the rising sun and the setting sun is full of unique culture.
Cleanliness is also an important expression in our lives.
Before Chhath, the entire house is cleaned, along with rivers, ponds, ponds, ponds, worship places, i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is also a festival of environmental protection, disease prevention and discipline.
Normally people believe that something is insufficient to take, but in Chhath Puja, there has been a special tradition of asking for prasad after the dawn.
Behind this tradition of asking for prasad, it has also been recognised that it destroys egoism.
It is very natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat continues to be appreciated and criticised.
But whenever I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, my belief becomes firm that Mann Ki Baat has been tied up with a hundred per cent unbreakable relationship with the people of this country.
Take the example of Khadi and handloom.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I have always been a lawyer for handloom, Khadi and what is the outcome
You must have been pleased to hear that Khadi and Handlooms are being sold at the same store.
During Diwali, Khadi Gift Cooperation has registered an increase of about 680.
Total sales of Khadi and Handicrafts showed an increase of about 70 this year over the previous year.
It shows that today the youth, the elderly, the women, the people of every age group like Khadi and handlooms.
I can imagine that this will benefit many weavers families, poor families and families working on handlooms.
Khadi is emerging as a powerful tool to empower the poorest of the poor by transforming the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is playing a very big role for the rural people.
Shri Rajan Bhatt has written on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about my Diwali experience with the security forces and he also wants to know how our security forces believe in Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwad has also written on Narendra Modi App, why can we have a system of providing sweets to the security forces of our home
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that our household sweets should reach the jawans of the country.
You must have celebrated Diwali with great joy.
For me Diwali also brought a special experience this time too.
Once again I had the privilege of celebrating Diwali with our brave security forces on the border.
This time it was unforgettable for me to celebrate Diwali with the security forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I respect the soldiers of our security forces from every countrymen for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our security forces defend the country by facing the difficult and odd situations on the border.
When we get an opportunity, when we get an opportunity, we should know the experiences of our soldiers, we should listen to their glorious stories.
Many of us do not know that our security forces are playing an important role in peace not only on our borders but all over the world.
Being a UN peacekeeper, he is naming India in the world.
In recent days, on 24th October, UN Day was observed worldwide.
Everyone recalls the UNs efforts for peace in the world, its positive role.
And we believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam means the whole world is our family.
And because of this belief, India has been actively participating in various important initiatives of the UN since its inception.
You must be aware that the proposal of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begins with the words WE THE PEOPLE.
India has always emphasized on female equality and UN DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS is a living evidence.
The proposals made in its preliminary framework were All Omen are borne free and equal which was changed with the efforts of the representative of India Hansa Mahotsav and was later accepted by All Human Beings are burn free and equal.
Though this seems to be a very small change, but a healthy idea is seen in it.
There will be many of your mothers who will be getting this information for the first time.
More than 18,000 Indian security forces have served in UN PEACEKEPING OPERATIONS.
Currently, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN PEACEKEPING INITIATIVES and are the third largest in the world.
By August 2019, Indian troops have served in nearly 50 OPERATIONS out of 1 PEACEKEPING OPERATIONS of the UN worldwide.
These OPERATIONS are operating in many countries in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kongo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and other parts of the world.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated at Indian Army Hospital in Kongo and South Sudan and countless people have been rescued.
The security forces of India have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts by doing People Friendly Operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peacekeeping operations.
Very few people would be aware that India was the first country to send Female Police Unit to the UN peacekeeping mission in Liberia.
And see, this step of India has become an inspiration for the countries around the world.
And then all the countries started sending their own Women Police Unit.
You will be proud to know that India's role is not limited to only Peacekeeping Operating Operators, but India also works to impart training to the Peacekeepers of about 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and harmony throughout the world.
Peacekeping operations are not an easy task.
Our security forces have to work in remote areas.
People have to live in different places.
Different situations and different cultures have to be understood.
They have to swim according to the local needs and environment there.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper who was honoured with the Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeepers who have established a unique identity in Cyprus.
He was made a Force Commander in Namibia at the age of 2 in 1989 and served his services to ensure the freedom of the country.
General Thimayya, who has also been the Chief of the Indian Army, led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and laid down his all-round support for peaceful operations.
As a peace ambassador, India has always been a message of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
We believe that everyone lives in peace, harmony and moves towards building a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our sacred land has been decorated with great people who have served humanity with selflessness.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Bhagini's statement, was also one of those extraordinary people.
He was born in Ireland as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of Nivedita.
And observation means that which is completely dedicated.
Later, he proved himself in accordance with his name.
Yesterday marked the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his happy and prosperous life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was deeply saddened by the atrocities committed in the British Raj.
Not only did the British make our country a slave but they also tried to make us mentally slaves.
This work was going on continuously to underscore our culture, to create an inexhaustible feeling in us.
Bhagini Nivedita ji re-established the glory of Indian culture.
Awareness of national consciousness, he worked to unite people.
He went to different countries of the world and raised his voice against the evil propaganda against the eternal religion and philosophy.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramania Bharati is famous for her revolutionary poem Pudumui Penn, New Women and Women Empowerment.
It is said that his inspiration was Bhagini's statement.
Bhagini Nivedita ji also supported the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bus.
He helped publish and propagate bus research through his writings and conferences.
It is a special beauty of India that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture.
Bhagini's commentary and scientific Jagdishchandra Basu are strong examples of this.
In 1987, there was a terrible plague in Kolkata and hundreds of people died in the vigilance.
Bhagini Speech started the work of cleaning the nick and roads without worrying about her health.
He was a woman who could lead a comfortable life but dedicated to the service of the poor.
He was inspired by the sacrifices made by the people.
He spoke of the importance of cleanliness and service to the people through his work.
And on his grave it has been written - "Here Repose Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India" - Bhagini is resting here who dedicated her all to India.
He undoubtedly did the same.
Today, there cannot be any other worthy tribute to this great personality that every Indian takes inspiration from his life and strives to follow that path of service.
First of all my best wishes to all the children on Children's Day on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
Children are the most important aspects of building a New India.
Your anxiety is true that the diseases that had come up earlier, the last stages of life that had come up around, are now being seen in children as well.
Today it is very surprising that we hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
Such diseases were rarely happening among the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders.
One of the major causes of such ailment in young age is deficiency in physical activity in our lifestyle and change in our food habits.
The society and the family need to pay attention to this.
When they think about it, you see that there is no need to survive.
It is necessary that we keep changing our habits by doing things properly and regularly and make them a habit.
I would like that my family members should try to adopt the habit of going to the open ground.
If possible, the elderly of our family should also play with these children in the open.
Adopt the habit of going to the stairs instead of coming up in the lift.
After dinner walk for a while keeping the entire family with the children .
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga will prove to be helpful in maintaining a healthy lifestyle especially our young friends and protecting them from lifestyle disorders.
Thirty minutes before going to school, see how beneficial it is.
You can do the same thing at home as well as the specialty of Yoga - it is easy, easy, all-available. And I am saying this because people of any age can do it easily.
Several studies are being conducted to know how Yoga is effective in controlling diabetes.
It is also being studied in AIIMS and the results that have been achieved so far are very encouraging.
We need Ayurveda and Yoga not only as a medium of treatment but also as a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been good news in the field of sports in the past.
Our sportspersons have brought laurels for our country in different sports.
India has won the Asia Cup hockey in Hockey.
Our sportspersons have excelled in excellence and have made India a Asia Cup champion after ten years.
Earlier, India became the Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2003.
On behalf of me and my countrymen, I extend my best wishes to the entire team and helpful staff.
After hockey, good news has also come to India in the badminton.
Badmint Star Kidambi Srikanth has made a sense of pride in every Indian by winning the title of Denmark Open in an excellent performance.
This is his third super-series premiere after the Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
I congratulate our young friends for this achievement and for enhancing India's pride.
Friends, FIFA U-1 World Cup was held this month.
Teams from all over the world came to India and everyone showed their affection on the football field.
I also got the opportunity to go to a match.
Players and philosophers were all enthusiastic.
The whole world is watching you on such a great occasion of the World Cup...
Such a big match... I was stunned to see the energy, enthusiasm and sentiment of all the young players.
The World Cup was successfully organized and all the teams performed their best.
Though India could not win the Khitab, the youth of India won the hearts of all.
The entire world, including India, acknowledged the festival of sports and was fond of football lovers across the globe.
The future of football is very bright, its signs are visible.
Once again, I congratulate all the players, their colleagues and all the sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, as many people write to me about Swachh Bharat, I feel that if I think of doing justice with their feelings then I will have to do Mann Ki Baat programme everyday and I will have to dedicate to Mann Ki Baat on the subject of cleanliness.
If someone sends the footprints of the attempts of mistakes then somewhere is the case of the collective efforts of the youth.
Sometimes there is talk of innovation regarding cleanliness or changes in public opinion.
In the past, I have received a very detailed report about the transformation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
The entire team of NGs called the Ecological Protocol Organisation carried out the cleanliness drive of the Chandrapur Fort.
He has sent me pictures of the fort before cleanliness and after sanitation.
I was stunned to see the photographs. And I would like to tell those photographers who would be depressed to see filth around themselves. Sometimes they feel that how the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled then I would like to tell them that you can see the youth of the Ecological Protection Organization, their sweat, their zeal and their resolve in the living pictures.
Your despair will be transformed as soon as you see it.
This concerted effort of cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, collectivity and consistency.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of all our countrymen to keep the historical heritage safe and clean.
I congratulate the Ecological Protection Organisation and its entire team and the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of November, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
He spoke of the well-being of the entire human race, and described all species as equal.
He emphasized on women empowerment and womens dignity.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled 28 thousand kilometers on foot and delivered the message of true humanity during his visit.
He interacted with the people, and showed them the path of honesty, sacrifice and dedication.
He conveyed the message of equality in society and showed his message not only through words but also through his actions.
He drove anchor which generated serving in the people.
The feeling of unity and equality among the people was created by sitting with anchor.
Guru Nanak Devji gave three messages of a meaningful life - memorise the name of God, work hard, work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Devji had also created Gurubani to speak for himself.
We are going to celebrate the 550th Prakash Year of Guru Nanak Devji in 2019.
Let us strive to move forward on the path of their message and teachings.
My dear countrymen, two days later on 31st October we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he had laid the foundation of a modern Integrated India.
Today we can learn a lot from the extraordinary journey of this great child of Mother India.
On 31st October, Smt. Indira Gandhi also left the world.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was that he not only gave transformational ideas but he was also skilled in finding practical solutions to a very complex problem.
He had a split in realizing his thoughts.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took the privilege of binding India in one corner.
He ensured that crores of Indians are brought under the guise of One Nation and One Constitution.
Their decision-making ability enabled them to overcome all obstacles.
Wherever there was a need for honour, he made congratulations, where there was a need to use force.
He said that gender and creed cannot stop us, all are the sons and daughters of India, all of us should love our country and build our trust in each other's love and harmony.
This statement of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring and relevant for our vision of a New India.
And that is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
His contribution to transforming the country into an integral nation is incomparable.
On 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the Run for Unity will be organized across the country which will include children, youth, women, all age groups from all over the country.
I urge you all to participate in this festival of 'Run for Unity'.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, with a new resolve, with a new determination, all of you have once again been associated with your day-to-day life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani and today it is the 36th episode.
And when I talk about Mann Ki Baat, people from every corner of the country reach me, perhaps I can tell you very little things but I get a lot of treasure.
Most of them inspire me.
Many are for reforms in the government.
Sometimes there are personal grievances and sometimes attention is drawn towards the collective problem.
And I take you half an hour a month, but people talk about Mann Ki Baat on 30th day.
And as a result, the government is also getting a sense of sensitivity and the kind of power that has been created in the far-flung society.
And that is why this three year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the feelings and feelings of the people of the country.
And perhaps in such a short span of time I am extremely grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity that I have got to know about the feelings of the common man of the country.
And I believe that these ideas and ideas will be useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future. It will provide a new consciousness and a new energy.
Once I had said in Mann Ki Baat that we should worry while eating or take as much as we need, we should not waste it.
But then I saw that all the letters from every corner of the country came to me, several social organisations and many youngsters were already working on this thing.
Several people who worked on the food plate that was left out of the plateau and how it could be utilised so that my heart was filled with joy.
And after that I saw that many people came forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Once I saw a selfie with daughter from a Sarpanch of Haryana and I talked to everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
In view of this, a massive campaign of selfie with daughter has been launched not only in India but also in the whole world.
This is not just a social media issue.
A new confidence in every girl and a new pride has emerged in this event.
Every parent felt that I too should take selfies with my daughter.
Every girl started feeling that I have some greatness, I have some importance.
In the past, I had met the Department of Tourism, Government of India.
Whenever I asked the people visiting the tour to send a photo of Incredible India wherever you go.
Millions of printers from every corner of India, in a way those working in the field of tourism, have become very popular.
I have experienced this thing in Mann Ki Baat that how big a movement starts with a small movement.
Today I feel like saying all these things because when I was wondering that three years have passed then several incidents of the last three years have come to my mind.
The country is constantly moving in the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the betterment of the country, for the betterment of the society and for the progress of the country. In my three year Mann Ki Baat campaign, I have learnt, understood and understood from the countrymen.
This is a huge capital for any country, it is a huge power.
I heartily salute the countrymen.
The feeling that Khadi's attraction has increased in the younger generation.
Sale of Khadi has increased and this has led to direct employment in the homes of the poor.
Discount is given in Khadi from 2nd October and several relaxations are given.
Once again I would like to urge us to carry forward the mission of Khadi.
Let us work with that spirit to purchase Khadi and to unfurl Diwali in the house of the poor.
The poor of our country will get a strength from this work and we should do it.
And because of the increase in interest towards Khadi, the Government of India has also encouraged the people of Khadi to think in a new way.
How to bring new technologies, how to enhance production capacity, how to bring solar power
How can we revive the ancient heritage which had been closed for 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years
In Varanasi Sevapur, Uttar Pradesh, the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri has been closed for 26 years but has been revived today.
Various activities were integrated.
New employment opportunities have been created for many people.
Khadi and Village Industries in Pampore in Kashmir resumed its closed training centre and Kashmir has a lot to offer in this area.
Now due to the resumption of this Training Centre, the new generation will get a boost in the construction of modern dhabas, in the construction of new things and in the construction of new things. And I feel very good that when a big corporate house is also presenting it on Diwali then it has started giving Khadi goods.
People have also started giving Khadi items as gifts to each other.
We all experience how things move forward with a comfortable spirit.
My dear countrymen, we had made a solemn pledge last month in Mann Ki Baat and we had decided that 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti we will celebrate the festival of cleanliness across the country.
I will connect the masses with cleanliness.
Our Honble President ji started this work and the country got connected.
Children, old people, men or women, cities or villages have become a part of this cleanliness drive.
And when I say that Sankalp se Siddhi, this cleanliness drive is progressing towards a solemn pledge, we are seeing it before our eyes.
Everyone accepts it, supports it and contributes to it.
This time we have seen one thing - one is that we should clean somewhere, the other is that we should not waste by staying awake but if we want to make cleanliness a habit then an ideal movement is also necessary.
This time, several competitions were held with Swachhata Hi Seva.
Over 2. 5 crore children participated in the Swachhta essay competition.
Thousands of children made pictures.
As far as cleanliness is concerned, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
We can see in the 'Swachhata Hi Seva' movement how much our country's electronic media can serve the country's print media.
Just a few days back, somebody noticed me about the 18-year-old Bill Dar in Srinagar.
And you will be glad to know that Srinagar Nagar Nigam has created Brand Ambassador for cleanliness and when it comes to Brand Ambassador, you will feel that perhaps he will be a cinema artist, perhaps he will be a sportsperson.
Bill Dar has been engaged in Swachhata since the age of 12-13 years for the past 5-6 years.
The biggest lake in Asia is near Srinagar where plastic, polythene, used bottle and waste keep cleaning it.
They also earn a little from them.
Because his father died due to cancer at a very young age but he also linked his life to cleanliness.
I would like to convey my best wishes to Srinagar Municipal Corporation for their initiative towards cleanliness and their imagination of Ambassador because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every citizen of India feels like going to Srinagar and it is a big thing to get so much strength for cleanliness there.
And I am glad that they have not only made Bills Brand Ambassador but they have given bills to the corporation this time and they also train people in other areas for cleanliness, they inspire people and they lag behind till the results are brought out.
Bill Dar is a small age but it is a source of inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
The month of October is a month for us to remember many great men.
These dignitaries gave us direction for the 20th and 21st centuries, led us, guided us and suffered a lot for the country.
On October 2, when we mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji, on October 11, the birth anniversary of Jayprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh is being celebrated and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji is born on September 25.
It is also a centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
And what was the central point of all these great men
One thing was common in his life and that was to live for the country, do something for the country and not just teachings but also to guide the people through its conduct in his life.
Gandhiji, Jayaprakash ji, Deendayal ji are all such great men who remained away from the shackles of power but lived with the lives of the people, kept on jingling with them and kept doing something for the welfare of the people.
Nanaji Deshmukh had left his political life in the village and when we are celebrating his centenary year then it is very natural to have respect for the work of his village.
Former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalamji used to talk about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh when he spoke to the youth.
He used to mention with great respect and he himself went to the village to see Nanaji's work.
Remembering all these great men is not a favour to them. Remembering these great men so that we get the path ahead and keep moving forward.
In the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will surely talk about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, but on 31st October, the Run for Unity Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat programme will be held across the country.
Run for Unity programmes should be organised in every city and city of the country in a big way and this season is also such that it is enjoyable to run and it is also necessary to get iron power like Sardar Saheb.
And Sardar Saheb had united the country.
We should also run for unity and move ahead with the mantra of unity.
We say in a very natural way - unity in diversity, specialty of India.
We take pride in diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I would like to repeatedly tell my countrymen of India and especially my younger generation that we are in a state of consciousness.
Let us experience the diversity of India, touch them and experience their fragrance.
You see, these diversities of our country work as a major school for the development of your personality.
There are vacations, Diwali days, in our country there is a tendency to travel somewhere around, people go as a tourist and it is very natural.
But sometimes there is anxiety that we don't see our country, we don't know the diversity of the country, we don't understand it.
You go anywhere in the world, I don't have any obstacles, but sometimes see your home too.
The person of North India will not know what is in South India.
The person of western India will not know what is in Eastern India.
Our country is full of diversities.
All these great men made a vast trip to India.
At the outset of his work, he tried to understand India.
He tried to make India live within himself.
Can we try to make the different states of our country, different societies, groups, their customs, their dresses, their food habits, their beliefs as a student
Value edition in tourism will happen only when we are not only visiting but as a student we try to make them fit.
I have my own experience that I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India.
More than 4,500 districts will be such that I would have got the opportunity to enjoy night-life. And today when I am taking charge of this responsibility in India then the experience of this tour is very useful for me.
There is a lot of convenience in understanding things.
I also urge you to feel the immense strength of our vast India while speaking the slogan of unity in diversity.
This includes the dream of Ek Bharat - Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many diversities are there in food habits
Even if the whole life is eating a different diet everyday, there will never be any repetition of any diet.
This is the strength of our tourism.
Make the diversity of Kotikoti people in the future.
These experiences will enrich your lives.
The scope of your thinking will be immense.
And who can be a big teacher with experience
Generally, the period from October to March is mostly of tourism.
People go on a tour.
I believe that if you go this time too then you will carry forward this mission.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share photos.
Send your photo on Incredible India (Hash Teg Incredible India).
If you want to visit not only the buildings but also the people there, you can also send a picture of it.
Write not only about natural beauty but also about the life of the people there.
Write good rules on your journey.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can you give any information about it
If all the people of a state ask me about it then I will ask the government to fulfill it and prepare a publicity literature on the seven things that have come up about every state.
That is, in a way, my aim is to give a boost to tourist destinations from the point of view of the people.
The Government of India will work on it.
Come, join me.
You can also play an incentive in increasing the tourism of the country using the time from the month of October to the month of March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch me too.
It motivates my heart.
I leave a deep impression on my mind.
At the same time, I am a person like you.
We have seen a unique example of women power and patriotism.
We can imagine that when the world has risen in this young age then what will be their mental state .
For 11 months, he worked hard and trained and dedicated his life to fulfil his husbands dreams.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey's husband, Khilesh Dubey, used to work as a hero in the army and was martyred for the motherland.
His wife Nidhi also decided to join the army.
It is very natural for every countryman to have respect for our mothers and our heroes.
I congratulate both of these sisters from the bottom of my heart.
He has created a new inspiration, a new consciousness for the people of the country.
Congratulations to both of these sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is also a huge opportunity for the young generation of our country between the Navratri festival and Diwali.
We are hosting the World Cup of FIFA UNDER 19.
I am sure the football will spread all around.
Each generation's juice will grow in football.
There should not be any school or college ground in India where our youngsters are not sports-oriented.
Let us also make sports a part of our lives when the entire world is playing on the soil of India.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
It is an occasion to worship Mother Durga.
The entire environment is full of pure fragrance.
The atmosphere of spirituality, the atmosphere of festivals, the atmosphere of devotion all around and this festival is celebrated as a festival of energy.
It is known as Shardiya Navratri.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to the countrymen and pray to Maa Shakti that our country will scale new heights to fulfil the aspirations of the common man of the country.
The country has the power to deal with every challenge.
When the country progresses at a rapid pace and India completes 75 years of its independence in 2022 then the effort to fulfil the dreams of the people who struggled for freedom should be the resolve of 1.
My best wishes to you all.
Festivals should also be celebrated and encouraged.
Mann Ki Aug 2017
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand when violence is detected from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to worry.
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the country of Sardar Patel who has given full strength to the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have accepted the values of public life, non-violence and equal respect.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: We have been listening to it sincerely.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be tolerated in the name of faith, even if it is a communal belief, belief in political ideology, belief in the individual, belief in the tradition.
In the Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us, every person has every kind of system of justice.
I want to assure the countrymen that those who take the laws, those who have lost their lives in the wait for violence, whether they are individuals or groups, this country will never tolerate or tolerate any government.
Everyone will have to face the law, decide the responsibility of the law and remain punished by the culprits.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living and dressing.
We see diversity in every behaviour of life.
Our festivals are also full of diversity and because of our cultural heritage thousands of years old, we need cultural traditions, social traditions and historical traditions, if we want to spend some time in 365 days, which is not associated with any festival there.
Now it must have been noted that every festival of ours runs in accordance with the timelines of nature.
There is a direct relationship with nature.
Our wealth festivals are directly linked to the farmers and are associated with the fishermen.
Today, when I am talking about festivals then first of all I would like to call you a sweet pause.
Yesterday, the festival of Samvatsari was celebrated in the Jain community.
The festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadrava in the Jain community.
The last day of the festival is the festival of festivals.
This is a really wonderful tradition.
The festival of Samvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way, it is also known as Kshama Vani Parva and on this day it is a tradition of calling each other a sweet dustbin.
In his drama The Merchant of Venice, Jeanspier has written: Mercy is two blessed, it blesses him that gives and him that forgives and those who are forgiving receive blessings from God.
Bal Gangadhar Lokmanya Tilak had given birth to this tradition 125 years ago and 125 years ago he had become a symbol of freedom movement before independence.
And since independence, he had become a symbol of social education and social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi runs for 10 days.
This Mahaparv is said to be a symbol of unity, equality and integrity.
Ganesh Chaturthi greetings to every Indian.
Now the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
One of the colourful festivals of India is the festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance.
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival offers new zeal, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people along with giving a message of love and harmony to the society.
And now our festivals are also becoming the reason for tourism attraction.
And I would like to tell the countrymen like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or the Durga Festival in Bengal has become an attraction for tourism in a way.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We should think about what we can do in this direction.
A few days later, the festival of Id-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to the people of Idul uha.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and belief for us but we also have to make festivals a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
Festivals and hygiene are associated with family life.
Cleanliness is the best way to prepare for festivals.
It is not a new thing for us but it is also necessary to become a social nature.
The insistence of public sanitation should not only be at home but also in our entire village, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country.
My dear countrymen, the definition of becoming modern is changing.
Just now, a new dimension, a new parameter, how much culture you are, how modern it is, how modern your thought process is, it is also becoming a trick that you are aware of the environment.
If it is against it then it is considered to be a bad thing in society today.
And as a result of that, today I can see that a big campaign has been launched in the Ganesh Festival.
If you go to your utube, then every household is constructing Ganesh ji and making it Ganesh ji by bringing soil.
Various types of experiments are being conducted in every family.
In a way, such extensive training of environment consciousness has been seen in this Ganesh festival which has been seen earlier.
Media House is also being trained, inspired and guided by a large number of eco-friendly Ganesha statues.
And as I said, our country is full of crores and crores of bright minds.
And it looks very good when new innovations are known.
Someone told me that there is a gentleman who himself is an engineer, he gathers soil in a specific way and trains people to make Ganesh ji by combining it.
And if Ganesha is immersed in the water then it takes one dollar of water and keeps it in it so that it melts in the water immediately.
Three years ago, when Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will complete three years on 2nd October.
And its positive results are visible.
The coverage of toilets has gone up from 3 to about 6.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
A few days ago, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people had lost their lives but when water was reduced after floods, so much waste was spread everywhere.
At the same time, the workers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind at Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned 22 flood affected temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
All those who persecuted themselves came out.
The best example of unity for cleanliness, such an example that inspires everyone, was given by every worker of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.
The dedicated effort towards cleanliness, if it becomes our sustainable nature, then where can our country reach
Let us look for opportunities wherever we get the opportunity.
But let us all join.
Work together on the day of the holiday or on Sunday .
Go to the neighbourhood, to the nearby villages, but do it as a movement.
In, a section has been created where after the construction of toilets, you can name yourself and the name of your family, which you have helped in providing.
Friends of my social media can run a constructive campaign and the work done in the virtual world can be an inspiration to the ground.
The Swachh Sankalp se Swachh Siddhi Competition, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, is an essay competition for you, a short film making competition, a painting competition is being organized.
You can write essays in different languages and there is no limit to age, no age-limit.
You can make a short film with your mobile phones.
You can make a 2-3 minute film that inspires cleanliness.
It can be in any language and it can be silent too.
The participants who will participate in this competition and the best three will be selected, three will be on the district level and three on the state level.
So I invite everyone to join you in this mission of cleanliness.
I would like to once again assert that this time, on 2nd October, we will take a pledge to observe Gandhi Jayanti as a Swachhta 2nd October and for this, we will take the mantra of Swachhata from 15th September to every household.
Definitely take some steps for cleanliness.
Strive yourself and become a partner in it.
See how this 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti will shine.
You can imagine how a sacred joy would be in us to pay homage to revered Bapu when we will celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October after this 15-day cleanliness drive.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to particularly accept the loan of all of you.
I would like to express my gratitude to you from the depths of my heart that is why you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for such a long time but I would like to express my gratitude to you all because this programme does not mean Mann Ki Baat connects lakhs of people from every corner of the country.
The number of listeners is not only in crores but lakhs of people sometimes write to me, sometimes send me messages, sometimes a message comes on the phone, which is a big deal for me.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I look forward to your messages more than what you look forward to listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes some things become such a part of our habit that we dont feel that we are wrong.
Prime Minister, I am speaking from Pune with Aparna.
I want to tell you about one of my worries.
They always try to help the people, but I am worried about a habit.
I once went to Mall to shop with it.
He spent 20000 rupees for a sari and he had taken Rs. 450 for a pizza and the auto-rickshaw that was required to go to the mall, he kept paying money for five rupees along with the rickshaw driver for a long time.
While returning, buy vegetables from the road and save four-five rupees by refunding on every vegetable.
I felt very bad.
We have to pay big bills without asking the big ones and we have to fight with our labourer brothers and sisters for a few rupees.
Don't you think that whenever we come to sell something around our house, whenever we come in contact with a small shopkeeper or a vegetable seller or an auto rickshaw driver, we start sharing the feelings with him whenever we come in contact with those who live their lives by working hard.
And whenever we go to a big restaurant to eat, we don't even see what we have written in the bill and we immediately withdraw the money.
Not only this, if we go to the showroom to buy sarees, we do not have any value but we cannot stay without emotions with the poor.
Have we ever thought of what would happen to the poor
The question for this is not about two-five rupees but it hurts his heart that you are poor and hence you doubt his honesty.
There is no difference in your life for two-five rupees but have you ever imagined that this small habit of yours will have a deep impact on your mind
Madam, I am grateful to you, I have given me a message by calling you to touch your heart.
I believe that if my countrymen also have a habit of dealing with the poor then they will leave them.
My dear young friends, on 2nd August, the entire nation celebrates National Sports Day.
The day marks the birth anniversary of the great Hockey Player and Hockey Master Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to Hockey is unparalleled.
I remember this because I want the new generation of our country to join sports.
Sports is a part of our lives.
If we are counted among the young countries of the world then our youth should also look at the field of sports.
Sports i . . physical fitness , mental alertness , personal encement , I understand what should be more than this .
In a way, sports is a huge herb of heart fairs.
Today, in the Computer era, I would like to warn that the playing field is even more important than that.
The FIFA RAMO on the computer also showcase the football in the field outside.
Crickets will be played on the computer but the joy of playing crickets below the sky in the open field is something special.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out and they used to ask- When will you come back
Today, the situation is such that as soon as the children come home, they start watching a cartoon movie in one corner or get stuck on a mobile game.
There was a time when the mother used to tell the child, "When will you come" And today the situation is that the mother has to say: "Betta, when will you go out"
Friends, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has prepared a sports talent portal to explore and nurture sports talents where any child who has achieved some achievements in the sports sector across the country can upload his bio-data or video on the portal.
The Ministry of Sports will impart training to selected select sportspersons.
Let us welcome our young guests from all over the world with this festival of sports and sports and create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I would like to share my thoughts with the countrymen last week as a touching incident.
I got the opportunity to meet some young girls and some of them were born in the Himalayas.
The enthusiasm and courage of the six daughters of our country, who have never had any connection with the sea, work in the navy, inspire us all.
These six daughters, a small boat, INS Tarini, will have to cross the sea.
The mission has been named Navika Sagar Parikrama and it will return to India after months after travelling all over the world.
Sometimes he will spend 40-40 days simultaneously in water and sometimes he will cook in water for 30-30 days.
Our six daughters, and this is going to be the first event in the world with the courage of the waves of the sea.
Who would be an Indian who would not be proud of our daughters
I salute the enthusiasm of these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the entire country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for his experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read it for sure because this is a story of courage, a story of self-confidence and I will be glad to convey to you the words of those daughters.
My best wishes to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, all of us are celebrating Teachers Day on 5th September.
The former President of India, Dr.
Radhakrishnan ji's birthday.
He was the President but lived as a teacher.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was dedicated to education.
The great scientific Albert Einstein had said - It is the Supreme Court of the Teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
It means that creative emotions and enjoyment of knowledge in our students are the most important qualities of a teacher.
This time when we celebrate Teachers Day, can we all make a solemn pledge
And when we talk about change in our country, the way we remember the mother in the family, the same way we remember the teacher in the society.
Teachers have a big role to play in transformation.
Sometimes there have been incidents in the lives of every teacher that their comfortable efforts would have been successful in transforming someones lives.
If we make collective efforts then we will play a very big role in the transformation of the nation.
Come, let's take the mantra of Teach to Transform.
Namaste, Prime Minister, my name is Dr.
Unnatural expression.
I live in Mumbai and work for India Research Centre at Howard University.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana Financial Inclusion has been a subject of discussion not only in India but also in the pundits of the economic world.
The campaign was launched on 28th August, 2014 with a dream in mind.
Yesterday, on 28th August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is going on for three years.
30 crore new families have been connected with it and bank accounts have been opened.
This figure is more than the scorching of many countries of the world.
Today, I am glad that within three years, my poor brothers and sisters sitting on the last corner of the society have become a part of the country's economy, their habits have changed, they have started travelling in the bank, they have started saving money, they have been feeling the security of money.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor.
In a way, this is the savings of the poor, this is their strength in the days to come.
And those accounts that have been opened with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also benefitted from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana - Rs. One rupee, Rs.
In many families, because of the insurance of one rupee, when a crisis hit the poor, the lives of the sister-in-law of the family came to an end, in a few days she got two lakh rupees.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana - be it Dalits, tribals, women, educated youth, youth who intend to do something on their own, millions and millions of youngsters got money without any guarantee from the banks and they got their own money.
Moreover, everyone has made a successful effort to provide employment to Ekad-Be.
A few days ago, the people of the bank had met me because of the Jan Dhan Yojana, because of the insurance scheme, due to the Rupay card, the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana have been given to the common man and many inspiring cases have emerged.
Today is not that much time but I would like to tell the people of the bank so much that MyGov has taken up such issues.
They can also inspire new generations by interviewing such people.
The changes in the changing weather cycle and the environment are very negative.
During the last few days, some parts of India, especially in parts of Assam, Ishaan Bharat, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have faced natural calamities due to excessive rains.
The flood affected areas are being thoroughly monitored.
A comprehensive relief work is underway.
My cabinet colleagues are also reaching Ruburu.
State governments are also making immense efforts to help the sufficient suppliers in their respective areas.
Social organisations, cultural organizations and serving citizens are also making immense efforts to help people in such situations.
Whether the Armed Forces from the Government of India, the Air Force, the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF), the Paramilitary Forces, all of them join hands in serving the people of the country.
Due to floods, life becomes very distraught.
NDRF teams were deployed.
They were made friends of disaster and trained what to do and what not to do during the disaster.
Self-servicemen have been prepared and we have to learn to work in a difficult situation by forming a public organisation.
Gradually, we should also make a habit that we should coordinate our activities according to the weather conditions so that we can avoid losses.
Whenever I am preparing for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time all the letters related to GST have come up, all these phone calls have come up.
And people are still expressing happiness about GST and also expressing curiosity.
And I also tell you a phone call, Namaskar Prime Minister, I speak from Gurgaon to Nitu Garg.
I heard your Chartered Accountants Day address, and I was very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax-GST was launched in our country on this very day last month.
Can you say that the results that the government had expected are being achieved after a month or not
I want to know your thoughts about this.
And when a poor person writes to me that because of GST, the prices of essential commodities of the poor have come down, things have become affordable, then I feel extremely satisfied and happy.
I was just watching the impact of GST on the transport sector.
Now the income of trucks has increased.
It is taking less time to reduce distances.
Highways are free of traffic jams.
Earlier, due to the presence of different taxpayers, most of the resources in the transport and logistics sector were used to keep working and they had to make their own new godowns in every state.
However, GST is what I call Good and Simple Tax.
It has indeed made a very positive impact on our economy and in a short span of time.
The speed at which simplified changes have taken place, the speed at which new registrations have been made, have created a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes the experts of the economy, experts in management, technicians, Indias use of GST in the form of a model will be presented to the world.
This case study will be created for many universities of the world.
All decisions have been taken unanimously by the States and the Centre.
And this is the result that every government has the same priority that there is no burden on the poorest of the poor due to GST.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries involved in this work, to all the departments, to the Central and State Government employees.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but also a new culture of honesty.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again I salute crores of Indians for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
We have been listening to it since childhood and because of this, on 1st August, 120th, the Non-Cooperation Movement started.
August, 1942, the uit India Movement, which is known as the Awakening Revolution.
And on 15th August, 14th August, the country was freed.
In a way, several incidents related to the freedom struggle in the month of August are particularly related.
This year we are going to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
However, very few people know that the slogan of uit India was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 142.
From 185 to 1942, the way the people of our country kept connecting with you, fighting and tolerating freedom, that is our inspiration for building India.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for Indias freedom movement.
The movement was pledged to liberate the entire nation from British rule.
This was the time when the Indian public opinion against the British government had become a part of the uit India Movement in all corners of the country, be it villages, cities, be it educated, be it the poor, the poor, the immortal, all the people.
Jan Akrosh was at its peak.
Millions of Indians were fighting their lives in the battle with the mantra of 'Your Death' on Mahatma Gandhi's call.
Millions of youth of the country had abandoned their education and had abandoned books.
He had come out after listening to the bugle of freedom.
In August, Mahatma Gandhi had called for the uit India Movement, but all the big leaders were thrown into jail by the British.
And it was during that period that great men like Dr. Lohia and Jayprakash Narayan had played a leading role in the country as a leader of the second generation.
The Non-Cooperation Movement and the uit India Movement have seen two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi in 120 and 1942.
The format of the Non-Cooperation Movement was different and the situation of the 42 was different. The intensity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave a mantra of ceaselessness.
The entire success was popularly supported, the people were capable.
It was a peoples resolve, a peoples struggle, the entire country was fighting together.
Sometimes I think that if we want to add a few leaflets to history then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1985.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1985, continued till 1942, in some corner of the country.
During this long period, the hearts of our countrymen were struck by a wave of freedom.
Everyone is committed to something.
Generations have changed but there is no dearth of resolve.
People came here, joined them, went away, newlyweds came, newlyweds joined and the country was trying its best to uproot the British rule.
This work from 185 to 1942 created this movement in such a situation that it reached the peak in 1942 and the desert of uit India was so deserving that in the last five years, the British had to go to 14.
The five years from 1942 to 1944, when it reached the people of 185 to 1942, became a people with determination to make the country free with success in the form of five decisive years of attainment.
This was a decisive five years.
Now I want to connect you with this calendar.
In 1947, we became independent today.
It has been nearly 70 years since the governments came, the systems were created, changed, developed and everybody made their own efforts to get rid of the problems of the country.
Similarly, there was a decisive five years of achievement from 142-14 resolutions.
I can see that from 2019 to 2022, we have witnessed a further five-year period of Sankalp se Siddhi.
We will observe this 15th of August as a solemn pledge and we will continue to make this solemn pledge accomplished when we complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores of solemn pledges.
So, as the five years of 1942-14 were decisive for the country's independence, these five years could be decisive and decisive for the future of India from 2019 to 2022.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of our independence.
Come, let us run a great campaign of Sankalp se Siddhi from August in this month of August.
Every Indian, social institutions, local entities, schools, colleges, different organisations - take a pledge for every New India.
And a solemn pledge that we will achieve in the next five years.
Today, I am specially online because we may be online or not, but we must be online.
I invite the online world and especially my young friends and my young friends to come forward in an innovative way to contribute in building a New India.
Use of technology, video, posts, blogs, articles, new ideas and ideas.
Transform this zeal into a mass movement.
The Narendra Modi App will also launch the uit India quiz for young friends.
This quiz is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to familiarize the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must spread this message extensively.
There he does not say that the voice of 1. 25 billion Indians is echoing from the Red Fort.
This time too, I invite you to send me your thoughts on MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
I myself read it and I will try to publish it in whatever time I have on 15th August.
During the last three years, I have heard a complaint in my 15th August speech that my speech becomes a bit longer.
Whether success is achieved or not.
My dear countrymen, I also want to say one thing.
There is a social economics in the economy of India.
And we should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just occasions of joy and prosperity.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a mission of social reform.
But with this, every festival of ours is directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
A few days later, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, then Ganesha festival, then fourth moon, then Anant Chaudas, Durga Puja, after Diwali, one after the other, this is the right time when the poor get the opportunity to earn money.
As far as the economy is concerned, several months before the Raksha Bandhan, hundreds of families have started making households in small scale industries.
Thousands of seconds of manufacturers, sheep sellers and sweets are associated with a festival.
The family of our poor brothers and sisters runs through it only.
Its not just a festival of light, it is a festival, it is not just a house decoration.
It is directly related to those poor families who make small mud walls.
But today when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would also like to talk about the environment.
I have seen it and sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware than me, they are more active.
For the last one month, the citizens have written letters to me for continuous environmental awareness.
He urged you to talk about Eco-Friendly Ganesh in the Ganesh Chaturthi so that people can plan for soil breed from today itself.
At the outset, I am grateful to such an awakening citizen.
He has urged me to speak on this subject before time.
This time Ganesh Festival has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji started this great tradition and this year marks the 125th year of Ganesh Utsav.
Once again, let us recall the contributions of Lokmanya Tilak in essay competitions, discussions and discussions during the Ganesh Festival this year.
And once again, how should we take the public Ganesh Festival towards the spirit of Tilak ji, how should we strengthen that spirit and at the same time, it should be our resolve to preserve the environment.
And this time I have said this thing very soon
I am sure that all of you will join me and it will benefit from this thing that the poor artists, the poor artists, the idols that make will provide employment and the poor will get filled up.
Let us join our festivals with the poor, the economy of the poor, the joy of our festivals becomes the economic festival of the poor, the economic joy of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to the people of every country for the upcoming festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are consistently seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels for the country, be it education sector, economic sector, social sector or sports.
We are proud of our daughters.
In recent days, our daughters have performed wonderfully at the Womens Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those daughters this week.
I was very happy to talk to him but I was feeling that the World Cup could not win.
He had pressure on his face as well as stress.
We have seen many such games that if the players of India fail to do so then the anger of the country falls on those players.
Some people break the limits and say something that causes a lot of pain.
But for the first time, when our daughters were not successful in the world cup, 1. 25 billion Indians took that defeat on their own and didn't fall on those daughters.
Moreover, these daughters sing their praises and glorify what they did.
Indeed, the young generation of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to enhance the name of the country.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to the young generation of the country, especially to our daughters.
My dear countrymen, once again I recall the August Revolution and once again I recall the 15th of August, 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence.
Let every countryman make a solemn pledge and prepare a five-year roadmap to fulfil his resolve.
We all have to scale new heights, scale new heights, scale new heights.
Let us move together, let us do something.
Let us move forward with confidence that the future of the country will be better.
Many congratulations.
The weather is changing.
Rainfall in many parts of the country has made the weather pleasant.
After the rains, the cold winds are feeling relieved of the heat that has fallen in the past.
And we have seen that our mindset changes whenever there are many problems in life, however much stress, personal life, public life and rains.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath ji is celebrated with great devotion and joy in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated.
And the poor of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath ji.
The people who visited Dr.
He might have studied Baba Saheb Ambedkar. He might have seen that he praised the temples and traditions of Lord Jagannath as it included social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannathji is the God of the poor.
And very few people would be aware that there is a word in English, juggernaut and that means a grand chariot that no one can stop.
And in the dictionary of this Journal, it is also seen that this word has emerged with the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has adopted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the auspicious occasion of Lord Jagannath ji, I extend my greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens and bow down to Lord Jagannath ji.
India's diversity is also its specialty, India's diversity, which is also India's strength.
People of the holy month of Ramadan celebrated it with a sacred spirit.
Now is the festival of Eid.
On this occasion of Idul-Fitr, I convey my best wishes to everyone.
The month of Ramzan is the month of donation.
Happiness is the month of sharing and the happiness that we share is the same happiness.
Let us collectively take inspiration from these sacred festivals and share the treasures of happiness and take the country forward.
In this sacred month of Ramzan, an inspiring event of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor of Uttar Pradesh came to me.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live in a small village. In a way, more blood is from the brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
In this Ramzan, the people of the village have decided to construct toilets together.
And within this individual toilet, assistance is also provided by the government and an amount of about one lakh rupees has been given to them.
This one lakh rupees will be spent on other facilities in the village.
I congratulate every villager of Mubarakpur for turning this auspicious occasion of Ramzan into a good opportunity for the society.
One of their things is also very inspiring.
And the biggest thing is that he freed Mubarakpur from open defecation.
We know that there are three regions in our country - Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala - which have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration, governance and people of these five states for completing this work.
We are very familiar with the fact that there is a lot of hard work to do in the life of a person, in the life of a society.
If our letters are bad, if we need to improve it then we have to remain very conscious for a long time.
Then changes the habit of body and mind .
The subject of cleanliness is similar.
Such bad habits have become a part of our nature.
It has become a part of our habits.
We must constantly strive to get rid of it.
Everybody's attention has to be attracted.
We have to remember good inspirational events.
And I am happy that today cleanliness is not just a government programme.
In the last few days, a very good event came to my mind, which I would like to say to you.
This is an incident in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration has undertaken a massive task with public participation.
100 hour non-stop drive
And what was the goal
10,000 household toilets in 1 gram panchayat in a hundred hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that people and the government have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
1 Village ODF.
I congratulate the people sitting in governance, government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district. I have presented a very inspiring example of the hard work done by them.
During these days, in Mann Ki Baat, I keep getting a concession from the people, Narendra Modi continues to visit the App, Mygov.
It keeps on coming in, it keeps on coming in from the newspapers and it keeps on coming in the sky.
Recalling the crisp, Shri Prakash Tripathi wrote that he has presented the 25th of June as an era in the history of democracy.
Prakash Tripathi ji's awareness about democracy is commendable and democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
15th, 25th June was the dark night that no democratic lover can ever forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted to jail.
The opposition voice was suppressed.
Distinguished leaders of the country, including Jayprakash Narayan, were jailed.
Even the judicial system could not escape from the shadow of a terrible crisis.
The newspapers were made completely useless.
Today's journalism, the students of the world, the people working in the democracy, they have been repeated and constantly striving to raise awareness about the democracy.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
When the catastrophe took one year, Atal ji wrote a poem and described the state of mind in his poetry.
We have to strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud by raising his head in the world today.
On 21st June, 2019, the entire world became Yoga-based.
People from water to mountains welcomed the sun rays in the morning through Yoga.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
While people practiced Yoga on The Great Volume of China in China, people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 meters above sea level on the World Heritage Sight Machu Picchu in Peru.
People participated in the Ease of Doing Business event in France.
More than 4000 people performed mass Yoga in UAE's Abu Dhabi.
In Afghanistan, in Hairat, India gave a new look to India's friendship by practicing Yoga on Afghanistan Friendship Dam Salma Dam.
Programmes were held at 0 places in small places like Singapore and for weeks.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters were organized at UN Headquarters.
UN officials, including diplomats from all over the world...
This time, once again, Yoga has also worked as a World Record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have made a new world record by working together.
I also got the opportunity to attend the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time I got the opportunity to do Yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers also performed Yoga in Siachen where the minus 20, 25,40 degrees Celsius is located.
Our Armed Forces, BSFs, ITBPs, CRPFs, CISF, all have made Yoga their part along with their duties.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because it was the third International Yoga Day, I had said that three generations of the family should share the pictures of Yoga.
Some TV channels also carried this forward.
I have received several photographs, some of which have been collected on the selected Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister Shri, I am speaking to Dr. Anil Sonar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Saheb, I have a question that we have recently heard in your speech in Kerala that instead of giving gifts and flowers bouquets at different places, we should give good reading books as mementos.
You have started this work during your tenure in Gujarat. However, sir, we have not been able to see this work in a few days.
So can we do this .
Book reading habits, public awareness towards reading books, reading days and reading months are celebrated by the BHICKAR Foundation.
That is why I got the opportunity to go on the occasion of its launch.
And Khadi's handloom, which will also encourage Khadi.
As far as I was in Gujarat, all of us had become that habit, but after coming here, my habit was abandoned.
But when I went to Kerala, I was reminded of it once again.
And I have recently started giving the following suggestions to the government.
We can gradually create a habit.
And flower bouquets are very low in life.
Once we took it in our hands and then we left it.
But if you give a book then it becomes a part of the household, it becomes a part of the family.
Welcome to Khadi by offering a tower, so many poor people get help from it.
Expenditure is also reduced and it is also used in the true sense.
And when I am talking about this thing then how historic is the value of such things.
When I went to UK last year, ueen Elizabeth, the queen of Britain, invited me to dinner in London.
Many years have passed since, yet Rani Elizabeth has preserved the legacy given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I was watching, he urged me to touch and see.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I believe that habits do not change overnight and when we talk about it then we also have to become a victim of criticism.
Yet there will be criticism, but if we talk about it then there will be a change.
My dear countrymen, being the Prime Minister, there are several types of works.
I have to stay in the files but I have a habit that I read a few letters per day from the letters I receive and this gives me an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different kinds of letters come, different kinds of people write letters.
I got the opportunity to read such a letter these days, I feel that I must tell you about it.
Arulmoji Sarwan, a housewife from Madurai, sent me a letter in the far south, in Tamil Nadu.
And in a letter, he wrote that I thought of doing some economic activity along with paying attention to the study of children in my family, which would provide financial assistance to the family.
So I took money from the bank through the MUDRA scheme and started a small work towards sending some goods from the market.
In that sense, it was noticed that the Government of India has set up a system called the Sarvant e-Marketplace.
So I found out about it and asked people about it.
Then I myself registered it.
I want to tell the countrymen that if you also get the opportunity, you will also visit the e-GeM on the internet.
Those who want to send some supplies to the government, want to send small things, want to send electricity bulbs, send a dustbin, want to send a volunteer, want to send a chair, want to send a ticket, want to sell it, they can register their names in that site.
They can write about the quality of goods they have, how much they sell, how much they can write and the people of government departments will have to visit that site on compulsory basis.
And then we have to order them.
So every department of the government looks after those who register their names within the e-GeM.
Because of non-stop intermediaries, goods are available at affordable prices.
Now the Arulmozhi Madam has registered all the goods that the government could provide on this website.
And it is a matter of joy that the letter he has written to me is very interesting.
He has written that once I got the money from MUDRA, my business started, I gave all the information about what I could give within the e-GeM and what I would have asked from the Prime Minister's Office, he has written that the Prime Minister's Office bought two thermos from me.
And I got my bill of Rs. 1600.
This is power.
This is the strength of the country.
It also has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
This is the Government e-Marketplace- GeM.
I would like that those people who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way, they should associate themselves with this site more and more.
I believe that this Minimum Governance and Maximum Governance is a wonderful example of the Government and its goal is Minimum Price and Maximum Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other we are proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground related to Yoga then our dreams are to fulfil those horizons.
India has worked hard in sports and science a few days ago.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 nano satellites with Cartosat-2 series satellites.
And this satellite includes 14 countries - France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, USA besides India.
And this satellite mission of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the work of farmers, in times of natural calamity.
A few days ago, we must have remembered that ISRO had successfully launched GSAT-1.
And this is the most weighted satellite in the satellite launched by India so far.
And if the newspapers of our country compare the weight of its elephants then you can imagine how much our scientists have done in the field of space.
One thousand days of Mars Mission have been completed on 1st June.
But I am glad that the efforts of our scientists have been successfully completed for six months and now even after a thousand days our Mangalya Mission is working.
Photos are being sent, information is being given, scientific data is coming, they have been working more than their age.
Our scientific journey is an important milestone in our space journey.
We also see that the interest of our youth is increasing in the field of sports.
It is now seen that our younger generation is witnessing its future not only in studies but also in sports. And because of our sportspersons, because of their hard work and achievements, the country also gets illuminated.
Recently, India's badminton player Kidambi Srikanth has enhanced the honour of the country by charming his victory in Indonesia Open.
I extend my heartiest greetings to him and his coach for this achievement.
T.
Ushaji's Usha School of Athletics got the opportunity to attend the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track.
Sports also plays an important role in personality development.
The importance of sports in overall personality development is immense.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If our family also has interest in sports then they should be given the opportunity to play.
They should not be pressurized for books, they should not be pressurized for books, they can move forward, but if they have the potential and interest in sports then they should be encouraged and encouraged by schools, colleges, family and the people around them.
Everyone should dream for the current Olympics.
Once again, my parents, countrymen, the atmosphere of rains and festivals, in a way, the experience of this period is unique.
We can never forget the heat of this year.
Rainfall is awaiting sight.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has begun.
On arrival in the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and around the world, especially to the Muslim community.
In Ramzan, prayers, spirituality and charity are given a lot of importance.
We Indians are fortunate that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India can take pride in this thing. We can take pride in the fact that all the communities of the world are present in India.
This is a country where people who believe in God also reside and those who deny God, those who worship idols and those who oppose idol worship also reside.
Every kind of ideology, every kind of worship system, every kind of tradition, we have imbibed the art of living in harmony. And if it is religion, sect, ideology, tradition, it gives us the same message - peace, unity and harmony.
This sacred month of Ramzan will certainly help in furthering this path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you.
Last time when I was talking about Mann Ki Baat, I used a word and especially told the youngsters to do something new, come out of the comfort zone.
Take new experiences, and this is the age when life can be lived in such a way that it can take some risks and invite problems.
I am glad that many people have given me a befitting reply.
Personally, everyone showed me the zeal of speaking to me.
Some dramas learn, some people have written that we have started writing poems.
My reading habits were almost exhausted.
Therefore, I decided to study in these vacations.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I felt how much struggle had to be done to make India free, how much sacrifice had to be made, how many freedom fighters had spent years in prisons.
I am inspired by the fact that Bhagat Singh had done a lot in his young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some messages to todays generation on this subject.
I am glad that the younger generation is keen to know about our history, our freedom fighters, those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men, who spent their youth in prisons, laughed and laughed in the midst of many young fans.
And that is why today we are breathing in a free India.
We must have seen that the great men who spent their time in the freedom movement did a great job of writing, studying and doing a great job.
I went to Andaman Nicobar several years ago.
The Cellular Jail was visited.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book Maji Janmath in jail.
He used to write poems, write on walls.
They were shut down in a small coat.
Just imagine how those who seek freedom must have paid their respects.
When I read Savarkar jis book Maji Janmath, I was inspired to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show, which is very inspiring.
There was no such state in India that would not have spoken a language in India that would not have left an impression on its youth in the Cellular Jail, in the Andamans jail, for the sake of freedom and for the sake of water.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji, every language speaker, every generation of the people of every province had sat on the torture of the British.
I would like to tell the youth of the country that what kind of evils and hardships the people had to face for the freedom that we had achieved, if we go to the Cellular Jail then we will know.
Whenever you get the opportunity, you must go there in a way as the pilgrimage for our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, the 5th June is the first Monday of the month.
Connecting with Nature means nurturing a better planet.
And who can say this better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - One must care about a world one will not see.
That is, we should also take care of the world that we do not want, our duty is to worry about it.
If you are tired and if you open the windows of the room, open the doors, fill the air with fresh air then a new consciousness comes.
When this body of the five great personalities comes in contact with the five great personalities then self-respecting a new consciousness comes in our body- a new energy emerges.
We all have experienced this thing, but we don't know it, we don't connect it in a thread, in a thread.
After this, you must have seen that when you are in touch with the natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge inside you. And that is why we should become a global mission to connect with nature on the 5th of June.
And we are getting some benefit from our ancestors for protecting the environment.
If we protect, our future generations will be benefitted.
In the Vedas, the earth and the environment are considered to be the roots of strength.
And Atharvaveda is in a way the biggest guideline of the environment and it has been written thousands of years ago.
We say, Mother Earth: Son Aham Prithvivaya: The Vedas say that the purity that we have in us is due to our planet.
Earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha then one thing is obvious that the birth of Lord Buddha, his attainment of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana had fallen below three trees.
But we need to link it with modern logic in modern words.
These days, I keep getting news from the states.
In almost every state, a big plantation drive is going on in the rainy season.
Millions of trees are being planted.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has now become the worlds best known day.
The entire world recognizes it as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this 21st June World Yoga Day is spread in every corner, it is connecting people.
On the one hand, when several forces of division are showing their distorted faces in the world, Yoga is a great gift to the world.
We have connected the world with Yoga.
As Yoga connects the body, mind, mind and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, it is becoming difficult to lead a stress-free life due to lifestyle, racing and increasing responsibilities.
And it has been noticed that this situation is also happening in the younger generation.
Yoga has an important role to play in leading a stress free life while taking dietary medicines and passing days.
There is a guarantee for both Yoga wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through Yoga to experience the journey of healthy travel through body, mind, thinking and conduct.
Just two days back, I have written to all the governments and leaders of the world for Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some Yoga related competitions.
Gradually, the work will progress in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and I have been asked to appeal that this time, on the third International Yoga Day, three generations of the same family should join hands.
Whether it is grandparents or grandparents or daughters, all the three generations should do Yoga together and upload their pictures.
Yesterday, if such a wonderful combination of today and tomorrow then Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that the way we had run the Selfie with Daughter campaign and it was a very interesting experience.
These three generations of yoga images will certainly play the skills for the country and the world.
I invite you all.
We still have about three weeks for the International Yoga Week.
Today, the practice has started.
I will continue to post some or the other Yoga related post on Twitter from June 1st and will continue to post on 21st June.
Share with you.
You should also propagate, disseminate and connect people for three weeks continuously.
In a way, it is a movement of privative health care.
I invite all of you to join it.
Because I received a very interesting phone call and I didn't even think about it.
But I am grateful to him for the way he took it.
You will also get to know from this phone call.
Namaste Modi ji, I am Naina from Mumbai.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your call.
The zeal that you had inspired for cleanliness from the valleys of Kashi has now taken the form of a movement.
Your fact is that wherever I go, the government system does the work of cleanliness but during these days there is a festival of cleanliness in the society as well.
Five days prior to my visit, seven days prior to my visit, ten days ago, several sanitation programmes are being organized.
Media also gives a lot of priority to such programmes and just a few days ago I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
You can imagine how much pleasure I might have been able to know that and how the country is taking care of these things in a beautiful manner.
During my journey, the issue of cleanliness has been linked to me. What could be a matter of greater happiness for me
There will be other preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister, but sanitation will be important.
This is also a source of joy and inspiration for any cleanliness lover.
I convey my best wishes to everyone who has helped in the cause of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
However, the suggestion will spread a little romance.
I don't know if I can do that.
Modi ji, before your visit, those who want to invite you, tell them, "Brother, if you want to invite me, what would be the level of cleanliness"
I thought it was very good but I had to think.
However, it is true that it should be started that other items are better than gifts that we should clean so many tons of waste and give it in a gift.
How many people will be able to stop us from becoming sick.
How big will be the work of humanity
One thing I would like to say that the waste that is waste should not be treated as waste, it is a wealth and a source.
Do not look at it just as a garbage.
The Government of India, with the help of State Governments as well as the representatives of the cities, has decided to launch a massive mission of the West Management.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, solid waste and liquid waste will be available in about 4,000 cities of the country.
Two types of waste will be available, one green, the other blue.
Two types of waste are emitted - one liquid waste and the other dry waste.
If we remain in discipline, in those four thousand cities where garbage is required, put dry waste in blue waste and wet waste in green waste, like waste from the kitchen, vegetable thread, waste food, egg harvest or tree leaves, all these are wet waste and put it in green waste.
This entire process is such that it can be used in the fields that the color of the fields is green and you will remember what waste is being used in the green waste.
And the remaining waste like paper, cardboard, iron, glass, clothing, plastic, polythene, broken tables, rubber, metal, and many other useless things are called dry wastes which have to be recycled in the machine.
Just a few days back, you must have heard a news that the Versova Bitch, which was considered dirty in Mumbai, has now become a beautiful clean silver Versova Bitch.
Versova Residence Volunteer (VRV) took over the entire responsibility.
I congratulate Mr. Afroz Shah.
I convey my best wishes to this movement.
And the way he connected the people of the entire region like a folk music and converted it into a Jan Andolan is indeed an inspirational example.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, months and months, be it TV or social media, the accounts of the present government are continuously going on for three years.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Minister.
I see this process as a very positive sign.
This period of three years has been guessed on every case.
People from all walks of life have reviewed it.
This is a great process in democracy.
I clearly believe that governments should be responsible in democracy, people should give account of their work.
For a conscious nation, a conscious nation, this movement is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and as a common citizen, the impact of everything is similar to that of a common man.
Mann Ki Baat sees it as a sided dialogue, some people criticise it politically but after such a long experience, when I started Mann Ki Baat, I didn't even think that Mann Ki Baat would make me a member of every family of India.
It seems as if I sit at home in the midst of my family and talk about home.
And there are hundreds of such families who have sent me by writing these things.
And as I said, as a common man, I have an impact on my mind.
Two days ago, in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Honble President, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker Madam, everyone launched a book Mann Ki Baat, an analytical book, as an individual, as an ordinary citizen, this event is very enthusiastic for me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, whenever I meet you all, there must have been rains in every corner of the country, the atmosphere may have changed, the results of the examinations may have come to an end, the start of the university will start from the new year.
Let us all move ahead in this environment with love and affection for nature.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
Most of those who suggest or try to reach me are those who actually do something in their lives.
And when I came to know that this suggestion is not normal, it has come out of the clutches of experience.
I had never thought that today the youth of our country has been doing this thing for a long time.
Yes, we have been aware of the fact that some social organisations have been working for years. However, the youth of my country are engaged in it.
How many have sent me a video
There are several such places where roti banks run.
People deposit chapatti on their behalf in this roti bank, deposit vegetables and those who need it, they get it from there.
Those who give satisfaction too, those who take it dont have to look down.
This is an example of what kind of work is being done with the cooperation of society.
Today is the end of the month of April.
The first day of May is the establishment day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
On this occasion, many congratulations to the citizens of both the States.
Both the states have strived to scale new heights of development and contributed to the progress of the country.
My best wishes to both these states.
There was a time when climate change was a subject of education, it was a subject of symposium, but today, in our daily lives, we also experience it and express it suddenly.
Nature has changed all rules of sports.
The heat in our country in May-June has come to experience this time in March-April. And when I was receiving suggestions about Mann Ki Baat, people have given me the most suggestions on what should be done in this summer season.
Although lice are popular, it is not new, but at that time its reconstruction is very useful.
Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra and T.
s.
Several friends like Kartik have expressed concern for the birds.
These friends have said that water should be poured on the roof in the balcony and I have seen that the small children of the family are doing this very well.
Once they understand why this water should be filled, then ten times a day that the utensils that have been stored should contain water or not.
We believe that this game is going on, but in reality it is a wonderful experience to inspire the feelings of the child.
Whenever you look at the animals and the birds, you feel a new joy.
However, it is a matter of fact that in our country we are coloured in the colours of animals and birds and nature, but it is essential that such efforts should be strengthened collectively.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, it used to be a hundred years for the Dharmaguru Syedna Saheb of the Dawoodi Bohra community.
I got the opportunity to inaugurate it.
He shared about 52 thousand handicrafts in every corner of the world.
It was also ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that we come to our corners with printers, with milk, with vegetables, with postal, but we forget that there are days of heat.
Young friends, I want to do something with you too.
Sometimes I am worried that our younger generation enjoys spending their lives in Asho-Aram.
Parents also nurture them in a defensive condition.
I believe that some friends will certainly make efforts and will tell me the truth.
Would you use this time of vacation as per my suggestions I make three suggestions, if you implement three of them then it is a very good thing but if you try to implement one of the three then try to do it.
It should be a new experience.
Try to learn new skills.
Whether you have seen or not, whether you have thought or not, but if you feel like going there then try to go there.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
There is a difference between watching something on TV or reading about it in books or hearing from familiars and feeling the same thing on its own.
I would urge you to try to know whatever curiosity you have in this vacation and do a new experiment.
Whether the diamonds are positive or out of comfort, do it.
We belong to a middle class, a happy family.
I don't say that do it again and again, feel it once again.
Whether it is the time of the evening, take your football or polio, or by taking any means of sports, you should reach the poorest of the poor.
Play yourself with those poor kids, you will enjoy such a sport that you may have never met before.
And Im confident that if you go once then you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many volunteers organisations continue to work for service.
Find out the fact that you are associated with Google Guru, please join any such organization for 15 days and 20 days.
But at the same time, if you feel that you have done such a summit, if you have studied individual development then you should reach out to those people who have not got the opportunity to participate in such camps and you should learn those people without taking the money that you have learnt.
You can learn how to develop.
Every person has become busy somewhere with technology.
Community is also a culture, collectivity is a power.
Today is the era of greenery.
Sometimes it is feared that our young generation is not becoming a human robot.
Efforts are being made to spend time with yourself away from technology.
You are learning some narrative of music, you are learning 5-50 words of a new language, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
There are so many diverse countries and if we look at them, one can learn from around us.
You feel like learning car driving, do you ever want to learn auto rickshaws
You have driven a bicycle but the three-wheeled cycle carrying people has ever tried to drive.
You will see that all these new experiments, these schemes are such that will enjoy you. And the life that has been tied to a midwife will also bring you out.
Do something out of box, mate.
This is an opportunity to make life.
And you would be wondering if all the examinations are completed, if you go to a new stage of career then it will not be possible to learn.
Later you will be in another chaos and that is why I will tell you that if you have the hobby of learning magic then learn the miracle of the address.
Keep showing your warmth and affections.
I say from my experience that seeing the world brings so much learning and understanding that we cannot imagine.
This will give you a lot of learning.
I would like that and it is also true that whenever you are going, share your pictures.
What's new
Where did you go
You share your experiences using the hashtag Incredible India.
Friends, this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity.
The Government of India has a scheme.
If the BHIM App you will download, you will also be using it.
But refer to others.
Connect someone else and if a new person does three transactions and if he does economic business thrice then you earn 10 rupees for doing this thing.
10 rupees will be deposited by the Government in your account.
If you get it from 20 people in a day then by evening you will earn 200 rupees.
Traders can also earn, students can also earn.
And the scheme is till 14th October.
You will contribute to making Digital India.
You will become a steward of a New India.
So vacation and earnings of income.
In a way, it had become a symbol of VIP culture, but experience tells us that the red light used to be on the vehicle, it used to be on the vehicle, but it used to slip into the mind and it was mentally VIP cultured.
Whether a red light has just gone on, no one can claim that the red light that has been snatched in the brain will be removed.
I received a very interesting phone call.
Well, he has expressed his apprehension in that phone, but now this phone call is estimated that the common man does not like these things.
It feels like getting away from it.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I am calling Shiva Chaube from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I want to say something about the red beacon light ban of the government.
I read a line in the Newspaper which stated that it was a matter of great pride for me to hear the ever Indian is a VIP on a road. And I was also happy that today my time is equally important.
I don't get stuck in traffic jams and I don't even have to stop for anyone.
I would like to thank you very much for this decision.
And our country is not only cleaning the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan but also cleaning the VIP liability on our roads so that the red light is a part of the system with the gratitude of the government.
But we have to take it out with our hearts.
If we all make a concerted effort, we will be able to come out.
Our concept of New India is to increase the importance of EPI in place of VIPs in the country.
And when I am saying EPI in place of VIP then my feeling is clear - Everry Person is Important.
Every individual has a significance, every person has a great importance.
If we accept the importance of 1. 25 billion Indians, if we accept the majesty of 1. 25 billion Indians then how powerful it will be to fulfil the great dreams.
We all have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that we should keep reminding ourselves of history, our culture, our traditions.
It gives us energy and inspiration.
This year, we are celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of the 125 crore countrymen, Sant Ramanujacharya ji.
We have become so small because of some reason that we have been thinking for the maximum number of centuries.
Century is of immense importance to other countries of the world.
But India is such an ancient nation that we have got the opportunity to commemorate the memories of thousands of years old and thousands of years old in its fate.
What would happen a thousand years ago
Very few people would be aware that Ramanujacharya ji had fought a great deal against the evils in the society, the feeling of humiliation, the feeling of casteism.
Through his own conduct, the society, which was considered untouchable, was swallowed up by him.
Thousands of years ago, he had a movement to enter his temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that in every era, a great man is born from our society to eradicate the evils of our society.
When we celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of Sant Ramanujacharya ji, then take inspiration from him for social unity, for organisational strength.
The Government of India is also going to release a stamp in memory of Sant Ramanujacharya on May 1st.
I salute Sant Ramanujacharya Ji and pay my tributes.
My dear countrymen, yesterday, 1st May has a different significance.
It is also celebrated as a day of labour in many parts of the world.
Labour is a matter of discussion and when it comes to Labourers then it is very natural for me to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And very few people would be aware that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the facilities that are available to the workers today.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb, I talk about Sant Ramnujacharya ji, I also remember the great saint and social reformer of the 12th century Karnataka, Jagat Guru Basaveshwar ji.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to attend an event.
This was an occasion for the public dedication of the collections of his promises.
In other words, labour is Shiva.
Today, when I talk about labour, it is very natural to remember Dattapanth Thangdi Ji.
My dear countrymen, a few days later we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world celebrate the festival.
The problems that the world is facing today, the competition for violence, war, destruction and arms...
When we look at this environment then the ideas of Buddha appear very relevant.
And in India, Ashok's life is an excellent symbol of Buddha's journey from war.
I am fortunate that on this great festival of Buddha Purnima, vesak day is celebrated by United Nations.
This year it is going to be held in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
They will get an opportunity to refresh their memories.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And especially for our neighbouring countries.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 26th March, 2019
My dear countrymen, my greetings to all of you, most of the families in the country will be busy in examining their children.
Those whose examinations have been completed will have a slightly light environment and those families where the examination is going on, there will still be some concern.
But at this time, I will say that the last time I listen to the things that I have done to the students in Mann Ki Baat.
You will definitely be able to use that conversation at the time of the examination.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is the day of Bangladeshs independence.
A historic battle against injustice was the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
On this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizen brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day. And I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development within the entire region.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are our shared heritage.
Bangladesh's national song is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in the year 113 and the British gave him the Nighthood Prize.
Three days before today, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh ji and his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British. And we all know the incident of 23rd March - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had the satisfaction of serving Mother India - there was no danger of death.
Mothers of all dreams of life had sacrificed their lives for the freedom of India.
And these three brave hearts are still the inspiration of all of us.
We cannot decorate the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the entire British Sultanate was afraid of these three daughters.
The prisons were closed, the hangings were fixed, but how did they move forward along with that, it was anxious to the terrorists.
And it was only then that we had to get trapped on 24th March, but on 23rd March it was left behind.
Phansi was smuggled away from the burglary, which is not usually done.
And then the British quietly burnt their bodies in today's Punjab.
A few years ago when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time then I used to feel a kind of wave on that land.
And I would like to tell the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity to go to Punjab then it is necessary to replace the memorials of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singhs mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the period when the zeal of freedom, its intensity and its zeal were rising.
On the one hand, the heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired many youngsters for the armed revolution. Just a hundred years ago, on 10th April, 11th, Mahatma Gandhi performed Champaran Satyagraha.
This Champaran is the centenary year of Satyagraha.
Gandhian thoughts and Gandhian ways in India's freedom movement were first reflected in Champaran.
This was a major turning point in the entire movement of freedom.
Particularly in terms of methods of struggle, during this period, the Satyagraha of Champaran, Satyagraha of Kheda, and the bravery of the workers in Ahmedabad, all of them witnessed the enormous impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and work culture.
In 1915, Gandhi came back from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1919 and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Imagine a person who came back to India in 1915, a tenure of only two years.
Neither the country knew them nor did they have an impact. It was still the beginning.
We can imagine the hardships and hard work they must have suffered at that time.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that the organisational skills of Mahatma Gandhi, the pulse of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, through his behaviour Mahatma Gandhi, organising, motivating, inspiring and bringing the poorest and the most destitute to the struggle against the British Sultanate, showcases this wonderful vision.
And that is why we feel the brilliance of Mahatma Gandhi in this form.
But if we think about Gandhiji a hundred years ago, it is a matter of great study for Champaran Satyagraha, for any person who started public life.
We can learn from them how to start a public life, how to work ourselves and how Gandhi worked.
And this was the time when we heard the names of the big giant leaders who had sent them to the villages be it Rajendra Babu or Acharya Kripalani ji.
He had to learn the way people were working with the people and the way they were colouring it with the color of freedom.
And the British could not understand what was the manner in which Gandhiji's methods and struggles were going on, creation was going on and both of them walked together.
Gandhi knew that a coin was made on two sides.
Conflicts on one side of coin and on the other side.
On the one hand you will fill the jail and on the other hand you will find yourself in constructive activities .
There was a wonderful balance in Gandhiji's work culture.
What is the word 'Satyagraha', what can be the word 'Satyagraha', what can be the disagreement, what is the disadvantage of such a massive Sultanate, which was established by Gandhi not only by words but by a successful experiment.
This is the desire of the 1. 25 billion Indians for this transformation and this is the effort of this transformation that will lay the foundation of New India and New India.
New India is neither a government programme nor a political party polling booth nor a project.
This is the feeling that 1. 25 billion Indians want to make a grand India together.
There is hope in the minds of 1. 25 billion Indians, there is a sense of joy, a resolve and a desire.
My dear countrymen, if we go a little away from our lives and strive to find out what is happening in our society with an emotional vision then we will be surprised to know that the millions of people are selflessly looking at something for the society, for the exploited, the deprived, the deprived and the poor and the unhappy.
And he keeps doing penance like a servant while doing penance.
Many people go to a regular hospital and help patients.
Many people who know that they run for blood immediately.
There are many people who worry about their food if they are hungry.
Our country is Bahuratna Basundhara.
This mantra of public service is in our blood.
Once we want it in the form of a collectivity, in an organised manner, we will know how powerful it is.
When it comes to New India, it is very natural to criticize it, to get into consideration and to look at it from a different perspective and it is a welcome welcome in the democracy.
But it is true that if 1. 25 billion Indians make a solemn pledge, if they make a solemn pledge then the dream of New India - 1. 25 billion Indians can be realised before our eyes.
And it is not necessary that everything should be done by the budget, whether it is the government project or the government money.
If every citizen makes a solemn pledge that I will follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen makes a solemn pledge that I will fulfil my responsibilities with full accreditation and dedication, if every citizen makes a solemn pledge that one day in a week I will not use petrol and diesel in my life then how big changes can be brought about.
It means that every citizen obeys his civic religion and obeys his duty.
This can be a good beginning for a New India.
My dear countrymen, I also thank you today.
In the last few days, such an environment has been created in our country and a large number of people have become part of Digital Payments and Digital Movement.
The curiosity of how transactions can be done without cash has also increased.
The poorest of the poor people are also trying to learn and gradually people are moving towards how to do business without cash.
Digital payments have seen a substantial increase since demonetization and post demonetization.
With the launch of BHIM App, it has been only 2-3 months but almost 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it so far.
My dear countrymen, we have to move ahead with the fight against black money and corruption. Can 1. 25 billion Indians make a solemn pledge to work on 1. 25 billion digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
For 1. 25 billion Indians, if they want to do this thing then they dont have to wait for a year, they can do it in six months.
2500 crore digital transactions. If we want to pay the fee for appointment then we will not pay the money in cash, we will have to travel in the railways and if we want to travel in the plane then we will pay the digital payments if we buy the medicines then we will pay the digital payments.
We can do this in everyday life.
You cannot imagine but you can serve the country very well and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
In the past, several programmes have been organized for the Digital Mela for public education.
It is a pledge to have 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
It also included a prize scheme.
Nearly 1. 5 lakh people have received this reward from the consumer.
0 thousand people have received the prize for traders.
And everyone has pledged to carry forward this work.
And many times, as was decided earlier, on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar will be the culmination of the Digidhan Mela.
After a hundred days of completion, the last big event is going to be held.
Very big drones have also been installed in it.
I am confident that we should propagate Bhima App in whatever time we have saved on Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
Let us contribute to the reduction in cash transactions, reduction in transactions with notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I ask people to give instructions for Mann Ki Baat, every kind of suggestions come.
But I have seen that the people of every country have been urging for cleanliness.
I would like to talk to you in my heart.
I want to say that people have to understand how important cleanliness is.
Every day I pass by a river in which people throw lots of garbage and pollute the river.
They come to my house flowing by the river Rispana bridge.
Several people have spoken about it but it has not benefitted from it.
And the best thing is that Gayatri herself is expressing her anger, instructing me and also telling me that she has made many attempts but it has been unsuccessful.
Awareness has started since the beginning of the Swachhta movement.
Every person has been connected to it positively.
It has also taken the form of a movement.
Hate towards dirt is also increasing.
Whether it is awareness, active participation or movement, all of them have their own importance.
But Swachhata is associated with the habits of movement.
This movement is a movement to change the habits, it is a movement to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can be done in a collective manner.
The work is difficult but it has to be done.
I believe that this spirit has emerged in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students and in the youth and this is a good result.
Today, those who are listening to Gayatri in my Mann Ki Baat programme, I will tell all those countrymen that this message of Gayatri should become a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I have been talking about Mann Ki Baat since the beginning, I have received a lot of suggestions and most of the people have expressed concern about the waste of food.
We know that we take more food than required in the family and in the community food festivals.
Everything that is visible is taken in the pouch and it cannot be eaten.
We cannot eat half of the amount of potatoes we fill and we can move ahead only after keeping them there.
You have just imagined how much damage we have done to the food we have left behind.
Have you ever thought that if we dont waste food then we can fill the stomach of some poor people
Despite efforts being made by someone, depression on this subject is a social treachery.
There is injustice to the poor.
I am not appealing much on this subject but I want to raise awareness.
His life inspires us not to waste food.
We should eat as much as we need.
See, these are the solutions for change.
And those who are aware of the health of the body always say - keep a little stomach empty, keep some plates empty.
We are also familiar with the word depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are suffering from mental depression.
The problem is that there are people around us but we are not able to recognize them and perhaps we are constrained to speak openly on this subject.
Those who are suffering from depression themselves don't even speak because they themselves feel embarrassed about it.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not such a disease that cannot be freed.
There is a need to create a psychological environment and the first mantra to come out of it is that instead of depression, it requires an accommodation.
Talk openly with your friends, friends, parents, brothers and sisters and teachers about what you are feeling.
Sometimes one feels loneliness and especially students staying in the hostels face more problems.
Families are large, they live there, which is unlikely to cause depression.
However, I would like to tell my parents that if you have seen that any member of your daughter or daughter or family should sit with everyone and say that I will not go there anymore, then it will not come on the table.
You should understand that this is the first step towards depression.
If he does not like to live in a group and lives in a single corner then try to keep in mind that it should not happen.
This is the best solution.
And depression is the cause of mental and physical illness.
As diabetes is hosting every disease, similarly depression also eliminates our capabilities of sustaining, fighting, venture and decision-making.
Your friends, your family, your campus and your atmosphere can stop you from going to depression and if you have gone then you can quickly get out of it.
Help with your heart, share their happiness and grief, you will feel that the pain within you will be cured.
If you try to understand their sorrows and do them with service then a new confidence will emerge within you.
By connecting with others, serving someone and serving selflessly, your mind will be lightened.
Yoga is also a good way to keep mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in getting rid of stress, getting rid of pressure and moving towards happiness.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga and this is the third year.
All of you make preparations and celebrate Yoga festival in lakhs of numbers.
If you have any suggestions on the 3rd International Day of Yoga, send me through the mobile application.
Whatever songs and poetic creations can be prepared about Yoga, it should be prepared so that it can be easily understood by the people.
But along with work, women also have special responsibilities.
They also take care of family responsibilities and collaborate in the economic responsibilities of the family, which often leads to injustice to their newborn children.
At that time, the Government of India has taken a very important decision that the Maternity Leave which was earlier 12 weeks old has now been increased to 26 weeks.
There are only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this regard.
If this happens then our children will grow up to make the country's priceless.
It will also ensure health of mothers and will be an important decision for this.
This will benefit approximately 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
May the lives of all these great men continue to inspire us, and may the resolve of a New India be fulfilled.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukalp, Year End, Nine Samvatsar, I convey my best wishes to all of you for this new year.
This is auspicious time for farmers to start harvesting after the spring season.
Nine years are celebrated in different forms in different parts of the country.
Mann Ki Baat (2nd mark)
Flowers bloom.
Not only the flowers, the fruits on the tree branches are visible in the sun.
Fruits of summer season are also seen in the spring season.
On the other hand, yellow flowers of mustard in the field give hope to the farmers.
The flower of saffron indicates the arrival of holi.
Amir Khusro has described the moments of climate change.
Amir Khusro has written: When the nature is happy, when the weather is beautiful, the people also enjoy this season.
The festivals of Vasant Panchami, Maha Shivratri and Holi enhance the colours of happiness in the lives of human beings.
In an environment full of love, brotherhood and humanity, we have to leave for the last month and we are ready to welcome the new month Chaitra.
This is a coincidence of two months.
At the outset, I express my gratitude to the millions and millions of citizens of the country for the fact that whenever I ask for my suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of suggestions.
I have written on the Narendra ModiApp that a lot of people are not recognised by the accomplishments of ISRO. Therefore, he said, I have left 104 satellites and you have some information about interceptor missiles.
I am extremely grateful to you all for the pride and pride of India.
Be it poverty alleviation or be it prevention of diseases or be it attachment to the world or be it knowledge or be it access to information or be it technology, science has made its place everywhere.
15 February 2019 is a day of pride in Indias life.
Our scientists have made India proud of the world.
And we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions over the years.
After the success of the Mars Mission Mangalyaan on Mars, ISRO has created a world record in the field of space in recent days.
And it is heartening to note that this is the 38th successful launch of PSLV.
It is a historic achievement not only for ISRO but also for the entire India.
ISRO's Coast Effective Efficient Space Programme has become a surprise for the entire world and I appreciate the success of India's scientists.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 satellites is very important.
Cartosat-2D is the satellite of India and through it, it will be of great help in planning Urban Development.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, what kind of water resources are there in the country, how it can be used, what should be taken care of, our new satellite catrosat-2D will be of great help.
As soon as our satellite left, we also sent a few photos.
He has started his work.
It is also a matter of great pleasure for us that this entire mission has been led by our young scientists, our women scientists.
This enormous partnership of youth and women is a proud aspect of ISROs success.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
The more we pay our entire team to these scientists, the less it is.
Acharya Ji has asked another question and that is India's security, India has achieved a great achievement in this regard.
There has not been much talk of this thing at present, but the attention of the beauty has gone to this important point.
India has also successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor Missile in defence sector.
The interception technologies enabled the Missile to be successfully destructed at an altitude of about 100 km from the ground during its testing.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security.
And its specialty is that even if India comes to an attack from a distance of 200 kilometres, it will destroy it in this missile space.
Whenever we want new technologies and new scientific achievements, we are happy.
And inquisitiveness has played a very big role in the development journey of human life.
And those who possess the unique intellectual talent do not let the curiosity remain in the form of curiosity. They also raise questions within them, discover new curiosity, create new curiosity.
And this curiosity becomes the reason for innovation.
Until they get the answer, they keep on sitting on their feet.
And if we observe the journey of human life for thousands of years then we can say that this journey of development of human life is not complete.
Full break is impossible.
Efforts are made to know Brahmanda, the rules of creation and the mind of mankind.
New science and new technologies emerge from them.
And every technology gives birth to a new era of every new science.
My dear young friends, when we talk of the hard work of science and scientists, I often mention the fact that our youth should be attracted towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientific future becomes a cause for a stable change in the lives of generations to come.
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a very unique competition on the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Invitations were made for social innovation.
How to identify, showcase such innovations, give information to the people and how such innovations work for the common man, how to use them for their hard-working products, how to do business.
Many times the problem also reflects the importance of science for solutions.
In the year 2005, when there was rains, floods and seas in Mumbai, there was a lot of trouble, crisis and whenever there was a natural calamity then the first crisis came to the poor.
The two brothers worked very consciously towards it, and they built a house that saves the people living in the depths, saves them from water logging, and also protects them from water-logged diseases.
And our society also becomes technology-driven.
Arrangements are also made technology-based.
In a way, technology is becoming a part of our lives.
In the past, there was a lot of importance on digital payments.
Gradually, people are moving ahead from the bank to the Digital movement.
In India too, digital transactions are growing at a rapid pace.
In particular, youngsters are habituating digital payments with their mobile phones.
I convey my best wishes to them.
In our country, the Lucky Consumer Scheme Digidhan Business Scheme has received immense support in the last few days.
It has been almost two months and 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And through these two schemes, an initiative to make digital payments a mass movement in India has been welcomed across the country.
And it is heartening to note that under the DigiDhan Yojana so far, 10 lakh people have received prizes, more than 50 thousand traders have received prizes and more than 1.
Under this scheme, most of the consumers are those who have received a prize of Rs. 1 lakh.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received a reward of fifty fifty thousand rupees.
Whether it is a farmer, a trader, a small entrepreneur, a businessman, a housewife, a student, everyone is enthusiastic about this scheme.
From Mysore, Shriman Santosh ji happily wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he received a reward of Rs. 1,000 under the Lucky Consumer Scheme.
But I want to tell you that they have written the biggest thing.
He said that I received a reward of Rs. 1,000 and at that time I came to know that a poor old woman had a fire in her house.
When the goods were burnt to death, I felt that perhaps the poorest of the poor mothers had a right on the rewards I received, then I gave them thousands of rupees.
You have done a very inspiring job.
It keeps on enlightening these digitals for a long time.
They keep saying things with such enthusiasm and encourage others.
I would like to appeal to the countrymen, especially the youth of the country, to the Lucky Grahak Yojana or to the rewards they have received from the Digital Business Scheme that you yourself have become its ambassador.
You take it forward and it is an anti-corruption activity in a way.
In a way you are a soldier of ethics.
You are aware that on 14th April, when the Lucky Consumer Scheme is completed, Dr.
It's a memorable day.
On 14th April, a mix of Rs.
There are still about forty-five days left.
Can you do one thing after remembering Babasaheb Ambedkar
Recently, the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar was celebrated.
Remembering them, you must learn to download at least 125 people while downloading the Bhim App.
You must learn how this leads to transactions and especially the small traders around you.
This time Babasaheb Ambedkar's Jayanti and Bhima App, I would like to say that Dr.
This movement has been going on for the past two-three months and several townships, several villages and several cities have achieved great success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture contributes a lot to the roots of our countrys economy.
The economic strength of the village gives strength to the economic growth of the country.
I would like to tell you that today it is a matter of great happiness.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have laboured hard and filled the store of food.
This year, record food has been produced by the hard work of the farmers in our country.
Every indicator is saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time there was such a rift in the fields that it seemed as if the pong and baisakhi were wasted today.
This year, more than 2,700 lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is 8 more than the last record in the name of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I also want to thank the farmers because they cultivate different pulses keeping in mind the poor of the country along with the traditional crops because the poor get the highest protein from pulses.
I am glad that the farmers of my country have heard the voice of the poor and they have cultivated pulses on nearly 9 lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service provided by the farmers to the poor of my country.
My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special gratitude for the way the farmers of my country have made records by working hard on their roots.
My countrymen, in this country, the government, the society, the institutions, the organisations, everybody has something to do with the direction of cleanliness.
In a way, everyone is seen to be aware of cleanliness in some form or the other.
And in the state of Telangana, it was not just a seminar in the closed rooms of the state, but also an experiment on the importance of cleanliness.
On 1-18 February, a Toilet Pit Exercise was organised in Hyderabad.
The toilets of six houses were cleaned by evacuating the toilet pits and the officials themselves showed that the empty empty empty pit toilets could be re-experimented.
He also demonstrated how comfortable the toilets of new technology are and there is no inconvenience in sanitation, there is no constraint, there is no psychological barrier.
And we can clean a toilet so that we can clean it.
And the result of this effort was that when an IAS officer himself cleanses the toilet then it is natural for the country to pay attention to it.
And from the toilet pit that we consider waste, but from the point of view of fertilizer it is equal to black gold.
We can see what is happening from the waste to wealth.
And this has been proved.
A standard "Twin Pit Toilet" model for the family of six members gets filled in about five years.
After that, the waste can be easily removed and redirected to another pit.
The waste collected in pits in six to twelve months is completely decomposed.
These decomposed wastes are very safe in handling and are very important in terms of fertilizer fertilizer NPK.
Farmers are very well familiar with NPK.
And now a special programme is being organized in Doordarshan.
The more light these things will be, the greater it will be.
Several departments also consider Swachhata Pakhwada in the government.
In the first fortnight of the month of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development along with them Tribal Affairs Ministry will give a boost to the cleanliness drive.
And in the second fortnight of March, two more Ministries, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will also take forward the last two weeks cleanliness drive in March.
We know that whenever a poor citizen of our country does something good then the whole country feels a new energy, it feels a lot of confidence.
We all welcomed the exhibition that our Divyang players performed at the Rio Paralympics.
In the finals of the Blind T-20 World Cup held this month, India has made the country proud by defeating Pakistan for the second consecutive World Championship.
It is a matter of pride for our Divyang friends of the country.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, determined, brave and determined.
Every time we learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anyone.
He has been moving ahead with a lot of hard work and has been encouraging the country with his achievements.
In the last few days, our women sportspersons won Silver Medal in Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy.
My best wishes to all those players.
8th March marks the World Womens Day.
To give importance to children in India as well as to increase their awareness and sensitivity in family and society.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is progressing very fast.
Today it is not just a government programme, it has become a social sensitivity and a campaign for public education.
During the last two years, the programme has connected the common man.
In every corner of the country, these vivid issues have forced people to think and have brought about a change in the thinking of the people towards the old ways that have been going on for years.
When it comes to the news that a festival was celebrated on the birth of a child, it is a matter of great pleasure.
In a way, positive thinking towards children is becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that Children and Children have been banned under a special campaign in the Cuddalore district of the state of Tamil Nadu.
More than 15 childbirths have been prevented so far.
The District Administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand girls under the Sukanya Samridhi Yojana.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme and in addition to organizing Gram Sabhas, efforts are being made to ensure that the orphan girls get their education through the district administration.
Under the Har Ghar Dastak programme in Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being run to provide education to the girl child from village to village.
The children who had been drop-out in Rajasthan have been re-schoolized and motivated to re-school their children.
It means that the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement has taken several forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement.
New ideas are associated with it.
It has been slopped as per local requirements.
I consider it a good sign when we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we have the same feeling.
My dear countrymen, you have got the opportunity to discuss something at various times in Mann Ki Baat. Women is that power, empowered, it is the woman of India.
I know a lot from you.
What is happening on earth, what is happening in the minds of the village and the poor reaches me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
In the past, we have celebrated many festivals.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Sri Krishna was celebrated throughout India.
And every person can find solutions to the present problems in the life of Shree Krishna.
Sometimes it is an innovation to pick up plates, that is, in everything.
And that is why when I talk to you today, I look forward to two charms.
Thousands of years ago, Sudarshan Chakraborty had used his intellect, his duties, his capabilities and his thoughts to fight the war.
And even Charkha Dhari Mohan chose such a path that for the sake of freedom, for the preservation of human values, for strengthening the essence of individuality, he gave such a glimpse to the people of freedom which is surprising for the entire world.
Be it the importance of selfless service or be it the importance of knowledge or be it the importance of laughing at all things in life, all these things can be learnt from the message of Lord Sri Krishna.
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is preparing for a bigger festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but all over the world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Those who gave a new dimension to human history, set new dimensions.
One thing has always been associated with Mahatma Gandhi, in a way it has become a part of his life.
Anyone, whenever required, was always present for Mahatma Gandhis service.
He not only gave importance to service but also emphasized on the spirituality associated with it.
We can understand this very well from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, society, humanity and humanity were all the same.
Be it Phoenix Farm in Africa, Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Vardha Ashram, in a unique way, he stressed upon social upliftment and community mobility.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to go and bow down to several important places associated with the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi serving stressed on organisationalism.
Social service and social reform, community service and community community service and community mobilisation are the emotions that we can bring to our lives.
In the true sense, this is the true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.
No, my countrymen.
And collectivity has its own strength.
All these programmes of the Gandhi Symposium include collectiveness and service.
Why shouldn't we come out together
If we are a football team, we will not only play football teams but will also work together to serve Gandhian ideals.
We can do a lot, we can collect old books and share them among the poor and spread knowledge.
And I believe that perhaps 130 crore Indians have 130 crore ideas and 130 crore enterprises.
Whether it is goodwill, goodwill, goodwill and dedicated service, it is also done for the feeling of selfless happiness, a unique joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha and Dandi are important turning points in the freedom struggle.
I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
I urge you all to visit some of the places associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
These can be any place.
Be it Porbandar or Sabarmati Ashram or Vardhan Ashram or be it associated with Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
And also write two or four words expressing your emotions.
Several programmes, competitions, exhibitions have also been organized in the coming days.
But one thing is very interesting in this regard, which I would like to share with you.
Venice Biennel is a well-known art programme which collects artists from all over the world.
This time a very interesting exhibition related to Gandhijis memories has been put up in the India Pavilion of Venice Biennial.
The pictures of Haripura were specially interesting in this.
You might remember that the Congress session was held in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhas Chandra Bose was elected as the Chairperson, was also included in the history.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and exhibition of his art work during the session.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose artwork enhances the beauty of our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
And his art instruments have made Nandal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nandal Bose visited the neighbouring villages of Haripura and then made some artistic pictures depicting the lives of rural India.
Venice of precious artefacts was highly discussed.
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I look forward to making a solemn pledge from all Indians.
Something should be done for the country, for the society, for the sake of any endurance.
You must be reminded that in the last few years, we have been running the same service campaign for nearly two weeks before the second October.
This time the campaign will start from 11th September.
During the campaign, we will go out of our homes and pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdaan.
Whether it is a house, a street, a chowk or a drain, a school or a college, we will run a massive campaign of cleanliness at all public places.
This time, we have given special emphasis on plastics.
Similarly, we have to eliminate single use plastic.
This time on the second October when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will not only dedicate ourselves to an Open Defecation Free India but will also lay the foundation for a new folk movement against plastic across the country.
I appeal to all sections of the society, to every village, to the residents of small towns, to join hands and pray that this year we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti in a way as a liberation from plastic waste.
2nd October as a special day.
On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti, let us celebrate a special Shramdaan.
All municipalities, municipalities, district-rural systems, rural panchayats, government-ruled systems, all the organizations, every citizen, every citizen of the country, everybody is urging me to make proper arrangements for collection and maintenance of plastic waste.
I also appeal to the corporate sector that when all these plastic wastes are collected, they should come forward and settle down for proper disposal.
It can be recycled.
This can make fuel.
This is the way we can finish the work of safe disposal of plastic waste by this Diwali.
There is a need for a resolution.
There is no need to see the spirit for inspiration.
Who can be a bigger inspiration than Gandhi
My dear countrymen, in a way our Sanskrit defined is a composition of knowledge.
Whatever we want in life, we can get from it.
My connectivity with them has come down recently.
But earlier my contact was very high.
Today, I want to touch a very important issue with a Sanskrit definition.
And these are the things that were written centuries ago but how important it is even today
One of the best described and said, Prithvian Trinity Ratnani, Jalam Annam Subhasitam, Moodhya: Pathanakhandesh's Ratna Sanjna Pradityette or the three scriptures that are water, food and defined in the earth.
Capital stone is called Ratna.
There is a lot of food in our culture.
Even then, we have transformed the knowledge of food into science.
Balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and young children, because they are the foundation of the future of our society.
People are fighting against malnutrition in a new and interesting manner.
Once upon a time, one thing was brought about in my mind.
NASIC has become a big movement for 'Clean Wealth'.
Anganwadi workers collect food grains during crop harvesting days.
These cereals are used to cook fresh food for children and women.
The person who donates it becomes an awakening citizen, a social worker.
After that, he himself is dedicated to this goal and he becomes a soldier of this movement.
We all have heard about the food-processing culture in every nook and corner of India.
This is done when the child starts feeding for the first time solid food.
This is a very beautiful initiative that can be adopted.
In many states, people run the Third Food Campaign.
If someone in the family has a good birthday, a good day or a memorable day, then the family members go to Anganwadi by making nutritious meals and tasty meals and go to schools and the family members themselves serve, feed, share their happiness and increase their happiness.
There is a wonderful combination of service and joy.
Friends, There are so many small things that our country can fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both poor and happy families are suffering from malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as a Poshan Abhiyan across the country.
However, I have joined the youth of the world and I had never thought that I would become a place in the hearts of the youth of our country and the world.
I had never imagined how diverse things our country and the youth of the world pay attention to.
I had never thought that there would be any opportunity in my life to touch the youth of the world.
And I went to Bhutan last week.
I have seen that as Prime Minister, I have got the opportunity to visit anywhere. And due to International Day of Yoga, the situation has become such that if I meet and sit in the world then someone asks me about Yoga for five-seven minutes.
Discovery has organised this programme in 165 countries.
Today, as the environment, global warming and climate change are taking place, I hope that this Application of Discovery Channel will greatly help Indias message, India's tradition, India's sensitivity towards nature in the journey of Sanskrit.
And people now want to know about the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in our country.
But one more interesting thing is that some people ask me shyly, Modi ji tells me that if you used to speak Hindi and not know Beer Grills Hindi then how could you talk to you so fast
Or later, it has been edited.
He asks with great curiosity.
Look, there is nothing hidden in it.
How many people have this question in their minds I can declare that secret.
Anyway, it is not a secret.
In fact, technology is being used extensively in interaction with beer grills.
It was simultaneously translated and in the ears of Beer Grills, a small cordless instrument was installed so that it could be used in English.
However, I used to say Hindi but it used to happen in English and it used to make dialogue easier and this is the wonder of technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit places related to nature and wildlife nature and other creatures.
I have said this thing before and I assert that I should definitely visit Ishaan Bharat in your life.
The world inside you will expand.
On 15th August, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I had urged all of you to visit at least 15 places in India in the next three years.
Go to 15 such places with the aim of 100 tourism, see, study, take the family, spend some time there.
A country full of diversity, you too will be filled with diversity as a teacher.
Your life will be expanded.
Your thoughts will be broadened.
And trust me that there are places within India from where you will come with new zeal, new enthusiasm, new zeal and new inspiration.
Your family will also feel like this.
My dear countrymen, the environmental care and anxiety in India is clearly visible.
Last month, I was fortunate to announce the tiger population in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
A resolution was taken to express concern over the declining population of tigers in the world.
The pledge was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is the New India that we are realizing the goal in the near future.
We doubled the population of tigers in 2019.
In India, not only tiger population but also the number of reserved areas and community reserved areas has increased.
When I was announcing the tiger population, I also remembered the lions of Gir in Gujarat.
When I took charge of the Chief Minister there, the area of residence of lions was shrinking in the forest of Gir.
Their numbers were decreasing.
We took one step after another in Gir.
In 2009, it was decided to upgrade the women guards there.
Infrastructure reforms to boost tourism
Whenever we talk of nature and wildlife, we talk of conservation only.
But now we have to move ahead from defence to think about compassion and compassion.
Our sciences have found great guidance in this regard.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic address of Swami Vivekanand Ji on September 11, 183
The young Sannyasis of India, who triggered humanity across the globe, had left India's vibrant identity in the world.
The way Swami Vivekananda ji saw India, Swami Vivekananda ji knew the strength of India, let us try to live it.
We have everything inside us, let us come out with confidence.
My dear countrymen, you must remember that 2nd August is celebrated as the Sports Day.
On this occasion, we are going to launch Fit India Movement Clean India Campaign across the country.
My dear countrymen, I will look forward to you, on 2nd August, in Fit India, in the month of September, in the Poshan Abhiyan, and especially in the 2nd October Swachhta Abhiyan and on 2nd October, the entirely dedicated space liberation.
Let us come out with a new zeal, a new resolve and a new energy.
My dear countrymen, this is the same thing in Mann Ki Baat today.
I'll meet you again.
I will look forward to your suggestions.
Come, let us all come together to build the India of the dreams of freedom fighters, to realise Gandhi's dreams - Swatantra Sukhaya, let us leave the joy of distance with service.
Namaste.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with fervor and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
I hope that at all levels, every time, the importance that is given to the rights, the same importance should be given to them.
India's democracy can move forward at a rapid pace only on two pages of rights and duties.
Tomorrow is the 30th of January, the death anniversary of our revered Bapu.
On January 30, we all pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country by keeping a silence of 2 minutes at 11.
As a society, as a nation, on January 30, at 11 o'clock, a two-minute tribute must be a comfortable one.
Why not only for two minutes but also for collectivity, determination and martyrdom.
In our country, there is a simple respect for the armed forces and the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I convey my best wishes to the brave soldiers and their families who have been honoured with various gallantry awards.
The awards consist of several categories like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Special Service Medal.
I especially urge the youngsters, you are very active in social media.
You can do one thing The brave hearts who have received this honour - look at the network, write two good words related to it and spread it among your colleagues.
We are also surprised, proud and inspired when we are aware of their courage, bravery and valour.
On the one hand, when we were all happy with the news of the enthusiasm and zeal of 26 January, our soldiers in Kashmir were brave due to the avalanche.
I pay my homage to all those brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are very well aware of the fact that I continue to do Mann Ki Baat.
January-February-March-April, all these months are months of distress for each family.
There is a test of one or two children at home but the entire family is buried under the burden of examination.
So I was convinced that this is the right time that I should talk to the students friends, talk to their parents, their teachers, because for many years whenever I visited the place, the examination was a major cause of distress.
A strange psychological environment is seen in every household in terms of family distress, student depression, teacher tension.
And I always feel that we should get out of it. And that is why today I want to talk to young friends in some detail.
When I announced this topic, several teachers, parents and students sent me a message, they also expressed their pain and told me about the difficulties and I got the idea that I would like to talk to you today.
I received a telephone message from the universe.
So I would like to ask you whether this atmosphere cannot be happy
The question has been asked by Christ but this question will be in your minds.
Exams should be an occasion of happiness in itself.
It should be a festival of fervor and enthusiasm that has worked hard throughout the year and now it is time to showcase.
There are very few people for whom exams are happy, while exams are a pressure for most people.
It is to be decided that you will be happy to consider it as a pressure.
Whatever will be happy will be achieved and the pressure will be preferred.
And that is why I believe that examination is a festival, take the exam in such a way that when there is a festival, when there is a festival, the best in us comes out.
The power of the society is also felt on the occasion of the festival.
We generally feel that how disgusting we are, but if we look at the arrangements for the Kumbh Congregation that lasted for 40-45 days then we will know what is the Make Shift Arrangement and what is the discipline of the people.
This is the strength of the festival.
Even during the examination, there should be a festival in the entire family, friends and neighbours.
You will see that this pressure will be converted into happiness.
Festivals will make the environment free of burden.
And I would like to urge the parents here to make it a festival for three-four months.
It is our responsibility to change these three-four months every year into a festival by understanding our traditions and the environment of our family.
And that is why I will tell you that Smile More, Score More.
You must have seen that when you are happy, you see yourself relaxed, you can easily relax and when you are relaxed, you will also easily remember the old things of yours.
A year ago, the entire scene of what the teacher had said in classroom will be remembered.
And you should know that the power to re-college the memory is the highest in the relaxation.
If you are in tension then every door is closed, it does not go inside and it does not come out.
The thought process stops, which becomes a booze in itself.
You must have seen in the examination that you remember everything, the chopper is remembered, the topic is remembered, the leaf chromosome is remembered, it is written upwards, it is also remembered downwards.
Why didn't you remember inside, there was pressure.
But the person who was inside immediately came out and it came out that you were relaxed.
And that is why it is relaxation if any medicine is the biggest medicine to recall the memory.
And I say on the basis of self-confidence that if there is pressure then we forget our things. And if there is a relax, we have never imagined it.
And it is not that you don't have knowledge, it is not that you don't have information, it is not that you don't work.
But whenever there is a tension, your knowledge, your information will be suppressed and your tension will be affected.
And that is why it is essential that A Happy Mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot see the test in the true perspective.
It seems as if it is a question of respect for life.
The exams that you are going to give are the tests that you have studied throughout the year.
This is not the litter of your life.
What kind of life you live, what kind of life you are leading, what kind of life you want to live is not tested.
In your life, apart from the examinations given in the classroom, there must have been an opportunity to pass through several evils.
And that is why the success of life should be freed from the burden of testing.
In front of us, our former President Dr.
A.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great inspiration.
Anand ji has sent a question to me: Today, if I see the biggest challenge of education in this period, I can see that the education examination has become central.
uality has become the most important.
This has not only increased the competition but also increased the stress among the students.
I want to know your thoughts about this current direction of education and its future.
Though he himself has given the answer but Rachaji wants me to present my statement here.
Marx and Marxit are very limited uses.
There is nothing like that in life.
Whatever knowledge you have gained, it leads to livelihood.
Whether you have tried to live with what you know or not, lives are on it.
The sense of mission that you have received, your sense of familiarity, your mission and ambition are gaining momentum.
If you rely on such matters, you will not have to run behind the marcus.
You will be benefitted with knowledge, skills, self-confidence and determination.
You tell me that there will be a doctor in your family and every family member will go to him who is a family doctor.
None of you would have asked his family doctor how many qualities he had passed.
No one has asked.
Brothers and sisters, as a doctor, you are benefiting from it and you have started taking care of them.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a big case then do you see the mark sheet of that lawyer
You see its experience, its knowledge and its successful journey.
And that is why the strength of these qualities sometimes stops us from moving towards the right direction.
But this does not mean that I have said that it is not just studying.
Its use is essential for our waste.
I was yesterday and it is necessary to know where I am today.
Sometimes this also happens and if you look at yourself from close quarters then it will be remembered that if you are lagging behind in the qualities then you will find a short way, you will catch a few selected things and you will focus on it.
But if you focus on the quality, then gradually you are constraining yourself and you limit yourself to a certain area only to get the mark.
It may be that despite being enlightened in the exams, one never fails in life.
Richa ji has also said this: Competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
Indeed, competition is not going to work for advancing the lives, it is the competitiveness for advancing the lives, and when I talk about competition, it means competitiveness with you.
How to do better tomorrow than yesterday
One of the special features of the life of most successful players is that they compete.
Let us take the example of Shri Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Friends in every sphere of life, when you are going to examine then think that if you can read peacefully for two hours then you can study for three hours.
S.
Sundar ji has expressed his heartfelt gratitude towards the role of girls.
He says that the role of girls in the examination is very important.
He further writes: My mother was not supposed to have been calculated, but she used to sit with me and ask me to be counted among the countless.
Because mothers are aware of the future of the households, they are active and they make things very easy.
Once you will learn to accept it then most of the problems will be solved there itself.
Every girl feels that she must have experienced.
Parents and teachers are in the root of the problem.
Acceptance opens the way for solving problems.
Expectations make it difficult.
Accepting the condition gives an opportunity to open a new path.
And therefore accept what is happening.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not ask a single question about his health.
Sit down and don't talk about what is the situation there, what is the disease.
The lights started hearing and within the first two-four minutes the weather became lighter.
Going to a sick person, we often scare them with disease.
I would like to tell the boys that sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have you ever felt that during the days of examination give laughter to children .
You see, the environment will change.
I have received a call from a miracle.
Namaste, Honble Prime Minister, I cannot mention my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
And when I tried to pass by imitation then I got caught in it and because of this I had a lot of trouble with my friends around me.
You must have often heard that don't steal, don't steal.
I also reiterate to you the same thing.
Once there is a habit of stealing, there will never be a desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach
You might not be required to imitate their entire creativity if you prepare the examination for the same time.
My first question is whether we can reduce the stress that arises during our examination and my second question is why or why does the exam feel light, why not thank you.
If there is an inclusive development then there is a life outside the books and it is very big.
This is the time to live and learn.
Anyone says that I will pass all these exams first and then play.
So it is impossible.
The rest of the body should also get physical activity.
Have you ever imagined that when there are so many things in front then just take a few moments out and look at the sky, just look at the trees and plants.
By doing so, you will see that once again you will come back to your room, to your books.
Whatever you are doing, keep it for a while, get out of it, go to the kitchen and look for the things you like, if you get a future biscuit then eat.
Why not just five minutes, but take some breaks.
There is no need to stay locked in any room for deep breathing .
Go slightly below the open sky, go to the balcony, take a deep breath for five minutes and then sit to study again.
You will feel that the body will become very light and body will not only become light but it will also make the brain light .
Some people feel that I will wake up till late at night - I will read more and more.
Definitely take as much sleep as the body needs.
Fresh.
Your efficiency will certainly increase significantly.
Whenever I hold meetings at the time of election, sometimes my swimming is done.
I came to meet a folk singer.
He came and asked me , How many hours do you sleep
He gave me a herb.
Indeed, if we understand the importance of these things then we will be benefitted.
But this does not mean that just keep lying down .
Otherwise the people of your family will disappoint me.
And you will see the day your marksheets will come.
The person who plays, shines, this is a major medicine to keep the mind, mind and body cautious.
But at the same time I would also say that do not let the words I have said become a burden.
I also feel that the way I advise your family not to become a boss to your parents.
Remembering your resolve, keep your faith in yourself and go for exams.
My best wishes.
Make festivals and festivals to cross every difficulty.
Then there will never be any trash.
Take this mantra forward and move forward.
Dear Countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing forty years in February 2019.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Garden for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has retained its position among the worlds four largest Coast Guards with all its 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in the country.
Last year, the Coast Garden people had undertaken a massive campaign to clean the coastal areas of our country along with their responsibilities and thousands of people joined it.
And very few people would be aware that not only the men in the Coast Guard in our country but also the women are fulfilling their responsibilities by joining their shoulders.
The Coast Garden is also an Observer of our women officers and pilots.
Today, when maritime security is an important topic across the globe, I congratulate the Indian Coast Guard for its forty years in maritime security of India.
1st February is the 5th anniversary of Bastar.
Spring has been approved as the best season.
Season is the queen of seasons.
Opportunity of teaching is considered as an occasion.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the brave.
My Rang de Basanti Chola - this is the inspiration.
My best wishes to the people of my country on this auspicious occasion of Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, the Akashwani also fills new forms with its imagination.
Immediately after the completion of my mind from last month, he has started listening to my mind in regional languages.
It has received extensive approval.
People from far flung areas are writing letters.
I congratulate Akashwani for this self-inspirational work.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar and I convey my best wishes to you all for Christmas.
Today is an occasion to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Lord Christ said that the poor are not our beneficiaries, we want to accept that Lord Christ has not only served the poor but has also spoken of the service done by the poor and that is the true empowerment.
There is a story associated with it which is very popular.
It is said in the story that Lord Jesus stood by the threshold of a temple.
Many immortals came there and they donated immensely.
Thereafter, a poor widow came and made two coins of the copper as a donation.
In such a scenario, two coins of copper are not very big donors.
It was very natural for the devotees present there to have a curiosity.
Lord Christ then said that this woman has donated the most because all others have donated a lot in donations but this woman has dedicated herself to the donor.
Today, 25th December is also the birth anniversary of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya ji.
Malviya ji, who brought about a sense of determination and confidence in the Indian public, gave a new direction to modern education.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development projects in Malaviyaji's Tapobhumi Banaras.
I have laid the foundation stone of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at BHU in Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre will be an important boon not only for the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand-Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country can never forget Atal ji's contribution.
Under his leadership, we have honoured the country by achieving success in the nuclear energy sector.
Whether it is the leader of the party or the member of the parliament or the minister or the Prime Minister, Atal ji has established an idealism in every role.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for his good health.
As an activist, I was fortunate to work with Atal ji.
A lot of memories are swimming with them.
Today, on Christmas Day, as a gift, the countrymen will get the benefit of two schemes.
In other words, two new schemes are going to be launched for the countrymen.
Whether it is village or city, whether it is educated or uneducated, what is the cashless business, how it can be purchased without cash, the curiosity is spread all over the country.
Everyone wants to learn from each other.
In order to promote this, to make mobile banking more robust, two new incentive schemes for consumers and small traders are being launched by the Government of India to make e-payments a habit.
One scheme to encourage customers - Lucky Consumer Plan and other Promotion of Plan Traders - Digital Trade Scheme
Today, on 25th December, as a gift of Creamsum, 15 thousand people will get prizes from the drone system and the accounts of 15 thousand people will be paid in the form of a prize of one thousand rupees.
Fifteen thousand people will get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
In 100 days, lakhs of families are going to receive crores of rupees but this prize will be made when you use mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI, USSD (USSD) and this will be the basis for the draw.
With this, there will be a major one day a week for such customers, including prize money of lakhs and three months later, on 14th April, Dr.
On the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, there will be a bumper drone with a prize of crores.
DigiDhan Business Scheme is mainly for traders.
Businessmen themselves join the scheme and also connect the customers to make their own business cashless.
Such traders will also be rewarded separately and the prize will be thousands.
The traders will also carry on their own businesses and will also get prizes.
This scheme has been formulated keeping every section of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class at the centre. And that is why people will get the benefit of this scheme if they purchase something above 50 rupees and purchase less than three thousand rupees.
More than three thousand rupees will not get the benefit of this prize.
The poorest of the poor can also buy goods through free phones, ordinary phones and sell goods and also pay the money and every person can be beneficiaries of this scheme.
People in rural areas can buy and sell through AEPS and they can also win prizes.
These 30 crore people can soon become part of this prize scheme.
I am confident that my countrymen will be interested in this system and the youngsters around you will be aware of it and you will be able to ask them.
Your family will also have children studying in class 10-12 and you will also be able to easily learn this.
Its very simple - the way you are sending a vote-up message from a mobile phone, it is an easy task.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know that the awareness about how to use technology in the country, how to do e-payment and how to do online payments is increasing at a rapid pace.
In the last few days, cashless trade and cashless trade has increased from 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to promote this.
This decision is so big that traders can apply it very well.
Traders who do digital transactions, will replace their business with online payment system, such traders have been exempted from incompetence.
Everyone has carried forward this mission in their own way.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shriman Chandrababu Naidu has appointed a committee headed by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, who is considering a number of schemes in this regard.
But I have noticed that several state governments have started and implemented several such schemes in their own way.
Someone told me that the Government of Assam has decided to give 10 discount on digital payments of Property Taxes and Trade License fees.
The rural banks which will have at least two digital transactions of 5 of their subscribers in the period between January and March will receive a prize of Rs. 50,000 from the Government.
The Government has announced a reward of Rs. 5 lakh under Uttam Panchayat for Digital Transactions to 100 Digital Transaction villages by 31st March, 2019.
Under the Digital Agricultural Shiromani for the farmers, the Government of Assam has decided to give a reward of Rs. 5000 to 10 farmers, which will be available to those who are fully utilizing digital payments for procurement of seeds and fertilizers.
I convey my best wishes to the Government of Assam and to every government that has initiated such a good luck.
Several institutions have also made several successful experiments to promote digital procurement among the poor farmers of the village.
I am aware that the GNFC - Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited, which works in the main fertilizer sector, has installed 1,000 POS machines in the fertilizer market to facilitate the farmers and 5 lakh fertilizers bags have been distributed to 35 thousand farmers in the last two weeks.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our lifestyle, the informal sector is very big. And most of the people are required to pay the wages, work money or salary in cash.
Wherever they should get 100 rupees, they get 80, they get 50 where they should get 80 and there are other facilities in the health sector like insurance, they remain deprived of it.
But now cashless payments are going on.
Money is being deposited directly into the bank.
In a way, the informal sector is changing in the formal sector, the exploitation was being stopped and the cut-offs were also being stopped. And it is now possible for the workers, artisans and ordinary people to get sufficient compensation.
He is also becoming a stakeholder in the benefits of other benefits.
Our country is the country of the youngest.
Technology has eased us.
Countries like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youngsters have made great strides from startups.
This digital payment is a golden opportunity.
Our youth should not only strengthen this sector with new ideas, with new technologies and with new methods, but also with the mission of making the country free from black money and corruption.
Most of the writers have pointed out that such a good work, the work of the country's recommendations, such a sacred work, however, people have also mentioned about the way the Gorakhdhands are taking place and how new paths are being laid for the wrongdoing.
And the third stage is that in which people have supported what is happening, but at the same time, this fight should be carried forward, corruption and black money should be eradicated, it should take even more stringent steps, it is also those who encourage and write.
I am grateful to the countrymen that I have helped in writing all these letters.
Smt. Gurmani Keble has written on MyGov: This step to curb expiry funds is commendable.
We are facing difficulties for the citizens, but we are fighting against corruption and we are happy that we are cooperating in this fight.
We are fighting like armed forces against corruption, black money etc. The same spirit that Garumani Kebel ji has written is being illuminated in every corner of the country.
We all are experiencing it.
But it is also true that when people suffer from pain and trouble then who is such a person who does not have pain
I feel the same pain as you have.
But for a noble cause, when it works with good intention to achieve a higher objective, the countrymen remain courageous in the midst of these difficulties, in the midst of pain.
In fact, these people are the front-runners of change.
I also thank the people for another reason that they have not only faced difficulties, but have also given a cordial answer to some people who are trying to mislead the people.
There is a lack of spelling written on a note, someone has said that the price of salt has increased, someone is going to spread a flaw, the note of 2000 is going to be postponed, even the notes of 500 and 1000 are going to be postponed.
I also salute this power of the people.
My dear countrymen, I can clearly feel that when 1. 25 billion Indians stand with you, nothing is impossible.
The blessings of the people become the blessings of God.
I thank the people of the country, I congratulate them that people have participated in this Mahayagya against corruption and black money.
There will be widespread discussions in the Parliament for political parties as well as for political parties.
Had Parliament been there, there would have been a good discussion.
The people who are spreading the rumors that political parties have all the concessions is wrong.
Those who cannot support open corruption and black money are being searched for government errors all the time.
This government is for the masses.
The government is trying to make a constant response to the people.
On the other hand, I had said on the very first day that on the eighth day, this fight is unusual.
How powerful are the possibilities that have been associated with the black business of beema and corruption for 70 years
Whenever I have decided to compete with such people, they also adopt a new formula for defeating the government.
I would like to convey my heartfelt congratulations to all my fellow citizens.
How did this become possible
Let me tell you its secrets.
The secret is that I am getting all this information from the people.
Several more important stakeholders are getting from the citizens than from the government system and most of us are getting success because of the awareness of the common citizens.
Can the citizens of my country imagine the dangers that are posing to open such elements
And most of the information that is being received is getting success.
I am confident that the government has given an email address for this thing that you can also send it on the basis of which you want to give such a memorandum.
You can also send it to MyGov.
There is also a third group of letter writers, which is also very large.
He says: Modi ji will not get tired, will not stop, and you will be relieved of all the drastic steps that you have to take, but now once we have taken the path, we have to reach Manjil.
I am particularly grateful to all those who have written such letters because there is a sense of confidence and blessing in their letters.
And there is no question of returning to the work for which the blessings of 1. 25 billion Indians are there.
We have brought it out and have enacted a very robust Benami Property Act.
These laws will also work in the coming days.
Our priority is to do whatever is required for the welfare of the nation, for the welfare of the people.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last month too, I had said that even in the midst of these difficulties, our farmers have broken the record of last year in their fields by working hard.
This is a good sign in terms of agriculture sector.
Be it the labourers of this country or the farmers of this country or the youth of this country, the hard work of all these people is bringing a new color today.
In the past, on the global economic forum, India has made its name very glorious in many fields.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
In the Global Innovation Index-2016, we have improved 16 places and the World Banks Transport Efficiency Index improved by 1 in 2016.
There are several reports that have been evaluated in this direction and India is moving forward at a fast pace.
The President, the Vice President also expressed his open disapproval.
But in such a scenario, sometimes good things happen and then the mind gets a lot of satisfaction.
There was also an excellent work done in Hobala in the Parliament which the country did not pay attention to.
Brothers and sisters, Today, I feel very proud to mention this thing that a bill related to Divyangjan was passed in the Parliament by taking forward the campaign for Divyangjan.
I also express my gratitude to all the MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this.
I express my gratitude to the crores of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is committed to the Divyangjans.
I have also personally tried to make it more zealous.
I meant that the Divyangjans should get their rights and respect, which they deserve.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters strengthened our efforts and trust when they won four medals in the Paralympics.
He not only enhanced the dignity of the country but also surprised the people with his capabilities.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, like every citizen of the country, have a precious legacy and a priceless one.
I am happy today that after the passage of this Act in the interest of Divyangjans, there will be more job opportunities for Divyangjans.
For them, the limit of reservation in government jobs has been increased to 4.
The Act also provides for special provisions for redressal of education, facilities and grievances of persons with disabilities.
You can guess how sensitive the government is for the Divyangjans that in the last two years, the central government has organized four thousand three hundred and fifty camps for the Divyangjans and has distributed resources to 5 lakh 80 thousand Divyang brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs. 352 crore.
The government has passed a new law in accordance with the feelings of the nation.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we have come to know from the field of sports that has made us proud.
Being an Indian, it is very natural for all of us to be proud.
The Indian Cricket Team has won four-wheelers in the opposite category of England.
Some of these young sportspersons were eligible for professionalism.
The vast Kohli of drying up the test, along with good betting, led a good leadership.
Indian Cricket Team off-spinner R.
Ashwin has been declared as the best cricketer and best test cricketer for the year 2016 by the ICC.
My best wishes to all of you. Many congratulations.
Even in the field of hockey, good news came after fifteen years and gave good news.
Our Junior Hockey team captured the World Cup.
After fifteen years, it has come to the fore that when the Junior Hockey team won the World Cup.
Congratulations to the youngsters for this achievement.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey Team.
Last month, our women sportspersons also made a miracle.
Indias women hockey team also won the Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days back, Indias women's hockey team won the Asia Cup for players under the age of 18.
I heartily congratulate all the cricketers and hockey teams.
Last month we were enjoying Diwali.
Like every year, on the occasion of Diwali, I once again crossed the border with China to celebrate Diwali with the jawans.
With the ITBP personnel and the army personnel, I considered Diwali at the height of the Himalayas.
He was full of emotions and not only this, the message of good wishes that the people of the country had conveyed to the security forces of the country in their happiness was a wonderful response.
And people did not just send messages but they were connected with their minds.
Someone made a video that means almost every household had become a guardian of the soldiers.
And whenever I looked at those letters, I was also surprised to see how many emotions were filled with imagination. And out of these, Mygov thought that a coffee table book should be made by finishing a few select items.
Work is underway.
With your contribution, the feelings of the soldiers of the country will be integrated into this epic. The feelings that you have for the security forces of the country will be integrated.
But I didn't really feel that this time.
This time it did not seem that there are festivals and I am not at home.
It seemed as if we are also celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the armed forces, the strength of the armed forces increases by 125 crores.
Just a while ago, I had come to visit all the Sarpanches of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
And with so much love, with so much openness these Sarpanches of the villages spoke and everything touched my heart.
I urged them to go and concentrate on the future of those children.
Today, I am glad that all the Sarpanches from the Kashmir valley have fulfilled the promises made to me and made everyone aware by visiting the villages.
Just a few days ago, when the board was tested, about 95 percent of the students and students from Kashmir and the girls from Kashmir participated in the board examination.
The presence of such a large number of students in the board examinations indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education and education for a bright future.
I congratulate him for his enthusiasm but at the same time I congratulate his parents, his volunteers, his teachers and all the village sarpanches.
My dear brothers and sisters, When I asked people for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat then I can say that all the suggestions have come in one direction.
Everyone used to say that they should talk in detail about 500 and 1,000 notes.
However, on the 8th of November, when I was addressing the nation in the name of the nation, I had talked about launching a great campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is, the more important it is.
And I was convinced that we will have to face many new challenges in our normal life.
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take fifty days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards normalcy.
The diseases that we have been suffering from forty-six years cannot be simple.
I can understand your problems and challenges in a better way.
However, when I see your support, I see your cooperation and several efforts are being made to mislead you, even then sometimes the incidents that disturb the mind are coming out, you have understood this path of truth and you have accepted this thing in the country's interest to stop the notes of five hundred and thousands.
And such a big country, such a large number of notes, such a bunch of notes, such a bunch of notes, and this decision-making decision-making decision-making decision-making is being done by the world in a very minute manner. Every economist is analyzing and evaluating it.
The world is witnessing the fact that whether India's 1. 25 billion Indians will be able to overcome the difficulties and challenges.
There may be question marks in the mindset of the world.
India has only a reverence for India's 1. 25 billion Indians and it is a belief that crores of Indians will fulfil their resolutions.
And our country will emerge as penitent as gold in every way and the reason for this is the citizens of this country.
The path of success has also been made possible due to you.
All the central governments, state governments, local bodies, lakhs of bank employees in 1 lakh 30 thousand bank branches, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work day and night.
In the midst of various kinds of tensions, all these people consider it a yagna of service to the nation in a very peaceful manner and work towards a great transformation.
They don't even know when it starts in the morning but they are doing it.
And that is why it is clear that India will succeed in this thing.
And I have seen that all the people of Banks and Post Offices are working in the midst of such difficulties.
And if we talk about humanity then they can see two steps ahead.
Someone told me that an old brother had accidentally happened in Khandwa.
Suddenly there was a need for finance.
It was a matter of great pleasure for the local bank employees and I was happy to know that they themselves brought the money to their homes, to the elderly person so that they could help in the treatment.
In such cases, countless cases come out in TV, media, newspapers and conversations everyday.
I sincerely thank all the stakeholders who have worked hard in this Mahayagya.
The purification of strength should be done only when we cross the skull .
I clearly remember that the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was underway and the way the bank employees took it on their shoulders and showed the work that was not done in the last sixty years.
Today, once again, he has raised this challenge and I believe that the resolve of 1. 25 billion Indians, the collective mandate of all of them will make this nation a new strength.
They are finding illicit ways to save their money.
Sadly, in this too, he has found ways through the use of the poor.
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money in their accounts or doing some work with them.
I would like to tell such people today that whether it is your intention to improve or not, whether it is your will or not to comply with the law, the law will see what to do.
But please don't interfere with the lives of the poor.
Do not do anything so that the name of the poor comes to the record and later on when the test is done, my beloved poor will get stuck in trouble because of your sins.
And there has been such a stringent law of benami property that is being enforced in it, it will bring a lot of trouble and the government does not want our countrymen to face any problem.
My name is Ashish Pare.
I am a common citizen of Tirali Village, Tirali Taluko, Harda District, Madhya Pradesh.
I want many examples of Mann Ki Baat to say that despite the inconvenience of the people, people have welcomed this tough decision for the advancement of their nation which will enhance the enthusiasm of the people and that the cashless system is very important for nation building.
I am very happy that you have stopped the notes of thousands and five hundred rupees.
I speak to Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal district of Karnataka.
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart because you had said that good days will come. But no one thought that you would make such a big decision.
The notes of 500 thousand rupees, black money and corrupt people have received wisdom after seeing all this.
Every citizen of India will never have a better day than this.
I would like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for this thing.
Some things are known through the medium of media, through the medium of people and through the medium of government sources, the enthusiasm for work increases very much.
It is so enjoyable that I feel so proud that how the common man has a wonderful potential in my country.
If you get the opportunity to go back to the ground and get the opportunity to pass through this road then you must pay the money.
And people go there, they go there, they go there and after a couple of days when they pass there again then they pay the money.
This is the strength of my country, which has the spirit of service, sacrifice and authenticity.
I used to discuss the issue in the election and this thing has reached the whole world.
The people of many countries of the world have also learnt to speak the word 'Chapra Charcha'.
But I didn't know that there should be a marriage in the discussion.
I came to know that on 17th November Surat had a marriage that took place with Cha.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl who married herself didn't just feed tea and others didn't spend anything.
The Bharat Mara and Daksha Parmar of Surat, who have contributed to the fight against corruption and black money through their marriage, have inspired them.
When I was late at night, I used to watch TV, I saw in the news that there is a small village named Dhekia Juli in Assam.
There are artisans of tea gardens and they get money every week.
What did they do if they got a note of Rs. 2000
Four women from the neighborhood got together and shopped all around and paid two thousand rupees in a note so they did not need a small note because they bought it all together and decided that when we meet in the next week, we will sit and take account of it.
People are searching for their own paths.
And see the change.
A message was received from the government that the people of the tea gardens of Assam are saying that we should install ATMs there.
See, how the lives of the villages are also changing.
Some people have got immediate benefit from this campaign.
The country will get benefits in the coming days but some people have got immediate benefits.
Each municipal corporation gets 150 tax on tax payers.
But this time, due to the decision of the 8th date, all the people were rushed to submit their old notes.
Last year, about 3,500 crore rupees were received in 47 urban units.
You will be surprised to know that in the same week 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited.
Now if that municipal corporation receives four times the money then it is natural that there will be sewerage system in the poorest of the poor, there will be water management and anganwadi arrangements will be made.
There are several such examples in which its direct benefits are visible.
Brothers and sisters, Our village and our farmers are a strong link to the economy of our country.
On the one hand, because of these new changes in the economy, every citizen is streamlining himself in the midst of difficulties.
Farmers have also found ways in the midst of difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority but still there are difficulties. However, I believe that if the farmers face any problem or natural calamities then they will continue to stand up this time too.
Small traders of our country, who provide employment, also increase economic activity.
In the last budget, we had made an important decision that the small shopkeepers of the villages like the big malls will be able to do their business for twenty-four hours, they will not be able to stop any law because it was my opinion that if the big mall gets 24 hours then why should not the poor poor poor poor poor poor bankers of the villages get it
A big initiative has been taken to provide loans to them through Mudra Yojana.
Millions and crores of rupees were transferred to such small people through the Mudra Yojana because a large number of people do small businesses and boost the business of billions of rupees.
But it is natural for them to face difficulties due to this decision.
You can also download the Bankoni App in the mobile phone.
You should also install POS machines for credit cards, you should also learn how to trade without a note.
Technological roads are safe and quick.
I would like to assist you in making this campaign a success and not only to lead your changes but also to lead your changes.
I am confident that you can work on the basis of this technology in the entire village business.
I also want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that a lot of embarrassment has happened to you.
There is a payment on the paper and it is different when it comes in hand.
Sometimes when a full amount is paid then sometimes a part of it is required to be given to someone outside and the labour force makes it a part of life.
With this new system, we would like you to be stolen or even in your bank, your salary will be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages are followed.
Nowadays, your mobile phones are also working on e-packets. You can buy the same mobile phones from the small shops in the neighborhood and you can also pay the money from it.
Therefore, I specially urge the labourer brothers and sisters to become a partner in this scheme because in the end, I have taken such a big decision for the poor, the farmers, the laborers, the deprived and the deprived sections of the country that they should benefit from.
Today, I would especially like to talk to the youth.
We say in the world that India has 65 of its population, below 35 years of age.
Young women of my country, I know that you must have liked my decision.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you are contributing sufficiently to carry this forward positively.
But friends, you are my true Sipahi, you are my true friend.
We have got a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India and an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
Can my youngsters help me
You will accompany me, you will not stop talking so much.
The more experience you have in today's world, the more it is not for the older generation.
It may be that the elder brothers in your family are not aware and parents, uncles, maternal uncles, maternal uncles, maternal uncles, maternal uncles, maternal uncles etc.
You know what is happening, you know what is happening online banking, you know how online ticketing can be done.
All these things are very common for you and you use them as well. But today, the great work that the country wants to do, our dream is Cashless Society.
A hundred percent cashless society is not possible, but whether India launches a Less Cash Society
Once we start the 'Lace Cash Society' today, the Manzil of the Cashless Society will not be very far away and I will see your physical help in it, your time and your resolve.
And I believe that you will never despair me because we all want to change the lives of the poor people of India.
You are aware that today there is a lot of opportunity for digital banking or mobile banking for cashless society.
Each bank offers online access.
Volt means e-packet.
Several types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards and the RuPay card used very little after 8th of December.
The poor have started using RuPay cards and it has registered an increase of nearly 300.
Similarly, the prepaid cards are available in the bank as well as the prepaid cards are available in the mobile phones.
There is a good platform for the UPI to do business so that you can purchase, send money and get money. And it is easier for you to send it to the WhatsApp.
Sav would be an uneducated person, how he sends messages on Whatsapp today.
Moreover, technology will become so simple that no big smartphone is required for this purpose.
And now the cost of online surcharge has also been abolished and you must have seen that in 2-4 days newspapers every expenditure has been abolished so that the movement of cashless society can be strengthened.
My young friends, despite all this, there is an entire generation who is unaware of it.
And as much as I know, all of you are active in this great work.
As you send a creative message on Whatsapp, I see slogans, poems, cases, cartoons and new imaginations. And in the midst of a lot of difficulties this creative force of our youth appears to have been the hallmark of Indias soil that the songs were born in the battlefield of an era, just as we are passing through such a great transformation today, original creativity will emerge within you.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I reiterate that I need your help and I believe that millions and millions of youth of my country will do this work.
Please do one thing from today itself and make a solemn pledge that you will yourself become a part of the Cashless Society.
All the technologies that are available online on your mobile phones.
Moreover, at least 10 families are being taken out every half an hour, two hours and at least 10 hours, how to use this technology, how to download their banking app and how to spend the money in your account
How can shopkeepers also be traded
Your willingness is to lead this Cashless Society, the great campaign to bring the country out of the dilemma, the campaign to liberate the country from corruption, the movement to free black money, and the movement to liberate people from problems and difficulties.
Once you people are using RuPay cards then the poor will bless you.
If the ordinary citizens get rid of all these concerns then they will get rid of them. And if all the youth of India get involved in this work then I dont think it will take longer.
Within a month, we will be able to emerge as a new modern India in the world and you can do this through your mobile phones.
You can also connect 10 households per day to 10 households.
I invite you, Come, let us not only support but we will also be a force of change and will be a force of change.
We will carry forward this fight to free the country from corruption and black money. And there is a wealthy country in the world where the youth of this country has changed the lives of that nation.
Kenya, he speeded up his beats, M-PESA used the technology of such a mobile system, named M-PESA and today the entire business of this region of Africa has come to it.
This country has made a big revolution.
My young friends, once again I urge you to take this campaign forward.
Every school, college, university, NCC, NSS, collectively and personally, I invite you to do this work.
Let us take this forward.
We have got an opportunity to serve the best of the country, not to miss the opportunity.
Dear brothers and sisters, this day marks the birth anniversary of a great poet of our country Shriman Harivansh Rai Bachhanji and today Shriman Amitabh Bachchan has given a slogan for this cleanliness drive on the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai Ji.
You must have seen that the most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji, has been taking forward the campaign of cleanliness in a very good manner.
It seems that the subject of cleanliness has spread to his nervous system and he also remembered the work of cleanliness on his father's birth anniversary.
Harivansh Rai Ji used to introduce himself through this.
His son, Shriman Amitabh ji, who is running a mission for cleanliness, has sent me through the poetry of Harivansh Rai ji, Swachh Tan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, I am familiar with him.
I bow down to Harivansh Rai ji.
I also thank Mr. Amitabh ji for joining Mann Ki Baat in this manner and for taking forward the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, feelings, your letters, on MyGov, Narendra Modi app always keeps me connected with you.
Now Mann Ki Baat is at 11 o'clock, but soon after that we will start in regional languages as well.
I am grateful to Akashwani, the new initiative that has been taken by those people so that even my countrymen of the country will get the opportunity to connect with it where Hindi is not popular.
Thank you very much.
The visitors from far flung places feel as if they are the second name of the Indian Jana Vivan Parv and it is also natural.
The festivals that have been the tradition of India since Vedic times till date have been festivals that bring about change in time.
We have seen the courage to end the tradition of outdoor festivals and the changes in festivals as per the time and society's demand have also been easily accepted.
And it should be done through this enthusiasm.
All these things have been covered by our ancestors in a very scientific manner.
Today, the entire world discusses the environment, it becomes a matter of concern for nature destruction.
India's festival tradition is going to strengthen nature's love and culture from children to every human being.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody's responsibilities are being celebrated.
Nowadays we keep on Sundays, but those older generations, the workers, the fishermen, etc.
So far, we had developed the tradition of keeping pace with Brahmanda and science.
Today, when we celebrate Diwali, as I have said, our every festival is an educational festival.
One thing we all know very well, go to any corner of India, from Amir to Amir's house, from the poorest of the poor to the hut, from the festival of Diwali to the festival of cleanliness in every family.
The corner of the house is cleaned.
But the need of the hour is not only to clean our homes but also to clean the entire campus, to clean the entire atmosphere and to clean the entire village.
We have to expand this nature and tradition.
The festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the boundaries of India.
In some form or the other, the festival of Diwali is celebrated and celebrated in all the countries of the world.
Many governments and parliamentarians of the world have also started becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
Whether it is eastern or west, whether it is a developed country or a developing country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, the threshold of Diwali is visible.
You must be aware that the US Postal Service of the United States has also released Diwali postage stamps this time.
The Prime Minister of Canada also shared his photos on Diwali.
On the occasion of Diwali in London, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom organised an excellent programme to connect all the communities, he himself participated in it and perhaps U.
And what is a picture .
16 women MPs from Singapore, wearing Indian saris, are standing outside the Parliament and these pictures have become viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
Today, the festival of Diwali is being celebrated in every street hall of Singapore.
The Prime Minister of Australia, while conveying his best wishes to the Indian community, has called for connecting every society on the occasion of Diwali in different cities of Australia.
The Prime Minister of New ealand recently arrived.
He told me that I have to go back so soon that I am going to attend the Diwali celebrations there. I mean, Deepawali, this festival of light is also an inspiration to take the world community from darkness to light.
On the occasion of Diwali, along with good clothes, good food and drinks, heavy bursting of bursting also takes place.
And children and youth are very happy.
No matter what happens in the vicinity .
In the days of Diwali, news of accidents, news of fire and mischief is causing serious concern.
And there is a problem that on Diwali, doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers.
The festival of Diwali is very long in our country.
This is not just a day.
Govardhan worship, say brothers and sisters, say beneficiaries, and take them to the light of Kartik Purnima. In a way, it is going on for a long time.
At the same time, we also celebrate Diwali and prepare for Chhath Puja.
The festival of Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern parts of India.
But one of its specialties is that it gives a very deep message to the society.
But it is a fact that people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath Puja is such a festival in which the sun is also worshipped.
There's a huge social message in this festival...
I would like to mention the festival of Deepawali that I would like to convey my best wishes to you all for Chhath Puja.
But there is also a special time for me.
We especially thank the countrymen, we have to express our gratitude.
In the events that have taken place in the last few months, our army personnel are looting their credentials for our well-being.
On my future, the sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the armed forces continues to cease.
And one of these things was in the mind to dedicate this Diwali to the Defence Forces.
I invited the countrymen for a campaign called Message to Soldiers.
But today, I would like to say this thing by bowing down my head that there should not be any human being in India who has an unprecedented love for the soldiers of the country and the way it has been expressed, it gives strength to every citizen of the country.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the security forces, it has emerged as a messenger of your courage.
Whether it is a school, a college, a student, a village, a businessman, a shopkeeper, a politician, a sportsperson or a sportsperson or a cinema world, perhaps no one who has unleashed a lamp for the country's soldiers, has not given a message to the soldiers of the country, even the media has changed this lamp into an opportunity to express gratitude towards the army and why not
Whether it is BSF, CRPF, Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Jal Shakti or Air Force, Coast Guard, I cannot say the names of all, but what kind of pain does our soldiers suffer
I can imagine this moment of pride for the soldiers of my country.
Message to Soldiers has come so many acts on hashtag , reflectively or what to do .
I want to read that poem has been sent by Mr. Ashwini Kumar Chauhan.
Sisters and sisters, Shivani has sent me a telephone message.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I call upon Shiva.
Our army brothers are getting a lot of encouragement from the message to the Soldiers campaign launched on this Diwali.
I belong to a military family.
My husband is also an officer of the Armed Forces.
My father and mother-in-law have been the officers of both the armed forces.
The entire family is full of soldiers.
I would like to say that along with the armed forces and the soldiers, their families and their bodies also offer such sacrifices.
My dear countrymen, it is true that not only the border but also the entire frontier of life.
Whether it is natural calamity or the crisis of law and order, whether it is a threat to the armed forces or to show courage to return the youth on the wrong path, our soldiers continue to work inspired by the patriotism of every aspect of their lives.
You must have heard that the open defecation free - open defecation free - was done in the open of Himachal Pradesh.
Now Himachal has also been formed and Kerala is also going to be the first number.
But how does this success appear
Now our ITBP jawans went to villages on leave from their duties.
So perhaps the village would have to meet the village council at that time and it was being discussed in the Gram Sabha and the toilets were being constructed.
It was found that some families were unable to make toilets due to lack of money.
This clan should be buried and his patriotic vision was not that he served the country only by leaving pills on enemies.
He took away thousands of rupees from his chequebook and handed it over to the Sarpanch of the village and said that those five households did not have toilets, give one thousand rupees to each family on my behalf, construct five toilets and make all of our villages open defecation free.
I am really grateful to the youth.
I noticed that there is no road in the far flung jungles of Kerala, which can be reached with difficulty in walking on foot all day.
It was difficult for the tribal Panchayats to reach Idmalakudi, so people did not go there. In the nearby urban areas, the students of engineering had come to know that toilets are being constructed in this village.
Candidates from NCC, youngsters from NSS and engineering students have decided that we will build toilets.
The youngsters who had to carry the goods to construct toilets, intestines, cements and all the goods that they had to carry on their own shoulders, they walked on foot throughout the day and went to Pela forest.
They themselves worked hard to construct toilets in the village and these youngsters freed up a small village in the remotest jungle.
This is the reason why Kerala is getting ODF.
Even Gujarat has declared all municipalities - municipalities - more than 150 Open Defecation Free.
10 districts have also been declared Open Defecation Free.
Haryana is also going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee for the first time and it has been decided that the entire state will be ODF in a few months.
So far, he has completed seven districts.
Work is going on in all the states.
I have mentioned some.
I congratulate the citizens of all these states for joining this great work and contributing to the work of removing filthy darkness from the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of schemes in the government and if there is another good scheme in accordance with it after the first scheme then we have to release the first scheme.
Normally, it does not pay any attention to these things.
Old schemes are also going on and new schemes are also going on.
This is going on.
In our country, those households where there is gas connection, where there is electricity, there is no need for kerosene.
The households that have gas connections, the households that have electricity, have been eradicated from Aadhaar number and I have heard that seven or eight districts have been eradicated from kerosene by now.
I am confident that the entire state will soon become kerosene-free.
And the convenience of the people will also increase, yes, it will be difficult for the promising people, it will be difficult for the unauthorised.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Everything of them, where should the country go Even today the criteria for all of them are set.
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you formulate a scheme, first of all, remember the poor and the weak faces and then decide whether the poor will be benefitted by what you are going to do or not
You decide on this criteria.
The need of the hour is to satisfy the hopes and aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the difficulties.
Whatever our old thinking may be, the society must be freed from the discrimination of girl childhood.
Its not possible that the 21st century should be dark in the village.
And that is why the great campaign of providing electricity to the villages is successfully moving forward to make the villages free from darkness.
Time is moving ahead in limits.
After so many years of independence, what would be the health of the poor mother, if she smokes 400 cigarettes a day after cooking the kitchen on a wooden stove
5 crore such families have been successfully leading a smoke-free life, this is a cell.
The small traders, small businessmen, vegetable sellers, milk-made, mineral shopkeepers, those who were trapped in the interests of the savvy were stuck.
My dear countrymen, yesterday, 31st October, the great man of this country, the unity of India, who made a mantra of his life, demonstrated his life.
31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb on one side and the living beings of the country's unity are the great men.
On the other hand, Smt. Gandhi is also the death anniversary.
We not only remember the blessings of the great men but we should also do it.
But the phone of a gentleman from Punjab, his pain also touched me, Prime Minister Namaskar, Sir, I am calling Jasdeep.
From Punjab, sir, you know that Sardar Patel's birthday is on 31st.
Sardar Patel is such a miracle that he spent his entire life connecting the country with the nation. And in this zeal I feel that he was successful and he brought everyone along.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a human being.
A Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is a witness to the fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done the job of uniting the country after Chanakya.
Successful attempts to bring down the freedom struggle, the great man who did such a great job, bowed down to the great man.
But it is also a pain that Sardar Saheb was alive for unity, he was struggling for unity and because of his priorities, he was also a victim of many anarchies but he never forgot the path of unity.
The birth anniversary of those great men who lived for the sake of unity and Sardar ji along with Sardar ji.
But in the midst of this crisis, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of this country.
There are many languages, sexes, dresses, food and drink but unity in diversity is the strength of India.
The core of unity lies in the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
The journey of life of Sardar Saheb started with the struggle for farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sometimes many of our fellow citizens hear the name of Amul.
Today, people are familiar with every manufacturing of Amul and even outside India.
However, very few people would be aware that it was the divine vision of Sardar Saheb who had imagined the cooperative milk producer association.
And the sportsperson, who was then called the 'Kera' zone, strengthened this idea in 1942.
Similarly, today's Amul is a living example of how Sardar Saheb had created happiness and prosperity for the farmers.
I offer my homage to Sardar Saheb.
And on 31st October, whenever we may remember Sardar Saheb, let us resolve for unity.
My dear countrymen, in this series of festivals on Diwali, there is also a festival of lighting of Kartik Purnima (Devivali).
Guru Nanakdev, his teachings are guiding not only for the entire humanity but also for the entire mankind.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and harmony.
When we were at the forefront of smuggling, gender, high-level disorder, Guru Nanak Dev was chosen by Bhai Lal as his colleague.
If we move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', the inspiration that Guru Nanak Dev has given us, the spirit of discrimination, the spirit of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', then who can be our guide
I also bow down to Guru Nanak Dev, when this light festival of his birth anniversary is coming.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to the people of the country on this Diwali.
Thank you very much.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, a few days ago, we have lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all those brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
It was sufficient to make the entire nation vigilant.
There is also grief and anger in the country. And it is not only for those families who have lost their sons, brothers and sisters or lost their husbands.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our forces.
We have a lot of opportunities to speak to citizens and politicians and we also speak.
But the army does not speak, the army shows its might.
Today, I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir as well.
The citizens of Kashmir have started to understand the anti-national disabilities well.
And as soon as they have realised the truth, they have deviated such elements from themselves and have come out on the path of peace.
Every parent wants to work as soon as school-colleges are formed. Farmers are also feeling that the crops, fruits etc. have been produced in the markets across India.
Economic activity also goes well.
And in the last few days, the business has begun well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the solutions to our problems, our progress is the path of our development.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem, we will find ways and at the same time paving the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
Safety of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of that rule.
The administration has to take certain steps to maintain law and order.
And we will follow it completely.
Anytime we think, people who think Judaism also present innovative ideas.
I get the opportunity to know a lot about the recent social media.
Every corner of India has the opportunity to know, understand and understand the emotions of every kind of person and strengthen the strength of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harsh Vardhan of 11th standard has given me a different idea.
He has written, I was very distraught after the Uri terrorist attack.
But bathing suggests a way to do something and what can a small student like me do
Of these, I was wondering how I could work for the country's interests.
And I had pledged that I would study three hours a day.
The country will become an appropriate citizen.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, it is a matter of great pleasure for me that in this environment of anger, in such a young age, you can think healthily.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would also like to say that the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country has a huge value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
But you must be aware that when the war of 165 was fought, Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji was leading us and there was such a spirit in the entire country, it was like patriotism.
Everybody wanted something or the other. He wanted to get rid of something.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had made a tremendous effort to touch this feeling of the country in a very good manner.
He inspired the people of India to work for the nation by giving the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
Another way of expressing patriotism between the voices of the bomb and the gun is for every citizen, said Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
When Mahatma Gandhi was also leading the freedom movement, when the movement was at its peak and there was a need for stability in the movement, he used to make very successful experiments to turn that intensity of movement towards constructive work in the society.
If all of us, the armed forces, the people sitting in the administration, perform their duties and contribute constructively to the spirit of patriotism and patriotism then our country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartike writes to me on the Narendra Modi App that the players who had gone to the Paralympics have created history and their appearance is a victory of human emotion.
Shri Varun Vishwanath also wrote on the Narendra Modi App that our athletes have done a great job and you should mention this in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only these two, but every person of the country has got an emotional connection to our players of the paralysis.
Perhaps moving ahead from sports to paralysis and from our sportspersons, our vision of humanity, our approach towards Divyangjan has completely changed.
There is immense strength in this sentence.
This time, 1 player, including 3 women from our country, participated in the paralysis.
In comparison to other players, when Divyangs play, physical capabilities, sports skills are even bigger.
He again won the Golden Moon in the Debendra Jhazaria Bhalafang and won it again after 12 years.
Age increases in the age of 12 years and once the Golden Moon wins, the spirit also decreases slightly.
However, Debendra observed that the condition of the body, or the rise of age, could not weaken his resolve and he brought the Golden Moon again after 12 years.
And he was not a Divyang from his birth.
He had to lose one of his hands because of the electric current.
Just imagine, the person who attained the first Golden Moon at the age of 23 and the second Golden Moon at the age of 35, he would have done a great job in life.
The High Jump won the Golden Moon in a high jump.
And Thangavelu lost his left foot at the age of just 5.
Poverty also did not come under their influence.
They neither live in a big city nor come from a middle class Amir family.
Despite passing through a difficult life at the age of 21, he also gave a solemn pledge to the country in the midst of physical difficulties.
In the name of Deepa Malik of sportspersons, the pride of sportspersons has been added to the sportspersons.
Varun C.
Bhati won a bronze medal in the elite.
These medals of the Paralympics are not only the medals but they have done a great job in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, in the direction of our Divyang brothers and sisters.
Our sensitivities are not only outstanding but our vision towards this Divyangjan has also changed.
Very few people would be aware of the paralysis of the paralysis of this time.
A few days ago, the Olympics Competition was held at the same place.
This time it has been created.
In the race of 1500 meters, in which the Olympics Competition, the Gold Medal winners, in which the records were created, Abdelateef Baka of Algeria braved the 17th Final Decade Second in the 1500m competition for the Divyangjans in a short time.
Moreover, I was surprised to know that the fourth person among the Divyangjans did not receive any medal as a runner, but they also ran in less time than the winners of the Gold Medal in the race for ordinary runners.
Once again I congratulate all of our players and India is moving forward in the direction of formulating a smooth scheme for the Paralympics and its development in the coming days.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience at Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
A Mega Camp of the Government of India was organised for the Divyangjans and it was established on a very big global scale.
On that day, I also got the opportunity to dedicate a book and in that book some successful stories of Divyangjans have been collected.
There were very inspiring events.
I consider it important to have a world record on the soil of India and Navsari.
It was successfully used to put the machines in the ears to listen to the persons with disabilities that could not be heard within eight hours.
It was ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for all of us to establish three world orders by Divyangjans in a day.
My dear countrymen, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu on the second October two years ago.
And on that day I had said that cleanliness should become our nature and it should be the duty of every citizen.
Now, on the second October, when it is taking two years, I can assure you that awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of the country's 1.
Today we all can say that everyone has tried to move forward one step ahead.
That is, the country has moved hundreds of crores of steps towards cleanliness.
It has also been decided that the direction is correct.
Its fruits are so good that we can see what is happening with some such efforts.
Bus stations, railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, harlots, children, elderly people, villages, poor, farmers, women and everyone is contributing to cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role.
However, we still have to go a long way.
For health, for the dignity of the citizens, especially for the honour of the mothers and sisters, the trees should be cut off.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve immense success in the near future in terms of tree coverage.
When I had visited Gujarat recently, the officials told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will be fully accomplished on this second October.
I would particularly like to present a scheme for young friends who are using technology today.
Everyone has the right to know what is the situation in your city of Swachhta Abhiyan and hence the Government of India has given a telephone number - 16.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1986.
You will not only be able to know the condition of constructing toilets in your city but you will also be able to apply for making toilets.
You must take advantage of it.
Moreover, a Swachhta App has been launched to find out the status of sanitation related grievances and grievance redressal.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
They can be sent as Swachh Bharat Fellows in the districts.
This cleanliness drive will not be possible even if it is confined to Sanskrit.
Cleanliness becomes a nature is not enough.
It will be useful in making waste fertilizers and for this the policy time has also been initiated by the government.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to purchase the compost-centrial fertilizer that is produced from the waste.
And the farmers who want to go to livelihood reach this fertilizer.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, worry about the health of the soil, those who want to stop the loss of good chemical fertilizers due to chemical fertilizers will be assured by the companies if such fertilizers are required in a small amount.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing a lot in this work as a brand ambassador.
I also invite youngsters to start new start-ups from waste to wealth-waste to waste-waste, to develop such instruments, to develop such technologies and to manufacture them in affordable manner.
This year, a special event - Indo-India Sanitation Convention is also being organized from 25th September to 2nd October.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors and Commissioners of metropolitan cities from all over the country have to concentrate only on cleanliness.
What can be done in technology
What can be the economic structure
How to do public participation
How can employment opportunities be increased in this
All issues are going to be discussed.
And I can see that new information about cleanliness is coming up.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technological University went to 10 villages and started an awareness campaign to build toilets.
He himself worked hard and contributed to the construction of nearly a thousand toilets.
Just a few days ago, you must have seen that a team under the leadership of Vingakmandar Param Vir Singh had travelled from Devprayag in Ganga to Gangasagar in a distance of 2800 kms and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made a full year calendar time sheet in its own departments.
Each department will focus on 15 days specially on sanitation.
The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayati Raj and Department of Rural Development (DoPRD) will work together to increase sanitation in their respective areas from 1st to 15th October, 2019.
The Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs, Department of Food Processing Industries, Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India will undertake sanitation drive for 15 days from 16th October to 31st October, last two weeks.
You must have seen that all the cleanliness drives are now underway.
Earlier, a report was presented to the people of the country about the situation of cleanliness in the three cities.
Now there are more than 500 cities in the country with more than one lakh population and due to this there is a belief in every city that we are lagging behind, but next time we will do something good.
Cleanliness has created an atmosphere of competition.
I hope that all of us citizens should contribute to this movement as much as we can.
The next October marks the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has also been completed for two years.
I have been urging you to buy something from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This time too, I urge that in every family, Khadi should have something or the other so that the lamp of Diwali can be lighted in the house of the poor.
On the second of October, when it is Sunday, as a citizen, can we connect ourselves with the work of cleanliness
If there is a video then send a video.
If our efforts in the entire country will once again get a new strength and a new momentum.
Remembering the blessings of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
And I have seen that in the past, whenever I asked for gas subsidy, the responses made by the people of the country itself is a very inspiring event in the national life of India.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the shackles and those old sportspersons used to ask for donations from the families and those sportspersons used to give bets to the poorest of the poor.
The wonderful pleasure that the poor kids like Pella sports seemed to be in such a way that they were adventurous.
The work of describing the political ideology of millions of workers like me, the political ideology of India, the political parties associated with the origins of India, the thinking of rewarding the cultural heritage of India, who gave their political philosophy, who gave their political philosophy, gave a solemn philosophy of humanity, the centenary year of Pandit Deendayal ji is beginning today.
Sarvajan Hitaya - the principle of Sarvajan Sukhay Antyodaya is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the welfare of the people of Awada.
How can the poorest of the poor get the fruits of development
He gave work to every hand, water to every farm, a complete economic agenda in two words.
We can save ourselves from poverty only when the country considers his birth centenary year as a poor welfare year, when it focuses on the benefits of development, the governments and the governments of the society and the welfare of the poor.
As a part of this, the Prime Minister's residence and the road that was known as the resource road of the British right now, has been named Lok Kalyan Marg on the occasion of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's birth centenary year.
This is a reflection of this centenary year of poor welfare.
My dear countrymen, I had started Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashmi.
It has been my sincere endeavor that Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to commemorate those government works.
How is the intelligent man of this country inspiring me
Is it the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the manner in which Mann Ki Baat appreciated and improved the way Mann Ki Baat was being concluded this week.
I also express my gratitude to Akashwani, who not only spread these things to me, but also made every effort to reach it in all the languages.
I am also grateful to those countrymen who have written letters after Mann Ki Baat, have knocked on the doorsteps of the government, have highlighted the shortcomings of the government and Akashwani has made a special programme on these letters and has provided a platform to the representatives of the government, to solve the problems.
Therefore, Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue, but a new opportunity for social change.
For any reason any other reason of bigger satisfaction than this can be any other reason .
My dear countrymen, next week, the festival of Navratri and Durgapuja, the festival of Vijayadashmi, and the preparations for Diwali have a different kind of atmosphere throughout the country.
It is a festival of incredible prayers and the unity of the society is possible for the country.
Whether it is Navratri or Durga Puja, how can it be a festival of prayers for the unity of the society
How to become a festival connecting humans with humans
And only then can we celebrate the festival of victory by combining it as a means of realisation.
Let us follow the mantra of unity, let us follow the mantra of unity.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 28th August, 2016
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on 2nd August, Hockey's Magazine Dhyan Chand ji was born.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
I pay my homage to Dhyanchand ji and also remind you of his contribution on this occasion.
He played an important role in giving India a hockey gold medal in the 128th, 132nd and 136th Olympic Games.
We also know the name of all cricket lovers and breadmen.
For Dhyanchand ji, he said, "High Scores Goal Like Rance, Dhyan Chand ji Sportsman Spirit, and a living example of patriotism.
Once, during the match in Kolkata, an opponent of the anti-competitive team threw a hockey on Dhyan Chand ji's head.
There was only 10 minutes left to complete the match at that time.
And Dhyan Chand ji had made three goals in those 10 minutes and said, I have replaced the injuries.
But I have seen that this time largely everyone has urged me to talk about the Rio Olympics.
I see it positive to say something about the applicability of the common man towards the Rio Olympics, so much awareness and pressure on the head of the country.
Besides cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports, there is so much awareness and so much knowledge.
Reading this message for me also became a source of great inspiration in itself.
Please speak to the daughters in Mann Ki Baat on their participation in education and sports as they have made the country proud by winning the medal at the Rio Olympics.
Any Mr. Sachin writes, I urge you to mention Sindhu, Witness and Deepa Karmakar in Mann Ki Baat this time.
The medals we received were given to these daughters.
Our daughters once again proved that they don't descend from anyone.
One of these daughters is from North India and one from South India and the other from East India.
And from any other corner of India.
It seems as if the daughters of the entire India have taken up the issue of making the country proud.
On MyGov, Summit Thakur has written that we could perform well in the Olympics.
He has written, "Congratulations to Honble Modi sir, the first two medals we have won in Rio, but I want to draw your attention to the fact that was our performance really good
And the answer is - no.
We need to bridge the gap in sports.
Our parents still ask us to pay attention to education.
Even today, sports is considered to be the worst of times in the society.
We need to change this idea.
Society needs inspiration.
Thus, thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
No one can deny that we cannot demonstrate our hopes in accordance with our expectations.
It also happened that the exhibition that our sportspersons had performed in India, the sportspersons were not able to reach there.
And only two medals could be found in the pursuit of the medal.
But it is also true that even if you look at medals, for the first time in many sports, Indian players have demonstrated great skills.
But why can we forget that it is the first Indian girl to qualify for the Olympics and for the Olympic Finals
In some of these tennis, Sania Mirza and Rohan Botany were associated with it.
For the first time in 32 years after Usha, Lalita Babare made a qualifying for the Track Field Final.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, the women's hockey team has reached the Olympics.
India's players, the time to come will certainly be good for us.
There are many players, like Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das.
But, my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we continue to do what we have been doing then we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
We will make a map of how we can do better.
Just imagine, the state chooses one or two games and plans how it can perform excellently in it.
I also urge the associations associated with the sportspersons to motivate them in an unbiased manner.
And I appeal to every citizen of India to send a suggestion on the Narendra Modi App, whoever is interested in it.
Let us write to the government.
The Association will give its representation to the Government in consultation.
The State Governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
But let us prepare ourselves fully and I am confident that we have to move ahead with a solemn pledge to achieve the best in the world of sports.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is the Teachers Day.
I have been spending a lot of time with the students on Teachers Day for many years.
But for this time, when I had to go to the G-20 Summit then I was told that today I would like to express my emotions in Mann Ki Baat.
And we have seen teachers who are more concerned about their students than themselves.
He dedicates his life to his disciples, to his students.
Nowadays after the Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichandra ji is being discussed.
He is a sportsperson but he has given a brilliant example of what a good teacher is.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher besides a player.
And on Teachers Day, I congratulate Pullela Gopichand ji for his penance, his dedication towards sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
Teachers' contribution is always felt in the lives of all of us.
On September 5, the former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ji is born day and the country considers it as a teacher day.
He may have reached that place in his life but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Moreover, he always used to say that good teachers are those within whom students never die.
Dr. Radhakrishnan ji has lived such a wonderful life to keep the inner student alive as a teacher despite being the President's post.
I think I remember a lot of things from my teachers because they were our heroes in our village.
But today I can say with joy that even though my teacher is now 70 years old, his letter comes to me every month.
And that is why if I see some good letters then there is a lot of respect in my mind.
It is the responsibility of all of us to take pride in our teaching community.
You must present your pictures with your teachers on the Narendra Modi App if there is any motivation for your teachers.
See, it is also valuable to see the contribution of the teacher in the country from the point of view of the students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival will take place in just a few days.
Ganesh ji is a scholar and we all want that the lives of our country, our society, our family and every person remain intact.
But when we talk about the Ganesh festival then it is quite natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of Ganesh Utsav is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Now, not only Maharashtra, but in every corner of India, the festival of Ganesh is being celebrated.
Essay competitions and colourful competitions.
Their exhibitions also highlight the artistic aspects of the society.
This big campaign of public education is going on through the Ganesh Utsav.
Surajya is our birthright, let us move towards the state, let us become our priority. Can we not convey the message of this mantra through the Ganesh Utsav
Come, let me invite you for this.
It is true that festivals are possible for the society.
This time, many people have sent me a lot of writings on the occasion of Ganesh Festival and Durga Puja.
Why not use the statue of Ganesh Ji made of mud of the village lake
The idols made of POP are not conducive to the environment.
It is Gods service that protects the environment, protects our rivers and climates and protects small creatures from pollution.
Ganesh ji is a scholar.
We should not create such a Ganesh ji that produces widows.
I don't know how you will take these things, but I don't say this thing alone. Many people say this thing and I have heard many things - a sculptor is Shriman Abhijit Ghondfal.
An unfavourable Ganesh Festival to the environment is also a social service.
Durga Puja still has time.
Today, let us assure the old family that constructs statues.
If we buy a statue from them then they will also get employment and if these statues are made from the soil of the pond or river then they will get it again.
My best wishes to you all for the Ganesh Festival.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred the Sant Upahi on 4th September.
Mother Teresa dedicated her whole life to the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud to be proud when Mother Teresa, who has served the poor of India for the rest of her life, receives the title of Saint.
On September 4, the Government of India will also send an official delegation to lead our foreign Prime Minister Sushma Swaraj on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
We have to learn something from saints, sages and great men every moment.
Let us keep getting something, learn something and keep doing something good.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then what a big change comes.
Janash Kit is considered to be the form of God.
Government of India has made a successful effort in collaboration with five state governments in the last few days to connect people to clean Ganga and to clean Ganga.
On 20th of this month, Sarpanches of villages along the banks of Ganga were invited to Allahabad.
Villages do not allow the river Ganga to be dirty, they come from Uttarakhand for this pledge.
Someone came from Uttar Pradesh, somebody came from Bihar, somebody from Jharkhand or some other from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India for fulfilling this vision. I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states who have taken an important step in the cleanliness of the Ganga by connecting the people with the people.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch me a lot and those who imagine them also have special respect in my mind.
On 15th July, more than seventy-two school students in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote letters to their parents.
Children aged seven to seventy years have done this work.
Congratulations to the students who made this effort and special congratulations to those parents who decided to take their children's letter seriously and make toilets.
There are things that inspire us.
Mallamma, a sixteen year old daughter in Koppal district of Karnataka, paid tribute to Satyagraha against her family.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
It has become the resolve of some Indians.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
However, everybody is connected to it in some way, everybody is contributing to it.
Everyday news comes about how new efforts are being made.
There has been an idea in the Government of India and people have requested that you make a film of two minutes, three minutes on cleanliness and send this short film to the Government of India.
You will get details on the website.
It will compete and be rewarded for the victory that will take place on 2nd October on Gandhi Jayanti.
I also tell the Channel makers that you too will be competing for such films.
Creative creativity can also give a boost to the cleanliness drive.
New methods will be discovered, new inspiration will be given and all this will be done by the common artists in public participation.
It is not necessary that there should be big studio, good cameras to make films.
A very important thing has happened in the past.
Our Honble President Pranab Mukherjee launched a new programme in Kolkata - Akashwani Friendship Channel. Now some people will have to inaugurate a radio channel.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
On the other hand, the Akashwani Friendship and Bangladesh Betar will share their shared comfort and the Bangladeshi people on both sides will enjoy the Akashwani.
I also thank Bangladesh for joining us for this work.
I also congratulate the friends of Akashwani that they are contributing to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, even if you have given me the responsibility of the Prime Minister, I believe that I am like you.
And sometimes the emotional events touch me a bit more.
Such emotional events also provide new energy and new inspiration, which inspires the people of the world to do something or the other.
In the past, I received a letter which touched my heart.
The retired teacher, who is about 84 years old, has written to me.
Had he not forbidden me to declare his name in this letter, I would have spoken to him today.
In a letter, he wrote that when you had appealed for gas subsidy, I had given up subsidy and then I had forgotten it.
My dear countrymen, you must be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those who have left the gas subsidy and some of my delegates would send a letter to him and send him a letter to him.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a great job, it is a great mission to free the poor mothers from the stove of chila and I am an retired teacher.
The question is not of fifty thousand rupees but of mother's emotions and it is the blessings of such mothers and sisters that gives me confidence and strength for the future of my country.
I bow down to that mother and also bow down to those insignificant mothers of India who have always been suffering in their own way.
My dear countrymen, last year we were in trouble due to drought but this month of August was filled with continuous flooding problems.
There have been floods in some parts of the country.
The state governments, the local autonomous bodies, the social institutions and the citizens were able to do whatever they could.
However, among the news reports of the flood, there were reports that needed to be remembered more.
What is the strength of unity, what kind of results can be achieved if we move together, we will be remembered for the month of August this year.
In August 2016, many opposition parties, non-operating parties and nearly 70 parties from all over the country, and several political parties in the Parliament, together, passed the GST Bill.
Similarly, whatever happened in Kashmir, in the context of the situation of Kashmir, all the political parties of the country spoke of Kashmir in one voice.
If it is uttered in the least words then I will say that unity and consensus - these two things have been in the original mantra. And all of us believe that from the Sarpanch of the village to the Bada Pradhan Mantri is of the opinion that if anyone dies in Kashmir then whether it is a young man or a security worker, this is ours, it is our people, it is our country, the people who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir, however, they will have to answer the innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big, it is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to reinforce the unity of a nation full of diversity and to reinforce ourselves with emphasis on unity, only then will the country be able to build a bright future.
My brothers and sisters believe in the enlightenment of the countrymen.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Today morning, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the youth of Delhi. And I believe that in the days to come, the color of sports throughout the country will enhance the youth with enthusiasm.
We all know that the world's largest sports event is going to be held in a few days.
The word Rio will repeat in our ears.
The whole world will be playing.
Every country in the world will keep an eye on the exhibition of its players. You will also keep it.
Our hopes and aspirations are very much, but those who have gone to play in the rio, it is the work of 1. 25 billion Indians to boost the enthusiasm of the players.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a grand event on Run for Rio, Khelo Aur Jio and Khelo Aur Khilo.
What should we do for the promotion of our players in the days to come, wherever we may be
No matter how much the food habits are, we have to leave everything.
Even if there is a sweet smell in the winter, one has to leave the bed and run away in the field and not only the player but also his parents.
Sportspersons are not made overnight.
I am also ready to do this work on your behalf.
The Prime Minister of India is ready to become a postman to convey your message to these players.
Let us make every sportsperson proud and enhance his efforts in the days to come.
And today when I am talking about the Rio Olympics, a poem was sent by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of a poetry-loving Punjab Central University.
There may be many other poets who might have sent poetry, they might have written poetry but they might have written it.
Every day technology changes, everyday takes a new look, everyday there is a new impact and it keeps changing.
You cannot capture technology.
If research and innovation does not happen then the way coastal water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a boost.
And if we live without research and innovation, then we will have to revive the era of change in the world and therefore we will have to give a boost to the spirit of science, research and innovation in the new generation.
Atal Innovation Mission is being promoted by NITI Aayog.
One goal is to create an eco-system across the country through Atal Innovation Mission, through innovation, experiment, enterprise, and thereby creating new employment opportunities.
Similarly, innovation is directly linked to the Incubation Centre.
And if I talk about Atal Incubation Centre then the government has thought of providing a huge amount of Rs. 10 crore.
Similarly, India is facing many problems.
We see problems in our daily lives.
Now we have to find solutions through technology.
And Atal Grand Challenge has called upon the young generation of the country to find solutions to the problems faced by you people with the help of technology, research, innovation and solutions.
Government of India seeks to promote and reward the technology discovered for solving our problems.
And I am glad that people are interested in talking about the fact that when we talked about the Tinkering Lab, about 3000 schools applied and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand institutes came forward for the Incubation Centre.
I believe that research, innovation, technology to solve the problems of our daily lives, simplification of our problems will be done by our new generation.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, we were worried about the drought and today the joy of rain is also coming and the news of the flood is also coming.
The State Government and the Central Government are working together to provide all possible assistance to the flood victims.
Even if there are some problems due to rains, the hearts and minds of all human beings become embarrassed because the focal point of our entire economic activity is in the rainy season.
Sometimes there is a disease that keeps us confused throughout life.
But if we remain aware, alert and striving hard then the way to avoid it is also very easy.
Dengu has been brought to power.
Dengue can be avoided.
Keeping in mind a little bit of cleanliness, be cautious and be cautious, pay special attention to the children and the poorest of the poor is a disease, but there is no case of dengue.
Dengu comes first in the comfortable prosperous region and therefore, let us understand it.
You might have seen the news on TV but sometimes we become aware of it and sometimes we are uncomfortable in taking cautious steps.
The government, the hospital, the doctor will do their work. But we will not enter dengue in our homes, in our regions, in our families and will be cautious about the diseases caused by water.
On the other hand, I would like to draw your attention to the dear countrymen.
Life has become so radical that it has become so busy that we don't have time to think for us.
If we fall sick then we feel that we will be able to recover quickly and for this we will be able to take any antibiotic and we will be able to save ourselves.
But the bacteria that are present in it are treated with these medicines and then medicines prove to be useless for these bacteria and then these diseases take years to fight, prepare new medicines, conduct scientific research etc.
The bacteria that spread tuberculosis and malaria are bringing about such changes within themselves that there is no effect on the medicines.
In medical terms it is called antibiotic rehabilitation and hence it is necessary to comply with the rules of using antibiotics.
When it comes to health, I would like to add one more thing.
Though the maternal mortality rate has come down in the last decade, the lives of very large pregnant mothers cannot be saved even today.
During pregnancy or deficiency of blood , infection related to reproductive organs , high BP , no matter how difficult it is to waste its life .
Keeping these things in mind, the Government of India has launched a new drive in the last few months.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, on 9th of every month all pregnant women will be given free examination at Government Health Centres.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not spend 12 days in a year for the poor
I have written a lot of letters in the past.
Thousands of doctors have come forward after following me.
But India is such a big country that lakhs of doctors should join this campaign.
I am sure you will join me.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is worrying about climate change, global warming and environment.
There is a collective concern in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
During the Kurukshetra war, Lord Sri Krishna talks about the tree.
In the Gita, Lord Shri Krishna says, I am drunk in all the trees.
As stated in the Rules of Justice, the NASTI ANUSHADHAN - There is no vegetation that does not have any medicinal properties.
The Discipline Festival of Mahabharata has been discussed in many areas and it is said that the trees that flow are the origins of the trees.
There is no doubt in it.
The tree that is donated by it is like a tree child in the world as well.
A few days ago, an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, had touched my heart.
In the discipline of Mahabharata, it is said that trees also fulfil the responsibilities of childhood in the entire world.
The farmer Khandu Maruti Mahatre of Narayanpur village in Jannar taluka, Pune, Maharashtra, married his grandson Sonal in a very inspiring manner.
When I saw a picture of them in the social media, I was surprised to see that even though there were no animals in the wedding, the plants were visible all around.
The sight of the picture was very touching.
In a way, Sonal's marriage has become an eternal story of nature's love and I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Mr. Mahatrejee for this new endeavour.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat then a large number of pilgrims visit the Ambaji Temple there in the month of Bhadrava.
And I would like to tell them that see, this is the mother's prasad and if you think that this plant will become big by going to your village then mother will continue to bless you.
And lakhs of pedestrians used to come and lakhs of plants were distributed in that year.
Temples can also start planting in this rainy season instead of prasad.
It can be a simple mass movement of tree plantation.
I have repeatedly told the farmers that if we waste our land on the banks of our farms then why should we not do the timber cultivation instead of the woods
If we plant such trees along our farms that are used for furniture and housing then it can be cut and sold after fifteen-twenty years after the government's permission.
And it can also be a new tool for your income and India can also avoid importing timber.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan - Desert Festival is such a big festival and we have pledged to plant twenty five lakh plants.
There is no small issue of twenty five lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan know how big a bear has been raised.
Industry has also pledged to increase its green cover by 50.
The Central Government has launched the Green India Mission, under which the Railways have taken up this task.
Gujarat also has a very bright tradition of the Van Mahotsav.
This year, many projects like Amravan, Ekta Forest and Martyr Forest in Gujarat have been taken up as forest festivals and have been running a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but they also deserve to be congratulated.
But for me, the journey of South Africa was in a way a pilgrimage.
When we recall South Africa, it is quite natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever a word of non-violence, love and forgiveness falls on the face of Gandhiji and Mandela in the world.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to Phoenix Settlement and was known as Mahatma Gandhian residence Sarvadaya.
I was also fortunate to have got the opportunity to travel by the train which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and that train which had brought Mohandas the second plant to become Mahatma Gandhi, that Peter Maritzberg Station.
But I got the opportunity to meet the dignitaries who sacrificed their lives for equality and equal opportunity and fought with Nelson Mandela.
Twenty-twenty-twenty-two years ago, Nelson spent his life with Mandela in jail.
In a way, he had cautioned the entire youth and I was fortunate to visit the friends of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ahmad Kathada, Mr. Laloo Chiba, Mr. George Bezori and Ronnie Casarils.
The duties described in the Gita are quite evident.
My heart will be reminded of that visit.
Equality and equal opportunity cannot be a bigger mantra for any society and government.
The priorities will be different, but the path is the same. And that is the path of development, equality, equality of opportunity, equality of expression and maternal feeling.
Let us take pride in our Indian diaspora who has lived the roots of our lives in South Africa as well.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Shilpi Verma.
Those who have conveyed my message and their concerns are very natural.
I am saddened by being a woman.
And some people are misguided and are stuck in the jealousy of money.
A new method of looting through this technology is spreading across the world.
And that too on a SMS.
And in a few moments they came to know that everything was looted.
But recently I had a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh had come to me.
Artificial paintings are drawn at the station.
If you ever go to Aligarh then definitely check the station.
Today, I have been receiving such reports from several railway stations in India that local people are presenting their identities on the walls of railway stations through their art.
An innovation is being experienced.
This is an example of how public participation can lead to changes.
Congratulations to all those who have done this kind of work in the country, especially to my colleagues from Aligarh.
And you will also join the festival at home and outside as well.
We have special significance in the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Like last year, can you not provide Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of your country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Just imagine, give such gifts to sisters that will protect them really in life.
And today is social security.
Today, Raksha Bandhan has a true meaning.
My dear countrymen, many of us are born after independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in an independent India.
The entire nation should be painted in the colour of the freedom fighters. Once again, the aroma of freedom should be felt, we should create this atmosphere. And the Freedom Festival should not be a government programme.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope that you too will do something related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Whatever you want, your talk should be kept so intensely from the Red Fort.
Nowadays, technology platforms are so simple that you can easily send things to me.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio
Everybody makes several programmes during the holidays.
And since there is a season for a person during the vacations, it also feels like enjoying a man.
And someone also feels that if you get a chance to sleep in the afternoon then it will be better.
But the scorching heat of this time has spoiled all the fun all around.
But I have seen that citizens also make very good efforts.
Awareness is visible in many villages and people who know what is the value of water, they are aware of the problem of water.
And that is why there is a sensitivity in water and there is activity in doing something.
A few days ago, someone had told me that the Bajar Gram Panchayat and the villagers of Maharashtra have solved water in the form of a very sensitive question in the village.
We have decided to harvest the crops that used the maximum amount of water, be it sugarcane or pulses.
It sounds very easy to hear, but it is not that easy.
And everyone went to the horticulture and vegetable cultivation that requires minimum water.
He has taken several initiatives such as fountains, drip irrigation, rain water conservation and water conservation.
Yes, I am talking about Bajar village on a small hill but there will be several such villages.
I thank all such villagers for their excellent work.
Someone told me that there is a Gorwa Gram Panchayat in the Desas district of Madhya Pradesh.
This Panchayat has made efforts to create swimming pools.
Although water is saved, but when water level rises, there is also a big improvement in water quality.
Sometimes it seems that when the Indian government brought water to Latur by train then it became a news for the world.
It is true that the speed at which the railways have done this work deserves appreciation, but the people of Pela village deserve similar compliments.
I would say that I deserve more congratulations than the Railways.
However, many such schemes that are being implemented by the citizens are not complicated at all.
The nature of the person may be somewhat complicated, but if some good news comes about it then he feels that the entire crisis has been resolved.
This year, it is estimated that the rainfall is expected to rise from 106 to 110 per cent, as if a message of great peace has come up.
Though it is time for rains to come, the news of good rainfall has also brought a new consciousness.
It will be a good rain, the more joyous the news gives us, the more it gives us a chance, it also challenges us.
Can we run a campaign from today to save the village water
Farmers need soil and they are used to grow that crop in the fields.
This time why do not we take soil from the ponds of the village and take it to the fields
This will also improve the land of the farm and also increase the water conservation capacity of the ponds.
Whether the water can be stopped in the cement bags, in empty fertilizer bags, by spreading and filling the soil
If water stops for five days, if water stops for seven days then water will fall into the ground then water level will rise to the ground.
There will be water in our wells.
Water should be stopped as much as possible.
So today, be it water crisis or drought, but we have the time for the next one and a half months.
And I have always said that if we go to Porbandar at the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, we will find a place in the different places where we want to see what kind of buses have been built under the house to save rain water and how clean the water remains in it.
Because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments came, several schemes were formulated and blockades were also spent, so it is quite natural for millions and millions of people like Bhai Kumar Krishna to have this question in their minds.
Ganga is a mokshadayini for those who have religious beliefs.
I will certainly accept this majesty, but I feel more that the Ganga is a lifeline.
Ganga provides us a new strength to live through it.
As the Ganga flows, it also gives a new impetus to the economic activities of the country.
We have brought Ganga to a devotional place but crores of devotees are required to save it.
This cannot be successful without public participation.
And that is why we have to become a representative of change for sanitation, sanitation and hygiene.
Several efforts have been made by the government.
Efforts are being made to cooperate with the states that have been formed along the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are also being made to connect social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have also been taken to prevent leakages and industrial pollution.
Everyday, solid waste is being disposed of in the Ganga through a large quantity of canals.
In order to clean such waste, the Trash Skimmer at Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc. works to clean waste water.
These machines have been provided to all local autonomous organisations and they have been requested to run them continuously and clean garbage from there.
And in the past, I have been told that there is a very good effort and at the same time garbage is being removed from 3 to 11 tonnes per day.
Out of the pulp  pepper industry, the waste or black liquid has almost stopped completely.
All these are indicative of the fact that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that if a person is found not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the far-flung south then he certainly says that if the Ganga will be clean
And that is the belief of the common man that will surely succeed in cleaning the Ganga.
People are also donating money for cleaning the Ganga.
This system is being run in a very good manner.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
It is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
Today, the Panchayati Raj system has started in our country.
And today gradually the Panchayati Raj system in the entire country is working successfully as an important unit of our democratic system.
And therefore, in collaboration with the State Governments, the Government of India has launched the Bharat Diwas from 14th April to 24th April.
And today on 24th day I will celebrate the Panchayati Raj Day in Jharkhand or in the region where our most tribal brothers and sisters live.
Once again, on the occasion of Panchayati Raj Day, I will interact with all the Panchayats of the country.
This campaign has done a very big job of awareness.
How can democratic institutions be strengthened at the level of the village in every corner of India
How to make the villages self-reliant
How do the villages plan their own development
The birth anniversary of the daughter should be the festival of the village.
There are several such schemes.
Food donation programmes were organized in some villages.
Perhaps 10 days of such programmes have been organised simultaneously in all these villages of India.
I congratulate all the State Governments and Sarpanches of the villages for this.
In a very fundamental way, with innovation, this entire mission was transformed into an opportunity for the development of the village, for the strengthening of the democracy.
The awareness that has come in the villages is the guarantee of India's rise.
Prime Minister Namaskar
I speak from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpur.
My question about education in school colleges is one of you.
Over the years, there has been a need for reforms in the education sector.
For example, lack of adequate schools or colleges or quality in education.
Today, if the parents have any first dream in every family then they live in good education of children.
Homes, cars, everyone gets the idea.
And for a country like India, this feeling of public mind is very powerful.
There should be greater anxiety and greater awareness among the children to be educated and educated.
And the child also becomes aware that I go to school for this work.
And that is why I would urge all the parents to talk to them in detail about the activities being done in the school by giving time to their children.
And if anything is noticed then go to school and talk to the teachers.
This opportunity can also reduce many of our education systems by reducing the evils.
So, in a way, the effort to spread education all around was a priority.
And it was also necessary.
However, the greater importance now is to improve our education.
We have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
With the literacy drive, good education will now become our priority.
Entry, Entrance, Entrance-Mantra remained consistently consistent but now the children who have reached school, we have to focus on good education, proper education.
You must have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to emphasize on good education.
But it is true that there is a need to bring about reforms in our country.
This time you must have seen in the budget that the work has been done by cheating the chilo.
In the Budget, he has asked ten Government Universities and ten private universities to come out on the path of liberation from government restrictions and to tell them what you want to do to become the top university.
This scheme has been formulated with the intention of giving them complete freedom.
Universities of India can also become globally competitive universities.
Along with this, the importance of education is equally important.
Similarly, technology will also play a big role in education.
Remote distance education and technology will also make our education easier.
And I believe that the results will be visible in the near future.
For a long time people keep asking me on one subject.
Some people write on the web portal MyGov.
Some people write to me on the Narendra Modi App and most of these youngsters write to me.
In today's era, sports is very important not only for the youth but also for the youth.
So, one day I also got the opportunity to interact with you people, before that I will interact with you all.
As a result, I had just called a meeting in which NCC was headed, head of NSS, head of Scouts Guides, head of Red Cross and Nehru Yuva Kendra.
And when I asked him, whenever he had met, he said, "No brother, our country has got such a first meeting after independence.
And I believe that a new life of these organisations should be fulfilled and a new strength should be irrigated.
This time I have put some topics in front of them.
Brothers and sisters, why don't our youth, organisations do a great job of water conservation in this season
Can we create such programmes for connecting the country
What can be the common youth of all our organizations
What new things can be added to their work culture and programme
If you write on my Narendra Modi App, I will take it to the right place.
Such a situation will be created.
My dear countrymen, today I appeal to all of you that we are compelled to think.
I also see it as a matter of shocking people.
You must have seen that the political situation in our country is such that in the last few elections, there were discussions about how many cylinders would the party give
And every political party felt that if it reached the middle class with the point of view of elections then the issue of gas battalion is very big.
On the other hand, economists used to pressurize them to reduce the subsidy.
And because of this, several committees were set up which included a lot of proposals and suggestions for reducing gas subsidy.
These committees were spending crores of rupees behind.
But the talk was going on there.
This experience belongs to everyone.
But it was not seen outside.
My countrymen, I am glad to calculate today that I have adopted the third path.
One crore families voluntarily handed over their gas subsidy layer.
But after calculating it, it was found that there were more than 80 per cent of these 1 crore families who had distributed distributors themselves in the queue.
One incident has forced the economists of the country to think in a new way.
And if the economies of the world also happen then they will be able to do so, if they do so then they will be the result.
Even for them, this is an incident outside their thoughts and someone has to think about it.
I would especially urge the entire political fraternity to say that we must do one thing that puts peoples trust everywhere.
You must not have imagined that we will get the result.
And we should go in this direction.
Please rely on those who are sending their exams to Marcus.
Sometimes I feel that we should announce that there will not be any ticket checker in the railway payrolls today.
Every newspaper and News Channel has a bad news on every breaking news.
Isn't there anything good in our surroundings in a country with a population of 1.
Please change this situation.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that only positive news should be published on the first page of the paper.
He used to say this thing continuously.
A few days ago, he also wrote a letter to me, saying, We have decided that we will not give any negative news on Monday.
This is the biggest reason for the inspiration to improve good news.
However, it is true that the more we strengthen goodness, the less space will be for the evildoers.
If we light the lamp then the darkness will go away and it will happen.
You can also contribute to it.
Ravi ji has given a good suggestion but please do not be angry with me.
Let us all strive to make a positive difference, let us strive to speak positively.
The specialty of our country is Kumbh Mela.
Kumbh Congregation can also be a center of attraction for tourists .
Very few people around the world will be aware that crores of people will come to the bank of the river for such a long time.
For the last two days, I have seen that many people are uploading pictures of the Singhstha Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India, the State Tourism Department to compete with it.
Photo Competition, and tell people to upload beautiful pictures in beauty.
How will the environment be created completely and people will also be aware of the diversity of the Kumbh Congregation.
So it can be done.
The Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, he used to say that we have laid special emphasis on cleanliness.
And it is not just that there should be cleanliness.
People from there also take the message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh may be a religious-spiritual fair but we can also make it a social opportunity.
How can we enhance the love for water from this Kumbh Mela, enhance the faith of water, and how we can use this Kumbh Mela to deliver the message of water conservation
My dear countrymen, on this important day of Panchayati Raj, I will meet you once again in the evening.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
You might remember that the last time I had talked about a book about Premchand ji's stories and we had decided that I would share a few things with everyone through the NarendraModi App.
I could see that a large number of people have shared information about several types of books.
I am glad that people are discussing and discussing books on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and lifestyle.
Yes, I will definitely talk to you about some other books.
But I have to acknowledge that now I cannot spend too much time reading books.
However, one advantage has been that I am getting the opportunity to know about the books that you people are sending.
But from the experience of last month, I feel that we have to take it forward.
Why should we create a permanent Book's corner on the NarendraModiApp And whenever we read new books, write about it and discuss it.
And you can also mention a good name for our Books Corner.
I want this books corner to become an active platform for readers and writers.
Keep reading, writing and sharing it with all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Several effective efforts are being made to conserve water across the country.
People have to tell about traditional methods and methods.
Media too has a lot of innovations on water conservation.
Whether it is the government, the NGOs, they are doing something at the war level.
Looking at the strength of the collectivity, the mind is feeling very good and satisfying.
For example, the enthusiasm shown by the villagers in the village of Aaram in Orenzi, far away from Ranchi in Jharkhand, has become an example for everyone.
You will also be happy to know that Ishaan, the beautiful state of India, Meghalaya has become the first state in the country to prepare its water policy and water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, those crops are being promoted which require less water and farmers do not suffer any harm.
I specially congratulate the Government of Haryana that they interacted with the farmers and inspired them to steal from traditional farming and produce less water.
Now the time has come for festivals.
Several fairs are also organized on the occasion of festivals.
Why should we not use this fair for water conservation
Friends, Some things in life inspire us and especially the achievements of the children, their valour gives us a new energy. And that is why today I feel like talking about a few children and these children are Nidhi Bipotu, Manish Joshi, Danshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Naga, Atharva Deshmukh, Arunatesh Ganguly and Hrithik Al-Manda.
Whatever I say about them will fill you with pride and zeal.
We all know that cancer is a word that fears the whole world.
It seems that death stands at the door, but all these 10 children have not only defeated fatal diseases like cancer in their lives, but have also brought laurels for India throughout the world through their valour.
In fact, this month, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
This is a unique sports event in which the Young Cancer Surveyors participate in the same life as those who have emerged out of cancer.
Competitions like shooting, chase, swimming, running, football and table tennis were organized in the competition.
All these 10 champions of our country have won medals in this tournament.
Some of them won medals in more than one game.
My dear countrymen, I firmly believe that you must have been proud of the success of India across the sky, in space, in India - I talk about Chandrayaan 2.
Sanjiv Haripura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga, Kolkata, and P.
Aurobindo Rao, several such people from different parts of the country have written to me on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and he has urged me to discuss Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, 2017 has been very good for India in terms of space.
Our scientists had released A-SAT in March and after that Chandrayaan-2.
There was not much talk of big and important news like A-SAT during the election race.
We have achieved the capability of breaking the satellite in just three minutes, three hundred kilometers away from the A-SAT missile.
India became the fourth country to achieve this achievement and now on 22nd July, the entire country proudly saw that Chandrayaan-2 had taken its dagger from Sriharikota towards space.
But if you ask me what two major teachings I have received from Chandrayaan 2 then I will say that these two teachings are Faith and Fearlessness i. e.
We must rely on our talents and capacities, we must believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan 2 is completely indulged in Indian colour.
It is Indian in terms of objective and spirit.
It is a fully indigenous mission.
It is unprecedented that the way our scientists have launched Chandrayaan-Be in a record time by rectifying all the technological problems day and night.
The entire world witnessed this great penance of scientists.
We have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but always remember that we have the potential to achieve them.
I sincerely hope that the Chandrayaan-2 mission will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
In fact, science is the path of development.
Now we are eagerly waiting for the month of September when the Lander Records and Rover-Intellectual landing will take place on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share a very interesting competition with the students and young friends of the country and invite the youngsters of the country for a quiz competition.
Space-related curiosity, Indias Space Mission, Science and Technology - will be the main subjects of this quiz competition, such as what to do for rocket launches.
How the satellites are installed in the room and what kind of information we get from the satellite, what kind of A-SAT happens, there are so many things.
I appeal to young friends, students to participate in this quiz competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with your participation.
I specially urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their schools successful.
The most thrilling thing is that the Government of India will take the students to Sriharikota at their own expense and in September they will get the opportunity to witness the moment when Chandrayaan will be landing on the surface of the moon.
This will be a historic event in his life for the successful students.
But for that you will have to participate in the quiz competition, get the maximum marks and you will have to succeed.
Friends, You must have missed my suggestion - this is a pleasant occasion.
My dear countrymen, you must have noticed one thing.
Our thoughts have given momentum to the cleanliness drive from time to time and similarly the efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
This journey, which started five years ago, today is setting new benchmarks for cleanliness with the participation of the people.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal situation in sanitation, but the way the cleanliness drive has been successful from ODF to public places, it is the strength of the resolve of 1.
This movement is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days back, I was watching Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh is a military engineer and has left his job in America and returned to serve Mother India.
He has taken the initiative to make Delhi not only clean but beautiful some time ago.
He started with his team from Lodhi Garden garbage collectors.
Through street arts, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
When he started trembling from the walls of the Over Bridge and schools to the hutments, he got the support of the people and this sequence started.
You might remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh.
I came to know that Bhai Yogesh Saini and his team played a major role in this.
There may be no sound in the colors and in the lines, but the sense that is created by the images of the films is more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us that the culture of making waste to wealth is evolved in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward towards making the waste waste waste waste.
My dear countrymen, I have read a very interesting stamp on MyGov in the past.
It was from the brother Mohammad Aslam who lived in Shopian in Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote - "Mann Ki Baat" programme wants to be heard.
I am happy to state that I played an active role in organizing Community Mobilization Programme - Back to Village in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organized in the month of June.
I feel that such programmes should be organized every three months.
Besides, online monitoring of the programme should also be arranged.
I think that was the first such programme in which people had a direct interaction with the government.
Bhai Mohammad Aslam ji sent me the message and after reading it, my eagerness to know about the Back to Village programme grew and when I got to know about it from the region, I felt that the entire country should also be aware of it.
The people of Kashmir are eager to connect with the mainstream of development.
The programme lasted for weeks and in all the four and a half thousand Panchayats of the State, Government officials briefed the villagers about the details of government schemes and programmes.
How can the Panchayats be strengthened
How to increase their income
What can be the impact of their services in the lives of the common man The people of the village also showed their problems freely.
Friends, This programme was not merely naming that the officers would return to the villages all day long but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
Several other things have also been added to make the programme interesting.
Sports Competition for Children was organized under Khelo India.
Sports Kit, MGNREGA Job Card and SC-ST certificates were also distributed.
The people of Kashmir participated in this festival of development.
It is heartening to note that the Back to Village programme was also organised in remote villages where government officials had to travel on foot for one day or one and a half days while passing through difficult roads.
These officers also reached out to the border panchayats, who are always in the ranks of militiamen crossing the border, and also in the highly sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag.
Some officers were so impressed with their welcome that they stayed in the villages for more than two days.
Such programmes and peoples participation in this show that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir want good governance, which also proves that the power of development always lies heavily on the strength of the bomb.
It is obvious that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, want to create obstacles, can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, who has been honoured with the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented the month of Shravan in a poem like this.
In this poem, he has said: "The meaning of rainforest, and the stream of water is unique and the earth is immersed in its beauty.
Throughout India, people from different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Shravan in their own way.
In this season, whenever we look around us, it appears as if the earth has covered a green cover.
During this time, the festival of Raksha Bandhan is also a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
You will be happy to know that during the last four years, most of the devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra.
Since 1st July, more than 3 lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than the number of pilgrims who had participated in this journey that lasted for over 60 days in 2015, this time it has been included in just 28 days.
I especially commend the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey become admirers of the spirit of humility and intimacy of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I was told that more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months since the start of the Chardham Yatra in Uttarakhand this year.
For the first time since the disaster in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I appeal to all of you that you must visit those parts of the country whose beauty blossoms during the monsoon.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of our people, tourism and travel, perhaps, there can be no greater teacher than this.
My best wishes to you all for this beautiful and vibrant month of Shravan, to communicate with you new energy, new hopes and new expectations.
Similarly, the month of August is reminded of the uit India Month.
However, when we look at TV then we get to see only one aspect of rain-filled water, traffic jam on all sides.
Thank you very much.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am equally concerned about your child exams.
But if we change our ways of examining the tests, then we can become stress-free.
In my last episode Mann Ki Baat, I had said that I am delighted to share your experiences and suggestions on the Narendra Modi App.
Parents and some thinkers of the society have sent me a lot of things in writing by the teachers whose career has been very successful.
I will do some of the things that I have read and told me.
Whatever I feel, how much of it will be.
I would like to share with you the message that Bharat Ratna Shri Sachin Tendulkar has sent to the youth of India for which he is proud of.
You must work hard but set a real target for yourself and try to achieve that goal.
When I was a cricketer, I had a lot of expectations.
So it was very important for me to find a solution.
So I thought that I would keep my expectations and fulfill my goals.
But I am fulfilling this goal and I am fulfilling it. I am doing something good for the country.
And I always tried to achieve that goal.
My focus was on lyrics and goals were gradually realised.
I would like to tell you that it is very important that your thoughts are positive.
Why competition
Why not competition
Why should we waste our time in competing with others
Why should we not compete with ourselves
Why shouldn't we decide to break all our old records
You lice, no one can stop you from moving forward.
And when you break your old records then you will not have any expectation for happiness, satisfaction or satisfaction.
Do not consider exams as a game of statistics.
Don't be stuck in the account of wherever you reach.
Life should be linked to some great objective.
We should move ahead with our dreams, we should be committed.
Whether these exams are going to be true or not, our pace is correct or not.
And therefore, if the dreams are huge, then the exams will become a festival of joy.
Every examination will be a step towards accomplishing this great objective.
Every success will be the key to achieving this great objective.
And don't be confined to what will happen this year and what will happen in this examination.
Walk with a big objective and nothing less than expected will not be despaired.
And it will be very courageous to make efforts.
Thousands of people have written small things on my App with mobile phones.
Representative Gupta has stressed that healthy mind remains in the body.
Students, along with your studies, also take care of your health so that you can write properly in the examination.
Now I dont want to say this thing on the last day that you should start a campaign and go for three kilometers and five kilometers.
But one thing is true that what is your day-to-day, especially during the examination days
Our 365 days should be in line with our dreams and resolves.
I agree with Shriman Prabhakar Reddy Ji, he has specially requested that he should sleep on time and revision should be done after waking up early in the morning.
You should reach the centre of exams before taking entries and other things before time.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said this thing, I may not hesitate to say that because I am a little sad about sleeping.
And many of my friends keep complaining to me that you are sleeping very little.
And this is possible.
I am not talking about sleeping.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable if there is a slight problem in one organ or even in one part of our body.
Not only this, our daily routine also becomes distraught.
And that is why we should not consider any issue as small.
You do not get stuck in the habit of compromising with the licensing which is certain.
Fix it, do it.
Friends, I have seen that those students who go for exams have two types of students.
You must have seen these two types of students.
Anyone can do this better than me, who has a mastery in checking and the big players of the world who have made a chakmat.
Viswanathan Anand, Champion of the Tawa Chase will share his experience.
Come, let us learn from them the way you check in this examination.
Hello, let me begin by conveying my best wishes on the eve of Vishwanathan Anand.
I will talk a little about the examinations and experiences given by me.
It looks like the problems faced in life after exams.
When you play, you don't know what will be the case now. You don't even know what questions will be asked in the examination.
If you are calm, healthy and have taken a sufficient decision then you will get the right answer at that moment.
So be calm.
Don't put too much pressure on yourself, don't keep much expectations.
See this as a challenge - I remember the lessons that I have learnt during the year, I can solve the problems.
In the last minute, the topics that you don't remember properly should be passed through these important things.
You can recall some details with teachers or students which will help you in the course of exams.
If you repeat the difficult questions then all these things will be fresh in your mind and you will be able to write them very well in the examination.
Therefore, be calm, take a very deep sleep, don't be very confident, and don't be disappointed.
Therefore, have full faith in yourself.
"Vishwanathan Anand has indeed spoken very importantly.
Sometimes we used to hear that the incident of the life of Arjuna was observed in the eyes of a bird.
Deep sadness is going on, you cannot relieve yourself if you are putting up books in the last moments.
Let's laugh, let's go laughing, let's say joke with friends, let's see, the atmosphere of peace will be created only after that.
You can imagine that you are standing on a pond and beautiful things are visible below the pond.
But if suddenly stone starts flowing in some water and vomiting starts in water then what would be the beautiful things that were visible in the pond
If the water is calm then something may not be as deep as it is visible.
But if the water is turbulent then nothing is visible below.
Then I feel that if I don't feel a bit light then I will feel better.
So I have developed myself technically.
It can be my experience, which will help you too.
Rajat Aggarwal has said a good thing.
He writes on my App: We should feel comfortable with friends and family for at least half an hour every day. Rajat ji has said this very important thing because most of us want to sit down to calculate how wrong we have done when we have done the test.
We are trapped in it.
Guys, don't do this.
Spend half an hour after coming out of it.
Rajat ji's talk is really a matter of understanding.
Ramcharit Manas, while describing it in the present context, is trying to bring this culture of the country and the world to Sarita.
Such venerable Muraribapu has also sent important stamps for the students.
And he is also a teacher, a thinker and hence there is a blend of diversity in his speeches.
I feel that we can be very happy and happy to accept the situation.
You will certainly succeed in your examination without any hesitation and happiness. And even if you do not get success, it will not be a game of disappointment and it will be a matter of pride to succeed.
I am also grateful to the revered Mr. Muraribabu for giving a very good message to us.
Friends, today I want to tell you another thing.
I can see that those people who have shared their experiences with me this time have discussed Yoga.
Well, friends, let me clarify today, it will be unfair to you if you start doing Yoga tomorrow morning.
But it is true that Yoga is a big key in the development journey of distance, be it in the student life or be it in the second half of life.
It's easy to chew.
Look, if you can do it, you can do it.
I have great faith in it.
It's not like that, my friend.
However, if we read the suggestions then perhaps we are copping up the suggestions or yes, it is okay, let me go the same way.
And I would urge you that even if you go to it for five minutes, you must read the instructions.
When I read it for the first time, I felt that I didn't get it, but when I read the same thing again, I realized that no question was asked in a different way but this is the same thing that I don't understand the questions.
Rao, he emphasized on patience.
Very few words have given a very good message to all the students.
Let us listen to the message of Rao Saheb.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering.
N.
R.
Rao speaks.
I believe that it is natural to have anxiety due to examination.
And these are competitive exams.
Don't worry, do a good job.
I say the same to my young friends.
Always remember that there are many opportunities in this country.
Like mountains and trees, you also have the right to be here.
Strength, devotion and penance should be in you.
With such a quality, you will be successful in every exam and other efforts.
Goodblase, how is it a scientific approach
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
Whatever he has said - destiny, penance, this is the same thing - dedication, determination, diligence.
If you feel like you will be afraid.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do a good job.
Now my app has given a message about the experience of exams on the right.
He said that there is a lot of effort in his family to create a positive environment during exams.
It is true that Sachin ji also spoke about the positive approach, the positive frame of mind.
We read in our syllabus about the researcher Thomas Lwa Edition of Electricity Guarantee.
Friends, how many years did it take for them to do this thing How many times did it take, how much time did it take, how much money did it go, how much disappointment it would have been due to failure
But today this electricity and this bulb also illuminates our lives.
It is said that the possibilities of success are also hidden in failure.
Who doesn't know Shrinivasa Ramanujan You must know one of the modern-day calculations - Indian mathematician.
His formal education did not incorporate subjects, nor did he get any special training.
However, he contributed immensely to various sectors such as Mathematical Analysis, Number Theory.
K.
Rolling is an excellent example that success can be achieved by anyone.
The Harry Potter category is popular all over the world today, but it was not the case at the beginning.
They had to bear many difficulties.
Rolling said that in the face of difficulties, he used to work with full energy which was really important for him.
The exams are now being conducted not only for the students but also for the entire thinking and for the entire school and for the teachers.
But the situation is not good if the student is alone without the support of the girl and the teacher.
The examination becomes easier if all the teachers, girl students or senior students come together and become units and move forward in a planned manner with a common idea.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the app: He has complained that the parents should not put any pressure on their children to bring more mercury.
They should be encouraged only to prepare.
If the child is talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Build a light-hearted environment, create a positive environment, be it your daughter or daughter, how many conferences come up.
You will also be able to see those conferences.
Friends, one thing is certain, especially I want to tell young friends that the lives of our people have changed much more than our older generations.
Every moment, new discoveries, new technologies and sciences are reflected in the form of new colours.
And this is not just what we feel.
We also want to move ahead from the scientific pursuit of science.
I am doing this because today is National Science Day.
The Science Festival of the Nation is being celebrated on 28 February as National Science Day.
28 February, 2018, 128 S.
Rommon announced his search for roman efficiency.
He received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
Therefore, the country celebrates 28th February as National Day.
Curiosity belongs to the people of science.
And new discovery cannot be possible without science and technology.
Today, on National Science Day, we should focus on innovation in the country.
Knowledge, technology and all these things should become a comfortable part of our development journey.
And this time the theme of National Science Day is Make in India Science and Technology Drive Innovations.
Friends, some successes are achieved after a long time and when success comes, the vision of the world changes.
If you were very busy in exams, you might be able to record a lot of news in your minds.
But I want to tell the countrymen this thing again.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a huge and important discovery in the world of science.
The world's scientists worked hard, the generations went on doing something, and after nearly a hundred years a success took place.
The discovery of Gravitational Waves has emerged as a man of our scientists.
This research is a very far-reaching success in science.
This discovery does not just authenticate the theory of our great scientist Einstein of the last century, but is considered a great discovery for physics.
This entire mankind will work for the entire world.
But as an Indian, we are glad that the sons of our country were associated with the honourable scientists of our country in the entire research process.
Our scientists will continue to strive to advance research in the future too.
India will also become a partner in international efforts.
And my countrymen, we have made an important decision in the last few days.
In order to achieve even greater success in this discovery, the Government has decided to open the Laser Interfaceter Gravitational-Wave Observatory which is called Lego in India.
By joining India, this process will get new energy and new momentum.
India will surely become an active partner in this highly scientific research process of human welfare amongst its limited resources.
Once again I extend my best wishes to all the scientists.
From yesterday you can listen to my Mann Ki Baat by placing a message on that number.
You will also be able to hear in your mother tongue.
The number of messed-ups is 8108-8108.
81908-81908 days, your exams are underway.
You know, the budget is tomorrow.
We all celebrated the Christmas festival and are now preparing for the New Year's reception.
India is full of diversity.
In a way, every festival waits for another festival.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where there is a festival-driven economy.
This becomes the reason for the economic activity of the poorest of the poor.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on behalf of me and many congratulations on the New Year of 2016.
The year 2016 brings a lot of happiness to all of you.
New zeal, new zeal and new resolve will take you to new heights.
Shri Ganesh V.
Savleshwarkar has written to me that this season is a climate of tourists.
A large number of tourists from India and abroad come here.
People also go for bathing holidays.
The cleaner our tourist destinations, the better Indias image will be in the world.
I welcome the ideas of Ganesh ji and I am conveying the message of Ganesh ji to the countrymen.
Anyway, we call the guest gods and goddesses, whenever we visit any hospital.
At the same time, in our tourist destinations, in our tourist destinations, in our pilgrimage destinations, this is indeed a special thrust.
However, they are ordinary artisans and they work hard and work hard.
He has done a wonderful job that has been published several times.
And when it came to me, I also felt that I had brought this thing to you.
In Bhojpura, he has constructed 100 toilets so far, considering that it is a sacred task without his hard work and hard work.
I sincerely thank Dilip Singh Malviya very much.
Sometimes we hear depression about the country.
And that is what makes the country proud and it is natural for them to take pride in Mann Ki Baat for Dilip Singh.
This is the result of the untiring efforts of several people that the country is progressing at a rapid pace.
Twenty-five crore Indians are moving ahead with one step by one step and the country is also taking the lead.
Excellent education, excellent skills and new employment opportunities.
It is a big task to provide easy loans under the MUDRA Yojana to the common family members who could not afford to reach the bank doorsteps.
Who can forget the occasion of Yashoda Mata and Krishna When Balakrishna opened his mouth and visited the entire universe of Mother Yashoda
The event of Yoga has made India self-reliant.
In a way, Swachhata is being embraced in the household.
The participation of citizens is also increasing.
Perhaps the people living in the cities cant guess what is the limit of the enthusiasm and zeal that the villages that will have electricity connections after so many years of independence.
Until now there has been no widespread discussion among the media but I am confident that the media will reach out to such villages and the biggest benefit will be that those employees of the government who are working in this direction will be so satisfied that they will be so happy that they have done something that will bring about a change in the lives of a village.
Should all these services be made available to them whether they are farmers, poor, youth or women
Therefore, it should not be reached as to what kind of work the government has done and which government has not worked.
However, it should be ensured that if they are entitled to this matter then do not let them go.
Should they also get information for their rights
We must strive to ensure that the right thing, the right thing, the right thing, the work of a man, the more people can reach.
This is also a service.
I have also made a small effort to do this thing in my own way.
I can't do everything alone.
But should I do something of what I am doing
A common citizen can also download the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone and join me.
And I keep sharing these small things on it.
And it is a matter of great pleasure for me that people also tell me many things.
How can I reach without your help
Let us collectively share the interests of the common man in the language of the common man and inspire them to achieve their objectives.
This was followed by discussions in all the departments of the government.
My young friends, on the 16th of January, the Government of India is launching the complete Action Plan Action Plan of Start-up India, Stand-up India.
And the event will be attended by liv-connectivity from IITs, IIMs, Central Universities, NITs and all the youngsters across the country.
For example, whether it is a digital world or an IT profession, this startup is for them.
No, we have to bring about a change in it as per the requirement of India.
The market will be available.
Is the intellectual property of our youth limited to certain cities
This idea is wrong.
Youngsters have talent in every nook and corner of India and the Cham should get an opportunity.
This Start Up India, Stand Up India should not be limited to several cities.
And I also urge the state governments to take this forward.
On January 16, I will be present before you and will interact extensively with you and will always be welcome to your suggestions.
Friends, 12th January marks the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekanandji.
Those who are getting inspiration from Swami Vivekanandji.
Swami Vivekananda Jayanti (National Youth Festival) is celebrated as National Youth Festival from 15th to 12th January.
This year it is scheduled to be held in Rampur, Chhattisgarh from 12th GNR to 16th January.
And I have come to know that this time their theme is because their theme is based, that the theme is very good. I have been told that more than 10,000 youths from all the states and all the corners of India are going to get together.
The sight of a young India is to be created.
In a way, dreams have to be fulfilled.
The resolution is about to be realized.
Can you suggest me about this youth festival
I especially urge the young friends that I am the Narendra Modi App.
So I will wait to see your thoughts on the Narendra Modi App on the Kumaon Festival.
Dilip Chauhan of Ahmedabad Gujarat, who is a visually challenged teacher, celebrated Excellent India Day in his school.
He has conveyed his heartfelt condolences to me and celebrated the Excellent India Summit in Sir, and in my school.
We enjoyed schooling and inspired children to help the disabled in the society.
I feel that this was the first time that you have done.
Dilip ji thank you very much.
And you yourself have been working in this field.
If you understand these things very well then there will be a lot of problems.
Sometimes there is an opportunity to meet such persons in the society, then there are some ideas in our minds.
We also express our vision of going to them as per our thinking.
Several words have been used in the world for such people but the words have always been reflected.
Every time people feel that no, they don't like the identity of this word, they don't feel honourable.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, I was going to attend that programme.
However, in some districts of Tamil Nadu and particularly in the state of Tamil Nadu, I could not attend the commencement of the drive on that day.
But I had to go to that programme. Something was going on in my mind.
At that time, I had thought that the Paramatma who has given some deficiency in the body, who has given some deficiency, who has done a good job, who is called a disabled person and who knows him as a disabled person.
But sometimes when they are familiar with them, they come to know that we see a deficiency from their eyes but God has given them a special distinction.
After that, I was contemplated in my mind that we feel that he is a disabled person but feels that he has some extra power.
And then I came to mind that why not use the word Divyang in place of the disabled in our country .
These are the people who have such organs that have divine organs that do not have the ordinary organs in us.
I like this word very good.
My countrymen, can we develop the habit of word Divyang in place of disability
I assure you that you will take this forward.
We have launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
Under this, we will make it easier for the people with disabilities by amending the inter-sectoral framework both physically and indirectly.
Schools, bus stations, railway stations, ramps, accessibility parking, accessibility lifts, braille scripts etc.
In order to simplify their availability, innovation, technology, system and sensitivity should be needed.
We have taken up this task.
Public participation is also being received.
They should not be dead in files.
In the past, the Government of India has made an effort to ensure that the beneficiaries of schemes are easily benefitted.
Subsidy is being given to gas cylinders in our country.
The government made some changes in it.
Be it Jan Dhan Account or Aadhaar Card or be it Beneficiary Account of subsidy directly to beneficiaries, through the Largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme, the largest in the world in terms of benefits.
This scheme is known by the name of initiative and the experiment is very successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore cooking gas consumers have become beneficiaries of Pahal Yojana.
Government money has started directly entering bank accounts of 14 crore people.
No intermediaries, no recommendations are required, no chance of corruption.
On the one hand, the campaign of Aadhaar card, on the other hand, opening of Jan Dhan Account, on the third hand, the state government and the government of India together prepare the list of beneficiaries.
So far, about 40 thousand crore rupees have been directly transferred to the beneficiary's account through various schemes.
I am sure that about 35 to 40 schemes are being directly incorporated into the Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, it is also a pleasant coincidence that this time the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the guide of our Constitution.
The Constitution was also discussed in Parliament for two days and it was a very good experience.
All the parties, all the MPs have spoken excellently about the sanctity of the Constitution, the importance of the Constitution, the realization of the Constitution etc.
We should move forward in this regard.
Can Republic Day truly connect people with the system
Our Constitution gives us a lot of rights and the officers discuss it in a tough way and it should also happen.
But the Constitution also emphasizes duty and obligation.
But it has been observed that the discussion on duty is very low.
Very often, when elections are held, there are publications all around, it is written on the walls, it is our sacred duty to hold elections.
It is a matter of duties at the time of voting, but why don't there be any obligations in literary life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, can we compete in schools, colleges, in our villages, in our cities, in different societies, in organisations by organising essay competition, poetry competition, oratory etc
What a great history can be created if one-and-a-half crore Indians move forward with duties.
Can you send me that
I would like to know your thoughts.
He sent me to my portal, MyGov.
I would certainly like to know what the youth of my country thinks about it.
It is a small suggestion.
On 26th January, when we celebrate Republic Day, we are citizens, children of school colleges, idols of great men in our city.
And this is not the government's wait.
As a society, as a country, can we make it easier
On 26th January, we should collectively try to honour the statues of such great men, their cleanliness, their premises, and all these things should be easily done by the people, by the citizens.
Friends, Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2016.
What would have been the opportunity to go to
And along with new zeal, business and employment must have started.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have also started.
Festivals have a special significance in social life.
Every nook and corner of the world receives news of natural calamities and reports of natural calamities that no one has ever heard or thought.
People are also experiencing the rapid impact of climate change.
Many people have died.
I express my condolences to all those families in this hour of grief.
State governments are fully engaged in relief operations.
The central government also always works closely.
Recently, a section of the Government of India is in Tamil Nadu.
But whenever we want to talk about crisis all around then we need to bring about a lot of change in it.
15 years ago, natural disasters were a part of the agriculture sector as it was limited to the maximum natural calamity i. e.
Today its form has changed.
At every level, it has become imperative for us to work for our capacity building.
Governments, civil society, citizens, every small and big institution has to work very scientifically for capacity building.
After the Nepal earthquake, I spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
And I had suggested to them that the SAARC countries should collectively make a joint poem for disaster resilience.
I am glad that the symposium and workshop of Best Practices and a Tabletock Exercise Issue of SAARC countries concluded in Delhi.
A good start.
Today I have received the call from Jalandhar in Punjab to Lakhvinder Singh.
(Yes, Lakhwinder Singh speaks from Jalandhar in Punjab district.
We are doing organic farming here and guiding many people.
Lakhwinder Singh ji, I am very happy to hear your message.
Moreover, you are very well aware of the problem of farmers.
And your concerns are true but this is not the case in Punjab Haryana alone.
This is our habit all over India and traditionally we are moving forward on the path of burning the ruins of our crops.
But the pain you have expressed is true.
The first step is to train our farmer brothers and sisters.
But this is not true.
The remains of the crop are also very valuable.
It is a biological fertilizer in itself.
We swed it up.
Moreover, if a small piece of it is made then it becomes a dry fruit for the animals.
Secondly, due to burning, the upper layer of the land gets burnt.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Imagine for a moment whether our bones are strong, our hearts strong, the kidneys are good or not, but what would happen if the upper skin of the body gets burnt
Heart cannot survive even if it continues.
The upper layer of our land gets burnt, which pushes our yield to death.
And therefore, we should make a positive effort.
Once again this thread is burnt to the ground, it becomes a fertilizer.
Or if some water is poured into a ditch by pouring potatoes and pouring water then it becomes the best organic fertilizer.
Animal fertilizers do not only save our land but also double the benefits if they put the fertilizer in it.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who had cultivated banana.
And he told me a good experience.
Earlier when he used to cultivate banana and when the banana crop was finished, he had to spend Rs. 5000, 10,000, 15,000 per hectare to clean it.
And till the time the people who picked it up, they used to stay in the same place until they had taken a tractor-bacter.
However, some farmers have proved that they had pieces of six-six-eight inches of the mattress and burnt them to the ground.
The water that is in that pool keeps the crop alive.
Dear Countrymen, the world will remember the International Day of Personnel with DCEBILITIs on the 3rd of December.
Last time Mann Ki Baat had discussed my organ donation.
The Helpline of My Noto for Organ Donation was also discussed.
On November 2, 2018, Indian Organisation was considered as DoNER Day.
Film actor Ravina Tandon and many well-known people joined the film.
Partnership can save valuable lives.
When an organ is transmitted from one body to another then it gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness in this area and in the true sense the needy will get the best possible help because this help will not be given to any other person unless they donate it.
I had earlier said that he is observing 3rd December as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally challenged persons also have an unprecedented courage and capability.
Sometimes it hurts when they enjoy it.
Sometimes a feeling of compassion and compassion is expressed.
But if we change our vision towards them then these people can inspire us to live.
They can inspire us to do something.
Even if we have a small problem, we start crying.
Then I remember that my problem is very small, how do they manage
And that is why all these are a source of inspiration for us.
His philosophy of transforming his vision into a power is commendable.
Javed Ahmad, I want to talk to him today.
40-42 years of age.
In 1996, Javed Ahmad was shot dead by the terrorists in Kashmir.
We had the power to stand on our feet but we did not give up.
Even the wounds of terrorism cannot be defeated.
Body does not help but they have been immersed in the study of children for twenty years.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop facilities for handicappedness in government offices at public places
They are working on it.
He also changed his studies in this direction.
He obtained Master Digri in social work and as a social worker, as an awakened citizen, he is making a silent revolution today.
Is the life of John not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Javed Ahmad, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
In the absence of time, I might have spoken about entrepreneurship, but in every corner of India, the light of such inspiration is flourishing.
They are showing new ways and illuminating the lives.
On 3rd December, there is an opportunity to remember and inspire all of them.
The middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the deprived, the deprived, the deprived, the deprived sections of the society have to constantly cry with the government systems.
And as a citizen, one feels a bad feeling sometimes on behalf of a government servant.
And it changes our vision of looking at the government system forever.
Sometimes we don't even know because we don't know that any government system, any government job is doing this thing.
ASHA workers in our country who are networked across the country.
I have never heard of ASHA workers amongst the people of India, nor have you heard of them.
But when I became the worlds most renowned family entrepreneur of the Bill Gates Foundation, his success has become a phenomenon.
The Bill Gates and the Milinda Gates were combined in the past.
He works very socially in India.
They have been using their retirement time and whatever earnings they earn throughout their lives for the work of the poor.
In the last few days, the Odisha government had specially honoured an ASHA worker on the occasion of Independence Day.
They should be pursued for treatment on the basis of the preliminary systems they have learnt.
Emphasis on the use of insecticides in every household.
For example, Asha Varkar Jamuna Mani Singh is working with dedication to protect the entire village from mosquitoes so that the child can sleep well and take care of them.
He fought against Malaria and prepared the entire village to compete.
It would be a matter of great pride.
Millions of people will be within our reach.
We will look at them with respect.
Such people become very impossible for our country.
How big is the happiness and grief of the society
I salute all such ASHA workers through Jamunamani.
An e-book refers to the inspirational events of Swachh Bharat, the ideal village of parliamentarians and health sector.
I urge you to look at it.
See, not only this, but also show to others.
Read it and it can be possible that you have a mind to add such things.
So surely you are Mygov.
in.
Such things do not come very quickly in our minds but they can be right for the society.
Positive potential is the biggest energy.
You should also tell about good things - share it.
You can truly become a social teacher.
The temperature of the earth should not rise anymore.
It is the responsibility of everyone, it is also anxiety.
And this is the first way to save the temperature.
14th December is National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are underway from the government.
Bulb schemes are underway.
Once I had said that on the full moon night, we should shut down the shallow lights and bathe in the moonlight for hours.
It should feel the light of the moon.
When a friend sent me a link and I got the opportunity to see it, I felt like telling you about it.
A woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur does not seem to have got the privilege of studying more on TV.
But they are doing something that perhaps no one would have thought of.
He is working with solar energy to provide light to the poor using solar energy.
He has created a committee of women and has set up a plant of solar energy driven funs.
And he pays a rent of Rs. 100 per month.
People take funs in the evening and return to charging in the morning.
And in such a large number, I have heard that people from 500 households come.
Now see what the world's largest people will do for climate change, but a silver jubilee is inspiring everyone.
And the meaning of Noorjahan is to publish the world.
He is spreading light through this work.
I congratulate Nurjah and congratulate i TV as he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the nation and the world.
Many congratulations.
I have received a call from Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey of Uttar Pradesh.
We want to know from the Honble Prime Minister how these MUDRA banks are helped by the adventurers like us.
Mudra promotes business enterprises.
MUDRA creates opportunities for earning.
And Mudra empowers in true sense.
This MUDRA scheme is going on to help the small adventurers.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginning has improved.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crores under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am glad that there are about 24 lakh women in these 66 lakhs.
And most of those receiving this help are those belonging to SC, ST, OBC and those who work hard to run their own family with dignity.
Abhishek has spoken of his own enthusiasm.
A lot of news keeps coming to me.
Someone just told me that there is a Shailesh buzz in Mumbai.
Under the MUDRA Yojana, he received loans worth Rs. 8.
And he started the Suez dress cleaning business.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new adventures.
And Shailesh Bhonsle did it.
And I have been told that in such a short span of time they had paid two lakh rupees to the bank.
This is the purpose under our Mudra Yojana.
But earlier they used to raise money from more interest.
And because of the earlier interest and other reasons, due to other reasons, this amount was now being saved by more than one thousand rupees per month.
And a good business of his family started growing gradually.
But I would like to say that the scheme will be more propagated.
All our banks should be more sensitive and help the smallest of the people.
Indeed, these people run the economy of the country.
Only those who do small things are economically impaired in the country.
We also want to emphasize on it.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of Sardar Patel Jayanti, I had talked about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
These are the things to which the society should be consistently aware.
What should be the framework of the program
What should be logo
How to increase public participation
I had asked for all these suggestions.
I was told that many suggestions are coming up.
But I still expect more suggestions.
I expect a lot of chocolate schemes.
And I have been told that the participants have to get certificates.
Some of the major prizes have been announced.
You can also run your creative mind.
How can Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat make this mantra of Unity Integration a mantra to connect this mantra with Ek Bharat
Whether it is public or grand, whether it is life-force, whether it is easy to connect everyone or not, what should the government do
What does the society do
What does civil society do
There can be many things.
I believe that your suggestions will be used.
My dear brothers and sisters, Winter has arrived.
I would urge you to use this good weather for a while to keep the body healthy.
And create an environment in the family itself, be it a festival of family or be it a festival for one hour, all of us have to do this together.
See how the consciousness comes and how the body supports the whole day.
So if there is good weather then good habits will also be there.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind...
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
Once again I am fortunate to join you in Mann Ki Baat.
Today, India and South Africa are going to play the fifth day match in Mumbai.
This category has been named Gandhi Mandela.
And that is why the last match has grown significantly.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Centre of Akashwani.
I would like to say that if we look at such awareness and proactive people in our regions of the country then our aim of running the country with public participation will get a new strength.
And therefore, I convey my best wishes to all the colleagues of the Kannur Akashwani Kendra.
The students of St. Mary Upper Primary School, Chittor have written a letter to me in Kerala.
The letter is special in many ways.
Firstly, these girls have made a picture of Mother India with the mark of their thumbs.
I have sent a picture of India's map.
At first, I was very surprised to see why he made the map of India through the print of his thumb.
But when I read his letter, I realized that he had given a very good reflective message.
These are the girls who have just tried to make the Prime Minister aware.
He is campaigning for public awareness for participants.
He has also staged dramas at various places so that people can understand the contributions.
Organ donation becomes a trend and activity.
These girls have written to me in a letter asking people to donate their belongings in Mann Ki Baat.
He says that organ donation should be made a festival.
Recently, I have received a lot of messages on the phone call.
Debesh ji of Delhi has also given me such a message.
It is a very fruitful step taken by the government to achieve the ambitious goal of donating one by one to ten lakh persons.
I feel this thing is very important.
More than 1. 5 lakh kidneys, heart and liver donations are required every year in the country.
But in the country of 1. 25 billion, we can achieve only five thousand transplants.
Every year one lakh eyesight is required.
And we can reach only twenty five thousand.
We can only give one in front of the four eyes.
Efforts have also been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some of the states have made a good effort to speed up the work by reducing the written letter.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the forefront of the Organ donation.
Several social institutions and voluntary organizations have been working very well in this direction.
National Organ and Tea Transplant Organization-NOTO has been set up to promote organ donation transplantation.
A Helpline of 1800 1140 working hours is also available.
And we have been told there that Tyaketan Bhujitha.
This is an excellent description of the joy of sacrifice.
A few days ago, we had seen on TV that Delhi's G.
And that operation was successful.
A life was saved.
Let us recognise the spirit of Taken Bhujeetha and give a boost to this thing.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we have recently celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days we will also celebrate Diwali.
Id also celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi.
India-Africa Foreign Summit is being organized in New Delhi from 26th to 2nd October 2018.
This is the first time that such a grand event is being organised on Indias soil.
The chorus has been invited to African countries and leaders of the Union.
A summit of the largest African convention outside Africa is being organised.
India-Africa relations are close.
The population of African countries is as much the population of India.
And if we get both, we are a third of the worlds population.
And it is said that lakhs of years ago this was the same land.
Later these two pieces of the Indian Ocean were divided.
We have a good deal of natural resources.
And nearly 2 lakh people of India have lived in this country for a long time.
India has economic ties with African countries, cultural and political ties.
But India plays a very important role in training the youth of the most African countries.
More than 25,000 African students are studying in India in Human Resource Development, Capacity Building.
And today there are leaders of many African countries who have studied in India.
So how deep we are
And that is why this Summit is very important.
Generally, when the Summit meets, the heads of different countries meet.
Similarly, the Summit will have a meeting of the Heads of Government.
However, it is our endeavor that people should also get together in it.
Approximately six hundred schools participated in it.
It also included schools outside India and India.
And thousands and thousands of school children have written about India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, an exhibition titled 'Memories of Mahatma' from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is going on from Porbandar to the Northern states on the 2nd October.
Millions of school children witnessed the exhibition.
The people of the village witnessed how Mahatma Gandhi had a great role in Africa and India's relations. What was the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's archaeology on both the landscape
Children from schools in our small places are also very brilliant, their vision is so widespread and they are very deeply imagined.
Although this summit is of India-Africa, we can clearly see the opportunity to connect the people.
I congratulate the dignity, all the children participating in the competition, over 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
Last time on 15th August, I had made a proposal on the MPAGY.
Thereafter, a lot of Parliamentarian friends have done this work.
He was very fond of it.
A workshop was held in Bhopal last month.
Out of these, the Sarpanchs, the Collectors, some MPs, the Government of India, the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the Republic of India, together discussed the issue of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
A lot of new things came to mind and we got to know very encouraging things.
I would like to bring some of these things to your notice.
Jharkhand, in a way, is a very big region and a tribal area.
He chose to make Parsi Gram Panchayat an ideal village in Kunti district of Jharkhand.
It was also difficult for the government employees to go there.
I congratulate the Honble Member of Parliament, Mr. aria Mundaji.
And in a way, the school offers education for children in the morning and teachings for children in the evening.
And these children taught about five hundred fifty illiterates, they read and read.
We can see that there is no budgetary system in the society, no maturity, no specific system but what a big change can be brought about by the will.
This village is well known for the production of sugarcane and kurtaya jaggery in the state.
Smt. Ruwala ji started the Kurtaya Gullu Sherdi festival in this village on 11th March.
People of old public life also came here.
The government officials who worked there also came and an exhibition was organized to increase the sale of sugarcane products.
How the village can be made a hub of economic activity, how sand can be sold in the village itself.
Ruwala ji is truly a complimentary officer for his efforts to build a self-reliant village along with an ideal village.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be a matter of mind and not a matter of cleanliness
Savita Rai of Mumbai has sent a message to me through telephone: We clean our homes every year for the preparation of Diwali.
On this Diwali, let us keep the outside environment clean along with our homes and keep it clean even after Diwali.
He pointed to the correctness.
My dear countrymen, I would like to remind you that after the festival of Diwali last year, our country, especially the media, had launched a massive drive. And whenever there was a firecracker after Diwali, they said that it was not the same.
All the media had launched a campaign of awareness.
And the result was that after Diwali, a clean mission was started immediately.
So, Savita ji, it is true that the more we worry before the festival, the more we should do after the festival.
Every public programme should be done.
And today I would like to especially congratulate the entire media world of India.
On 2nd October, I was fortunate to participate in the Safaigiri Summit organized by India Today Group on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhis birth anniversary and one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
He gave away the Clean India Awards and I also saw how many activities are going on.
For this, people themselves are working like the One Like One Mission.
What are the places in our country that have been kept so clean.
All these things came to light and I conveyed my heartfelt gratitude to the commendable work of the India to Day Group at that time.
He has been promoting sanitation through e-TV for the last one year.
He has added 51 lakh children of about 55-56 thousand schools in Andhra-Telangana.
Whether it is a public place, a station, a religious place, a hospital or a garden, a massive campaign of cleanliness has been launched in many places.
Now these reports themselves show the power to realize the dream of a Swachh Bharat.
The Mission Clean India is the hundreds of channels of our country, thousands of prints, thousands of prints and because of lack of time, I cannot take everyones name but everyone has started this campaign.
And that is why according to the suggestions given by Savita Raiji, today the entire country is considering this thing as its own.
The Governor of Meghalaya has written to me a letter to His Excellency Shanmugnath.
And through that letter, I have mentioned the Mavalyanong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last few years, this village has faced the challenge of cleanliness, and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this cause of cleanliness.
And it is said that a few years ago, he had received the award for the cleanest village in Asia.
I am glad to hear that there is a village in Meghalaya in the far-flung North-East of our country which has been in the field of sanitation for years.
This has become the nature of the citizens there and it has become the culture of the village.
This is what gives us confidence that our country will be clean.
And when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2017, we can proudly say that the Jews have liberated our Mother India from dirt, my dear countrymen, I had said from the Red Fort on 15th August that there are some things that have become a house of corruption.
When a poor person goes for small jobs then he does not know how difficult it is to bear the burden of anybody's recommendations.
I have never heard that there should be any psychological psychology in the world that can completely cross a person in a two-minute interview.
And I had announced that why should we not abolish the Interview for small post jobs
My young friends, today I would like to proudly say that the government has completed all the procedures and now the interviews will not be taken on the non-gazetted posts of Group D Group C and Group B of the Central Government.
The Rules shall come into force from 1st January, 2016.
We will not put any obstacles in the process that is underway, but it will come into effect from 1st January, 2016.
My best wishes to your young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget, we had announced an important scheme.
Gold has become a part of social life in our country.
Gold is considered as a medium of economic security.
The crisp time key is considered to be gold.
This tradition has been going on for centuries in social life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the gold bank and the bank will give you interest on it, the kind of money you deposit and the kind of interest you get.
Earlier we used to keep the gold in the locker and we had to pay the locker.
Now I will put gold in the bank and the bank will give you money in the form of interest.
Speak patriots can not become wealthy now .
Whether gold can be converted into a living force from a dead financing or not
Just this is what we have to do, please help me.
Now do not keep gold at home.
Its safety and interest, two benefits.
Take certain advantages.
There is another scheme Sovereign Gold Bond which does not have a gold link in your hands but has a paper.
However, the price of this paper is as much as the amount of gold, the day you return this paper, the price of gold will be refunded to you.
So we are launching these schemes.
We will no longer have to buy gold.
I will certainly present this scheme of security guarantee to the countrymen next week.
I am glad to inform you that we are bringing some gold coin with Ashok Chakra.
It has been almost 70 years since our independence but till now we have been using foreign gold coins or even using gold boolean bars.
Why should not the indigenous market of our country be
Therefore, in the coming week and in the next week, the Ghanteras will come out and Dhanteras will make available to the common citizens, and Indian gold coins with 5 grams and 10 grams of Ashok Chakra are being started.
Besides, 20 grams of gold bullen will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about a new innovation in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary is being celebrated.
Remembering Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the map of Ek Bharat is evident.
This great man has contributed immensely to the unity of India.
Iron Man has introduced his strength.
We will pay tribute to Sardar Saheb but his dream of uniting India was that he had geographically demonstrated. But this mantra of unity should always be the medium of our thoughts, behavior and expression.
India is a country full of diversity.
Several sects, sects, dialects, castes, dresses and diverse diversities are our country and this is the diversity that gives us our beauty.
Had it not been a diversity, perhaps we would have taken pride in the splendour we would not have been able to take.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity, this is the root cause of development.
Over the last few years, on 31st October, the country's Run for Unity programmes are being organised.
I have heard that this time too it is being organized all around.
People are enthusiastically preparing for the race for unity.
The race for unity is in the true sense of development.
In other words, the guarantee of development is also a race of unity.
Let us pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
May the mantra of unity move forward.
My dear countrymen, I have to visit Britain on the second day of Diwali.
I am very excited about my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also provide scholarships to such classes of society, be it Dalits, tribals or backward classes, their talented children who go abroad.
I believe that this place of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage centre for him when our children of India will study in Britain.
And that is why I am very excited about my visit to Britain.
And you can imagine the kind of joy and joy of the people like me if that building is going to be constructed by the people of 1. 25 billion countrymen with the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
I will also get another opportunity in London to unveil the statue of Lord Basweshwar.
The work that Lord Basweshwar had done for democracy and women empowerment several years ago is truly a learning aspect of the world.
The dedication of the Statue of Lord Basweshwar to the people of India on the occasion of Dharmati in London is an excellent example of how the great men of India used to think, how long they used to think.
You know that whenever such incidents are associated, the hearts of our countrymen become thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Later, there are discussions on the skies of your letters.
Government officials are being called upon and discussed.
Some people write their problems and try to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
However, a good relationship is closed between us.
Last time I was completing one year.
Today we are entering the new year.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
I have had a fundamental idea in my life and because of this I have great faith in the power of the people. However, I can say that the power of the people is even greater than what Mann Ki Baat taught me.
Our ancestors used to say that public responsibilities are part of that god.
I can say from my experiences of Mann Ki Baat that there is immense power in the thoughts of our ancestors, because I have realized that I used to suggest suggestions for Mann Ki Baat and I used to talk about two or four suggestions every time but lakhs of people used to be active and inform me, this is a very powerful force.
Yes, these lakhs of letters also gave me a big lecture.
Different departments of the government analyzed the public's letters and what are those things about the policy, what is the personal question, what is the matter that is not in the government's mind
Who would have thought that the source of these information would become Mann Ki Baat
One day I had said that Selfie with Doctor and the whole world was surprised.
Perhaps in all the countries of the world, what kind of dignity has anyone got in lakhs of selfie with the doctor and the daughter
And when he used to do Selfie with a doctor, he not only encouraged his daughter but also made a commitment within himself.
Even when people looked at it, they felt that the neglect of the daughters should now be taken care of.
It was a silent revolution.
Keeping in mind Indias tourism, I had told such citizens that if you go to Incredible India, if there is a good picture then I will see.
The tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the state government, may have never thought that we have such a beautiful legacy.
There was a time when Khadi for Nation.
Is not the demand of the hour now or the Khadi for fashion
Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the last one year, the sale of Khadi has almost doubled.
On a TV channel, I had seen that a retired teacher, a widow, was standing on the line to leave the subsidy.
It is a difficult task to quit the subsidy for the common man, the lower middle class, but such people have left it.
Is this not a silent revolution
Is not this the philosophy of manpower
Governments must also learn from the fact that the work done in our government offices is a powerful, dynamic and determined society outside Umarah.
We made every small thing ourselves and made every effort to connect ourselves with the good of the country.
What can be a bigger satisfaction than this
This time I thought of doing a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I prayed to the citizens of the country to telephone your questions and suggestions.
I will pay attention to it in Mann Ki Baat.
This is a pleasant experience.
People of all ages have conveyed their message.
I liked to hear some messages myself and I liked it.
My team is working on the rest.
You might have taken a minute or two minutes but your phone call for me is very important.
The entire government will work on your suggestions.
But one thing was surprising for me and was delighted.
However, it seems as if there is negativeness and negativeness in all directions.
But my experience was different.
Thousands of people had said this thing in their own way.
Anything could be said, but I am surprised that all these things were the same as be in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat.
Completely positive, indicative, creative.
People have said that more than 70 of the remaining energy-efficient and joyous things are being added.
They must have listened to the radio.
I came to know about the importance of radio for the blind.
I see a new dimension and say such good things, it is enough to sensitize people and the government.
I have a message from Alwar Rajasthan to Pawan Acharya.
Listen to what they want to say - "My name is Pawan Acharya and I am from Alwar Rajasthan.
Pawan, I believe that like the wind, your feelings will certainly reach every corner of India.
It has been suggested that the soil should not be priceless and therefore the soil is also priceless.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the Army.
Whether it is our naval force, the ground forces, the air force, the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, and the Navy,
The war in 1965 had completed 50 years with Pakistan.
On this occasion, he has set up a diamond exhibition near the India Gate in Delhi.
From the point of view of history, we can learn a lot and if we look for inspiration in life then perhaps there can be no bigger inspiration than this to serve the motherland.
Whether it is the Hajipir, the real North, Chamundani or the Hajipir, it is thrilling to see the sights of victory and pride towards our soldiers.
I had also met these heroic families and those who took part in the war are now in the Northern era of life.
If you want to make history, it is important to understand history in depth.
I have returned in two and a half hours but it will take you three-four hours.
Look at the strength of democracy, a small child has directed the prime minister, but the child has forgotten his name in a hurry.
We should also make the nature of cleanliness and make arrangements for cleanliness.
I got a lot of satisfaction from the message of this child.
I too have to hear a lot.
I can see the best of these things that the Parliament of the country is also discussing about the cleanliness of India.
And on the other hand, on the one hand Parliament and on the one hand the children of this country talk about cleanliness - what can be the good fortune of a big country
The movement that is going on - the atmosphere of hatred towards filth - the atmosphere of hatred that has become aware of hygiene - will also make the governments responsible for the work.
Even if there is a shortage, we have to move forward. And in 2019, when we will celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will work towards fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi. And you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Once he had said that if I want to choose one of the two freedoms and hygiene then I would like to select cleanliness first. After independence, Gandhi had more importance than freedom.
From Delhi, Gulshan Aroraji has conveyed a message to MyGov.
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Deendayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men are always an inspiration for us.
And it is not our job to evaluate the ideals of our great men.
If you publish any date, you will get the name of any great man from the ornaments of history.
In the days to come, let us remember all these great men, let us convey the message of their lives to every household and let us also try to learn something or the other.
I would like to especially urge you once again for 2nd October.
2 October is the birth anniversary of revered Bapu Mahatma Gandhi.
Last year too, I had said that you will have every kind of fashion clothes, every kind of fabric, many things but it should also have a place for Khadi.
Once again I have said that Khadi is free from 2nd October to 1st month.
We should take advantage of this.
And along with Khadi handloom should also be given equal importance.
The Khadi maker will go to the house of a poor widow and that is why in this Diwali, we must place Khadi in our homes and place it on our body.
And when we look at it, we almost doubled the sales.
How many poor people have benefited
The work that the government cannot do with the announcement of crores of rupees has been done with a small help.
This is the strength of the people and that is why I once again urge you for this work.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I have a great pleasure in this thing.
I feel that you should also get some taste of this happiness.
I had gone to Kolkata in the month of May and had come to meet the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose.
His brother Chandra Bose had organised everything.
I had got the opportunity to spend a happy evening with the family members of Subhas Babu for a long time.
Can you imagine how much happiness will be for me
Perhaps for the first time in his life, there might have been an occasion to visit the Prime Minister's residence.
But more than that, it is a matter of happiness for me that I have never had the privilege of being a guest in the Prime Ministers residence in October.
More than 50 people of Subhas Babu and the entire family live in different countries, all people are coming here.
I got a message from the Bharagavi Kanda and after listening to his voice, I felt that he feels himself to be a leader and perhaps he will become a leader.
My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to awaken the younger generation about water registration so that in the times to come, the participation of the younger generation is increased and the important support of the younger generation is being chosen and run by the government.
Every voter in the democracy has the fate of the country and this awareness is gradually increasing.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Election Commission was working as a single controller but in the last few years it has changed a lot.
Today, our Election Commission is not just a controller, it has become a facilitator, it has become a voter friend and among all its ideas and programmes, it is a big change.
The electoral roll should continue to be upgraded and we should also keep checking.
I am telling you in the election season that after the first polling, drinking water.
How sacred it is, everyone should do it.
On the very day, I visited Kashi.
One, I got the seventh standard student named Kshitij Pandey.
It is the seventh standard in Kendriya Vidyalaya in Banaras Hindu University.
However, it is extremely intelligent.
But at such a young age, I saw his interest in physics research.
He was saying what kind of sensitivities should be there in robots, what kind of sensitivities he was saying, it was a very wonderful brother.
There should be constant questioning in the mind of the child . Why
How to do
When
This child should ask the mind.
Similarly, I had to meet a very small child.
He is nine years old.
This daughter of Sadabrij Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi, is the daughter of a very poor family and I was surprised that the entire song that she sings is in her heart.
But the biggest thing I felt was that when I asked him he used to say Shloka, he used to interpret it in English and used to define it in Hindi.
Whether the songs are read or not
When we take history, we all face it in the evening.
We are also surprised to see how they are so talented in the entire family.
I was really very impressed.
Sometimes some children are delighted with celebrity but Sonam had nothing like this.
Besides what you see on TV, you read in newspapers, we do a lot of work and sometimes enjoy such things.
Similarly, my interaction with these two children was memorable for me.
I have seen that some people bring me a lot of work in Mann Ki Baat.
Sandeep ji, what will you do to me
I have to make so many confusions once in a month, I have to adjust so much time.
Sometimes my colleagues in the skywalk have to wait for half an hour.
But I respect your feelings.
I am grateful to you for your suggestions.
Now it's just a month.
Mann Ki Baat has completed one year.
Do you know how much Subhas Babu used to use radio
He started his radio from Germany and he used to constantly engage the citizens of India with the help of radio in relation to the freedom movement.
He started the Azad Hind Radio from a weekly News bulletin.
He used to run this radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushto and Urdu.
It has been a year since I also talked about Mann Ki Baat on the sky.
I also say that I am yours and this is my satisfaction.
We will again meet for Mann Ki Baat next month.
You must be sending your suggestions.
Your suggestions also benefit the government.
Reforms begin.
Your contribution is immense for me.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's Mann Ki Baat
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
Once again I have got the opportunity to come amongst you for Mann Ki Baat.
People in far flung areas are celebrating Onam and yesterday the entire nation celebrated Raksha Bandhan.
In line with social security, the Government of India has implemented several new schemes for the common man.
I am glad that in a very short span of time, everyone has accepted these schemes in a big way.
I had made a small request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, we should give this security scheme to our sisters.
The primary information that has come to me that since the beginning of this scheme, eleven crore households have joined this scheme.
Moreover, I was told that almost half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I consider this auspicious sign.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
A year ago, since I was talking to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up in a big way.
The work that has not been done for the past few years will be done in such a short span of time.
I also saw the implementation of the poor
Shri Sinha was supposed to open the account with balance.
However, the poor saved and deposited Rs.
Youngsters have been employed.
You will be happy to know that in this one year, one lakh thirty one thousand financial literacy camps have been organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
There is no need to stop only opening accounts.
And now thousands of people have become officers of overdraft under the Jan Dhan Yojana.
And there was a belief that the poor could get money from the bank.
I have brought it to you and now it is your duty to maintain it.
All of us should have an active account.
You must do this, I am sure.
In the last few days, the events of Gujarat, the trunk of violence, made the whole country unbreakable.
But in a very short span of time all my enlightened citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat took over the situation.
The situation had played an active role before the deterioration and once again Gujarat was on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and brotherhood - this is the right path.
And we have to walk on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the last few days, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I got the opportunity to listen to them.
And I am sure that the kind of experience that I have experienced, I have got the opportunity to hear their words that in a way a music is playing.
I liked it very well.
Perhaps it is the most important thing to realize the true nature of Islam in the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition that is associated with love and liberty will take this message far and wide, which will benefit the human race.
And I also tell others that we may believe in any community but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider this invitation as my good fortune.
In India, scholars of Buddhist traditions from many countries of the world are going to come to Bodhgaya.
First Prime Minister of India Pandit Nehru had visited Bodh Gaya.
I will get the opportunity to go to Bodhgaya with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Once again I would like to especially tell you about Mann Ki Baat.
I have already mentioned this topic in Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me in the Parliament, you must have heard me in public meetings, you must have heard me in Mann Ki Baat.
I have been saying this thing every time that the government's mind is open on the issue of dispute regarding the Land Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion for the interest of the farmers.
But today, I would like to tell my farmer brothers and sisters that the reforms in the Land Acquisition Act came through the states that if the villages and the poor farmers will have to recommend water supply, if they will have to construct a canal to provide electricity to the fields, if they will have to construct a road for the village, if they will have to construct a house for the poor people of the village, if they will have to make arrangements for employment for the poor youth of the village then we will have to leave the laws from the slums of this imperialist bureaucracy.
And then there was a proposal for amendment.
But I saw that the fear was spread so much that the farmers were so scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, My farmer should not be misguided nor should he be afraid.
And I dont want to give any such opportunity to anyone who fears the farmers and misleads the farmers.
We presented an Ordinance.
The Ordinance date is being completed tomorrow on the 3rd of August.
And I have decided that it should be eliminated.
This means that the situation that preceded the formation of my government has re-established.
But one work was incomplete.
And that is why we brought them in the Ordinance but due to these disputes this issue has also been neglected.
And I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan is not just a slogan for us but it is our mantra.
Village, welfare of poor farmers.
And that is why on 15th August I had said that not only the agriculture department but also the agriculture and welfare department will be formed.
And when it comes to the war of 1965, it is quite natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is also natural to recall the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan.
It is also very natural to remember all those martyrs who have maintained the tri-color flag of India and its glory.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 165 war.
And I am glad that India is doing a great job in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are really doing excellent work.
Now we have the opportunity to bring these researches to the masses .
How to convert the principles into equipments
How to connect labels with land
We have to push it forward as an opportunity.
I also got some new information.
I can say that it was also an extremely inspiring experience for me.
And when I had recently said in Mann Ki Baat that our students should move towards science.
After this meeting I feel that there is a lot of opportunity and there are many possibilities.
I get several letters from citizens.
He has written about Skill Development.
From Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu, Shri Prakash Tripathi stressed on the need for good teachers for primary education.
The emphasis is on reforms in the education sector.
My young friends have also shared one thing.
I had said from the Red Fort on 15th August that why interview for lower level jobs
And when an Interview no call comes, then every poor family, widowed mother, where will you get employment
The poor will not have to run for the enforcement.
There will be no exploitation, no action.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For health, especially for maternal and infant mortality and mortality, the call-to-action for its action plan was jointly deliberated upon by twenty-four countries of the world.
This is the first time in any other country outside the United States.
However, there has been a lot of improvement.
Even though India is being appreciated internationally, these figures are not small.
Just as we got rid of the police, we also got rid of the tetanus in the deaths of mothers and children.
The world has accepted this.
Brothers and sisters, Today news of dengue continues.
It is true that dengue is dangerous but it is very easy to save.
And the Swachh Bharat that I am talking about is directly linked to it.
We need advertising on TV.
There is widespread public education in this regard, but we do not care.
I would urge you all to say that we should not make death so cheap.
Life is very precious.
Concentration on water, satisfaction over sanitation becomes a cause of death.
Free dengue testing facilities are available at around 500 square centres across the country.
And cleanliness should be given a lot of importance.
These days, in a way, there is a festival in our country from Rakshabandhan to Deepawali.
Why should not each of our festivals be associated with cleanliness
You see, Sanskrit will become the nature
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan, however, is inspired by the spirit of serving the tribals of India.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
These two brothers won the race this year.
It has enhanced Indias dignity.
I convey my best wishes to these two brothers.
But I am delighted to note that they are doing this entire mission with the intention of releasing the Tribals 'Team India - Vision for Tribals'.
See, what kind of efforts are being made by everybody in their own way to push the country forward
And when we hear such incidents then the chest bloats.
Sometimes because of perception we sit injustice to our husbands.
My experience with regard to youngsters is different.
Sometimes we also learn a lot when we talk to the boys.
I have met many youngsters who say, "Brothers, I have lived in a lifetime that is Sunde on Pacific.
Some people say that I have kept a single day of a week.
Today I would especially like to congratulate the Government of Maharashtra.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now there will be a grand, divine, inspiring memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar will now be an inspiration for us when the Indians travelling across the globe will go to London.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for both these efforts to honour Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
After a long distance, once again, we are launching Mann Ki Baat amongst you, Mann Ki Baat, Talks of the people, Talks of the people, Talks of the people and of the people.
Sitting in their midst, in the midst of them, they used to listen, repeat and sometimes ourselves became inspiration for us.
You can imagine that the period between them must have gone.
Perhaps this was not a lifeless programme.
I am missing every moment and when I speak Mann Ki Baat, I might say that the words are mine, the voice is mine but the story is yours, the man is yours, the valour is yours.
I used to use only my words, my speech and that is why I was missing you not from this programme.
It was a blanket experience.
But this Sunday, we waited a lot.
Well, we have got the opportunity.
In a family environment, Mann Ki Baat, Small and Medium Enterprises, Society, Life which becomes the cause of change.
In a way, this sequence gives rise to a new spirit and in a way supports the wishes of a New India.
I feel a sense of belonging.
Sometimes I feel that this is my own journey to Samsti.
This is my journey from Aham to Vayam.
For me, my silent interaction with you was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions in the election race, why I was going to Kedarnath.
Most of them have brought political meaning out of it.
For me, this was the opportunity to meet me.
The rest is your curiosity - I think I will discuss it sometimes.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, in the same way, I have always felt your efforts to strengthen one positive thing.
The letters received for Mann Ki Baat, which are inputs, are completely different from regular government work.
Sometimes the work of pushing my thought process forward makes you a few words.
If someone writes for cleanliness then he is expressing his disapproval of filth but he also preaches the efforts of cleanliness.
If someone talks about the environment then he does not feel the pain, but at the same time he also tells the experiments he has seen and he also portrays the imaginations that he has in his mind.
That is, in a way, I am feeling a glimpse of how socially behavioural problems can be solved.
Mann Ki Baat is like a pioneer for the country and society.
It shows us that there is no dearth of inner strength, strength and talent within our countrymen.
The need is to incorporate that strength and talent, provide opportunities and activate it.
Mann Ki Baat also says that all 130 crore countrymen want to be connected with the strength and activity of the country's development. And I must say that Mann Ki Baat contains so many letters, so many telephone calls, so many messages are received, but the essence of complaints is very low and if someone wants something for himself, I have not noticed in the last five years.
When I analyze such things, you can imagine how much pleasure my heart might be, how much energy I might be getting.
You have brought me here, you have left me alone and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
With this feeling, let us move forward the path of Mann Ki Baat.
When there was a crisis in the country, the opposition was not confined to the political sector alone, it was not confined to the politicians, it was not confined to the jails.
There was an anger in the hearts of the people.
The lost democracy was a thirst.
They dont know what is hungry in the day and night when they eat food on time, just as they enjoy the rights of democracy in normal life, they come to know only when they snatch away democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country had started feeling that something had been snatched away.
Perhaps in a country of the world, every person in the country has voted for democracy without fulfilling his own rights, rights and requirements.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, a massive election campaign was completed in our country, from Amir to Poor, everybody was eager to share the future of our country with happiness.
Whenever something is very close to us, we underestimate its importance, its amazing facts are also ignored.
These numbers may seem very common to us but if I tell you about the world, if we leave China then more people from any country in the world had voted in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2017 Lok Sabha elections is nearly two times more than the total population of the United States.
The number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
This reflects the vastness and diversity of our democracy.
The 2017 Lok Sabha elections were the world's largest democratic election in history.
You can imagine how large the need for resources and manpower must have been created to complete such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and staff can be elected by day and night hard work.
In order to successfully fulfil this great personality of democracy, where nearly three lakh security personnel of the paramilitary forces fulfilled their responsibilities, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also laboured.
As a result of hard work of these people, more votes were cast than last time.
More than 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than 1 lakh VVPAT machines, you can imagine how big it will be.
All this was done so as to ensure that no voter is deprived of his vote.
Polling station was set up for only one female voter in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the officials of the Election Commission had to travel there for two-two days - this is the true honour of democracy.
India is also the highest polling station in the world.
The polling station is at an altitude of 150000 ft in Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is another fact of pride in this election.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women have voted with enthusiasm just like men.
The percentage of women and men in this election was almost identical.
An exciting fact is that today there are seventy eight women MPs in the Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the electoral process and salute the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, sometimes you must have heard from my mouth that "Buke not Book" was my request that we can give books instead of flowers in welcome.
Since then, people have started giving books at many places.
Someone recently gave me a book called Premchand ki Kahani and I felt very good.
Though it was not possible to get much time, I got the opportunity to read some of his stories again during the tour.
Their conversations in simple, simple language expressing human sensibilities also touched my heart.
Their interaction covers the whole of India.
When I was reading the story of his writing drug addiction, my mind was moving on its own to the economic inequalities in the society.
I was reminded of the days of my youth how the discussions were held overnight.
This story of the brave son of the landlord, Ishwari and the poor family is learnt from the fact that if you are not careful then the impact of a bad world can never be known.
The second episode, which touched my heart, was Idgah.
A child's sensitivity, a pure love for his grandmother, such a maturity at such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid reaches his grandfather with a chipyo from the fair, the human emotion reaches its peak.
In this conversation, a live picture of the problem of the lives of the poor farmers was seen.
Even though its crops have been destroyed, the farmer is so happy that he will not have to sleep in the fields in extreme cold.
Though this conversation is about a century ago, its relevance still feels the same.
After reading this, I felt a different kind of feeling.
When it was a matter of reading, I used to read about the letter library of Kerala in some media.
You will be surprised to know that this library is located in a village situated between the dense forests of Idukki.
Teachers from Primary School, P.
Chinnathampi, both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here tied in potla and laddi on the back.
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone along with the tribal children.
The 'Vanche Gujarat' campaign in Gujarat was a successful experiment.
Millions of people in every age group participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I would also urge you to take some time out and place books in your daily routine.
You will actually be very enjoyable and write on the Narendra Modi App about whatever books you read so that every listener of Mann Ki Baat can also know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about the issue which is a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and Mygov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides the Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, the Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf, many people have written to me about the water related challenges.
Water has a lot of importance in our culture.
The Rig Veda Apr: Suktam says water, , . . . . i. e.
Give your blessings like your mother, like your mother, your grace keeps on showering on us.
Due to lack of water, many parts of the country are affected every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water that is obtained during the year is saved in our country.
Only 8.
Now it is time to solve this problem.
I am confident that like many other problems, we will also solve this problem with the participation of the people, with the power of the people, with the strength, cooperation and determination of 1.
Keeping in mind the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been set up in the country.
This will speedily take decisions on every subject related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I wrote letters to Sarpanches across the country, to the Gram Pradhan Mantris.
I wrote to the Gram Pradhan Mantris to discuss the issue of water conservation, water conservation, water conservation, rain water conservation, Gram Sabha meeting and sitting with the villagers.
I am glad that he showed full enthusiasm in this work and on 22nd of this month crores of people have laboured in thousands of panchayats.
People took a pledge to collect one drop of water in the villages.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell you about a Sarpanch.
The people there are once again ready to play their active role in water conservation.
On my behalf, I convey my best wishes to all the Gram Pradhans, to all the Sarpanches for their activeness.
There are several such Sarpanches across the country who have taken up the issue of water conservation.
In a way, it has become an opportunity for the entire village.
It seems that the people of the village are now competing for the construction of a water temple in their villages.
As I said, collective efforts can have many positive results.
There cannot be a single formula for coming out of water crisis all over the country.
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this purpose.
But everyones goal is one, and that is water conservation.
Trainage lines are being fixed in Punjab.
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging.
Construction of tank at Themipalli in Telangana is transforming the lives of the people of the village.
A major change has come from the small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the river Nag.
I have also read about those women from Garhwal who have been working very well on the Rainwater Harvesting.
I believe that many such efforts are being made and when we are working together, we can also make the impossible possible.
When people will join, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I have been making three requests for the countrymen.
My first appeal is: Just as the countrymen gave the form of a mass movement to cleanliness, similarly, let us initiate a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us all resolve to save every drop of water together. And I believe that water is God's prasad, water is the form of mercury.
Earlier it was said that iron becomes gold from the touch of mercury.
I say that water is mercury and from mercury to water it creates a new life.
Initiate an awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Tell them about the problems related to water and also promote water conservation measures.
I specially urge the people of different regions to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is in the field of film industry, in the field of sports, in the field of media, individuals associated with social organisations, people associated with cultural organisations, stories and individuals lead this movement in their own way.
May the society be connected to the society, to the society.
You see, we can see changes in front of your eyes.
My second request is that in our country many traditional methods are being used for water conservation for centuries.
I urge you all to share these traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had got the opportunity to go to the place of birth of Porbandar, Pujya Bapu then there is another house behind the house of venerated Bapu, where there is a water tank of 200 years old and there is still water and there is a provision to stop rain water then I always used to say that whatever Kirti Mandir goes to see that water stove.
There will be many such experiments everywhere.
Let us inspire people for water conservation by making a list of more and more methods related to water conservation.
You can share your content using JanShakti4JalShaktiHashtag.
My dear countrymen, I also want to express my gratitude for one thing and also to express my gratitude to the people of the world.
Once again on 21st June, on the occasion of Yoga Day, three-three generations of each family came together and celebrated Yoga Day with fervor.
The importance of Yoga Day is increasing in the awareness that has come up for the Holistic Health Care.
In every corner of the world, if a lover of Yoga welcomes it as soon as the sun rises, then it is the entire journey till the sun rises.
Perhaps there will be such a place where there is a human being and there is no Yoga associated with it.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from the Air Force to the Aircraft Carriers, from the AC gyms to the desert, from the villages to the cities, Yoga was not only done at all such places, but it was also collectively celebrated.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities and civilians from many countries of the world have shown me on Twitter how it celebrated Yoga in its own country.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that a healthy society requires a healthy and sensitive person and Yoga ensures it.
Therefore, the propagation of Yoga is a great work of social service.
It was a matter of great satisfaction for me to announce Prime Ministers Awards for outstanding contribution towards the promotion and development of Yoga in 2017.
This award has been given to those organizations around the world who have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly in the promotion of Yoga.
For example, take the 'Japan Yoga Niketan', which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs several institutes and training courses or MSMEs.
Take the name of Antonietta Rozzzi, who started the 'Sarva Yoga International' and promoted Yoga throughout Europe.
This is an inspirational example in itself.
If this is a subject related to Yoga, can Indians remain behind
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya and Munger were also honoured and dedicated to Yoga for the past several decades.
Likewise, Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honoured and established the Local Mission and the University of Luxury Yoga.
The broad celebration of Yoga and the honour of those who carried the message of Yoga home and home, both made this Yoga Day special.
It is a very big journey for me to connect with your thoughts. Mann Ki Baat is an occasion.
Let us keep meeting, let us keep on talking.
Keep listening to your feelings, being honest and understanding.
Sometimes we try to live those feelings.
May you continue to receive your blessings.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Let us come together to enjoy Mann Ki Baat and fulfill the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Ten days ago, Mother India had lost her brave sons.
These brave heroes have sacrificed their lives for the protection of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Our brave sons had united day and night so that they could sleep peacefully.
After the martyrdom of the heroes in the Pulwama terror attack, the people and people across the country are shocked and annoyed.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families have been reversed.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who saved their lives while protecting Mother India.
We all have to tackle the challenges facing the country by forgetting the differences between casteism, sectarianism, territorialism and all others so that our efforts to counter terrorism are even stronger than ever before.
Our armed forces have been introducing unique courage and valour since time immemorial.
Once upon a time, he has demonstrated the amazing potential for peace.
On the other hand, the attackers have also been given answers in their language.
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The Army has resolved to eliminate the combination of terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational aspects of their families have been brought to the fore by the media.
Ramniranji, the father of martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, inspires us all in this hour of grief.
He said that he will send his second daughter to fight against the enemy, and if necessary, he will himself be able to fight.
The entire nation salutes the indomitable courage of Martyr Meenaji, the martyr of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
They have also vowed to recruit one of their daughters in the CRPF.
When the body of Martyr Vijay Soren encircled in Trianga and reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his Masum Dikra had said that I too would join the fountain.
The spirit of this month expresses the feeling of a single child across India.
Such feelings are visible in the homes of our brave martyrs.
I appeal to the younger generation to try to understand and understand the spirit and spirit they have shown by these families.
We do not have to go to the ancient event of history to know what is sacrifice, what is penance
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Omkar Shetty ji, Udupi Karnataka has expressed his happiness over the preparation of the National War Memorial.
I was also surprised that there was no National War Memorial in India.
It is a memorable remembrance that the heroic stories of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation can be kept alive.
I have decided that such a memorial should definitely be there in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial (National War Memorial) and I am happy that this memorial has been completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on the 25th of February, we will dedicate this National Army Memorial to our Armed Forces.
The country will make a small effort to repay its debt.
A new memorial has been built just close to the heart of Delhi that is, where India Gate and Amar Jawan Yojana is located.
I am confident that we will be able to visit this National Army Memorial at any shrine for our countrymen.
The National Soldiers Memorial is a symbol of nations gratitude towards the supreme sacrifice made after Independence.
The design of the memorial demonstrates the indomitable courage of our armed forces.
The martyrdom of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the soldiers.
The second is the Circle Veerta Chakra, which showcases the courage and valour of the soldiers.
Thereafter, there is a cycle of sacrifice.
This circle shows the sacrifices of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the country are written in the golden letters.
After that the protector cycle demonstrates security.
This circle consists of dense trees.
The National Soldiers Memorial will once again be identified as a place where people will come to study and express their gratitude to learn about the great martyrs of the country.
Those who have laid down their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and develop.
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country.
Last year in the month of October, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be grateful to the men and women police personnel who are constantly engaged in our security.
I hope you will definitely visit the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, thousands of letters and comments keep getting me read through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your comments, I remembered a very interesting stamp of Atish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He writes that he was only 25 years old when the British captured Birsa Munda on 3rd March, 2000.
Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata on 3rd March.
He further writes that both these individuals have come from an entirely different family background, which has enriched the legacy and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat is apt to salute the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have brought laurels for not only Jharkhand but the entire country.
The entire nation is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youth needs an inspirational personality for guidance then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
Whenever he was asleep, the British hid themselves and grabbed them very carefully.
Do you know why the British took the help of such draconian actions
Because even the British who had such a great empire were afraid of them.
Lord Birsa Munda had just stirred up the British rule decorated with guns and guns in his traditional archery.
In fact, when people get an inspirational leadership, the collective will power of the people falls heavily on the strength of the weapons.
Lord Birsa Munda did not fight for political freedom against the British.
But there was a fight for the socio-economic rights of the tribals.
They have done this in their short lives.
In the dark life of the underprivileged and the deprived, he shines like the sun.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the age of 25.
Mother India like Birsa Munda has come to all parts of the country.
There is no point in India that no one has contributed to this centuries-long freedom struggle.
But unfortunately, their sacrifices, valour and sacrifices have not reached the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda had enjoyed his life as a person, then a great institution like Jamshedji Tata gave the country.
Jamshedji Tata was a philosopher in true sense who not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He knew very well that it was his vision that it was necessary for the future to make India a hub of science technology and industry.
This has resulted in the establishment of TATA Institute of Science which is now called the Indian Institute of Science (Indian Institute of Science).
Moreover, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Morarjibhai Desai was born on 2nd February.
You all are aware that this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai Desai, the owner of a simple and peaceful personality, was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
The record for presenting the largest budget in the Parliament in independent India is in the name of Morarjibhai Desai.
Morarji Desai led India in such a difficult time when there was a threat to democratic tensions in the country.
Morarjibhai Desai embarked on a counter-crisis movement to protect democracy.
Therefore, he had to pay a heavy price even in his old age.
At that time the government had arrested them and put them in jail.
But when the BJP won the elections in 1971, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The amendment also provides that the fundamental rights enjoyed under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be slaughtered during the time of crisis.
It was for the first time that the President will announce the crisis only after the written recommendations of the Cabinet and it was also decided that the time of the crisis cannot be increased for more than six months at a time.
Thus, Morarjibhai ensured that the manner in which the catastrophe was killed in the 15th century cannot be reversed in the future.
The future generations will always remember their invaluable contribution in maintaining the month of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, this year also there was a lot of curiosity about the Padma awards.
Today, we are moving ahead on the path of a New India, we want to honour those people who are doing their jobs at the grassroots level with utmost sincerity.
Those who are bringing a positive change in the lives of others in different ways through their hard work.
In fact, he is a true Karmayogi who remains self-sufficient in public service, social service and in front of all of these nations.
I would like to tell you about some such people.
Talking about Abdul Gafur Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job of reviving the traditional pathogenic art of Kutch.
He is doing a great job of bringing this rare painting to the new generation.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today presented to former US President Barack Obama the copy of the Tree of Life (Life Tree) manufactured by Abdul Gafar.
In receipt of Padma awards, Shabbid Syed of Marathwad is known as the servant of Mother cow.
The way he has dedicated his entire life to the service of the mother cow is unique in itself.
You will be pleasantly surprised to hear about the Tao Porchon-Lynch of America and Lynch has become a living institution of Yoga today.
Even at the age of 100, he has been imparting Yoga training to people around the world and till now he has made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, known as Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, performed the brave task of confronting the Timber with forgiveness and counter-crisis, not only saved 50 hectares of forest but also motivated ten thousand women to protect trees and wildlife.
It is difficult to illustrate the work done by him for the upliftment of Divyang women, even though he himself is a person with disabilities, and he is working relentlessly to make the visually impaired children self-reliant by establishing an institution called Pragyachakshu Mahila Sevakuj.
He has set an example in the direction of women empowerment and making agriculture profitable.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women from their area to join the Self Help Groups to become economically viable.
My dear countrymen, today, I would like to talk about the experience that will touch the hearts of all those who have been experiencing this experience for the past few days.
Today, whenever I go to the country, it has been my endeavor that some of the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana - PMJAY will get the Ayushman Bharat scheme.
Brothers and sisters, Nearly 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme in the last five months.
I have seen how a big change is taking place in the lives of the poor.
If you all know a poor person who is not able to get treatment without money then you must tell him about this scheme.
This scheme is for every such poor person.
My dear countrymen, the time for exams in schools is about to start.
Separate education boards across the country will commence the proceedings for the 10th and 12th standard board examinations in the next few weeks.
I extend my heartiest greetings to all the students, their parents and all the teachers of the examiner.
A few days ago, a major event of Pariksha Pe Charcha was held in Delhi in the form of a townhouse.
The specialty of the Pariksha Pe Charcha programme is that an open conversation was held today on various subjects related to the examination.
Some aspects have come up which can certainly be beneficial for the students.
If all the students can see the entire programme on their parents and teachers YouTube, then my best wishes to all the examiners for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, be it a matter of India or not of festivals
There will not be a day in our country which does not have any significance, which does not have any festival.
Because we have this legacy of thousands of years old culture.
A few days later, the festival of Maha Shivratri will take place and this time Shivratri will take place on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday, a special significance of it will be attached to our temple.
My best wishes to you all on this auspicious occasion of Shivratri.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago I had gone to Kashi where I got the opportunity to spend time with the Divyang brothers and sisters.
So he said, I remember the Prime Minister.
I was really impressed with the power of the youth of Divyangjan.
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
In a way, I meet every month with crores of families through radio.
Sometimes, while talking to you people, reading your letters or listening to the ideas sent on the phone, I feel like giving me a part of my family.
It is a pleasant experience for me.
Friends, Elections are a big source of democracy.
For the next two months, we will be busy with all the elections.
And for years, I will continue to talk to you.
Once again I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on the 21st of this month, the country received very sad news.
Shivakumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to the service of the society.
Lord Basavaeshwara has taught us: It is like being in Kailasam Dham, the habitation of Lord Shiva by performing his duties with hard work.
His fame was a scholar who had a wonderful footprint in English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He dedicated his entire life to the cause of food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
Swami ji's life was prioritized for the welfare of farmers in every way.
Siddhganga Monastery regularly organised animal and agricultural fairs.
I have had the privilege of getting the blessings of supreme venerable Swami ji several times.
Kalamsaheb narrated a poem on this occasion for Swami ji.
This poem by Dr. Kalam Saheb reflects the life of Shri Sri Shivakumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhganga Math.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country which is not only an integral part of our democracy but is also older than our Republic - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
In our country, there is no scope for ensuring that every citizen of India who is a registered voter gets an opportunity to vote.
When we hear that a polling station is set up in Himachal Pradesh at a height of 15,000 feet above sea level, even in remote islands in Andaman Nicobar Islands.
Just for a voter
When we hear these things then it is natural to be proud of the Election Commission.
The entire team of ECI employees goes to the far-flung areas and arranges for the voting and this is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its continued efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also compliment the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other staff who participate in the voting process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country. This will be the first time that the youth born in the 21st century will exercise their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have got the opportunity to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now he is going to be a part of the decision making process in the country.
It is time to connect our dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register themselves as voters if they are eligible to vote.
Each one of us must feel that becoming a voter in the country, achieving the right to vote, is one of the important achievements of life.
At the same time, it is my duty to vote - this feeling should persist in us.
There should be a lot of pain if one cannot vote for any reason in life.
Whenever something goes wrong in the country, it should be sad.
I urge the renowned personalities of the country to collectively raise awareness among the people about the registration of voters or voting on the day of polls.
I hope that a large number of youngsters will register as voters and will further strengthen our democracy with their participation.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done some amazing work for humanity.
On 23rd January, the entire nation observed their birth anniversary in a different style.
On Netaji's Jayanti, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You are aware that many rooms and buildings have been closed since independence in the Red Fort.
The closed Red Fort rooms have been transformed into a very beautiful museum. The museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army is the museum dedicated to the museum "Yaad-e-Jallian" and the museum dedicated to the nation in the form of 'Kranti Mandir'.
Each brick of these museums enshrines the aroma of our glorious history.
Things that reflect the story of the heroes of our freedom struggle at the corners of the museum inspire us to enter the history.
At this place, the British ruled over the brave sons of Mother India - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was visiting the memories associated with Netaji at the Kranti Mandir in the Red Fort, the family members of Netaji gave me a special hat.
Netaji used to wear this cap.
I have installed the cap in the museum so that the people visiting the museum can see the cap and take inspiration from the country.
In fact, the valour and patriotism of our heroes need to be sustained continuously to the new generation.
Just a month ago, on December 30, I had gone to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
In a programme, the tricolor was flown right where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose hoisted the tricolor five years ago.
Thus, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there was a tradition on 15th August.
This was the occasion to mark the completion of 5 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled organiser.
A brave soldier who played an important role in the freedom struggle.
Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian with illustrious slogans like 'Delhi Chalo', 'Tum Muze Khoondo', 'My Tumhe Azad Dunga'.
For many years, I had been demanding that files related to Netaji be made public and I am glad that we could do that.
I remember the day when Netaji's entire family had visited the Prime Minister's residence.
Together we did many things related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
I am glad that efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is the 26 Alipur Road connected with Babasaheb Ambedkar or the Sardar Patel Museum or the Kranti Mandir.
If you go to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to call you a case related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered radio as an important medium of connecting people, just as Netaji had a close relationship with radio and he also chose radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhas Babu launched the Azad Hind Radio and through Radio he interacted with the soldiers of the Azad Hind Fauj and with the people of the country.
I was told that it used to broadcast radio stations, weekly news bulletins that lived in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangladesh, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
The Radio Station will be operationalized by M.
Vyas Ji played a very important role.
The programmes being broadcast on the freedom movement were very popular among the common people and their programmes gave a lot of strength to the warriors of our freedom movement.
A visual museum has also been built in this revolutionary temple.
This effort has been made to showcase Indian art and culture in a very attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 paintings and artworks of the three centuries old.
The museum has exhibited excellent works of great artists like Amruta Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avnindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Seloz Mukherjee.
And I would especially urge all of you to visit there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you must be wondering that things are happening here and I am talking to you about the excellent work done by Gurudev Tagore.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician so far.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has painted a number of themes.
He has also painted animals and birds, he has painted many beautiful scenes, and has also worked to bring human characters to the canvas through art.
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to most of his work.
He was supposed to see the pictures of those people who themselves understand them, look at the messages given by them in the pictures from their own perspective.
His pictures are also exhibited in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope that you will definitely see his pictures in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
It was such a saint- Sant Ravidas.
1st February is the birth anniversary of Ravidas.
Sant Ravidas ji's Doha is very famous.
Sant Ravidas ji gave a big message through a few lines.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every human being, it is not right to share them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji, through his message, tried to understand the importance of labour and labour throughout his life.
It would not be wrong to say that he has explained the true meaning of labour prestige to the world.
He used to say - 'Man Changa To Kathauti Me Ganga' means if your heart and mind are sacred, then Sakshat God resides in your hearts.
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced people of all walks of life, be it the Maharaja of Chittor or the queen of Meerabai, all of them were his followers.
Once again I salute Sant Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I have highlighted India's space programme and its future aspects.
He also wanted me to urge the students to take interest in the space programme and think about going beyond the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate your thoughts and especially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad where I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We take pride in the fact that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching the space.
The Kalam Set created by our students on 24th January has been launched.
Sounding rockets made by university students in Odisha have also made several records.
Since independence, almost as many space missions have been launched in the last four years since 2014.
We have also created a world order to launch 104 satellites simultaneously with the same spacecraft.
We will soon note the presence of India on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is using space technology in a beautiful way to protect the lives of people.
Whether it is air or rail or road safety, all these are getting much help from space technology.
Our fishermen brothers and sisters have been divided into Navic Devices that are helpful in their safety and economic progress.
We are using space technology to improve delivery and accountability of government services.
Approximately 40 lakh households in 23 States have been geo-tagged under this scheme.
At the same time, under MGNREGA, approximately three and a half crore assets have also been tagged.
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country.
It contributes immensely to our good relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has provided development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through our border competitive launch services, India today launches not only the developing countries but also the satellites of developed countries.
The sky and stars are always attractive for children.
Our space programme provides children an opportunity to think big and move beyond the boundaries that have been considered impossible so far.
It is a vision for our children to keep track of stars and inspire them to discover innovative stars.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that whatever will be done will be lost and this time in Khelo India, many talented and young players have emerged.
In January, about 6,000 players participated in 18 games at the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
When the player performs well at the local level, he will also perform well at the global level.
This time, players from every state have performed well at their own level in Khelo India.
The life of many medal winners is a tremendous inspiration.
In boxing, young player Akash Gorkha won a silver medal and I was reading that Akash's father Ramesh Ji was working as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
And Maharashtra's 21 women's kabaddi team is supposed to reside in Kaptan Sonali Helvi Star.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged Sonali's Hunar.
It is often seen that girls do not get so much encouragement in sports like kabaddi.
However, Sonali chose Kabbaddi and performed excellently.
Abhinav Shaw, 10, of Asanasol, is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.
A farmer's daughter, Akshay Baaswati, won a gold medal in weightlifting in Karnataka.
When we are talking about the creation of India then it is not only the resolution of the youth power but also the New India.
These stories from Khelo India show that not only the people of big cities are contributing to the creation of a New India, but the people from small towns and villages are also contributing a lot to the youngsters, young talent.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of a lot of prestigious beauty competitions.
But have you heard about the competition to shine the toilet
Moreover, more than 50 lakh toilets have also participated in a unique competition that has been going on since last one month.
This unique competition is called Swachh Sundar Shauchalay.
Besides keeping their toilets clean, people are also making it beautiful by making some pictures by coloring it and you will also see several pictures of a clean toilet from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media.
I urge all the Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans to lead this movement in their Panchayats.
Share your clean beautiful toilet picture with MyIzzatGhar on social media.
Friends, On 2nd October 2014, we started a memorable journey together to make our country clean and open defecation free.
Today, in collaboration with the people of India, India is poised to become Open Defecation Free long before 2nd October 2017 to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
The listeners of Mann Ki Baat have also contributed a lot in this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat. And that is why I am glad to share with all of you that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and six hundred districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and have crossed 8 in rural India and toilets have been provided to about nine crore families.
My young friends, the days of exams will come.
Anchul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about exams and exams fighters.
Anchul Ji, thank you for raising these issues.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the period of examination.
Students, from their parents to teachers, many people are busy doing exams.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would definitely like to discuss this topic in this programme of Mann Ki Baat today, but you would be happy to know that after two days, I would like to interact with students from all over the country at 11.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this programme.
In this Pariksha Pe Charcha, I will talk to my young friends about all aspects related to examinations, especially in the stress-free examinations.
I had requested people to send inputs and Idea for this and I am very happy that a large number of people are putting their thoughts on MyGov.
I will put some of these ideas and suggestions before you during the Town Hall programme.
You must be part of this program...
You will also be able to see its vibrant spread through social media and the Namo App.
My dear countrymen, the 30th of January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11 o'clock, the entire nation pays homage to the martyrs.
We must pay homage to the martyrs wherever we may be.
Remember the venerable Bapu and let us move forward with this pledge to fulfil the dreams of venerated Bapu, to build a New India and to fulfil our duties as citizens.
May this journey of 2017 be successfully carried forward.
My best wishes to you all and thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
What should we do so that we can transform our lives and together contribute to furthering the country and society
My best wishes to you all for the year 2019.
You must have wondered how to remember the year 2019.
It is also important to recall how India will remember 2019 as a nation, its potential as a 100 crore people.
It makes all of us proud.
In 2018, Ayushman Bharat, the worlds largest health insurance scheme, was launched.
Electricity has reached every village of the country.
The world's renowned institutions have acknowledged that India is making the country free from poverty due to its record pace.
With the unwavering resolve of our countrymen, the sanitation coverage has increased to 5.
For the first time since independence, the tricolor was laid on the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government from the Red Fort.
In the honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the world's tallest statue of Statue of Unity was found in the country.
The country's name has risen in the world.
The country was honoured with the United Nations' highest environmental award Champions of the Earth Award.
Indias efforts in the Solar Energy and Climate Change have been ranked globally.
The country's golden security has got new strength.
This year our country has successfully completed the Nuclear Triad, so now we have attained nuclear power in water, space and ninety three.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by touring the world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
Indias first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the field of waterways.
The country's longest rail-road pool Bogibeel Bridge was dedicated to the nation before Sikkim and the country's Soma Airport - Pakyong was launched.
India won the Under-1 Cricket World Cup and Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time India won a large number of medals in the Asian Games.
India has also performed well in the Para Asian Games.
However, if I keep talking about the human rights of every Indian, our collective efforts, our Mann Ki Baat will be so long that perhaps 2019 will come.
All this has been possible due to the untiring efforts of 130 crore Indians.
I hope that this journey of progress and progress of India will continue in 2019 and our country will be able to scale new heights with even greater strength.
My dear countrymen, we have lost some extraordinary countrymen in December.
Dr. Jayachandran was known for providing affordable and affordable treatment to the poor.
People say that he was always ready for the treatment of the patient.
He used to lease and visit elderly patients who came for treatment.
I'm the beterindia.
He has read about his many such works that inspired society on the Com website.
Similarly, the demise of Sulagitti Narsamma of Karnataka was reported on 25th December.
Sulagiti Narsamma was a helper in delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
Earlier this year, he was awarded Padmashri.
There are several inspirational personalities like Dr. Jayachandran and Sulagitti Narsamma who dedicated their lives for the welfare of all in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, I would also like to discuss the social efforts of the doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In the past, some of our party's workers told me that some young doctors in the city are treating the poor free of cost by putting camps.
Today, hundreds of poor patients are benefiting from this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctors and friends associated with selfless service is truly commendable.
Today, I am going to say this thing with great pride that due to collective efforts, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign.
I was told that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the cleanliness drive in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
We got to read about Jaychandran and whenever we get the opportunity, we have a thebeterindia.
I have been trying to know such inspiring things by going to the com.
I am glad that today there are several such websites that are familiar with many stories that inspire people from their lives.
Like thepositiveindia.
The Com is working to spread positiveness in the society and make the society more sensitive.
I am confident that more and more people will be able to know about our heroes who bring about change in society.
It is easy to spread negativity but many good things are happening around us in the society and it is happening with the collective efforts of all the 130 crore Indians.
Sports is an important part of every society.
When sports are played, the minds of the observers also get filled with energy.
We have experienced and experienced a lot of things in the name, identity and dignity of the players.
But sometimes there are many things behind it that are even bigger than sports.
I would like to talk about a daughter of Kashmir who has won a gold medal in the Karate Championships in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and resides in Anantnagur in Kashmir.
Hanaya studied hard work and hard work and proved himself in a thorough observation.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for a bright future.
Many congratulations and blessings to Hannaya.
Similarly, there has been a lot of discussion in the media about a 16-year-old girl.
You must have read.
Rajni has won the Gold in the Junior Women's Boxing Championship.
After winning the medal on Rajni, go to a milk stall and drink a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni covered his medal in a cloth and put it in a bag.
Why should Rajni drink a glass of milk
He did this in honour of his father Jasmer Singh ji, who sells a lassi on a stall in Panipat.
Rajni said that her father has made a lot of sacrifice in bringing her here.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work every morning before his brothers and sisters woke up.
When Rajni expressed his desire to learn boxing in front of his father, his father encouraged him to get all possible assistance.
Rajini had to start his studies with old age as the economic condition of his family was not good at that time.
Despite all these things, the courage to quit was not lost and the boxing continued to learn.
He has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini.
And I also congratulate his parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani ji for supporting him and enhancing his enthusiasm.
This month, a 20-year-old daughter from Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni, has become the fastest Asian tourist in the world.
It used to run around 300 km per day for 15 days.
Can we not get inspiration from this kind of achievement
Especially my young friends, when we hear about such incidents, we also get inspired to do something in the midst of difficulties.
If there is strength in determination and enthusiasm, then the obstacles automatically go away.
Problems can never be a barrier.
If we hear many such examples then we also get a new inspiration in our lives.
My dear countrymen, there are several enthusiastic and enthusiastic festivals in January like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi
During this time, Surya enters Makar Rasi after landing.
After this day, the day gradually starts to grow and the crops of cold begin to grow.
Many congratulations to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
Ek Bharat Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is the spirit of our festivals.
We can see how close our festivals and festivals are associated with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not considered to be different, individuals and culture are the same.
Our close relationship with nature is a good example, a lander based on festivals.
Along with festivals, there is also a list of planetary constellations.
This traditional calendar shows how old our relationship with natural and geographical events is.
Festivals and festivals are determined according to the moon and the sun calendar based on the moon and sunset.
This depends on who the Kellander believes.
Festivals are also celebrated as per the conditions of planetary constellations in many areas.
Gudi Padava, Cheti Chand and Ugadi are celebrated as per the lunar calendar and Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu - all these festivals are celebrated on the basis of the Sun Calendar.
Rivers and water conservation is particularly inherent in many of our festivals.
Chhath Parv - Rivers and ponds are associated with the sunrise.
Even on Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people are immersed in sacred rivers.
Our festivals also give us an understanding of social values.
On the one hand it has an archaeological significance, on the other hand, every festival can easily learn the inspiration to live with one another.
I convey my best wishes to all of you in 2017 and wish you a lot of joy for the upcoming festivals.
Share the photos taken on these festivals with everyone to see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of pride in our culture that we can take pride in and we can showcase the entire world with pride and one of them is Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh.
Even in films, there must have been a lot to see about its magnificence and enormousness and it should be true that the form of Kumbh is as vast as the divine.
People from the country and around the world come and join the Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, there is a crowd of faith and reverence.
Millions of people from India and abroad are connected at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has flourished and flourished with our great cultural heritage.
This time, the world famous Kumbh Mela to be held in Prayagraj on 15th January, maybe all of you are eagerly awaiting it.
For the Kumbh Mela, the silos have already started to reach the Saints and Spirits.
Its global importance can also be gauged from the fact that last year UNESCO has identified the Kumbh Congregation in the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, Ambassadors of several countries witnessed the preparations for the Kumbh, and at the same time the national flag of many countries was hoisted.
People from more than 150 countries are expected to attend the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj.
The divinity of Kumbh will illuminate the magnificence of India in the entire world.
This can be a great experience especially for youngsters.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh are going on with great vigour.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic for the Kumbh.
There, I dedicated the Integrated Command Control Centre to the nation, and the devotees will get great help in it.
This time a lot of emphasis is being laid on cleanliness in the Kumbh.
If there is cleanliness along with devotion in the event then its message will reach far and wide.
This time, every devotee will be able to pay floral tributes to Akshayvad after a sacred bath at Sangam.
This akshayavada, a symbol of the faith of the people, was locked in the fort for hundreds of years, which the devotees could not see.
Now the doors of Akshayvad have been opened for all.
I appeal to all of you that when you come to Kumbh, you must keep the different aspects and photos of the Kumbh on social media so that more and more people get inspired to visit Kumbh.
May the Kumbh of spirituality be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh be a Kumbh of nationalism as well.
Be it the Mahakumbh of national unity, this Kumbh of devotees will also become the Mahakumbh of the world tourists.
May this Kumbh of artistry also become the Mahakumbh of creative powers.
Revered Bapu and South Africa have a narrow relationship.
It was South Africa from where it became Mohn, Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and stood firm against apartheid.
He also established Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, which echoed peace and justice across the world.
2018- Nelson Mandela was also celebrated as the birth centenary year and was also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela was an example of the struggle against apartheid all over the world and who was the inspiration of Mandela.
He had got the patience and inspiration of spending so many years in jail from the venerable Bapu.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only inspirations for the entire world, but their ideals also inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, there was a DGP conference in Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where the world's tallest statue is Statue of Unity and there was a meaningful discussion with the police personnel of the country.
Discussions were made on how steps should be taken to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
During that period, I also announced the launch of Sardar Patel Awards for National Integration which will be conferred on those who have contributed to national unity in any form.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He always tried to keep Indias integrity intact.
Sardar Saheb believed that India's strength lies in its diversity.
Respecting that spirit of Sardar Patel, we pay homage to him through this award of Unity.
My dear countrymen, Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary is celebrated on 13th January.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
His work for most of his life was North India and he sacrificed his life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
Born in Patna, Karmabhoomi in North India and the last moment of life in Nanded.
In a way, his blessings were received throughout India.
If he wants to live his life then he gets a glimpse of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji had attained Guru's position at the young age of nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
He was a calm and simple personality, but whenever an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, injustice was done to them, then Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice firmly for the poor and the weak.
He said that power cannot be demonstrated by fighting with the weaker sections.
Shri Gobind Singh ji knew that the biggest service is to remove human misery.
He was a divine man full of valour, valour, sacrifice and compassion, who had an intellectual knowledge of both armament and science.
He was not only an archer but also a scholar of several languages including Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
That is, Food Safety and Standard Authorisation is being done by Off India.
Several programmes are being organized across the country to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In this series, F.
Under the Eat Right India Campaign, healthy India journeys are coming out across the country.
The drive will continue till 2nd January.
When India is clean and healthy then India will be prosperous.
Nutritious food is the most important for good health.
You should also participate in it and especially I would urge the children to show these things.
Important education of food is essential since childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the last event of 2018.
In 2019, we will meet again, we will talk again about Mann Ki Baat, be it the life of the individual, the life of the nation, the life of the society and the inspiration is the basis of progress.
Come, let us move ahead, let us change ourselves, let us change ourselves, let us also change the country. Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On 3rd October, 2014, the auspicious festival of Vijayadashmi, we all started a journey together through Mann Ki Baat.
50 episodes of Mann Ki Baat Yatra have been completed today.
Similarly, today is the Golden Jubilee Episode Golden Jubilee Episode.
The letters and phones you have received this time are mostly in the context of this 50th episode.
Similarly, on the Narendra Modi App, Monica Jain of Delhi, Bardwan, the Prasenjit Govt of West Bengal and musicologists of Nagpur have asked a similar question.
They say that people often connect you with latest technology, social media and mobile app, but why did you like radio to connect with people
Your curiosity is very natural that in today's era when the radio was forgotten, why did Modi bring the radio
I was nine months old and I was going to some other place in the evening.
In the mountains of Himachal Pradesh, if it gets cold in the evening then stop for tea in a dhaba on the way. And when I gave orders for tea then it was a very small dhaba.
There was no cloth.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Indian Community in New Delhi.
He said, No, sir, you don't know what, it's a matter of great happiness.
I didn't understand it, he said, Look, Saheb listened to the radio and there was talk about it on the radio.
The reach and depth of communication cannot be done properly with the radio.
In my mind, this thing has been done at home since that time and I realized its strength only then.
So when I became the Prime Minister then it was very natural for me to pay attention to the most powerful medium.
And when I assumed office as a Prime Minister in May 2014, I wanted that the unity of the country, our glorious history, its valour, the diversity of India, the serpents associated with the pace of our society, the valour of the people, of the people, of the people, of the people, of the people, of the people of India and of India.
From far-flung villages to metropolitan cities, from farmers to young professionals...
Recently, Akashwani also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen some of these reactions which are very interesting.
Of the people surveyed, an average of 90 are those who have regularly heard Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that the biggest contribution of Mann Ki Baat is that it has increased the feeling of positiveness in the society.
Mann Ki Baat has given a big boost to the mass movement.
There has also been widespread discussion on indiapositiveness.
It is also a glimpse of the spirit of positiveness and positivity in the minds of our countrymen.
People have also shared their experiences that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the spirit of doing something with volunteerism.
Along with radio, mobile, internet, Facebook Lives and Pariscope, Narendra Modi is also joining Mann Ki Baat through the App.
I sincerely thank all of you from the Mann Ki Baat family for expressing confidence in it and becoming a part of it.
Your views are correct.
In fact, if the leader gets a mike and millions and millions of people listen to it then what should be the need
Some young friends studied all the topics in Mann Ki Baat. They analyzed the word episode, lexical analysis and studied how often the words were spoken.
Which words were spoken repeatedly.
One of his concepts is that the programme has been non-political.
When Mann Ki Baat was started, I had decided that neither politics nor government should be praised in it, nor should Modi be there in it. And the greatest strength, the greatest inspiration to fulfil this resolution is amongst you.
Modi will come and go, but this country will remain intact, our culture will remain intact.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
It will take the country to new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
When will the strength of any government be so strong that the zeal of selfiewithdaughter starts from a small village in Haryana and spreads not only across the country but also abroad
Every section of the society, celebrities, all should be connected and in a new, modern language of conversion in the society that todays generation considers.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat also gets funny but in my mind, 130 crore Indians live.
My heart is in his heart.
Mann Ki Baat is not a matter of government - it is a matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India, an ambitious India.
India's original life is not politics, but India's original life is not monarchy.
India's root cause is social policy and societal power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life and there is one aspect of politics.
Its not a good system for a healthy society that all should be done in politics.
Sometimes events of politics and politics become so dominant that other talents and others of the society are buried.
It is the collective responsibility of all of us to get the right place for the talent of the common man for the bright future of a country like India and Mann Ki Baat is a humble and small effort in this direction.
In a way, your question is a question of intimacy.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are asking questions not to the Prime Minister but to your friends.
The question that you have asked is, if you answer it directly in the words then you will say nothing.
Indeed, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple task for me.
Every time peoples letters come before Mann Ki Baat.
MyGov and NarendraModi, on the mobile app, share their thoughts, including a toll free number - 1800 11800.
People also record their messages in their voices by calling them there.
Whenever the episode of Mann Ki Baat comes closer, I read very closely the ideas and information that you have sent during your visit.
And that is why when I read the letter then I can easily connect that place and context with myself.
Later, I would like to mention some things like the name of the village, the name of the person, etc.
Truly, I have a voice in Mann Ki Baat, but for example, emotions and emotions belong to my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not yet been able to name in Mann Ki Baat but they keep sending their letters and comments without being disappointed. Your thoughts and feelings are very important in my life.
I am confident that I will get many more things from the beginning and will make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, more effective and useful.
Efforts are also made to keep in mind the letters and suggestions not included in the Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat reaches the maximum number of people through their hard work.
Akashwani team prepares every episode to be broadcasted in multiple languages.
Some people efficiently listen to Modis voice in regional languages and in the same tone Mann Ki Baat.
Thus, he becomes Narendra Modi only for 30 minutes.
I also congratulate them for their talent and skills. I thank them.
I would urge all of you to listen to this programme in your local languages as well.
I would like to heartily congratulate my friends of the media who regularly broadcast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
Any political media is never happy, it feels that it receives very little coverage or the coverage it receives is negative but the media has made several topics raised in Mann Ki Baat.
There are several topics such as cleanliness, road safety, drugs free India, selfie with doctor, which the media has innovatively undertaken to take forward.
This journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete without your cooperation.
In fact, I have no secret.
Whatever I am doing, it must have happened to all the families.
In a simple language, I try to put myself in the youth and I try to match a valuable ballot with the thoughts of that place.
It is that old gauge of our lives, when it does not come in between then it becomes easy to understand anyone.
Today's youngsters have a lot to say that they will not do anything that they do not believe in themselves and when they believe in something then they leave everything behind for it.
Sometimes people talk about the Communication Gap between the elderly and the young.
In fact, interaction with wealth is very limited in most families.
In most of the cases, whether it is a matter of study or a habit or a lifestyle, it is a matter of concern that there is an obstacle in not doing so.
Discussing instead of accepting and dismissing expect will make the dialogue impressive.
My efforts are being made to continuously interact with the youth through different programmes or social media.
I have always tried to learn what they are doing or what they are thinking.
They always have Idea storage.
They are highly energetic, innovative and focused.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I try to share the efforts and ideas of the youth as much as possible.
Often there are complaints that youngsters ask a lot of questions.
I say that it is good that the youth asks.
This is good because it means that they want to examine everything from the roots.
Some people say that there is no patience in the youth, but I believe that there is no time for the youth to wipe out the same thing that helps in making the youth more innovative today because they want to do something fast.
We feel that todays youth are very ambitious and think a lot of big things.
Good, big dreams and big successes.
After all, this is the New India.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to do a lot of things at the same time.
I tell you what is wrong with that
They are perfect in multitasking, so they do so.
If we look around, it is the youth who bring about a big change in the social enterprise, start-ups, sports and other sectors.
The youngsters who showed the courage to ask and dream big.
If we bring down the ideas of the youth to the ground and provide an open environment to express them, they can bring a positive change in the country, they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram, Vineetaji has written on May Gov that in Mann Ki Baat tomorrow i. e.
They say that this day is special because we enter the 70th year of adoption of the Constitution.
Vineeta ji, thank you very much for your suggestions.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
A day to remember those great personalities who created our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1947.
The Constituent Assembly took 2 years 11 months and 1 days to complete this historic task of building the Constitution.
Imagine that within three years these great personalities gave us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
The extraordinary pace with which he built the Constitution is still an example of time management and productivity.
It inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities in a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a confluence of the great talents of the country, each of them was committed to provide a Constitution for the country so that the people of India could be empowered and the poorest of the poor could be empowered.
The special feature of our Constitution is that rights and duties are detailed in detail.
The combination of these two will take the country forward in the lives of the citizens.
If we respect the rights of others then our rights will be protected automatically. And in this way, even if we obey our duties in the Constitution, it will be our own defence.
I still remember that when 60 years of India's Republic were completed in 2010, we had taken a pilgrimage to the Constitution by keeping it on the elephant in Gujarat.
It was a memorable occasion for the youth to raise awareness about the Constitution and connect them with the aspects of the Constitution.
As a Republic in 2020, we will complete 70 years and will complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us all pursue the values of our Constitution and ensure Peace, Progress, Prosperity, Peace, Prosperity and Prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, the contribution of that great man can never be forgotten who was at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
6th December is his Mahaparinirvana Diwas.
I salute Babasaheb on behalf of all the countrymen who have given the right to live with dignity to crores of Indians.
Democracy was in the nature of Babasaheb and he used to say - India's democratic values have not come from anywhere.
What is a democracy and what is a parliamentary system, it has never been a new thing for India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he made a very emotional appeal that we have to protect the freedom that came after such a struggle till the last minute of our blood.
He also used to say that we Indians may be different backgrounds, but we have to uphold the interest of the nation on everything.
My dear countrymen, two days ago on 23rd November we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and we are going to celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought of the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the society the path of truth, action, service, compassion and harmony.
Similarly, a train will also be run on the path of holy places connected with Guru Nanak Devji.
Recently, when I was holding a meeting related to it, I recalled that time when I was reminded of Lakhpat Saheb Guru.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, the Guru had suffered a lot, but the way the state government revived it along with the local people is still an example.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the passengers of our country can easily visit this holy place of Guru Nanak Devji in Pakistan and Karpur.
My dear countrymen, after 50 episodes, we will meet once again in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat and I am confident that today I got the opportunity to put forward the sentiments behind this programme of Mann Ki Baat for the first time because you people asked such questions but our journey will continue.
The more we connect with you, the more our journey will become deeper and satisfying.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people that what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I would like to say that one thing touches my heart in the response to Mann Ki Baat, when most of the people said that when we listen to Mann Ki Baat while sitting with all the family members, it seems that the elders of our family are sharing our own words with us.
When I heard this thing in a comprehensive manner, I was very happy that I am amongst you and in a way I will continue to come here again and again as a member of your family through Mann Ki Baat.
Your ambition, my ambition.
Let us take this journey forward.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
Six and a half months before independence, on January 24, the edition of the world's famous International Magazine, Time Magazine, was a portrait of Sardar Patel.
He had published a map of India in his main store and it was not a map that we saw today.
It was the map of India that was divided into several parts.
Time Magazine wrote that India faced threats such as division, violence, food crisis, inflation and power politics.
Time Magazine further states that if anyone has the ability to serve the nation in the spirit of unity and fill the windows then it is Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
How he gave direction to the Bardoli Satyagraha
His authenticity and commitment to the nation was such that all the farmers, labourers and industrialists trusted him.
Whether it was Junagarh or Hyderabad or Travancore or Rajwada of Rajasthan, it was Sardar Patel who can see a India today with his sweetness and strategic skills.
We naturally bow down to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on seeing this nation and Mother India bound by the bond of unity.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be special. On this day, we will dedicate the Statue of Unity to the nation by paying homage to Sardar Patel.
Established on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, the height of this statue is double the height of the US State of Liberty.
It is the world's highest skyscraper statue.
Every Indian will now be proud of the fact that the world's tallest statue is on the soil of India.
The land that was connected with Sardar Patel will now increase the beauty of the sky.
I salute the families of our soldiers for their courage, but do you know why all the citizens of India consider this Infantry Day
This is the day when the Indian Army had landed on the land of Kashmir and had protected the valley from the gunmen.
This historic event is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview with Mr. Manekshaw, who was a great military officer of India.
In that interview, Field Marshal Manekshaw was remembering the time when he was the Colonel.
During this period, in October 14, the Army Campaign was launched in Kashmir.
Field Marshal Manekshaw said that during a meeting, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was disappointed for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir, and in his special gesture during the meeting, Sardar Patel looked at him and said that there should not be any delay in military operations in Kashmir and as soon as possible solutions should be taken out.
After that, the army personnel flew into the Kashmir Pathhi aircraft and we saw how the army was successful.
Indira Gandhiji is also the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister on 31st October.
Indiraji also paid respects to her.
My dear countrymen, who does not like sports
Recently, I had two memorable visits.
Earlier, I got the opportunity to meet our Para Athletes of the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
In these sports, India has won a total of 2 medals and made India proud.
I was fortunate to personally meet all these Para Athletes and congratulate them.
Similarly, the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina got the opportunity to meet.
You would be happy to know that our youth have done the best ever performance in the Youth Olympics 2018.
In this event, we also won 13 medals and 3 other medals at Mix Events.
You might remember that this time Indias performance in Asian Games was also excellent.
See, in the last few minutes, how many times I have used the best, the most splendid words ever.
This is the story of today's Indian sports, which is touching new heights a day.
India is not only making new records in sports but also in those fields which I had never thought about.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who won the Gold Medal in Athletics for the Country in the 2018 Asian Para Games.
He is Divyang since his birth.
When he was eight years old he lost his father.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he worked as a driver in Dhaba to clean the DTC buses and to drive the roadside in Delhi.
Today, the gold medal for India has been winning in the same Narayan International events.
Moreover, look at the rising path of excellence in India's sports, India has never won an Olympic Medal in Judo, whether it is a Senior Level or a Junior Level.
But Tababi Devi made history by winning a silver medal in the sword at Youth Olympics.
Tababi Devi, a 16 year old player, lives in a village in Manipur.
His father is a laborer while his mother works for the sale of fish.
There have been times in front of his family when he didn't even have food money.
Even in such circumstances, the courage of Tababi Devi will not die.
And he created history by winning medals for the country.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is an inspiration.
Every young sportsperson is a recognition of New India.
My dear countrymen, you must remember that we had successfully organized the FIFA UNDER 1 World Cup in 2019.
The entire world appreciated it as a very successful tournament.
In the FIFA Under 1 World Cup, a new record about the number of spectators was also created.
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches in different stadiums of the country and increased the courage of young players.
This year, India is fortunate to host the Mens Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will commence from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian must have an attachment to hockey in his mind whether he is a sportsperson or a sportsperson.
India has a golden history in hockey.
In the past, India has won gold medals in several competitions and has also been a World Cup winner.
India has also given hockey many great players.
Whenever there will be talk of hockey in the world, the story of hockey will remain incomplete without these great players of India.
The whole world is familiar with Hockey's magician Major Dhyan Chand.
After him, Hockey has cut a huge joke from Balwinder Singh Sinier, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, the players of Team India are inspiring the new generation of hockey due to their hard work and relationship.
There is a good opportunity for sports lovers to see thrilling matches.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only encourage the Indian team but also encourage all the teams.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Mens Hockey Team for this competition and assure them that 1. 25 billion Indians stand with them and support them.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward for social work, they are becoming volunteers, they are inspiring and zealous for all the countrymen.
But today, in a new era, in a new era, in a new generation, in a new era, with new enthusiasm and new zeal, we are coming forward to do these things with new dreams.
Every Indian will feel proud to see the enthusiasm and affection he has for this work.
It is an aroma of a journey from self-to-sociation to the world.
Some children are learning and some old people are learning.
Someone is involved in cleanliness, somebody is helping the farmers and there is no resonance behind doing that but it has a selfless sense of dedication and determination.
A young man learned a wheelchair basketball to help the Divyangjans wheelchair basketball team.
The dedication to this flag is the activity that follows this mission.
Wouldn't any Indian be proud of this
This spirit of 'Main Nahin Hum' will inspire all of us.
My dear countrymen, this time when I was seeing your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I saw a very interesting stamp of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on MyGov - Please speak in Mann Ki Baat about how the patterns and traditions of Indian tribes are the best examples of coexistence with nature.
We need to learn something from how we need to adopt their traditions in our lives for sustainable development.
I compliment you for keeping this subject among the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a subject that inspires us to look at our glorious past and culture and today the entire world is discussing environmental conservation especially in the West and is looking for new ways for balanced lifestyle Balanced Life.
However, the year of our India is not free from this problem, but for its sake, we just have to do something inside us, see our rich history and traditions, and especially to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
Living in harmony with nature has been a part of the culture of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
In the Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship the trees like Piplo and Arjun in a revered manner.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us the path of environmental protection.
Especially in terms of conservation of trees, they are permitted to sacrifice their lives, but they are not allowed to damage a single tree.
Mishmi of Arunachal claims to have a relationship with tigers.
He considers them as his brothers and sisters.
Even in Nagaland, the tiger is seen as the protector of the forest.
In Maharashtra, the people of the Barli community consider tigers as guests and the presence of tigers is a source of prosperity for them.
There is a belief in the Coal community in Central India that their own destiny is linked to the tiger and if the tiger does not get food then the village will also have to stay hungry.
The Gond tribe of Central India stops fishing in some parts of the river Kathan in the season of confluence.
They consider these areas as a shelter for fish, which is why they get healthy and plenty of fish.
Tribal communities build their homes with natural resources, they are strong as well as environment friendly.
In the solitary areas of the Nilgiri plateau of South India, a small dispersed community is traditionally composed of locally available habitations.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living with a very peaceful and mutually beneficial settlement. However, when someone is harming their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were the people of tribal communities.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought hard against British rule for the protection of his wild land
There are many examples of the tribal community that teach us how to live in harmony with nature and today the country is the debt of our tribals to save the wealth of the forests.
Let us express our gratitude towards them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who are doing extraordinary work for society.
Such works which appear to be normal in the first instance, but in reality, they have a profound impact on changing their mindset and changing the direction of society.
A few days ago, I was studying about the farmer brother Gurubachan Singh ji of Punjab.
A common and hardworking farmer was the daughter of Gurubachan Singh ji.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan ji had said that we will marry with ease.
Whether it is life or things, there is no need to spend a lot of money.
Some things may be difficult for the family members of the girl but you will be surprised to know that Gurubachan Singh Ji was a straightforward farmer, the condition that he had said to him is the true strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji asked him to promise me that now you will not be able to get rid of the consumption.
You can imagine how big social power is there in it.
Gurubachan Singh ji seems very valuable but it shows how large his personality is. And we have seen that there are many families in our society that transform the individual event into the context of social interest.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh has set an example like this before us.
I have read about Kallar Majra, another village in Punjab, which is near Nabha.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurubachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to Kallar Majra and the people of all those places who have made their best efforts to keep the environment clean.
All of you are pushing the Indian heritage of healthy lifestyle as a true heir.
Like Tippettipepe lake, small awareness and activeness and positive work always play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it is said in our texts:- . . . : : You mean, O God, there is peace in all three people, in water, in the earth, in the sky, in the fire, in the wind, in the wind, in the medicine, in the vegetation, in the garden, in the unconscious, in the entire universe.
Just live in the heart, in my heart, in the stars, in the particles of the world, at every place.
India has a special significance for 11th November this year as the first world war ended on 11th November 100 years ago, it is completing 100 years, i. e.
The First World War was an important event for India.
In the true sense, we wouldn't have taken any direct action against this war.
Yet, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when it comes to war, it is not behind anyone.
Our soldiers have shown their bravery in remote areas and even in difficult situations.
It was the only objective behind all that was the restoration of peace.
The world witnessed the destruction of destruction in the First World War.
According to estimates, nearly 1 crore soldiers and almost the same civilians lost their lives.
With this, the entire world understood the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today, peace and harmony are not meant to be a war.
There is a need to work with global cooperation and coordination, from terrorism to transformation, from economic development to social justice.
Development of the poorest of the poor is a true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, our Ishaan Bharat is something or the other.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is unique and the people there are very talented.
Our Ishaan Bharat is now known for its best work.
Ishaan Bharat is an area that has made immense progress in organic farming.
A few days back, Sikkim won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
You will be happy to know that the awards given for the best policy formulation in this field are similar to the Oscars in that field.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for winning this award, leaving behind 51 nominal policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October is about to end.
