Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
In particular, it is not that only Indian community participates in it
Now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social movements there also celebrate Deepawali with full zeal and enthusiasm.
In a way, it can also be said that India is going to be built there.
Friends, there is an attraction in the world as a festival tourism.
There are many possibilities of festival tourism in this .
Our efforts should be to showcase the festivals like Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal and Bihu.
In our country, there are various festivals in every state and every region, in which people from other countries take more country.
Therefore, the role of Indians living abroad is very important in enhancing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we had decided in the last Mann Ki Baat that we will do something different on this Diwali.
On this Deepawali, all of us had said that we will celebrate the strength and achievements of India's women, that is, we will pay our respects to the people of India.
In a few days, stories that have been inspiring in the social media have started accumulating.
In an app called Namo App, Ramesh Ji, a millionaire of confusion, has said that his mother is his power.
In the 1990s, when my father was born, my mother accepted the gold of five children.
Today we have five brothers sitting in good work.
My greetings to your mother, Ramesh Ji.
Next, Geetika Swamiji, who is very keen on Twitter, has said that Major Khushboo Kanwar is the sage of India.
As far as Kavita Tiwari is concerned, India's daughter is her daughter and she gives her strength.
Mother is very proud that her daughter is drawing a fine painting.
He also has good marks in the legal entrance examination called CLAT.
People are sharing such collective information.
You must read, see, get inspired and share something in your neighbourhood just like those who are present in it. On this occasion I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all these Indians.
We are aware that he had laid the foundation for this thing in the 17th century.
My dear countrymen, this year on November 12, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev Ji is spread not only in India but in the whole world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters live in many countries of the world who are fully dedicated to the upliftment of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I cannot forget that I went to Venkuar and Gurudwara in Tehran.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has a lot to share with him but many parts of Mann Ki Baat will be fully needed.
Nanak Dev Ji considered the service to be above all.
Guru Nanak Dev ji considered selfless service priceless.
He spoke strongly against social evils such as evil.
The message of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji spread across the corner of the world.
He was one of the greatest travellers of his time.
He went to many places, and wherever he went, he would win the hearts of all through his simplicity and service.
Guru Nanak Dev ji undertook several important religious journeys, which are called Udaasi.
He carried the message of harmony and equality from the North to the South, from the East to the West, in all directions, to the people from all walks of life, to the sovereigns and the sacred.
Even the famous Assamese saint Shankardev ji is believed to have got inspiration from him.
He undertook a pilgrimage to the holy land of Haridwar.
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji had stayed in Gurubagh Gurudwara, an ancient place of Kashi.
He has also visited holy places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During his visit to Bihar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the water scarcity there.
It reminds all of us that Guru Nanak Jira Saheb is a famous place in Bihar, which was dedicated to him.
At a time Guru Nanak ji travelled north, Kashmir and adjoining areas.
This led to a strong link between the Sikhs and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji went to Tibet and the people there accepted him as a Guru.
He is also bowed to Uzbekistan during his visit to Pakistan.
As part of his pilgrimage, he has visited Islamic countries in large numbers, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He was in the hearts of millions of people, who followed his teachings with full commitment and are following them even today.
Just a few days ago, government ambassadors from around 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
They visited the Golden Mountain and all this happened on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
On this day, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man of India, was born, who was the son of one who connected the country.
Sardar Patel had a wonderful talent to integrate people, while those who had disagreements had the ability to adjust themselves.
He's actually the man of Detail, desirous of looking at the nukes.
Besides, he is an expert in institutional functioning.
The art of formulating schemes and formulating strategies for him.
While reading about Sardar ji's performance, we know how strong his planning was.
Thousands of delegates have come from all over the country to attend the Congress conference in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All arrangements for the conference were imposed on Sardar ji.
He used this opportunity to improve the city's drinking water network.
He ensured that no one should be left untouched by water scarcity.
He had contacted the farmers and appealed to them to make khadi bags.
At the same time, a substantial increase in Khadi sales has also been ensured.
Our country will be grateful to Sardar Patel for his remarkable contribution to the Constituent Assembly.
He was an important worker to determine fundamental rights, and thereby was no place for any inequality based on caste and religion.
Friends, As the country's first Home Minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji had succeeded in the unifying of the edifices and in a brilliant effort in the books of history.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, we talk about his contribution to certain areas of integration of the country.
And as soon as Sardar Patel was informed of them, he immediately took a drastic step, without delaying a moment.
Under his command, the thunderstorm was immediately flew, and as soon as he was looking, he was dumped into the enemy's evil desire to capture the islands.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the elder brothers to ensure that all necessary assistance is provided for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing an important role in Indias progress.
This is an attractive tourist destination.
I am confident that all of you will visit its beautiful islands and coastal areas.
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity was dedicated to the nation and the world on 31st October, 2018 to commemorate Sardar Saheb.
This is the world's largest statue.
This is a two-storey statue at a height above the statue of the independent goddess of America.
Every Indian is proud of the world's tallest statue.
Every Indians head is filled with pride.
I am glad that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists have come to see the Statue of Unity.
That is, every day 8500 people have visited the glory of the Statue of Unity.
It is evident that Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Ji has faith and dedication in the hearts of these people.
Now there are several attractive centres like Sapathikalli garden, slum plantations, forest cover, child nutrition parks, solidarity nurseries and so that the economy of the region has developed and people are getting new opportunities for employment.
Friends, This statue of unity for the country, for all the states and for the tourism sector, can become a subject of research.
We are all witnesses of how within a year, a place can become a world-famous tourist destination.
There are people from our country and foreigners.
Traffic, accommodation, guidance and environmental friendly organizations are developing one after the other.
I also urge you to spend some time with your priceless time and visit the Statue of Unity
But at the same time, I would like to reiterate my request that every Indian travelling with his family should visit at least 15 places in India and stay there at night.
Friends, you are aware that we are observing the country's unity day from 2014 to 31st October.
This day gives us the message of how to save the unity, integrity and security of our nation.
On 31st October, the Run for Unity is being organised like every year.
This will include all sections of the society and all sections of the society.
In this way, this drive is being carried out not only for physical but also for inner and beauty, but also for India's unity and for India's new heights.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had connected the country with the help of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a friendship in our lives and in a diverse country like India, we must keep adding strength to this mantra of unity at every stage, at every stage and at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very constructive and conscious to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around, there will be many examples of those who are engaged in sustainable activities to promote mutual harmony.
But in many cases, the effort of the society, its contributions and memory disappears very quickly.
Friends, I clearly remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court had given its verdict on the issue of Ramjanmabhoomi.
But after the verdict on Ramjanmabhoomi came to light, the then government, political parties, social organisations, society, representatives of all religions, sages and nobles made a very soft and neutral comment.
This is an attempt to reduce the pressure on the environment.
Those days, those moments remind us of our duties.
This is an example of how much unity is the country's strength.
Even the gods who enjoy the fruits, they are 125 crore Indians.
But a comfortable experience is also an interesting experience.
I heard that why shouldn't we share with you
Just imagine... the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature is 50-60 degrees below the Earth.
Life in the air is merely a nominal one.
In such a catastrophic situation, living in the midst of so many challenges is no less than an act of might.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only guarding the borders but also running a clean Siachen movement.
I express my gratitude to the people of our country for this wonderful obligation of the Indian Army.
It is difficult to swallow anything in the severe cold there.
In such a scenario, it is very important to analyze and arrange garbage dumps.
If there is an ecosystem here, it is a place of life of rare animals like ice and rare animals like iPex and brown bears.
My dear countrymen, festivals are the days that will create a new awareness in the lives of all of us.
Furthermore, Deepawali, particularly in every family, is very rarely buying something new and bringing something from the market.
I had also told you that we should try to buy local products.
If we get the required things in our village then what is the need to go to the regional level
What is the need to go to the district level if one gets one thing at the regional level
The more we try to buy locally available goods, Gandhi will automatically bloom as a great opportunity for 150 people.
I once again reiterate my request to buy something from our weavers for weaving their hands and for making our weavers weavers.
Deepawali not only conveys his best wishes but also calls upon us to become those who want to buy more local products.
Through this, we must ensure that how important we can contribute to realizing the dreams of Gandhiji.
Once again I convey my best wishes for this Deepawali.
On Deepawali we burn a variety of butterflies.
However, sometimes it burns because of our carelessness.
Injury occurs .
Therefore, while protecting you, I also urge you to celebrate festivals.
My best wishes to Deepawali.
Thank you very much.
He is always ready to express his happiness and express his support for our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated the valour of the Barakram Parv.
We were reminded of the accurate attack in 2016, and our soldiers gave a strong response to the hidden war that was waged in the guise of terrorism against our nation.
Our army had organised exhibitions at different places in the country to showcase our strengths to the citizens of the country, especially the youth.
Look at how capable we are, how our soldiers are defending our countrymen by putting their lives at risk.
One day such as the Parakram Parv reminds the youngsters of the rich traditions of our army.
It also inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in an event in Jodhpur, the brave land of Rajasthan.
It has now been decided that those who are making efforts to contribute to the peace and development of our country will give them a strong response.
India has always been committed to maintaining peace and dedication.
In both the world wars of the twentieth century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace, even if we had nothing to do with those wars.
This is also a valiant act in the direction of peace that our armed forces have undertaken.
Over the years, our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, things related to the sky will always be different.
In this way, it is not surprising that the Indian Air Force has drawn the attention of each and every citizen of the country by displaying their strength in the air.
They have given us a sense of security.
On the occasion of the Independence Day celebrations, one of the most eager and eager peoples aspirations for the march, is the air adventure in which our Air Force will showcase their strength with distraught operations.
We are celebrating Air Force Day on 8th October.
In 1932, our Air Force, which started a small scale with six aircraft and 19 Air Force personnel, is now among the most adventurous and powerful air force of the 21st century.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the Air Force personnel and their families who are serving the nation.
In 1947, when Pakistanis launched an unexpected attack, our air force decided to rescue Sri Lankan attackers and landed Indian soldiers' arms and ammunition on the battlefield at the right time.
In 1965, the Air Force gave a strong response to the opponents.
Who would say who didn't know about the Bangladesh Freedom Struggle in 1971
In the Tiger Hill area, where the enemies were hiding, every night, they were bombed and covered with dust.
Be it rescue and relief operations or disaster management, our air warriors have been grateful to the nation for their magnificent work.
Their feelings are magnificent to tackle all disasters like cyclones, storms, floods and wildlife.
The Air Force has set an example in gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of each of their departments for women.
I had made an announcement on 15th August this year from the Red Fort on 15th August.
We can proudly say that not only the male power, but also the role of women power is growing in the Indian Army's armed forces.
Women are powerful, but now they are becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, in the past, an officer from the navy has been facing the struggle of Abhilash Domi and Jeevan Sawa.
The entire country was concerned about how to save Domi.
You know that Abhilash Tomy is a very adventurous officer.
He was the first Indian to travel in a small boat without any modern technological support.
Over the past 80 days, he had been moving forward to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the southern part of the Indian Ocean without diminishing his pace at sea.
He gave a wonderful example of adventure, loyalty and integrity, and a few days ago, when I brought Abhilash out of the sea, I telephoned him.
I've already met Tommy.
I pray for the excellent health of Abhilash Domi, his courage, his valour, his dedication, his determination to fight, will certainly inspire our youth.
My dear countrymen, every child of the country is well aware of the significance of our nation on 2nd October.
The 2nd of October this year is another landmark.
Since then, we are organising several events across the globe on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji for years.
Gandhijis ideas have inspired the entire world.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another important work of Namami Gange.
In 1941, Gandhiji started writing some thoughts on the Constructive Programme.
Later, in 1945, when the freedom struggle was intensified, he prepared a copy of those ideas.
He put forward his views on a wide range of issues such as safeguarding the rights of farmers, villages and workers, cleanliness and the spread of education.
This is also known as Gandhi Charter.
Everyone has experienced this in the most unique form of his personality.
He gave the feeling that everyone is very important and vital for the country.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was to transform it into a mass struggle.
In the freedom struggle, all sections of the society, all sections of the society, themselves came forward and took up the challenge of Gandhiji.
And if the other thing is said, I will give you a shield, whenever you are skeptical, whenever you feel a sense of doubt, keep this synonym: look at the person who is poor and weak, remember his face, ask your mind, what kind of work you are doing, then ask your mind what kind of benefit it will be for that person.
Will this brighten his life and future
My dear countrymen, this saviour of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class people in the country, their growing economic power, their purchasing power...
Whether we go to buy something or not, can we recall that time when we go to buy something
Can you remember the mother's skin
Whose face is funny
If you buy, who will get the benefit directly or indirectly
If this benefits the poorest of the poor, then my joy will be strong.
Remember this mantra of Gandhiji, when we all buy something in the days to come, when we celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Gandhiji, when we buy every item, our countrymen should do well, especially those who have made their sweat, those who have invested their money, those who have sown their capabilities in it, they should get some benefit.
He might have been unaware of how this would happen but this happened and India got independence.
Just like this, today we can feel that this small task of mine can contribute to the economic development of my country and the power of fighting against poverty to the poor.
But today this is the genuine patriotism and this is the Karyanjali which we can provide for the oil.
He will say that all these rods are wet with great difficulty and every rod of them should be used.
And there was a mixture of serpents, and of serpents of the land, and of every corner of the gentiles.
We are going to celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri Ji two days after the birth of a dedicated mother.
His slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is a symbol of his stature.
As a result of his selfless commitment towards the nation, in a short span of about one and a half years, he was able to provide a mantra to the soldiers and farmers of the country for achieving success.
Millions of people joined this movement and I got an opportunity to serve in the cleanliness drive with the children of Ahmedabad in Delhi.
The foundation for the school was the respected Baba Saheb.
All the people across the country have joined the service on the 15th of this month.
Organisations have also contributed very enthusiastically.
School children, college students, National Cadet Corps, National Cadet Corps, National Cadet Corps, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Corporate Communities etc.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those countries who want cleanliness for their contribution.
Let's hear a telephone call.
But if you had not been able to telephonically telephonically telephone it was a comfortable thing for you after the toilets were constructed then the attention of the people associated with this movement could not have been given to you.
I express my gratitude to you in a special way.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a success story not only in our country but also in the world, everyone is talking about it.
This time, India is organizing the world's largest cleanliness summit in history.
In the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, Health Ministers and Sectoral experts from across the globe share their experiments and experiences on Swachhta.
The closing ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October this year to mark the commencement of 150th Birth Anniversary of Mother India.
The Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar contains a number of articles to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by that vision, NHRC was established on 12th October, 1993.
The Commission is to be established within a period of 25 years.
The Commission is not only protecting human rights but also enhancing human dignity.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, a leader close to our hearts, has said that human rights are not a foreign principle for all of us.
The monument of our National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has embodied the principle of 'Sarvey Bhawantu Sukinah' that comes from the Vedic times.
The Commission has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
This 25-year journey has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
It provides a healthy society with a belief in the best democratic values.
Today, in addition to the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been functioning.
As a society, we need to understand the significance of human rights and adopt it in practice, which is the proof of progress for all.
My dear countrymen, in October, the birth centenary of Jai Prakash Narayan ji and Rajmata Vijayraje Scindia ji will begin.
Let us remember these gentlemen who have inspired us.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar ji will come and I will talk about it in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat. But today, if I want to mention about him then for a few years on the birth anniversary of Sardar ji, on the 31st of October, the Ordinance for Unity is being organised in every small town, region and village of India.
This year we have to make efforts to organize this movement for unity in our villages, regions, cities and cities.
The drive for unity is the best way to think about Sardar ji because he worked for the unity of the nation throughout his life.
I would like to urge all of you to strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society, every section of the country and every section of the country through the drive for unity on 31st October. This will be a great tribute to him.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
Raksha Bandhan showcases love and trust among his brothers and sisters.
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
Several special stories associated with the ropeway of Kapuk ropeway are also filled with the history of the country by two different regions or people associated with religions.
A few days later, the date of Genmasthamy is about to come.
All around the environment, elephants, horses, palanquins - Jai Kanhaiyalal ki and Govinda-Kovinda are sounding like a buzz.
Happiness in Sri Krishna's devotion is all that is happening.
Our youth will be making preparations for Dahi-Handi in many parts of the country, particularly in the state of Maharashtra.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
Thank you, sister Sinmai, for putting forward a good thing.
Friends, Besides Raksha Bandhan, we celebrate the festival of 'Shiravana Paurnami' on the day of 'Shiravana Paurnami'.
I convey my best wishes to all those who have dedicated themselves to bringing this great treasure further, to the common man.
Every language has a special significance.
India is proud of the world's oldest languages in Tamil.
Likewise, it is a matter of pride for all of us, Indians, that from the Vedic times to today, all the languages have been contributing immensely to the spread of wisdom.
The genius of every field of life is embodied in the language and literature of Sanskrit.
Whether it is science, technology, agriculture, health, aeronautics, sculpture, mathematics, management, economy or environment...
You will be happy to know that even today, the people of Matur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are using equanimity as a litigation.
Thousands of words, 200 entries i.e. prefix, 22 entries i. e.
Therefore, any hot feeling or thing can be described precisely.
We always remember Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji.
It is his birthday that we celebrate Teachers Day throughout the country.
I convey my best wishes to all teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day.
At the same time, I wish science, education and the dedication of the teachers to the students.
My dear countrymen, this monsoon brings expectations to our hardworking farmers.
At some places, it is natural that there is more rainfall than any other place.
We all have seen how bad the lives of people have been affected due to the severe floods in Kerala.
Though we cannot fulfil their grief, yet I am confident that 125 crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you at this sad moment.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity should get better at the earliest.
Everyone decides how to reduce the sufferings of the people of Kerala and how to share their sorrows.
We are well aware that the soldiers were the heroes of the rescue operations in Kerala.
They did not give up any effort to save the civilians in the flood.
Air Force, Navy, Ground Force, Border Security Force, Central Industries Defence Force and Expedition have all contributed immensely to this movement.
I would especially like to mention this time the hard work of the Suras of the National Disaster Management Force (NDRF).
Yesterday, the festival of Onam was celebrated, let us urge all of us to give strength to the nation, particularly to Kerala, to rise quickly from the impact of this disaster and to make the development journey of Kerala faster.
Once again, I would like to assure all the people of the country, the people of Kerala and all those affected by disasters across the country that when the entire country is full of this embarrassment then it will help you.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions that came for Mann Ki Baat.
I had to see the subject on which the countrymen have written a lot - it is our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Keerthi of Gaziapat, Swatva Vatsa of Soniba, Praveen, brother of Kerala, Dr.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and MyGov have urged me to talk about the diversity of Atal ji's life, including Swapnab Banerjee, Akhilesh Pandey from Kadihar in Bihar.
On August 16, the nation and the world saddened by the news of Atal ji's time.
He quit the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, he has been away from radical politics for the past decade.
He was not involved in the news, but was away from public life.
Though the New Year is a big gap, the nation and the world have seen that this decade has not created any gap in the minds of the common Indians since the 16th of August.
The love, suffering and sorrow that Atal ji had expressed for them has boosted the nation. They showcase his vast personality.
Over the past few days, the greatest dimensions of Atal ji have emerged before the nation.
People recall and recall him as a distinguished parliamentarian, eminent writer, best speaker and a people-friendly Prime Minister.
Atal Ji will always be grateful to Atal Ji for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
But today, I would like to mention another dimension of Atal ji's broad personality, to touch it, the political culture that Atal ji had given to India, the efforts made to transform it and the efforts made to build it systematically, will be of great benefit to India in the days to come.
It's sure.
India will always be grateful for the 91st Constitutional Amendment in 2003.
This transformation has led to two significant changes in the politics of India.
Firstly, the number of Ministers in the States should be only 15 of the total number of MPs.
Secondly, under the anti-party legislation, he increased the size of one-third of the previous membership to two-thirds.
At the same time, clear guidelines were enforced to ensure the discharge of membership of party detainees.
Over the years, there has been a political culture of forming large-scale cabinets in India, and these big cabinets were created not to share tasks but to retain political leaders.
Atal ji changed this situation.
Due to his performance, money and expenditure were saved.
Moreover, performance was also improved.
This was possible only by a prophet like Atal ji, and a healthy tradition began to flourish in our political culture.
Atal ji is a real patriot.
During his tenure, the budget was changed at the time of submitting.
Previously, the budget was submitted at 5 p.m. according to the British method.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the presentation time from 5pm to 11pm.
Likewise, today you are watching the discussions about holding elections in the country for the central government and the state governments at the same time.
On this occasion, when we take a pledge to realize his dream of a fulfilled and progressive India, I also pay tributes to Atal Ji on behalf of all of us.
When there is talk of parliament, it is spoken about frustration, shouting and postponement, but if something goes well, it doesn't matter much.
A few days back, the Monsoon Session of Parliament concluded.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 74.
Crossing party differences, all MPs tried to make the Monsoon Session more effective, resulting in the passage of 21 bills in the Lok Sabha and 14 bills in the Rajya Sabha.
The Monsoon Session of the two Houses will always be remembered for social justice and youth welfare.
During this session, several important legislations were passed for the benefit of the youth and the backward classes.
This process will stand in synergy with the aim of social justice.
Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was also passed.
The Act will further protect the interests of the lowered and tribal communities.
Moreover there shall be confidence in the minds of the underprivileged, which shall prevent the atrocities of the perpetrators.
No civil society can tolerate injustice against women.
The nation is not ready to tolerate the perpetrators of sexual abuse
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill leading to severe punishment.
You might have read a few days ago about a court in Mandsor in Madhya Pradesh pronouncing trials within two months and pronouncing execution sentences for two offenders who have committed sexual assault on the girl.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh completed the trial in just five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have expedited judgments in such cases.
The Act will be a milestone in preventing crimes against women and girls.
When we move ahead for the welfare of the nation, we can transform the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
This time, during the rainy season, all of them together set a special model.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all MPs of the country.
Today, the attention of millions and millions of our countrymen has also been on the Asian Games in arda.
Every morning, the first time in public newspapers, on television, on social media is that which Indian soldier has won medals.
Asian Games are now underway.
I would like to congratulate all sportspersons who have won medals for the country.
I also extend my best wishes to the sportspersons who will be participating in the upcoming event.
India's sportspersons have made outstanding achievements especially in the field of shooting and wrestling competition, but our sportspersons have also been receiving medals in so many unprecedented fields such as Wushu competition and boat competition.
These are not mere medals - testimony to the faith and dreams of Indian sportspersons and sportspersons.
This is a very positive sign that our women are also among the increasing number of medal winners for the country.
So much so that our youngsters under the age of 15-16 are among the young medal winners.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
We have seen all of us building houses and buildings with bricks, but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago, a large mountain, a single rocky hill, has been built as a very special, broad and magnificent temple It is beyond imagination, but this has happened, this temple is also the Kailasanath temple in Ellora, Maharashtra.
India has been a land engineering experimental platform.
Several engineers have emerged in India, who have achieved unimaginable things and have given examples of wonders in the engineering world.
Even today lakhs of farmers and common people are benefiting from the Krishnaraj Sagar Dam which he had created across the river Kaviraj.
He is a sermon in these parts of the country and the nation pays tributes to him.
In his memory, we celebrate the 15th of September as Engineers' Day.
The engineers of our country have set a separate seal across the globe on the path shown by him.
When we talk about the wonders of the engineering world, we recall an incident in 2001 when a severe earthquake struck Kutch in Gujarat.
When I was working there as a self-sufficient servant, I got the opportunity to go to a village where I had to meet an ancestor who crossed the age of 100 years.
He was laughing at me and calling it a park in my house Par-Kutch.
He added that this house has seen three earthquakes in my house.
I have also met three earthquakes.
I know them in the same house.
But there will be no impact anywhere.
It was in my heart that centuries ago, engineers of that period had built buildings suitable to the regional environment and how the people could live safely.
When we observe Engineers' Day today, we must think for the future.
The world is suffering from natural calamities.
Let us meet in Mann Ki Baat, let us speak openly, let us take the nation forward through our hearts, let us remain united.
With this feeling, my best wishes to you all.
Thank you.
We'll meet again.
Mann Ki Baat July, 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
While India's vastness, diversity is on the other hand, rainfall also shows its discrimination.
But why should we criticize the rain
As a result, nature sometimes expresses its anger.
Therefore, it is our responsibility to be natural lovers, to preserve nature and to preserve nature so that there can be a deterioration in the gifts of nature itself.
A natural disaster that took place a few days ago attracted the attention of the entire world and embraced humanity.
It usually takes a few hours to get out of that cave.
But the fate of that day was different.
After walking a long distance inside the cave , suddenly due to miracles the gates of the cave got stagnant water .
Their way out was blocked.
They stayed in the cave for 18 days, not two days, but two days, on a small rock in the cave, because they were unaware.
You can imagine the circumstances in which those little ones would have to spend every moment in the event of death before their eyes.
On the one hand, those who were trapped in large numbers, on the other hand, the entire humanity was united and expressed the humanity that God gave.
People from all over the world were praying to bring these children out safely.
It is not that there is no pain in the parents, nor is there any tears in the eyes of the mother.
Crossing so many difficult situations, when the boys showed so much adventure and chest in a dark cave full of water, the whole world was amazed at the lack of confidence.
This incident makes us feel that when humanity stands united, miracles are inherent.
But we need to be calm and steadfast to target ourselves and work tirelessly for it.
Just a few days ago, the beloved poet of our country, Neeraj ji, left us alone.
He has a special significance - trust, self-confidence and compassion.
The months of July-August are the most important months for farmers and youth.
Because these months they are the peak season of colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam emerge from school and join colleges.
The months of February-March, if the examinations, questions and answers are for the papers, the months of April-May will be joyful and the decisions will be taken to decide which business should be done to decide the direction to travel in life.
In July, the youth's focus has shifted from questions to cut-off marks, which is an important period.
Students leave their homes and go to the student's hotel.
Students leave their parents' umbrella and join the umbrella of professors.
I firmly believe that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about starting a college life.
This is the first time when we leave our homes for the first time and leave the village and get out of a safe environment and start driving ourselves.
So many youngsters have left their homes for the first time and have come out to create a new direction for their lives.
Many students would have joined their colleges and some would have joined.
Whatever I want to say to you, be calm, enjoy your inner self in life, it is no doubt that books are essential, it is important to study and while finding new things, you can also make it yourself.
There is a unique value for old friends.
Young friends are very valuable, while choosing, adapting and continuing friendship is a very intelligent step.
Some new things can be learned, some new skills, new languages...
My best wishes to all the youngsters who have started a new dance.
While talking about the college season, it was reported that Asharam Chaudhary, a student from a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, has overcome the difficult challenges of life.
He has qualified for the first time in the medical examination of Jodhpur AIIMS.
His father is working as a sanitation worker and managing his family.
I convey my best wishes to him for this success.
How many such poor families have achieved this because of their untiring efforts and efforts to overcome the worst conditions.
Their accomplishments inspire us that Kushi's father from Nagpur is a voter in a school bus, Karthik's father is a policeman from Haryana, Ramesh Sahu's father works in a brick hole, and a student Ramesh is also selling sports goods at the festival.
Likewise, Anushka Banda, a disabled girl from Kutka, was suffering from a stereotype called spinal muscular atrophy...
All of them are those who, with the help of compassion, have broken the barriers in their hearts and have made the world look back.
If we look around with us, we can see many such examples.
And some good thing that happens in some corner of the country fills my mind with strength, and gives inspiration
Whenever I talk about such youths, I am taking into consideration the issue of Neeraj ji, this is the meaning of life.
Behold the poetry lines of Neeraj ji: I want to hear the songs of the earth in the sky. I want to invite the sweets to light. I want to remove the cruelty of the man with flowers.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes went on a news report and two youngsters had realized the dream of Modi.
While studying it further in detail, it has come to light that today our youth is trying to transform the lives of the common man by using technology intelligently and constructively.
I was interacting with Indian youth in the city of San Jose, which is once known as a technology hub.
I appealed to them to take time to think about how they can utilize their skills for India.
I appealed for knowledge and talent to come out of foreign countries and how to make use of it for the country.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji, took up this challenge and made a new effort.
Using their professional skills, Yogi ji and Rajnish ji had jointly created SmartGaon App and an App called Wise Villages.
The App will connect the villagers to the world and enable them to access any information and information on their mobile phones.
The Dwadagpurvasis of Rae Bareli, the President of Panchayat, the District Judge and the District Collector created awareness about the use of this App.
If you look at this event carefully then we should consider that these youngsters are living in the United States and living in the midst of lifestyle and ideals, even if they leave India several years ago, they are well aware of their village, they understand the challenges and are emotionally connected to their village.
This is the reason that the requirements of the village are well understood and worked accordingly.
It is natural for every Indian to have a thirst with their village and their roots, to achieve something for their motherland.
But sometimes because of the compulsions, distances and circumstances of the time, this feeling is slightly sluggish and if you put some fire in it then this feeling is immediately grabbing it and pulling them towards the past.
Pandarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Approximately 15-20 days before the audience, Varkari i. e.
This journey is called Vari, in which lakhs of devotees participate.
Gyaneshwar Swamis and Dukaram Swamis are singing and singing volley-will and composing lyrics and composing lyrics.
Pilgrims reach there to visit Lord Vittol Bhagwan, known as Vitopa or Pandurangan.
Vietnam protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
Devotees from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are filled with pain and devotion.
Going to the Vitoba Temple in Thunderpur, its glory, beauty and spiritual joy are all extremely unlimited.
I would like to urge the people of Mann Ki Baat to enjoy the warmth once you get the opportunity.
Several great personalities like Gyaneshwar Swamis, Namadevara, Eknath, Ramadoss Swamis and Dukaram Swamis still remain the guides to the common people of Maharashtra.
The legacy of these great personalities is inspiring every corner of India.
We get immense news of the significance of Parud song sequence, affinity, harmony, love and brotherhood.
Just as the great legacy of the great saints who made their offerings at the feet of God was in our country, similarly the great men who dedicated themselves in the motherland of Bharat Mata, they showed their lives to her.
Such a great man is Lokmanya Tilak, who has placed a seal on the minds of many Indians.
While we celebrate 23rd July as the birth anniversary of Tilak, we observe his commemoration on 1st August.
Lokamanya Tilak is full of adventure and self-confidence.
He was filled with the power and intellectual power that directly points to the mistakes of the British rulers.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was greatly impressed by Lokamanya Tilak.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji passed away on 1st August, 1920, he was determined to build a monument.
When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected as the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipality, he immediately chose Victoria Cardin, named after the ueen of the UK, to set up a monument of Lokmanya Tilak.
The British were astonished to see this, so the president refused to allow it.
Interestingly, while addressing the inaugural function, Gandhiji said that after Sardar Patel assumed office, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got a good man but has also got a chest, which is why the statue of Tilakji is being constructed.
My dear countrymen, the remarkable feature of this Thiruvananthapuram Statue is that this Thiruvananthapuram Statue is very rare, in which he appears to be sitting in the chair.
I am sharing with you the British about the period of our years.
Because of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak, there is a tradition of celebrating the social fascination.
Our ancient traditions and heroes of history are still very inspiring in our young society.
Today, in almost all the streets of several cities, we can see the tables of worshipping diamonds.
I would like to urge every city to make exclusive competitions on the occasion of Eco-friendly Ganapati Utsav in which awards are given, MyGov and Narendra Modi App and a widespread campaign on environment friendly Ganesh Ganesh Utsav.
I will surely take your views to the people.
Every Indian has to go through goodwill and the benefits of development.
This will build a New India.
On the 23rd of July, 50 years after the birth of Tilak, another son of Mother India was born.
He dedicated his life to the nation for breathing a free air.
I am talking about Chandrasekhar Azad Ji.
Any young man of India will be inspired by these words that he inspires - "Revolution thirst is in our hearts, let us see the power of enemies, these poems have become a fool for many young people like Ashfakullah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrasekhar Azads vision, his liberty and commitment inspired many youngsters.
Asad ji risked his life, but didn't bow to the foreign rule.
I had a great deal to visit the village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh, Alirajpur.
Once again I offer my heartfelt condolences to the two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak and Chandrasekhar Azad.
Just a few days ago, Hima Das, India's hero and farmer's daughter, has won a gold medal at the 400m race in the World Stage Championships held in Finland.
Ekta Bayan, another woman from the country, has written to me through e-mail from Indonesia and is now preparing for the Asian Games.
"It is a moment of great significance in the life of a brave man, I am very proud to be holding the Tricolour on the world stage," said Ekta in his Envoy.
Ekta, we all are proud of you.
You have made the nation proud.
In Tunisia, Grand Prix (Grand Prix) has won Ekta Gold and Bronze medals in 2018.
His achievement was that he had transformed the challenge of disability into a means of success.
Because of the road accident in 2003, Ekta Bayan's underlying organs were inactive, but he did not lose his chest, strengthened himself and achieved the desired goal.
And one more disabled, Yogesh Kaduniya, who has won the Gold Medal in the Grand Fire, a Grand Finale in Berlin, has won the Gold Medal in Berlin, along with Sunder Singh Gurjar, who also won the Gold Medal in Berlin.
I convey my best wishes and convey my best wishes to Ekta Bayan ji, Yogesh Kaduniya ji and Sundar Singh ji for their self-confidence and unwavering demise.
You have to move further, play more, shout happily.
My dear countrymen, several events of history are a part of celebrations in August but due to the weather sometimes diseases also take place at home.
My best wishes to this month of August which gives a boost to the good health and patriotism of all of you, and for many centuries-long festivals.
Once again, we will definitely meet in Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days back, a historic cricket match took place in Bangalore.
You all must have realized that I mention the taste competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that this is the first International Text Birth Anniversary of Afghanistan and the historic test of Afghanistan has happened with India.
President Ashraf Khani ji also tagged me and said, The people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I express my gratitude to our Indian friends for setting up a platform to showcase their talents.
Rashid is a representative of the special features of Afghanistan.
This dance will be an unforgettable one for all.
I consider it special because it is the first to be remembered, on one hand, for another reason.
The Indian team has demonstrated an unprecedented image throughout the world.
We can understand the nature of sportspersons from this event.
This shows that sports is the best way to connect the world and bring out the skills and talents of our youth.
My best wishes to both the India-Afghanistan teams.
I am confident that in the near future, we will play with each other in the spirit of sports and development.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, when we celebrated the 4th International Yoga Day, the entire world joined it.
I am told that for the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic event of Yoga was organised in which a large number of women had made seats.
Among the highest peaks in Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers worked together for Yoga.
Some soldiers were also engaged in Yoga in submarine ships
Likewise, some soldiers used to practice Yoga on the snowy peaks of Siachen.
Our soldiers of the Air Force, in the middle of the earth, performed Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the ground and made everyone surprised.
And the thing to be noted is that they did not do this, as they sat on the plane, but did it floating in the air.
Yoga has been conducted everywhere in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and playgrounds.
A scene of Ahmedabad touched the heart.
Around 750 disabled brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in one group and joined together in Yoga and achieved world reputation.
Without any restrictions on caste, religion and geography, Yoga has done the job of connecting all the people of the world with the feeling that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam and the whole world is united.
Moreover, people will make it a part of their lives.
We are reminded of the doctors in times of distress
But on this day when we celebrate the services, dedication and achievements of doctors, I express my gratitude to them.
The doctors of our country have placed their stamps all over the world because of their capabilities.
While the medical industry is skilled and hardworking, our doctors are known for resolving complex medical problems.
India is a land of rich historical values that does not have a day or month without a historic event.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I will come to Maghar on 28th.
You know why Kabirdasar went to Maghar.
The holy poet Kabirdasar stressed on social unity, peace and brotherhood through his poetic forms of Sakhis and Dohas.
This was his objective.
We can see this vision in his works and it is equally concentrated in today's world.
Listen to his Doha - Kabir Soyi Peer Hai, Jo John Bar Peer, Jo Par Peer Na Janahee, So Ka Peer Man Peer.
Kabir Dasar stressed on social harmony.
In another Doha, what he says...
Where there is greed and fornication, there is sin.
And Jadi Na Pusho Sadhu ki, and Pooch Legie Ganan.
Neither ask you of the saints what is their goal: ask them wisdom.
His appeal to the people is that people should accept and respect the wisdom of the people beyond casteism.
His comments have been affecting centuries and even today.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji will say that the service to the poor and the needy is the service to God.
Wherever he goes, there is a lot of service to social good.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji had introduced the cooking system called Langar.
550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to participate in it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
India's freedom struggle was very long, widespread, very deep and full of sacrifices.
There is another history associated with Punjab.
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 2019 is going to take 100 years, which is a matter of shame for humanity.
My dear countrymen, Raman Kumar ji from Rohini, Delhi and Dr.
Raman ji, first of all, I express my gratitude to you.
I am very enthusiastic about your interest in Indias growth.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Ji on 23rd June.
In 1937, Dr.
Only a few people would know that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had spoken in Bengal at the convocation ceremony of Kolkata University at the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji.
This is the first time that the British had spoken in Bengal at the Convocation of the University of Kolkata during their reign.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industrial Minister of India. And yet, he had laid the foundation for Indias industrial development and had laid the foundation for a strong foundation then it was not surprising.
In the first Industrial Policy of Independent India, which came out in 1948, an unprecedented seal of his views and visions emerged.
Dr.
Mukherjee Jis dream is to make India self-reliant in every sector and make India self-reliant.
While India is developing large scale industries, she wanted her full focus on medium and small scale industries, industries, weaving and slum industries.
In order to provide financial and institutional base for holistic development of small and medium enterprises, he created the All India Council of Artisans (AIB), All India Council of Academics (AIBA), Patrols and Rural Industries (AIB) from 1948 to 1950.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jis contribution.
He was very keen on the development of West Bengal.
As a result of his understanding, intellectual and constructive action, a large part of Bengal was saved and part of India.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video conference.
There was an opportunity to go beyond the files and get to know directly about the changes in life.
While he knew about an ordinary man... his simple words, his experienced language, the incident of him, gave him an annual turn.
Women from far-flung villages are providing pension to passport services to senior citizens in villages through Common Service Centre.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister has collected sweet palms and is selling ice cream.
Like the Anjan Prakash of Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters of the country are not only performing medicines but also going to nearby villages and providing expensive medicines.
Schoolchildren from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa have been working on important topics such as waste management in their schooling lab at their early age.
Throughout this programme, more than the success of the government, I was able to hear and live the things about the success of the common man, the power of the country, the power of the dreams of a New India and the capability of a New India.
On the contrary, there are some people in the society - unless they talk about disappointment, unless they ignore the impotence, unless they inspire distrust, unless they seek the path of unity and not the path of diversity.
In such a scenario, when we talk about the events that took place in our lives along with the common man, new aspirations and new zeal, I don't think it was a reputation for the government.
The story of a small girl from a remote village becomes an inspiration for 125 crore Indians.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people were connected through this video bridge and you have given me the task of giving me a new energy.
Once again I would like to express my gratitude to you all.
I have always seen that if we look around, somewhere or the other good thing will definitely appear in our eyes.
There are people who understand good.
We can use the aroma of good things as well.
In the past one thing has attracted my attention and it is a very important combination.
On the one hand there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand there are agricultural brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
Farmers associated themselves with it, they devised schemes and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Experts and engineers trained farmers through this charity to learn new techniques of farming, how to do organic farming and how to cultivate crops along with one barley in the fields.
Today, they are not only cultivating vegetables but also selling their vegetables through this charity and selling them at a fair price and even the farmers who produce grains have joined them.
In another way, I am happy that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, engineers and technicians have left their circles and have made their own way of working together with the farmers, with the villages and with the fields and crops.
Friends
Your youth is really passionate about any young man.
Other youngsters of the country will definitely visit their portal and take care of their work and they will also get inspired about how they can work in different fields of society in their respective areas.
A dream for all of our countrymen, a nation is one tax.
If anyone has to appreciate the implementation of the same tax revision system, I would like to congratulate the states as I am.
Till date, 27 GST meetings have been held, people with diverse political views, States with different priorities participated in it.
Before the implementation, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is being revised.
The success of the GST currency is a celebration of currency measures.
As the checkpoints have come to an end, freight traffic is going on at a rapid pace, thus leading to time savings and significant profits in the goods sector.
Perhaps the world's largest tax reform.
Generally, such a massive reform, such a large country, as such a large population, could take five to seven years to fully sustain it.
And that is the biggest success that has been achieved by 125 crore countrymen.
My best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Hello.
Once again I have got the opportunity to meet you all through Mann Ki Baat.
I believe that all of you will remember that a team of six women commanders of the Indian Navy has been sailing for months.
They travel across different oceans and many seas and cross about 22,000 seas.
This has happened for the first time in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet these women gems and listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate them for their excellent work in the field of adventure, naval pride and the country's significance, particularly for proving that the women of India do not belong to anybody in the world.
Who does not know the spirit of adventure
For centuries, the Everest Summit has been a challenge to humanity, and sufficient people have been facing this challenge.
On 16th May, a group of five tribal students - Manisha Turuve, Pramesh Ale, Umanand Madvi, Kavidas Kathmode and Vikas Soyam - from an Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra have climbed to the highest peak in the world.
The students of Assam School started their training in August 2017 at Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youths were selected under the training programme of Shaurya Mission
In accordance with their name, they have made the nation proud at the peak of Everest.
I heartily congratulate the people of Chandrapur and my young friends.
Accordingly, a 16-year-old girl from India, Shivangi singer, who has reached the Everest peak from Nepal, is the youngest Indian woman.
Many congratulations to Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj ji and his daughter Diya will be the first father and daughter of India to touch the Everest.
It is not that some youngsters are climbing the Everest height.
Sangeeta Behal ji, over 50, climbed the Everest Summit on May 19th.
Some of the climbers on the Everest peak have shown that they have ability and emotion.
In the past, Swachh Ganga Abhiyan, under the Clean Ganga Mission, a team of Border Police Forces climbed the Everest Summit, but when they landed, they brought together collected dumplings.
While this is a matter of commendation, this activity highlights the vitality of the environment in terms of cleanliness.
Over the years, people have climbed the Everest summit and many of them have succeeded.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the brave soldiers, especially women.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, when I had spoken about Fit India two months ago, I didn't even think that there would be so many responses.
I don't even think that all sections of the society will support it.
When I talk about Fit India, I acknowledge that the number of sports that we are playing will be as much as the country will play.
In the social media, people are sharing fitness challenges, i.e., physical challenges, tagging each other and leaving the challenge.
Today everyone is coming together with this mission called Fit India.
Be it film industry, sports, the common man of the country, soldiers, school teachers, India will be firm everywhere.
I believe that such a challenge is not only helping us keep ourselves committed, but also encouraging others to make ourselves fit.
Savi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that sports played on the streets were a part of every child's life and they are close today.
In particular, these games have been an important part of the summer holidays.
At graduation, after having dinner, children will play for hours without worrying or worrying about anything
Some of these games were played by the entire family.
Several sports from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, these games were part of the younger age.
Yes, in different places they may have been called by different names.
For example, the game, known as 7stones, is known by many names Lahouri, Pittu, Sadolia, Tigori and Sadodiya.
We can see unity in these sports in the background of the diversity of our country.
The same sports is being known in different names at different places.
I am from Gujarat where I know about a game called Somal Isto.
It is played on 8 x 8 square tablet with a blooming piece or a mother.
This was played in almost all the states.
This is called Saukabara in Karnataka, and Athu in Madhya Pradesh, which is called Pagitali in Kerala, Sampal in Maharashtra, Thamal in Tamil Nadu, Sangapho in Rajasthan.
I don't know anything in every state language but after playing, I came to know that we have played this thing too.
Is there any of us who don't dress up like a skull or a skull
It is known by various names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh it is called Kotibilla or Karabilla and in Odisha it is called Kulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vittalu.
When everyone winds, when everyone plays, we can express the unique characteristics that we have without interruption.
You can see that many children are fond of curiosity, but when they play, they become very curious.
They express themselves, they seem to be very deep, and there is a hidden childhood in them.
Determining the goals, how to achieve the psychology, how to create a team spirit and how to help each other.
I can see that our traditional sports are now being used in training programmes related to business management, to improve overall personality and development of mutual skills.
From children to adults, when everyone plays together, the gap between generations, it disappears ignorantly.
At the same time, we can understand our culture and traditions.
Many sports provide awareness about society and environment.
Animation films can be made, played in streets and in slums and they will also see, play and grow.
My dear countrymen, India is officially organizing the World Environment Day Celebrations on 5th June.
The theme is Beat Plastic Pollution (BEATPLASTIC POLLUTION).
I urge you all to understand the importance of this theme and make a decision to avoid the use of polythene and low quality plastics and to try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on nature, on forest creatures and on our health.
Enter the World Environment Day portal Weed-india-2018, so many suggestions have been given in a very interesting manner - look, know and try to adopt them in your daily life.
When there is extreme heat, when there is floods, when there is no rains, when there is unbearable cold, everybody becomes an expert, he talks about global warming, climate change, etc.
Over the past few weeks, we have seen dust and strong winds blowing in many parts of the country and also heavy rains.
This has also resulted in loss of lives.
All these are the main consequences of climate change
Our culture and our traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We must live in harmony with nature and live in harmony with nature.
Gandhiji had put forth this thing in every step of his life.
We will make arrangements for the maintenance of trees not only by stopping them but by growing and growing.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
The world has repeatedly enjoyed the message of Yoga and harmonious society for unity in the last few years.
Yoga is a psychological source of learning and it always protects us like a father.
As a matter of concern, this feeling is similar to that of their mother in children, mental peace becomes our lasting friend.
By continuously teaching Yoga, the poetry becomes our children, our brothers and sisters, our brothers and sisters, our land is our bed, our wisdom is our hunger, he added.
If all these qualities were one's comrades, then the Yogi ji would win over all kinds of fears.
Once again I invite all the countrymen to take forward the tradition of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is the 27th of May, the commemoration of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji, the first Prime Minister of India.
I salute Panditji.
In May this year, he was the brave sarkar.
It was during the same month of May 1857 that our countrymen showed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers gathered against injustice and showed their resolve.
The sad fact is that for a long time, what happened in 1857 was either a riot or a rebellion.
In fact, this is not only an underestimation of the event but also an attempt to humiliate our self-respect and self-respect.
Veer Savarkar, who was not only a riot in 1857, but also a fearless freedom fighter.
In collaboration with Savarkar, many freedom fighters celebrated its 50th anniversary in the India House in London.
An expert in managing and managing both arms and weapons.
We generally thank Veer Savarkar for his bravery and his struggle against British imperialism
But apart from all this, he has always strengthened the magnificent poet, social reformer, unity and harmony.
I remember that Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, who is our beloved favourite of Chavarkar ji, had said this thing.
He was an understanding poet and a brave revolutionary.
I convey my best wishes for the bright future of our women monuments with aspirations and aspirations.
If you are determined to achieve something then you can achieve success by crossing all obstacles
It is a story of some people who have dedicated themselves to fulfilling the dreams of others, who live in the slums of Cuttack, Odisha.
Prakash Rao is theirs.
You will be surprised to know that a simple man who sells tea today is bringing the fire of education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He provides all facilities like education, health and food to all children coming to school.
I congratulate Prakash Rao Ji for his untiring work, his vision and illumination in the lives of poor children and for giving them a new direction.
He has removed the darkness of their lives.
Who knows not the scripture of Damaso Maa Jyothikamaya
But if someone did that, then he would be able to do that.
His life is a concept for all of us, for society and for the entire country.
There might be such incidents that inspire you all around.
In a few days, they will also wait for the arrival of Bathichandra.
I am confident that all of you will celebrate Eid with great enthusiasm tomorrow and on this occasion the children will get a specially good Eid Prize.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries of the world including India participated in this event.
Imagine how many such arrangements have been made and when thousands of sportspersons from all over the world take part, then imagine what kind of atmosphere is there.
A spirit of enthusiasm, expectation, inspiration, aspirations, aspirations and aspirations - if such an environment prevails then can there be any person who has no effect on it
..India has achieved an unprecedented achievement.
Whether it is a matter of pride for the soldiers to win medals, it is a matter of great pride for the entire country and for all the people of the country.
Encouragement and motivation boil.
We are all mixing together with one feeling.
I have no words to express this feeling.
But I want to share with you what these sportspersons have told me.
Why is it special, many things have happened for the first time.
This time all the warriors who participated in the Commonwealth Games have won medals.
Manika Bhadra has made medals in all her stakeholders.
He is the first Indian woman to win a gold medal in the Table Tennis Single Winner.
India got the largest gold shooting competition.
India's only Para Power Lifter won a medal at the Chachin Chaudhary Commonwealth Games.
Moreover, if the competition was special, it was because the majority of the winners were women.
Whether it was a skull, a gun, a weightlift, a gunshot or a gunshot competition, the women played very well and showcased their talents.
The final contest of the Poof Expedition will be held between Indias two heroes Saina Nehwal and B.
V.
It was held between Sindhu.
I was asking you to join Fit India and come to the leadership.
I am very happy that people have joined this movement with great enthusiasm.
Many have written letters expressing their support for this and are sharing important issues related to their commitment in the social media and Fit India information.
Sasikanth Bonsley shared the film he took in a swimming pool and wrote, My body is my weapon, water is my individual, swimming is my world.
Do you know what Ruma Devnath has written I feel happy and healthy after walking in the morning
As far as I am concerned, the smile is mixed with smiles and when we are happy, we have to smile.
After seeing all these things, it is good that many famous people are also inspiring our youth in the most interesting ways for Fit India.
The film star Akshay Kumar has given a video on Twitter.
His other video has also become more popular, in which he can see his handwriting with the people.
Many youngsters are connecting themselves with Fit India initiatives and sharing their experiences.
Your city, your village, your area, your school, your college, all the elderly, men and women should make efforts to connect with Yoga.
You must have been thinking about how to enjoy holidays and where to go.
Today I invite you to work in a new way
I can see several youngsters spending their time to learn something or the other.
The significance of summer training is increasing, the youth are also engaged in the search for this thing and training is a new experience.
Outside the four walls, one gets the experience of living in a new dimension through writing and computing.
My young friends, I urge you to do a special training.
The three Ministries of the Government of India - Department of Sports, Department of Human Resource Development and Ministry of Drinking Water, Government of India - are jointly organising the Swachh Bharat Summer Exercise 2018.
You can go to MyGov website and register yourself to participate in Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I believe that our youth will take this movement for cleanliness further.
Definitely send your information, send photos, and make yourselves ventilators.
Come on
We will create an opportunity to learn from this holiday to gain a new experience.
Just a few days ago, the youth of Delhi used to portray something about some of them in Coot News in India, who are serving the poor children with education.
These youngsters have stepped up a massive campaign to educate the street children of Delhi and children living in slums.
This innovative activity began as the condition of children begging on the streets or swinging on their retail jobs.
Beginning with 15 children in the slums near Gita Colony in Delhi, this movement is now connecting 2000 children to 12 places in the capital.
Young people, teachers and people associated with this movement have been working for them in their daily routine for two hours and have been trying their best to bring about a change in society.
Brothers and sisters, similarly, some farmers of the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become an inspiration for the farmers across the country.
Their coordinated efforts have not only enriched their position but also enriched the future of their region.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, particularly millets, saffron varieties, maize saffron and barley are being cultivated.
As a hilly area, the farmers did not get the right price for this
They formed a cooperative system in Munnar village, where the factory was built to prepare the biscuits.
Looking at the mindset of the farmers, the administration has also linked it with the National Rural Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are being added not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bhageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
Due to the hard work of the farmers, the income of this organization has not only reached 10-15 lakh rupees per annum but it has also created employment for more than 900 families.
Everyone talks about it but don't we have the obligation
Do we not think that water conservation is the responsibility of the society
This must be the responsibility of every individual.
How can we save every drop of water in the rainy season
Over the centuries, our ancestors have demonstrated this.
They have given priority to the importance of every drop of water.
They have discovered innovative methods and have understood how to save every drop of water.
If any of you had the opportunity to visit Tamilnadu, you might have noticed that some of the temples there were big inscriptions related to water conservation and drought management.
Large inscriptions like Mannarkovil, Cheranmadevi, Mandirpatti and Kurukshetra are found everywhere.
We should not forget that even today, a lot of educational wells are known as tourist destinations, which are the living examples of our ancestors of the water conservation movement.
Atlaj in Gujarat and Rani Keeev in Patan have been declared as the world heritage site of the UN Education, Science and Cultural Organisation.
In the months of April, May, June and July, we get a very good opportunity to save rain water, as much as we are ready before.
The budgetary allocation of MGREGS is being spent on water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, everyone has been making their own efforts towards water conservation and water management.
Average amount of Rs. 32,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water management across MGREGS every year.
In 2017-18, about 55 of the total outlay of Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent on activities like water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted from these water conservation and water management.
Seven thousand people working under this scheme have worked hard in seventy days to revive the river Kutte Perur in Kerala.
Rivers like the Ganges and the Yamuna, but in some parts of Uttar Pradesh, for example, two rivers called Sasur and Kadheri have dried up in the Fatehpur district.
The District Administration faced the challenge of large scale land and water conservation activities under the MGNREGS.
With the help of people of about 40-45 villages, these dry-filled sasur and khatri rivers were revived.
Have you ever seen the success of such a big blessing - be it birds, peasants, agriculture or villages
The months of May, June and July are coming and I once again urge you to take some responsibility for water conservation and water management.
My dear countrymen, before the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have been receiving news from all sides, letters and phone calls.
Ayan Kumar Banerjee ji from Devitola village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal has written in MyGov: We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know about Rabindranath Tagore's philosophy of peaceful, beautiful and honest living.
Please talk about this thing in Mann Ki Baat programme so that people can get an opportunity to know about it.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was an integral form of wisdom and wisdom. His writings have set an incredible seal in the minds of all readers.
Rabindranath is an intellectual, diverse, but we can enjoy that every moment a teacher lives within him.
"He, who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students," he wrote in his Gitanjali.
I was not familiar with Bengali but I used to wake up early in my childhood and radio broadcasting in eastern India will start soon and start late in western India.
Anantalok, Akuner and Boroshmoni will get a chance to hear these poems and there will be a lot of inspiration in mind.
You too, Ravindra Sangeet and his poems must have been composed.
My dear countrymen, in a few days Ramlan will start in the holy month.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated all over the world with utmost pain and respect.
Nonbin's social side is that when a man is starving, he feels the hungry of others, and when he is thirsty, he feels the feeling of the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to reflect on the message and teachings given by the messengers of Mohammed.
The lesson we learn from his life is to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a man asked the messenger that it was very important to do any thing in Islam.
The Ambassador said, It is to provide food to the poor and needy, whether we know or not, to be in harmony with everyone.
Mohammad Nabies believed in wisdom and compassion.
Prophet Mohammad Nabi has said that if something is more than your requirement then you give it to the needy person, so in the month of Ramzan, the donor has been given greater importance.
People donate money to the poor in this holy month.
And the prophet Mohammed said, No man is rich because of his pure soul, but because of the wealth that is with him.
Lord Buddha is an inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Baba Saheb empowered the millions of people on the brink of the land, be it the underprivileged, the deceitful and the oppressed under the Constitution.
For compassion, there can be no better example than this.
Mercy was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha in eradicating the misery of the people.
In many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, Buddhist traditions are associated with their roots.
This is the reason why we are enriching the infrastructure for tourism, which connects the important places of Southeast Asia with the important Buddhist sites of India.
Today, there are conflicts and people's misery everywhere in the world and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to eradicate hatred by compassion.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all those who have been devoted to Lord Buddha, who have believed in compassionate principles and others across the globe.
I bless the whole world with the blessings of Lord Buddha through which we can fulfill our responsibility of creating a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
You might have heard about the statues of laughing Buddha, while talking about these things, it is said that this laughing Buddha would have enjoyed the luck, but some people are aware that Buddha is associated with an important event in the defence of India.
You can imagine what is the connection between Buddha and the Indian Army with Buddhism.
New self-confidence has emerged from the people of Indian origin spread all over the world.
That day is a Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 1998, India carried out a nuclear test at Pokran, Rajasthan on its western border.
In a way, Indias experiment was successful and in the field of science and technology, it could be said that India had demonstrated its strength.
And it came to pass on that day, that in the history of India, the power of our armies was engraved in golden signs.
Bhagwan Buddha showed that the power of Andratama is essential for peace.
Similarly, if we are strong as a nation today then we can be calm with all of us.
That day we showed the world that India is capable of achieving new goals and summits every day under a strong leadership, a land of great scientists.
We can see the new joy and new joy of taking forward the journey that Atal ji had started before us.
My dear countrymen, once again we will come back to Mann Ki Baat and we will talk about many more things.
Mann Ki Baat March 2018
Today is the day of Ram Navami.
On this auspicious day, my best wishes to all fellow citizens.
In every moment of his life, we have seen how the power of Ram was in his life.
During the last few days, on 26th January, when all the leaders of ASEAN organisations came here, they brought together the Council of Cultural Affairs.
It is a matter of great pride that most of the countries have given Ramayana in front of us.
It means that Ram and Ramayana, not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries located in this part of the world, are proving to have the same enthusiasm and influence even today.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, this time, like every system, all your letters, e-mails, telephone messages and comments have been received in a big way.
You have heard about the introduction of communicable lessons in Gomal Taker in MyGov online and I have read it.
Besides being a member of the forecasting department, it is also a matter of great pleasure to see their attraction towards harmony.
I have told you about the efforts being made by the concerned department in this regard.
I appeal to all those who listen to Mann Ki Baat and those who are engaged in the work related to convergence that how do you think about Gomal Ji
Kanshyam Kumar ji from Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar, I read his comments on the Narendra Modi App.
You have expressed concern over the decline in ground water levels, and this is surely important.
You have also asked for water to be given to animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal ji, I bring your feelings to all the leaders.
Do you know what Yogesh Bhadresha ji has said He is urging the youth to ask for health care this time.
He believes that our youth is physically weak compared to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, this time I have decided to talk to everyone in detail about health - Fit India.
You all, youngsters, can join hands in the drive for a healthy India.
The French President had visited Kashi during his visit to the country during the last few days and the sights of the journey were all touching and impressive.
Now I urge you to lock them up, re-dewit and bring them to your friends.
Anaka, Jayesh from Chennai, and many more children and Exam Warriors have written to me on the gratitude cards behind my book.
I would like to tell Anaka, Jayesh and all the children that after seeing your letters, all the fatigue of that day disappeared like a snowball.
Many of these letters, so many phone calls, comments, and those I can read from, I can hear, many of these things are in my heart.
I would have to tell you about them only in months.
This time most of the letters have been written by children and they have been written about the examinations.
They are sharing their vacation plans.
They have expressed concern about the water for animals and birds in the summer.
Letters have been received from farmer brothers and sisters regarding the functioning of farmers across the country regarding farming.
Some citizens have positive suggestions regarding water conservation.
During festivals, our festivals, our culture and our traditions are being tolerated.
It means that Mann Ki Baat changes according to the climate and the truth is that the voice of Mann Ki Baat has changed the climate of life of many.
Why not change
In these things, in your experiences, in these examples of yours, the thirst for doing something good for the nation is reflected in such zeal and energy.
These have the potential to transform the environment of the entire nation.
When I got the opportunity to read your letters, I came to know how a Rickshaw driver from the district of Karimganj in Assam, Ahmed Ali, had created 9 schools for studying poor children with the help of his intense desire.
13 years ago, due to lack of proper treatment, the sister of Kolkata's taxi driver Siddle Lucker dies.
He pledged to set up a hospital on his own so that no poor person can die due to lack of treatment.
To achieve this goal, Sidul sold jokes in his house and collected money on his own.
Many travellers who travelled on his taxi gave a heartfelt bond.
An engineer sister donated her first month's salary.
In this way, after 12 years of collection of funds, the cynical effort of Saidul Laskar ultimately benefitted
Today, due to his hard work and dedication, a hospital with 30 beds is being constructed in Punari village near Kolkata.
Such zealous thrilling instincts have become an introduction to my nation.
Today, when the name of India is pronounced with great respect, then the unparalleled work of Mother India's rich wealth is embraced.
Today, this belief has emerged in the minds of the youth, the women, the backward, the poor and the middle class people of the country.
We can move forward, our country can progress.
An atmosphere of self-confidence with aspirations and aspirations has emerged.
This is self-confidence, this is a positive feeling that will realise our dream of a New India and reflect our commitment.
My dear countrymen, the coming months will be very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why a lot of letters have come in relation to agriculture.
This time, when I look at the video of discussions with the farmers on the Kisan Channel for the farmers of Doordarshan, I feel that every farmer should associate himself with the DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan and see that the benefits shown there should be implemented in their fields.
Be it Gandhiji or Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji or Lohia Ji or Chaudhary Saran Singh Ji or Saudri Devi Lal Ji all have considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and public life.
Likewise, Lal Bahadur Shastri used to talk about the importance of trees, plants, plants and special farming system.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has called for greater public awareness to ensure better income for our farmers, better irrigation facilities and to increase the production of food and milk.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Saran Singh ji urged farmers to use new technologies and create innovations and emphasized the need for this.
I had visited the Agriculture Development Festival in Delhi recently.
Interacting with farmer brothers and sisters and scientists there, I had a comfortable experience in knowing, understanding and understanding the innovations related to agriculture.
But the thing that had a great impact on me was Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers there.
This low-lying area has done a great job.
Our farmers from Meghalaya have achieved the record in 2015-16 as compared to the last five years.
If the goal is determined, if motivation becomes deeper, then they can achieve and achieve.
Today, technology is also being used for the labour of the farmers, due to which the farmers are getting substantial strength.
Brothers and sisters, in this year's budget, a massive resolution has been taken to provide remunerative prices to the farmers.
Besides, the work on agricultural marketing reforms in the country has been progressively undertaken to ensure fair price for the produce of the farmers.
Efforts are being made to connect the regional markets in the village, the gross markets and the world market.
APMC and e-NAM platforms will be integrated while developing and developing the necessary infrastructure for 22,000 rural markets across the country so that farmers do not have to go too far to sell their produce.
In a way, this kind of system is being developed from the farmland to any other market of the country.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
How should the nation celebrate this festival
Besides this, 125 crore countrymen, shoulder to shoulder, shoulder to shoulder, shoulder to shoulder, shoulder to shoulder to shoulder, shoulder to shoulder to shoulder, shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder, shoulder to shoulder to shoulder.
Can we organise new events
Can we develop new ways
I appeal to all of you to share your views on this through MyGov.
What is the symbol of 'Gandhi 150'
What can be the shout
Write to me your comments on these things.
Today, the health sector has gone beyond the routine approach across the country.
All health related services in the country were previously in charge of the Ministry of Health but now all the departments and ministries - be it the Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs or Ministry of Women and Child Development or State Governments - are working together for a healthy India.
Disease prevention health is not only affordable but also very simple.
The more aware we are about disease prevention health, the more it benefits the individual, the family and the society.
The first requirement for a healthy life is cleanliness.
We all are committed to a nation as a result of which healthcare has doubled to about 80 in the last four years.
Besides, work is being done in detail in the direction of setting up of healthcare centres across the country.
Yoga has created its identity across the world with a new energy in terms of preventive healthcare.
Yoga guarantees both fitness and health.
This has been the result of our efforts and today Yoga has become a mass movement and it has become a part of every household.
There are fewer than 100 days left for the upcoming International Day of Yoga on 21st June.
In the last three International Yoga Days, people have participated with great enthusiasm in the country and everywhere in the world.
We will also ensure this time that we will also inspire Yoga, Family and Friends.
This should be further popularised by adopting new interesting methods, including children, youth and senior citizens, among all age-olds.
Moreover, television and electronics from all over the country are offering various programmes related to Yoga throughout the year
But can we create awareness about Yoga as a movement from now onwards to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not an ascetic.
But some people have transformed me into a Yoga practitioner through their creation and have produced three-dimensional videos like Yoga.
Efforts are being made to ensure that healthcare is accessible to all and prices are cheaper and easier for goods.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country and more than 800 medicines have been received at affordable prices.
Moreover, new centres are being opened.
I would like to appeal to the people of Mann Ki Baat to bring information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras to the needy.
This will be a great service to them.
Heart stent prices for cardiovascular patients have been reduced to 85 percent.
Fees for knee transplant operations have also been fixed and reduced from 50 to 70.
Under Ayushman Bharat Swasthya Yojana, about 10 crore families, i. e.
The number of medical seats in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
New AIIMS will be opened in many states to provide better treatment and healthcare facilities to people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened in every 3 districts.
By 2025, the country has set a target to get rid of TB.
Today, Make in India and Make in India are working successfully in the country
On that day, Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt of India as an industrial power and his vision inspires all of us today.
Today, India is emerging as a bright spot in the world economy and FDI inflows into the world are coming to India.
Throughout the world, India is moving towards the centre of investment, innovation and development.
Baba Saheb had firm faith in self-sufficiency.
He did not want any man to spend his time in poverty.
Moreover, he did not think that their poverty would be averted if something was shared with the poor.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India initiatives, innovators and entrepreneurs from our younger generation have been created.
Today, a historic effort is being made to connect the waterways and ports of the country.
New ports are being developed on different coasts of India and infrastructure is being strengthened in old ports.
Most of the 40 debates meant the World War II, the emerging Cold War and the partition of the country.
During that period, Dr. Ambedkar, on the one hand, laid the foundation for Team India's spirit.
He spoke of the importance of federalism, and emphasized the need for the Union and State Governments to work together for the progress of the nation.
Today, we have acknowledged the mantra of Competitive Federalism - Competition sir Federalism - beyond cooperative federalism in all aspects of governance
The most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is a hymn for crores of people like me from the backward classes.
He has shown to all of us that there is no need to be born in a big family or in a Seeman family to move forward and the poor families born in India can dream, they can make full efforts to realise those dreams and they can succeed in that.
But the painting of New India is completely different.
I would like to appeal to you that you must participate in this movement with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, there are several festivals coming in the next few days like Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Anuman Jayanti, Easter and Paisaki.
It is a day to commemorate the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavira, his sacrifice and sacrifice.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavira, who gave us the message of non-violence, will inspire us.
Greetings to everyone on Mahavir Jayanti.
Whenever there is talk of Easter, Isunaths inspirational teachings will always be reminded of his message of human peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion.
Paisakhi Festival is being celebrated in Punjab and West India in April
On the same day, Jute Sheetal and Sathuvaain in Bihar, Bihu in Assam, Boila Bisa in West Bengal are celebrated with joy and monstery.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat February, 2018
Today, I will start my Mann Ki Baat with a telephone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions about science and some have written letters.
We all know very well that the color of the sea is blue but because of our daily experience there is no colour for water.
Have we ever thought, whether it be a river, or a sea, why are you colored
The same question arose in the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This was the question that created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about modern science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose was given to famous microscopes, which is known as Poson.
A few days ago, I had participated in the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence (WAI) in Mumbai.
It is very interesting to know about the miracles being done in the field of science.
This artificial intelligence provides an impetus to the creation of robots, b (B) and specific functioning machines.
Today, the machines are doing their intellectual work even more sharply through the machines.
Using this technology, we can make the lives of the poor and the poor better.
In this programme related to Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists to think about how this artificial intelligence can be helpful in making the lives of differently abled brothers and sisters easier.
Can artificial intelligence better understand the nature of disasters
Can we help farmers in their crops
Can this artificial intelligence facilitate access to healthcare services and help in detecting diseases through modern methods
A few days ago, I had accompanied the Israeli Prime Minister to launch the I Create Project in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young man who had developed a digital device
If those who cannot speak by writing what they think through this instrument, then that instrument turns it into a voice, it does as much as talking to one another.
I believe that in such a way we can use artificial intelligence.
Science and technology are neutral.
These have no self-esteem.
Any machine will work as we want.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered Light Pulpics, lost many of his experiments.
Once asked about this, he said, I have found ten thousand ways of how I cannot make a light bulb.
That is, Edison has changed his failures to his own.
Today, I am in Auroville, the glorious land of Maharishi Aurobindo, it is not only a coincidence but also an extremely important occasion for me.
As a revolutionary, he was a challenge to British imperialism, fighting against them, raising questions against their rule.
As a great rishi, he questioned every angle of life.
He discovered their answers and paved the way for humanity.
Knowing the truth, it is obvious that the sentiment of repeated questions is important.
This is also the genuine conception in the background of scientists' search.
Why, why shouldn't you live until such questions are known
I extend my best wishes to our scientists and all those associated with science on National Science Day.
Ravindra Singh from Pune has written about Occupational Safety in the NarendraModi App.
Defence standards in our country are not that good at factories and construction sites.
The Prime Minister in his Mann Ki Baat address on the occasion of National Safety Day on 4th March, 2019, has called upon the people to be aware of safety and security.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important - one being cautious and the other being ready.
Safety is of two types, one is important in times of disaster and the other is essential in day to day life.
If we are not aware of safety in our daily lives and are not safe then it is difficult to achieve this situation in times of disaster.
Across this, these words often have no use in our lives.
Most of the hazards are the result of our mistakes when we see natural calamities.
If we are awake, if we follow the necessary norms then we can save our lives and save our society from the greatest problems.
Sometimes we may have seen many words about security in our workplaces, but we must have seen that they are not following the correctness.
I urge those municipalities who have fire brigade to conduct mock exercises in schools once a week or once a month.
This country includes many natural calamities and disasters caused by the people associated with the chemical and industrial sector that we have experienced.
Today, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is leading the country on the issue of Disaster Management.
Self Help Groups (SHGs) have been trained and identified as hazards in flood prone districts.
Until 2-3 years ago, thousands of people were dying due to the heat wave.
Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) organised training workshops on securing the heat wave and organised a mass awareness campaign.
Everyone's contribution had a good effect.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat wave has decreased to nearly 220 from expected.
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can be safe.
We have to become a society with cautiousness against danger.
We have travelled several times and have given defence tips at the commencement of the airplane journey inside the aircraft.
Well, was there an information system
This is our experience in every sphere of life.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, emphasis has been laid on wealth from waste and energy production in villages through natural gas.
The initiative taken for this has been named as GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources i. e.
The Gobar-Dhan Action Plan aims at cleaning the villages, transforming livestock juices and farm crop residue into fertilizer and natural gas, thereby creating wealth and energy.
Some European countries and China use animal fodder and bio-waste to produce energy
But India is not fully functioning in this sector.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen Yojana, we are moving forward in this direction.
It has been decided to enhance the production of natural energy through animal waste, agricultural waste and kitchen waste.
Under the Gobar-Dhan scheme, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India should be encouraged and they should not only see waste and waste but also see them as a wealthy incentive.
There will be new employment opportunities in waste collection, transportation and natural gas sales.
An e-commerce platform will also be set up to implement the Gobar-Dhan scheme in a efficient manner, which will connect the farmers with the buyers and facilitate the right price for the farmers' crop residue.
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard about all kinds of festivals such as music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
But a special effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh - the first garbage festival of the state was organized here.
Inspired by Raipur, other districts also organized garbage festivals for their share.
Everyone shared innovative ideas on cleanliness in their angle, discussed, organised poems.
An atmosphere like a festival is centred on cleanliness.
Particularly the schoolchildren participated with great enthusiasm and this was a wonderful thing.
I extend my warm felicitations to the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, to the people of Chhattisgarh, to the government and government authorities there for the innovative process of waste management and sanitation.
Every year we celebrate 8th March as International Women's Day.
Several programmes are being organised in our country and around the world.
The Nari Shakti Puraskar is being conferred on the women who have done exemplary work in different disciplines in the past.
Today, the country is moving towards the direction of women-led advancement, beyond the status of women's progress.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's penance.
Today, it is our duty to ensure that the contribution of women in every field of socio-economic conditions is equal.
Today, our women power has shown self-confidence and self-confidence in its actions.
Wherever women are empowered and partners in all the development of the country, it is our dream of a New India.
In just 20 days from 26th January this year, these women have constructed 1 lakh seventy thousand toilets and set a precedent, including about one lakh women groups.
In the lives of the common man, women from Jharkhand have shown that women power has the potential to transform it into the nature of the masses by enhancing the cleanliness drive and cleanliness.
Brothers and sisters, I was aware of the fact that in the three villages of Elephanda Islands, how they were happy that we got electricity after 70 years of independence.
I was surprised to know that despite being such a very special tourist destination, it has not been there for so many years since independence even near Mumbai.
For 70 years, the three villages of the island of Elephanda - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Senthbandar - had departed from the lives of people immersed in darkness and became light.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and people there.
What else can be the time to make the lives of the country brighter and enjoy happiness in their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, just a few days ago we celebrated the Shivaratri festival.
In March, the Green boiling fields, the beauty of swimming crops, and the floriculture of the mind, are the specialties of this month itself.
At the same time, this month's Holi Pundicherry is also closer to all of us.
On 2nd March, the festival of Holi will be celebrated with great enthusiasm across the country.
The importance of the colours of the festival of Holi is so much more than that of Holica because this day we pour all the evils into the fire.
This is a remarkable time for forgetting all differences and taking part in the happiness of each other and forging unity and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Prakash Tripathi Ji has written a long letter in the Narendra Modi App and I urge you all to talk about all the things in it.
Kalpana Chawla ji passed away on 1st February.
Though they are not with us today due to the accident in Colombia space, they have inspired the youth around the world.
In this context, I express my gratitude to Prakash Ji for introducing his letter on the passing away of Kalpana Chawla ji.
It is a matter of great sorrow for all of us that we have lost Kalpana Chawla at such a young age. However, he has left the message that there is no limit to women power in the whole world, especially for thousands of women of India.
Today, it is a matter of great pleasure that women in India are progressing at a rapid pace in every field and are sustaining the pride of the nation.
Since ancient times, respect for women in our country, respect for them in the society and their contribution has made the entire world surprising.
This is an extension of the importance given to women in our society.
That's why they themselves have given the status of women power in our society
It reflects the wisdom, devotion, devotion of people like Lapamudra, Karki and Maitreyi, the scriptures of Aka Mahadevi and Meerabai, the governance system of Ahilyabai Holkar, the valour of Rani Lakshmibai, the strength of women has always inspired us and has brought pride to the values of the nation.
Prakash Tripathi ji has given many more examples.
Our Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman said that she was deeply impressed by the advent of Sukoi on 30th and the INSV TARINI team led by Vartika Joshi is on a world-class tour.
Bhavna Khand, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi are the three dreaded women fighters who are undergoing the training of Sukoy 30.
You're absolutely right.
Today, women are not only moving forward in all sectors but also leading them.
Today, for the first time in many fields, women power has been achieving and has been setting up a milestone.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed a new gathering in the past.
Our President met a group of extraordinary women who were the first to be achieved in their respective fields.
The women achievers of the country, the first female captain of the merchant vessels, the first female driver of the passenger train, the first female firefighter, the first female bus driver to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Antarctica, have made extraordinary achievements by breaking the conservative threads of our women and society.
They have demonstrated that with the help of hard work, zeal and responsibilities, all obstacles and difficulties can lead to a new path.
On this path, they are not only the people of their time but also the people of the future generations.
They have filled a new enthusiasm and a new inspiration.
A book has also been written about these women achievers and the first women who have come here to know about these women powers throughout the country and to get inspiration through their lives.
This book is available in the NarendraModi App today in the form of e-book.
Today, the great contribution of women's energy is reflected in the positive changes that are taking place in the country and the society.
Today, while we are talking about women empowerment, I would like to mention about a railway station.
You can imagine what could be the link between a railway station, womens empowerment.
All the employees and women at Mudunga Railway Station in Mumbai.
This time, after witnessing the Republic Festival Parade, a number of people on Twitter and other social networks are particularly concerned about the bicycle crew of Border Police Forces.
They understood adventurous things, and this marvellous surprisingly even the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-respect.
Today, our women power is leading.
It is becoming self-reliant.
The wonderful work done by our tribal women of Chattisgarh has given me a new example.
While talking about tribal women, there is a definite sight in everyone's minds, there are forests, roads and women carrying heavy weight on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chattisgarh have created a new vision before the country and our women power.
The Dundewada area of Chattisgarh was hit by Maoist extremists.
The Maoists, including violence, repression, bombs, guns and bullets, have created a terrible atmosphere here.
Tribal women are becoming self-sufficient and self-sufficient in such a terrible environment.
It is also being strengthened in terms of environmental protection.
I also compliment the government administration of this place that they have made a significant contribution in the backdrop of the success of these women, from providing financial assistance and training.
The abandonment of the prosecuted and the changes that are required.
Over the centuries, there have been individual and social efforts in the country against social degradation and degradation.
A few days ago, a tasty process was undertaken in Bihar.
A human chain of over 13,000 kms was organized in Bihar to root out social evils.
The movement inspired awareness against evils such as child marriage and dowry atrocities.
The people of the state resolved to fight against the atrocities of dowry and child marriage.
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and motivated youth, mothers and sisters, all came forward and joined themselves in this movement.
From the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna to the border of the state, this human chain has gone a long way without lodging.
If the people of all sections of the society get the benefits of real progress then our society should get rid of these evils.
Together we will make such evils disappear from the society.
Let us build a New India, a strong and powerful India.
Over the past few years, people have been writing and telling me about this thing.
I have also seen a lot of videos and social media about the beneficiaries of this scheme.
I am convinced that he had got the darshan and he had got the idea of getting it for others.
The objective behind the scheme is to make healthcare easier and ease of living.
Pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals etc.
In this, the use of medicines for the common man, especially the daily use of medicines, provide economic benefits to senior citizens, thereby increasing savings.
The generic medicines that are being purchased here, that is, similar medicines are in accordance with WHO standards.
This is why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today, the central government has established more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras across the country.
Through this, medicines are available at affordable prices and entrepreneurship has created new opportunities for employment for individuals.
Affordable medicines, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana, are available in Amru shops of hospitals.
The only aim behind all these is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country so that we can build a healthy, prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Mangesh ji from Maharashtra is sharing a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That photo attracted me very much.
One of them, along with his grandfather, participated in the 'Clean the Morana River' movement.
Citizens of Akola carried out the cleaning of the Morna River in connection with this Swachh Bharat Mission.
Though the Morna river has been a river flowing for 12 months, it has now become a climate.
There is another sad thing here that the river is full of turtles and water turtles.
I was told that this cleanliness drive was launched on 20th January, 2018 and this movement will continue every Saturday morning till the river Morna was completely cleaned.
This shows that there is nothing that cannot be achieved if one decides to strive.
Peoples movement can also bring about big changes.
I congratulate the people of Akola, its district and municipal administration, all the citizens who have participated in the Jan Andolan and my heartfelt congratulations for these efforts.
My dear countrymen, the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the Padma Awards today.
Newspapers and television are attracted to it.
But it is a matter of great pride for you to see that we have great pride in ourselves and we have no recognition and awards.
Now it is not necessary that a person should be popular to be honoured, but his actions are identified as his own.
He has been manufacturing sports goods from waste for 40 years, thereby providing scientific temper to children.
He has been trying to make scientific experiments with useless products
For this, he has gone to 3000 schools across the country and has been screening and encouraging 18-language video films.
Look at what a wonderful life, great dedication
The life of Sitava couple of Karnataka is similar.
There is no point in calling him Devi who empowered women.
He from Belgaum has contributed immensely in transforming the lives of countless women over the last 30 years.
From the age of seven, he dedicated himself as a god and spent all his life in the interests of the gods.
Not only this, he has also worked in an unprecedented manner for the welfare of the underprivileged women.
You might have heard about Bajju Shyam from Madhya Pradesh, who was born in a very poor tribal family.
Though he was doing simple work for his life, he had a terrible country on traditional tribal painting.
This is the reason why he is respected not only in India but all over the world.
His paintings have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, UK and Italy.
The Padma Shri award has been conferred on him, when his talent was recognised by Bajju Shyam, who has renowned India abroad.
The life of the tribal lady Lakshmikutty of Kerala can be a wonder to you.
Laxmikutty works as a teacher in the Kalar area, and even today he lives in dense forests and tribal settlements in a slum dressed by palms.
He has mastered the production of medicines to be used after snake bites.
Lakshmi Ji continues to serve society through her herbal medical knowledge.
He has been recognized and has been awarded the Padma Shri award for his contribution to society.
Today, I would like to mention one more thing that the 75-year-old Subhasini Mistri ji of West Bengal has been selected for the award.
Subashini Mistri ji washed utensils in many households to build a hospital and sold vegetables.
Today, the hospital produced by his hard work is providing free treatment to thousands of poor people.
Sometimes even in schools and colleges, such people should be invited and shared their experiences.
The society has to make some effort beyond all the awards.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate the festival of NRIs.
It was on the same day that Gandhiji returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the inseparable bond between India and Indians all over the world.
This year we had organised an event for the NRIs, in which MPs and mayors from all over the world residing in India were also invited.
In Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States, wherever there are mayors and parliamentarians, all of them participated.
Some of them have been branded in many fields such as cyber security, Ayurveda, music, poetry, research on climate change, Indian literature and are making a mark for themselves.
Some people are drunk drivers, some have built gurudwaras, some have built mosques, that is, wherever our people are, somehow or the other, they have brought about some kind of deterioration.
I express my gratitude to the EU members for recognising the excellent work done by NRIs and for their remarkable work to reach out to people across the globe.
Even in today's era, we are seeing at every stage how true the teachings of the mother are.
If we decide to go with our brother, what can we pay more tribute to him than this
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you for the year 2018 and get the answer from you.
Throughout the year, we have shared many things.
The exchange of letters, ideas and ideas for Mann Ki Baat has always been giving me a new energy.
After a few hours, the year will change, but our shareholding will continue as usual.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
Many congratulations to you all for the year 2018.
Just a few days ago, on December 25, people from all over the world celebrated Christmas as a festival.
We can also see the essence of the spirit of service.
This shows us the importance of service-manship.
In our country, we talk about the unprotected activity of fire, that is, there will be no expectation of reflection in such activity.
Seva Paramo uality i. e.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji's courage and sacrifice is a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji gave the teachings of great values of life and values and he lived all his life on the basis of those values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, did the work of inspiring people through all these contributions.
He waged a war against repression and injustice.
In this struggle, he lost many things in personal life.
But he never gave up his mind for disappointment.
Every moment of his life he gave the message of love, sacrifice and peace.
Have you seen such an immensely special characteristic
I got the opportunity to participate in the 350th Birth Anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji in Patna Sahib earlier this year.
Come, let us all learn from the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji, from his passionate life and strive to improve our lives.
Those who were born in the year 2000 or after that i. e.
In the democratic system of India, I welcome the voters of the 21st century and the voters of New India.
I convey my best wishes to these youngsters and I urge you all to go and register yourselves as voters.
Throughout India, as voters of the 21st century, they stand for you.
The vote is a major impact instrument to bring about a positive change in the lives of millions.
You will not be empowered to vote.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk about our glorious young society, which is 18-25 years old, which is full of dedication and strength.
I consider them NEW INDIA YOUTH, the youth of a New India, the youth of a New India, the youth of a New India, the youth, the youth, the energy and the energy of a New India.
I am confident that our dream of a New India will be realized by the talent and capabilities of our brave youngsters.
When we talk about a New India, then a New India should be free from the feeling of casteism, religiousism, extremism and corruption.
There must be filth and poverty.
There should be equal opportunities for all in New India and the aspirations and aspirations of all should be fulfilled.
Peace, unity and harmony in New India should be our guiding forces.
My young Indians, come forward and explore how to build a New India.
Young people between the ages of 18 and 25 can sit together to exchange ideas and find ways and plans for a New India.
How can we think of fulfilling our resolutions before 2022
Can we think of building the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters
Gandhiji transformed the freedom struggle into a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement to create a greater India of the 21st century and this is a peoples movement for progress.
How to achieve success through devotion
Today, a lot of new opportunities are being created before the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and also witnessing success.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had spoken about the importance of positivity and constructive thinking.
There is a case in English - Pessimism leads to weekness, optimism to power.
Share the positive moments of 2017 and we will welcome the year 2018 in a constructive atmosphere.
I am glad that a large number of people have given positive answers and shared positive responses on social media platforms, MyGov website and the Narendra Modi App.
Positive India hashtag has also made lakhs of devolutions, which has gone up to more than 150 crore people.
In a way, this spread of honesty has spread across the world from India to India.
The incoming tweets and answers are truly concentrated.
It was a pleasant experience for me.
Some of the countrymen have mentioned the events that took place this year, which had a positive impact on their minds.
Some are sharing their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live on Face One from Maurvihar, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
She wanted to read.
I needed loans for this thing, I got it very easily and my daughters were able to continue their studies.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I'm staying in a boat.
My husband had made an accident complaint of paying one rupee per month.
Unfortunately, he lost his life.
We knew the worst situation we had at that time.
We got immense benefits because of the help of the government and we were able to take a little care of it.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
Our BHINNAR was constructed through BHINAR village from 2017 onwards.
Because of this, our roads have become very good and our business has started to grow.
My name is Deepansu Ahuja, and I live in Saddakanj in Shaharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish.
We have been dependent on the pipeline of the army for the past 40 years as there is water shortage in our area.
Now a water pipe is being constructed for us alone.
This is our biggest achievement in 2017.
There has been a positive change in the lives of a large number of people because of the many things that they have done at their own levels.
Indeed, this is the New India and this is what we are building together.
Come, with these little joys, let us come to New Year, let us begin a new year, let us take a solemn step from Positive India to Progressive India - from a creative India to a vibrant India.
When we all talk about creative ideas, I also feel like sharing one thing.
I have heard about the story of Anjum Bashir Khan Katak, who has been specially trained in the State Civil Services Examinations of Kashmir.
He has emerged from the hostages of terrorism and defence and has been a distinguished leader in the state of Kashmir.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990 terrorists had burnt his old house.
While extremism and violence were over, his family was forced to leave their forefathers.
He has not forgotten his confidence.
He had laid a path for himself - it was the path of serving people.
He emerged beyond adverse circumstances and made his own story of success.
Today, he is an inspiration for not only Jammu and Kashmir but also for all of India.
Whatever the situation may be, the agency has demonstrated that it can dissolve and dissolve the disappointing clouds through constructive actions.
Last week we had the opportunity to meet some women from Jammu and Kashmir.
The moments that I spent with those women inspired me: this is the strength of the country, these are my youthful wealth, these are the future of my country.
Every year millions of devotees visit this temple, which is world famous, to receive the blessings of Iyappan.
But the Sabarimala temple is an example of how to convert cleanliness into a culture, how to find a way to solve the problem and how to make people's participation powerful.
B.
Vijayan, a police officer, launched an Action Plan called Punnyam Garden Van, under which Swachhta Awareness Campaign was launched.
This Punnyam Van Dhan Yojana, which has progressed so much in Sabarimala, has become a part of the journey of every traveler.
There, along with hardships, the resolution of cleanliness is also accompanied.
My dear countrymen, on the 2nd of October 2014, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, we all took a resolution and the unfinished task of our elder brothers is a Swachh Bharat, a Mass- Free India.
He spent his entire life in this work and tried his best.
On 150th Birth Anniversary, we had decided to dedicate to him the India of his dreams, the Swachh Bharat, and to contribute in that direction.
Efforts are being made in a big way across the country towards cleanliness.
Transformation is taking place in rural and urban areas in a wide range of ways with people-to-people support.
To measure the quality of cleanliness achieved in urban areas, the worlds largest survey titled Swachh Survekshan 2018 is scheduled to be conducted from 4th to 10th January, 2018.
This survey will cover over 40 crore people in more than 4000 cities.
The Survey envisages that peoples participation in this work will be authentic in terms of Open Defecation Free (ODF) in cities, waste collection, waste carriage system, processing of scientific wastes, capacity building and innovative drives for cleanliness.
According to the analysis, different groups will go to cities to conduct research.
They will get answers from the citizens by talking to them.
They will examine the use of the Swachh App and the development of various service centres.
It will also be taken into consideration whether all the organisations have been set up by the cities to make the cleanliness of the city a habit of the people.
Cleanliness should not be implemented by the government alone.
Every citizen and civil society has a big role in this thing.
On the basis of this survey, if the quality of the cities is determined, if the population in your city is more than one lakh, if there is a national level and if there is less than one lakh population then it will be given a regional level.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, through this programme, I want to share one thing with you.
I was reminded that if an Islamic woman wants to undertake Haj pilgrimage then she cannot go without 'Mahram' or her male guardian.
When I first heard about this, how can this be so
Why did this discrimination emerge
Over the years, injustice has been committed to Islamic women, but there has been no discussion.
Such a rule does not exist in many Islamic countries.
But India's Islamic women have been denied this right.
I am glad that our government has focused on it.
Our Minority Affairs Ministry has taken necessary steps and ended the tradition that lasted for 70 years and removed this restriction.
Today, I am glad that Islamic women can go to Haj without a male guardian named 'Maharam' and this time 1300 Islamic women have applied for Haj without male guardians and women from different parts of the country have expressed interest in Haj pilgrimage.
The Ministry of Minority Affairs has been instructed to ensure that all the women who have applied for such a separate journey are allowed to go for Haj pilgrimage.
I firmly believe that India's development journey is progressing through the strength of our women power and their intellectual power, and further progress is going to take place.
Our sustained efforts must be made to ensure that the rights and opportunities of men are closer to women, and they will progress on the path of development equivalent to the men.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic day for all of us.
However, the upcoming January, 2018 will be specially remembered on 26th January.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, will also be the Chief Guest of the 10 ASEAN-based ASEAN Heads of State for the Republic Day Celebrations this year.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering on the occasion of the occasion.
This has never happened in the history of India.
In 2017, ASEAN and India were special.
ASEAN concluded its 50-year term and in 2017, Indias partnership with ASEAN reached 25 years.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us that on 26th January, these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will be present here.
Very rarely there will be no festival on a day or so.
Now all of us have celebrated the Christmas festival and the next year is going to be the New Year.
May the coming New Year bring immense joy, pleasure and fulfilment to all.
Let us all move ahead with a new zeal, enthusiasm, new zeal and new resolve and make the nation prosperous.
Makar Sankranti will be celebrated this month on the occasion of sunrise in January.
This is the time associated with nature.
In fact, every festival of ours is somehow connected with nature but in our diverse culture, it is a habit of celebrating this unique event of nature in different ways.
If the pleasure of Lohri is rising in Punjab and Northern states, it is expected that there will be Kutchti and Til Sangranti in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Sankranth in Rajasthan, Mag-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu all these have their own specialty and have a unique significance for this.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13th and 17th January.
Though these are nominally different, their underlying philosophy is something that is linked to nature and agriculture.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my countrymen on these festivals.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you, my dear countrymen.
We will meet again in 2018.
Mann Ki Baat September 2019
There is no doubt that there will be an Indian citizen who does not respect him or who does not respect him.
He was older than all of us and was a witness at different stages of the country and at different times.
Not only the people of our new generation, this is a great learning experience for all of us, you are a great conscience for all of us, even after you have achieved so many achievements in your life, you have always been the primacy of your parents and your devotional conduct.
I've got a lot of this feeling.
I really don't want to give you any trouble.
Because I know how clever you are, I do see how much work you have.
Moti ji: yeah.
Moti ji: Because of your love, we are very happy.
Moti ji said, I have been grateful to myself for your continued observation on me.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all on my beloved birthday.
Modi ji: This time when I came to Mumbai, I thought of talking to you.
We will celebrate Navratri Mahotsav, Karba, Durga Pooja, Dasra, Deepawali, Baiya Duj, Shadpuja innumerable festivals.
In many cities, start-ups of many NGOs and youth are engaged in this work.
They integrate all the sweets, sweets and food items in the houses of the people and collect them in search of the needy. They do this without any publicity.
Should we drive away the darkness in this season of festivals with full awareness and devotion
The smile on the faces of many poor families will double your joy in festivals, your face will become brighter, your light will be still brighter and your light will be even more brighter.
My dear brothers and sisters, on the occasion of Deepawali, the shrines are welcomed at home in a way to provide a lot of comfort and a complete life.
We welcome Thiruvananthapuram traditionally.
Would we welcome Thiruvananthapuram in a new way this time
In our culture, we bow down to women in the form of shrines because women are considered to be beneficial and fulfilling.
Can we organise programmes this time in our society, in our villages, in cities and in our cities to honour women
A lot of achievements can be made by organising public events and by working hard and endeavouring women will be amongst us, in our families, in our society, in the country.
Can we organise programmes to honour and honour these shrines of India on this Diwali
Women who have done extraordinary work may be amongst us.
Some people might have tried to create awareness about cleanliness and health, some might have been engaged in some social service such as doctors, engineers, educating poor children.
Prosecutors may have been trying to fight for justice.
Our society should identify such women and take pride in them.
Just as we have driven the movement of a selfie with our daughters all over the world, similarly, we will speed up the movement called Bharatki Laxmi.
Encouraging the people of India means ensuring a complete life of the country and the people.
My dear countrymen, I had mentioned about Mann Ki Baat earlier that I got the opportunity to interact with a lot of people who are not familiar with this thing.
Over the past days, Alina Tayang, a student from remote Arunachal Pradesh, wrote an interesting letter to me.
I belonged to Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time, when my election results came, some people asked me if you were reading the book by the Exam Board.
I said I didn't read that book.
But after returning home, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times.
After that, my experience was very sweet.
My boys and girls, thanks for writing the letter.
And I thank you very much for telling me the grievances thereon while studying.
I will obey your commandment.
What is your experience in your daily life
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend and student Alina Thaing from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you would be aware of the uninterrupted events of the Prime Minister of India through the medium of newspapers and TV, and you are discussing about the absence of retirement.
This time, Medvedei's speech, which was the second in the final race as much as he had spoken about the victory in the US Open race, was also a few words.
I also listened to the speeches that are being spoken on social media and then I watched the dance.
For 23 years, Medvedev's simplicity and talent were comfortable with everyone.
He would have been sad and disappointed if someone else had been at this time, but he did not have any balls on his face, but through his words he made smiles in everybody's thoughts and customs.
His speech was welcomed by a large number of visitors.
In one skirmish, the zeal of the lord and the interest of the victorious man made a heart-threatening impression.
If you say that you have not heard of Dan Medvett's speech so far, I especially appeal to the youth, please go and listen.
There are a lot of things to learn from all sides and from all age groups.
These moments are beyond the failure of success and there is no point in the failure of success.
Life succeeds and our scriptures tell us this thing in a very special way.
The thoughts of our ancestors are really surprising.
Mani Kanchana Samyoga: Janayathi Loksya Losan Anand. I mean, if an individual gets eligible and work together, he cannot win the heart of anybody
In fact, this young sportsperson has won all the hearts of the world.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I am going to say this thing for your direct benefit.
But if we prevent them from awakening in the beginning, it can be very safe.
I want to bear this feeling in mind and especially to the younger community.
You all know that tobacco addiction is extremely harmful to the health and it becomes very difficult to eradicate that habit.
Tobacco users are more likely to suffer from diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure.
It affects the growth of brain more by its practice in childhood .
But today, I have come here to share a new topic with you.
You know, now there is a ban on e-cigarettes in India.
E-cigarette is a kind of electronic device that is different from ordinary cigarette.
A kind of chemical smoke is generated by smoking the liquid substances of nicotine in the e cigarette, through which nicotine is consumed.
We all are well aware of the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but the misinterpretation of E cigarettes has been widespread.
That means there is no danger to this E cigarette.
Like other cigarettes, it should not have foul smell, so they mix a fragrant virgin in it.
If a father smokes in a house, we may have seen in our neighborhood that he will drive others in the house to smoke. He wants his children not to get used to smoking like himself.
His efforts will be to ensure that nobody in the family smokes.
He is aware of the harm caused to the body by smoking and tobacco use.
Anyone who smokes knowingly smokes is well aware of this.
But this is not the case with e cigarettes.
There is no such awareness about E cigarettes.
They are unaware of its risks, so sometimes the e-cigarette quietly enters the house.
In fact, E cigarettes have mixed a number of harmful varieties, which would have a bad effect on the health.
If someone in the neighborhood smokes, its smell will betray us.
The dreams of every family should not be trampled on their feet.
Leave the habit of smoking and do not take any wrong thoughts related to e-cigarette in mind.
Come, let us together create a healthy India.
Yeah, you don't remember Fit India.
Fit India means that it is not enough to go to Jim for two hours in the morning.
It is also important to get rid of these things.
I believe that you will not feel bitter what I say and it will definitely happen to you.
They did not live for themselves, but dedicated themselves to others.
Such a gentleman is to be honoured in the city of Vedican on October 13.
Sister Mary Tresia, on her 50-year-old low life, has been an example for the entire world in the interests of humanity.
He had a great deal of involvement in the field of social service and education.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world today that while we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji, 130 crore countrymen are committed to liberating themselves from the evils of evil.
In the direction of environment protection, India is leading the world in a way and today the vision of all the countries is based on India.
I am fully confident that all of you will participate in the one-time evacuation campaign on 2nd October.
In many places, people are contributing to this movement in their own ways.
But the youth of our country is running a very important movement.
When I was concerned about his work, I phoned him and tried to find out about his new test.
For the first time when I heard this thing about plogging, it was new to me.
Perhaps this word may be of great use in foreign countries.
Hello Ribudhaman, Namaskar, I speak to Narendra Modi.
My best wishes to you all.
If 130 crore Indians have taken a step in this direction then India will move forward with 130 crore steps towards getting rid of single use eggs.
My dear brothers and sisters, once again, thank you for my strength.
Congratulations from my side for yourselves and your group and for such a new idea.
Tengue.
My dear countrymen, the country and the world are working on the 2nd of October, but we want to move on the path of Gandhijis 150th.
We want to bring about a change in the mindset of the country in our lives.
I would like to remind you of something beforehand.
If I talk about it in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, why don't I say this thing a little earlier today, will you also have the opportunity to prepare for it
You will remember that on 31st October, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel ji was born.
Thousands of people in all schools and colleges, children and adults, we must drive for unity in lakhs of villages of India that day.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August I had spoken from the ramparts of Red Fort and I had requested you to visit some 15 places in India by 2022.
At least 15 places, if possible one or the other, will have to set up programmes to stay there.
Once again I urge you people to visit some 15 places in India, please visit some of the 15 places in India as holidays come on the occasion of Deepawali.
And all this has happened only because of your cooperation, especially because we understand the importance of tourism.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you all for the various festivals in a diverse India.
Just a few days back, I got the opportunity to interact with young friends from Karnataka.
The Times team's newspaper Vijay Karnataka published a paper on the children in which they asked the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
In that journal, they published some selected letters.
When I read those letters, they were good for me.
Keerthi Hecta from Northern Karnataka appreciated the Digital India and Smart City programme, while addressing the necessity of transforming our education system, the Prime Minister said that in today's era, children do not have a country on classroom studies and they are keen to know about nature.
If we give information about nature to the children then they will be a great supporter of natural security in the future.
Reeda Nataf, a child from Lakshameshwara, has written that she is the daughter of a soldier, who is proud of her.
If you are the daughter of a soldier, it is not surprising that you will have pride in yourself.
My countrymen, I am glad that a newspaper has taken this kind of initiative and I have got the opportunity to read these letters.
For me, this was a wonderful experience.
My dear countrymen, today 2611.
Our Constitution Day is 26th November.
In 1949, on this day, the Constitution of India was adopted in the Constituent Assembly.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the day we recall the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They have been working hard for three years to wipe out the Constitution of India.
Those who read these discussions are well aware of their dedication to the nation in those discussions.
Do you know how hard they will work for a diverse nation to pass a Constitution
And when the land was freed from slavery, with understanding and vision, they did it.
It is the duty of all of us to build a New India by keeping in mind the clear thoughts of those who have provided the Constitution with the light of this Constitution.
Our Constitution is very vast.
There is no element of life that has not been found in it, and there is no matter of nature.
It is the duty of all of us to pursue it without even a single letter of the Constitution.
Be it citizens or rulers, we must move forward by understanding the spirit of the Constitution.
The objective of the Constitution is to ensure that no one has any role to play.
Today, on the day of the Constitution, it is natural to recall Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Seventeen different groups were formed to discuss the important issues of the Constituent Assembly.
The draft committee is one of the most important groups.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution.
He was enjoying an important role.
Today, we are experiencing the pride of providing the Constitution of India and in the formation of this thing an unnatural stamp of the leadership of Babasaheb Ambedkar ji has been laid.
He ensured that the interests of all sections of society are attained.
On the 6th of December, we will remember and pay homage to him as usual, on his death anniversary.
Remember also the role of Babasaheb in making the land self-sufficient and mighty.
On December 15th, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji was immortal.
Aitiya Sardar Patel ji had done an extraordinary work to make the nation an extraordinary worker from being a son of a farmer to an iron man.
Sardar ji was also a member of the Constitution.
He was a member of the Advisory Council of Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Scheduled Tribes.
Though 2611 is our Constitution Day, how can this country forget 2611 that happened 9 years ago
The nation remembers and pays homage to the brave citizens, the police, the security forces and the survivors.
This land shall not forget their sacrifice for ever.
Terrorism is spread all over the world today, an event is happening every day and it is happening in a terrible form.
We have been suffering from extremism for the past 40 years.
Our innocent people have lost thousands of lives.
But a few years ago, when India talked about terrorism in the global arena, when it was a reflection of terrorism, many people in the world did not take it seriously, but today when terrorism touches the doorsteps of the country, the world governments see terrorism as a big challenge.
This is aimed at destroying humanitarian forces.
Therefore, not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world must unite and defeat terrorism.
This is the land of birth of Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Gandhi Ji, this land has given the world the glory and love of this soil.
Terrorism and terrorism are engaged in a terrible effort to weaken and minimize our society.
Therefore, it is the need of the hour to be conscious of humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, we all are going to celebrate Navy Day on 4th December.
The Indian Navy is protecting our coasts.
I convey my best wishes to all those associated with the Navy.
You all are aware that our culture has emerged on the banks of the river.
Whether it is the River Sindhu, the River Ganga or the Yamunotri or the Saraswati - our rivers, the sea, the economy and the war are important in both respects.
This is our gateway to the entire world.
Their navy contributed to the expansion of the Chalukya empire, making it economically superior.
The naval invasions of the Chaldeans and many examples of analysis are still present in the literature of the Union.
Most of the world's navy had allowed women in war operations only a long time ago.
But about 800-900 years ago, a large number of women have played an important role in the navy of Chaldeans.
Women were also involved in war.
The shipbuilding technologies were intelligent with the Church regime.
When we talk about the navy, can't we talk about the openness of President Sivaji Maharaj and his navy
Sivaji Maharaj ji was dominated by the sea shores of Kong.
Several forts associated with the empire of Sivaji Maharaj, Sindhu Durga, Murud Janjeera, Swarna Durga etc. were situated on the seashore or were encircled by the sea.
The Maratha army is responsible for the security of these forts.
Large ships and small ships were mixed in the Maratha navy.
His navy was capable of attacking or defending any opponent.
Can't you talk about the Marathi navy and talk about Kanoji Angre
He brought the Maratian navy to a new height, setting up Maratha naval bases in many places.
Sumitra immediately engaged in rescue operations, saved many fishermen from drowning and handed them over to Bangladesh.
During the floods in Sri Lanka in May this year, three vessels of our naval force immediately reached there and exhorted the government and the people of that country.
In June, when the Papua New Guinea government sent an urgent help to us, our navy helped protect the fishermen from their fishing boats.
Our navy has always been proud of the country for bringing medical aid to Fiji and for providing immediate relief and humanitarian assistance in times of distress to the neighbouring countries.
We Indians have always brought respect and pride to our security forces, be it the ground, our navy or the air force, the courage, courage, courage, sacrifice and sacrifice of our soldiers, to every citizen.
The 125 crore Indians live a peaceful life because of the soldiers who sacrificed their youth for the country.
Every year on December 7, we observe the Flag Day of the Armed Forces.
Throughout this week, they will lay the flag on everyone as small and big.
A campaign to evaluate the soldiers in the country will be launched.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flags of our soldiers.
The fund is being spent on the welfare and rehabilitation of the families of the martyrs and the injured through the welfare of the soldiers.
You will be keen to know about a variety of ways of economic partnership.
Come, let us leverage this opportunity to work towards enhancing the morale of our soldiers.
We will also contribute to their well-being.
My dear countrymen, the 5th of December is World Soil Health Day.
I want to tell some things to our farmer brothers and sisters.
All the food we eat is linked to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is associated with the soil.
Just imagine, what if this rich soil is not available in this world to produce.
Tree plants will not grow, how can human life be possible
How do microorganisms emerge
The peasants of this country are giving a lot of importance to the two things of devotion to soil and its preservation scientifically.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions while they are immensely inclined towards modern science, they try and are confident.
When I visited the Marunj area of Dohu village in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, I heard about the farmers there.
The farmers here have used chemical fertilizers in the past and the soil was damaged.
As the collection was declining, the income was declining and gradually the productivity of the soil was declining.
In 2016-17, the yield of winter crops increased by 3-4 times in each acre and the income from each acre increased by 4-6 thousand rupees.
Moreover, the quality of soil was also improved.
Due to lack of fertilizer consumption, there was economic savings.
It gave me a lot of pleasure, my farmer brothers and sisters have come forward to implement the suggestions given to them in the Soil Health Card.
If we have to pay attention to the treasury, first we have to take care of the geography and if we take care of the geography then this land will take care of ourselves.
Our farmers across the country have more than 10 crore soil health cards so that they can properly understand their land and sow them.
We bow down to Earth, but have we ever imagined the impact of fertilizers like urea on her
It has been proved in all kinds of scientific methods that the impact of urea on Earth is severe.
When a farmer becomes a landlord, how can he bear with tolerance when he falls sick
The need of the hour is to revive this mother-father relationship once again.
Can we assure that our farmers, the sons of our land, the sons of our soil will be able to reduce the urea used by them by half when it will be 75 years after independence by 2022
We all have started enjoying global warming and climate change.
There was a time when cold poetry started before Diwali.
But even in such circumstances, there are some examples of the consequences that have always been awakened.
Dushar, an 8-year-old disabled person from Madhya Pradesh, has tried to keep his villagers open defecation free.
This 8-year-old boy can't speak, but he took his arms to steal.
He woke up at 5:00 a.m. and went home to his village and stamped them and created awareness through signs that he should not defecate in the open.
Because of this child who went to 30-40 houses every day and taught about cleanliness, the village of Kumhari was freed from the practice of toilets in the open.
This young man is engaged in the task of giving a boost to cleanliness.
This shows that there is no age for me, no limit for cleanliness.
Cleanliness is essential for everyone, whether it is small or large, whether it is women or men, everyone needs to contribute to cleanliness.
You must be aware that our disabled sportspersons have won 4 medals at the Rio Olympics and have become a competitor for the blind and the T20 World Cricket Championships.
Various competitions are going on across the country.
Over the past, 17th National Paralysis Competition was organised in Udaipur.
Our young brothers and sisters with disabilities from different parts of the country took part in this and showcased their skills.
One of them is the 19-year-old Jigar Taker of Gujarat, who does not have muscles in 80 percent of his body, but look at his adventure, his mind and hard work.
As a result of this talent, he will now be trained at the Centre of Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat as one of the 32 Para Swimmers selected for 20-20 Paralympics by the Sports Commission of India.
I salute the young Jigar Ducker and extend my warm greetings.
Today, special attention is being paid to the accessibility and opportunities for the Persons with Disabilities.
A few days later, Eid-e-Milat-Un-Nabi will be celebrated.
This is the day when the Ambassador Hazrat Mohammed Sahib was born.
(Conversation Call) Prime Minister, I am Neerja Singh from Kanpur.
I would like to request you all to share with us ten of the best things that you have spoken in Mann Ki Baat throughout this year.
Whether there be elders in our villages, or not, they always forget the sorrow, and do not forget the comfort.
We look at the past, we look at the concepts over the years, we look at the results and we plan for the next year.
We are once again trying to remind the media of the interesting events of the past year.
This includes a constructive thing and a negative thing.
But in the year 2018, when we will take our feet, we will not only remember the good things, we will not remember them.
I would like to suggest to all of you - if you share 5-10 positive things that you have heard, experienced and experienced then you will not feel good.
Can you contribute to this
Can we share five positive experiences in our lives this time
We invite all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a comfortable environment with good memories.
We will recall the events that inspire others.
We will remind ourselves of good things and create a better environment.
Good things provide the necessary strength to do good.
We will unite with us the strength of this joint drive and its impact.
In my next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will surely engage in an effort to bring the things that have come to your Positive India to the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, next month, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I will again come amongst you.
There will be an opportunity to exchange a number of things.
Sat Puja, a sacred day after the completion of Deepawali, is one of the festivals celebrated with many appointments and regulations.
Traditional appointments are being conducted in every case of what should be eaten and what should be worn.
The significance of cleanliness in our lives is also bound up in this festival.
The entire house is cleaned before the worship of the Sadhu Puja, as well as all of them participate in the cleanliness drive of rivers, lakes, ponds, worship places and holy places.
Sun worship or sat-pooja is a celebration of preservation of environment, prevention and regulation.
The feeling of destruction of human beings lies in the background of this tradition of renunciation, which can be a major obstacle in the path of progress.
It is a matter of pride that all of us are proud of this great heritage of India.
My dear countrymen, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is commendable and critical.
Let us take the example of dresses and handlooms.
Asked how much sales have been made in a shop, one feels happy and cheerful.
Approximately 680 growth has been registered in the Gadi Prize sales on Deepawali.
There is an increase of nearly 90 of the total sales of Gaddi and Handicrafts.
This shows that today the youth, the elderly, the women and all the elderly are wearing garments and dresses.
I can imagine how much it will benefit the wealthy families, the poor families and the families of the handloom workers.
You must share my experience of Diwali among the security forces and tell me how they celebrate the festival of Deepawali.
You must have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
For me, this time too, Deepawali has brought great experience.
Once again, we had the privilege of celebrating Diwali with our fearless security forces on the border.
This time it was an unforgettable experience to have Deepawali with the security forces located in the Gurez area of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces are protecting the country by facing so many difficult and difficult situations on the borders and I salute all the security forces from all the people of our country for their struggle, dedication and sacrifice.
Whenever we get an opportunity, we must know the experiences of our security forces, and listen to their adventures.
Many of us are unaware that our security forces are engaged in several important tasks not only in our borders but also in maintaining peace throughout the world.
As a peacekeeper, they are making India proud all over the world.
For us, we are going to follow the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam i. e.
India has always been pushing for women's equality.
Obviously, it can be seen as a small change in the paralysis, but it shows a tendency.
As far as it is concerned, Indias biggest contribution is concerned, it is the IISc.
India has always played a constructive role in UN peacekeeping operations.
Until August 2017, Indian soldiers have served in about 50 operations worldwide in 71 peacekeeping operations.
These activities have taken place in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan in all parts of the world.
In Congo and South Sudan, India's military has provided treatment to more than 20000 patients through medical services.
Only a few people would know that India was the first country to send the First Lady Guard Corps to Liberia through the United Nations Peacekeeping Movement.
This activity of India is a compassionate thing for all the countries of the world.
Since then, all countries have started sending their women's police units.
It is a matter of great pride for everyone that Indias contribution is not only on peacekeeping activity but also on training those who are engaged in the peacekeeping work of nearly 85 countries.
Our freedom fighters from this land of Gandhiji and Gautam Buddha have brought the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peacekeeping activities are not an easy task.
Our security forces have to go to difficult places.
I live in different peoples.
We have to understand a variety of circumstances and different cultures.
We have to change ourselves in accordance with regional requirements and environment.
When you look at him, the feelings of all the people of the country are very proud of him and Paramveer Chakra was the only Indian awardee.
In 1989, he was appointed Force Commander for Operations in Namibia, 72, and dedicated his services to ensuring Namibia's independence.
India has always been the ambassador of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name 'Nivedita'.
Nivedita means a fully dedicated person.
In the following period, he dedicated himself to his name.
Yesterday is the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
He was inspired by Swami Vivekananda and dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was mentally affected by the injustice done by the British rule.
The British did not only slave our country but they were trying to keep us mentally slaves.
The work of bringing a sense of humiliation in our minds continues to be degraded by our culture.
Sister Nivedita re-established the honour of Indias culture.
He raised the nation's awareness and worked towards bringing people together.
He went to various countries of the world and raised his voice against the wrong propaganda of Sanatan Dharma and Philosophy.
In a revolutionary poem titled 'Subramania Bharathi Innovation Woman', a renowned nationalist and Tamil poet, Subramania has spoken about the newlywed and their equilibrium.
It is also said that the inspiration for this song has been received from her sister Nivedita.
Sister Nivedita has also helped great scientist Jagdishchandra Bose.
He has collaborated to publish and disseminate Bose's analysis through his articles and conferences.
It is one of the most beautiful features of India to finish one of spirituality and science.
Sister Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose are a great example of this.
In 1899, there was a serious Black Disease in Kolkata, killing tens of thousands.
Sister Nivedita started the work of cleaning the canals and streets without any hesitation in her health.
He may have lived well, but he served the poor.
He was inspired by his sacrifice and began to contribute to the service of the people.
He taught a lesson on the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is very surprising to hear that children also suffer from diabetes.
Previously, such diseases are called diplomacy, which means that such diseases can only come from rich and healthy persons.
Such diseases were rarely seen among the youth.
But our way of life has changed.
Today we know that these diseases are not lifestyle problems.
One of the main reasons for suffering from such diseases at a young age is the decline in physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in food habits.
It is also very important for the society and the family to focus on these things.
If you think about these things then you will feel that there is no need to do anything extraordinary.
We should naturally make it a habit of changing our old habits and doing things properly.
Children should be aware of the habit of playing in open fields.
If possible, the elders of the family can join these children in sports.
Instead of using elevators, children can develop a habit of climbing stairs.
After dinner, everyone in the family can walk for a while with the kids.
Yoga is especially beneficial for providing a healthy lifestyle to our youngsters and preventing lifestyle problems.
Before starting school, practice yoga for the first 30 minutes and you will realize how much benefit you will get.
If I say it is easy then it can be easily learned and if it is very simple then it can be done anywhere.
There is no need for special equipment or field for this.
Yoga is very useful in controlling diabetes and many researches have been carried out.
AIIMS Hospital has been conducting a survey and is very encouraging to see the outcome so far.
We will not only see Ayurveda and Yoga as mere treatments but also make them a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been many good news in the last few days in the field of sports.
Our soldiers played wonderfully and after decades we have been able to win the Asian Cup.
Earlier, India had won the Asian Cup in 2003 and 2007.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens and all my fellow countrymen.
Following the hockey, India has also suffered good losses in the Badminton game.
Bedminton star Kidambi Srikanth has won a Denmark Open and made India proud.
After Indonesia Open and Australia Open, this is the third Super Series Premier Benefit.
I congratulate our young sportspersons and their achievements for making India proud.
Friends, this month the FIFA has started World Cup for the under-17 years.
The teams from all over the world came to India and everyone showed their talents in the foothills.
I got the opportunity to see a sham.
The sportspersons and the audience were enthusiastic.
The whole world is taking care of the great event of the World Cup.
I was surprised to see such a big show, the energy, enthusiasm and the thirst of all the youngsters.
The world started successfully and all the teams showed their talents very well.
Even though India could not win, India's young sportspersons had won the hearts of all the people.
All the countries of the world, including India, enjoyed this grand celebration, attracted and enjoyed the audience at the footsteps of the festival.
There are signs that the future of footwear is very bright.
Once again I convey my best wishes and congratulations to all the sportspersons and their helpers.
My dear countrymen, when I look at the number of writers who have written about Swachh Bharat then if I want to respect their feelings then I will have to give a daily Mann Ki Baat programme and I will have to dedicate every Mann Ki Baat for cleanliness.
Some are sending photographs of little girls' attempts, some are sending information about the group's efforts.
In some cases, there is some innovation related to cleanliness or news about the changes that have taken place due to the untiring efforts of an official.
I have been given a detailed report in the past about a revival story in the fort of Chandrapur in Maharashtra.
There, an NGO called the Ecological Protection Organisation was engaged in the cleaning of the Chandrapur Fort through its entire team.
The campaign, which lasted for 200 days, was engaged in the cleaning of the fortress, without any rest, without coughing.
Continuously 200 days.
Your disappointment and confidence will be transformed as soon as you see it.
This is a shining example of cleanliness, beauty, social activity and ceaseless efforts.
Fort is a symbol of our tradition.
We all have the responsibility of keeping our historical traditions safe and clean.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to the Ecological Protection Organization and their entire team and to the people of Sandrapur.
My dear countrymen, we will be celebrating the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak ji on 4th November.
Guru Nanak Devji was not only the first Guru of the Sikhs but also the Guru of the world.
He thought of the interests of humanity as a whole, he utilised all castes equally.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
He gave the message of maintaining equality in society, not only stopping his message with words but also his actions.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji has given three messages to live a fruitful life - proclaiming the name of God, working hard and helping those who need it.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji created a sacred book Guru Granth to take up his teachings.
We will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of our Guru Nanak Devji in 2019.
Let us make efforts to move forward on the path of his teachings and message.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel will be celebrated on 31st October after two days.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel is that he was not only a manifestation of the idea of transformation, but was also capable of implementing it and delivering a practical solution.
He was an expert in implementing the idea.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel embraced the great responsibility of connecting India with one corner.
Initially, he ensured that crores of people should be brought under the umbrella of One Nation One Constitution.
His ability to make a resolution has empowered him to overcome all obstacles.
This phrase of Sardar ji still remains a fountain of our dream of a New India and is relevant today.
That is why we celebrate his birthday as National Integration Day.
His contribution in providing an integrated form to the nation is unparalleled.
On 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar ji, a Run for Unity is being organised across the country in which many people from all over the country, children, youth, women and all age groups are going to participate.
I urge you all to participate in this run for unity and join the celebrations of mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, after the Deepawali holiday, all of you have started re-engagement in your daily lives with a new commitment and a new strength.
My best wishes to all of you for the realization of your dreams.
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat started talking to you in Akashwani.
Today is the 36th part.
In a way, the positive power of India, the feelings, desires and aspirations that are filled with all corners of the country, are sometimes accusations - however, Mann Ki Baat has given me a wonderful opportunity to interact with the feelings of the people.
You might have noticed that I have never said this as the voice of my mind.
Whether it is e-mail or telephone or mygov or NarendraModiApp, all of these things are available to me.
Sometimes individual-related deficiencies and sometimes social problems are attractive.
I take about half an hour of yours once a month, but people are sending me information about Mann Ki Baat for 30 days a month.
I am grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country in such a short span of time.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered the words of Acharya Vivibh Bhave.
Thereafter, I received a lot of letters from everywhere in the country and I was told that several social organisations and many youngsters are engaged in the task of not wasting food.
While looking at it, Selfie has become a big movement not only in India but also in the entire world.
This is not the problem of social media.
Every girl child has become a new self-confidence and a new proud event.
Every mother appeared to have a selfie with her parents.
Every woman has a sense of greatness for herself.
In the last few days, I had attended a session of the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
I asked the travellers to send me photographs of Incredible India wherever you are visiting.
Millions of films have come from across the corner of India and in a way it has become an asset for those working in the tourism sector.
Every moment, the country is on the right track.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something constructively for the welfare of others, for the benefit of the society, for the progress of the nation.
I learnt and understood from the people of the country, I learnt from this three-year movement of Mann Ki Baat.
This is the biggest capital and greatest power for any country.
The sale of pottery has increased, thereby increasing employment in the households of the poor.
There is a substantial relaxation in the threshold from 2nd October.
I once again urge you to take forward the drive related to paperwork and strengthen it further.
We have to bear the feeling that whenever we buy papers, Deepawali will be illuminated in the houses of the poor.
We have to do this for the poor people of our country that is why this work is being done.
Increasing interest in paperwork has led to innovative thinking and enthusiasm among those working in the carpet sector and those related to carpets in the Government of India.
How to introduce new technology, how to increase productivity and how to introduce solar equipment
They have started thinking about how to revive the ancient tradition that had disappeared from practice for 20-30 years.
In Uttar Pradesh, the Sevapuri Kati Ashram in Sevapur, Varanasi was closed for 26 years, which has now started functioning with a new theme.
That is, we have decided that we will participate in the Swachhta Celebrations across the country on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Gandhiji on 2nd October.
We will unite the minds of the people through cleanliness.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the work and the nation was united in it.
Today, the elderly, the children, the men and women, the cities and the villages are connecting themselves with this cleanliness drive.
I had said that we will make a solemn pledge and we will succeed. This cleanliness drive is moving in the direction of achieving success with our determination and it is spread in our eyes.
Everyone is making it their own, helping and contributing immensely to achieve this.
Sportspersons, filmmakers, academics, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, staff, police and soldiers are all connected to this movement.
There is a kind of pressure that people ask for cleanliness when they are polluted in public places and there is a need to keep the workers there clean.
This time I had to take note of another thing - cleanliness is one thing and it is another thing that we are not filthy with awareness.
At the same time, it is important that cleanliness becomes a part of our nature and a movement of thought is being implemented.
This time, several competitions related to cleanliness and service were held.
More than 12 crore children participated in the essay competition.
Thousands of children drew paintings with their imagination.
When we talk about cleanliness, I dont forget to express my gratitude to the media.
They have taken this movement forward with a lot of cleanliness.
They have contributed immensely in creating a constructive environment by incorporating them in their proper manner.
We are observing that the electronic media and newspapers of our country are doing great service to the Swachhta Hi Seva movement.
A few days ago, a person told me about the 18-year-old Youth Pillar of Srinagar.
Asia's largest lake is near Srinagar, in which he was removing plastic, polythene, used bottles and dustbins.
He also earned income from this.
Since his father died of cancer, he added cleanliness to his life.
Pilot Dar is a young man, but an inspiration and factor for all those who are keen on cleanliness.
The month of October marks the commemoration of many of our great personalities.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, the birth anniversary of 11 Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji.
This year marks the centenary of Nanaji and Deen Dayal.
Nanaji Deshmukh ji quit his political career and joined the Gramodaya movement. It is important to respect his work on Gramodaya during his centenary celebrations.
Abdul Kalam, former President of India, while speaking to the youth, will always present the topics of Nanaji Deshmukhs rural progress.
He will describe it with great respect and he also visited the villages to see these works of Nanaji.
Like Gandhiji, Deendayal Upadhyay Ji will also talk about the last man in the society.
Deendayal Ji will be remembered for the change in the lives of the poor, the oppressed, the underprivileged and the deprived sections of the society in terms of education and employment.
If we think of all these gentlemen, it is not the comfort we can do to them, if we think of these gentlemen then the path that we have to go ahead will be traversed.
In every city of the country there should be a massive drive for solidarity and the weather is comfortable and it is necessary to get iron like Sardar ji.
Sardar is not they, he has united the land
We should also take part in this drive for unity and take forward the mantra of unity.
We naturally say that unity in diversity is Indias achievement.
While we are proud of diversity, have you been trying to experience this diversity
I would like to tell the countrymen, especially the younger generation, that we are alive.
Enjoy the diversity of our India and feel it and look at its gate.
You can see that this diversity of our country will be a school for the glory of the uniqueness within you.
There is a mood of going somewhere on the holidays, on the occasion of Deepavali and on all the four sides of our country.
People from North India do not know what is happening in South India.
The people of western India are not aware of what is there in Eastern India.
Do you know how many diversity lies in our country
If you mention the speeches of Gandhiji, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam then one thing will be seen - when they look around India, there was a new inspiration to understand and dedicate their lives for this.
All these gentlemen have seen India completely.
Before their activity, they tried to know and understand India.
They tried to see India live within themselves.
Whether our different states, different societies, groups, their habits, their traditions, their natives, their food systems and their beliefs cannot be tried to learn, understand and live as a student
The value of tourism is not limited to going and seeing it as a student.
I have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts in India.
It has a dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of food systems are there
If you have every kind of food in your life then there is no possibility of eating the same food again and there are so many kinds of things.
This is the biggest strength of our tourism.
During these holidays, you should leave your homes and not stop, you should not go for change, you should go out with the intention of knowing and getting things done.
Your life will be fulfilled through these experiences.
Your vision will be enormous.
Tell me, who can be a bigger Asan than your experiences
If you go this time too, you will take this movement forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences and share photos.
Definitely send your photos to Incredibleindia.
If you meet the people there then send their photographs.
There is a feeling in my mind that in order to inspire the tourism sector in India, what will be the seven most important tourist destinations in your state - every Indian should know about those seven places of your state, if possible go to those seven places.
Assisted by this, can you provide any information about this
Can we reveal this on the NarendraModiApp
Can we explain this in Incredible India
I would like to tell the government that if several people from a state say this thing then I would like to examine it and publish publications about the seven places that have been said in every state.
In a way, how can we take the tourist destinations forward with the views of the people
Similarly, you can imagine that the places you have visited across the country, whichever places you have the best 7 places, the others should visit this place, visit this place and get information about these things and you must send 7 places of your choice in MyGov and NarendraModiApp.
Come, join me.
You can become a catalyst in encouraging the tourism sector of the country during the period from October to March.
I'm calling you.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch my heart.
I'm a man like you
Perhaps the events that took place in the past and perhaps it would have come to your notice - the countrymen would have seen the magnificent example of women power and patriotism.
The Indian Army has got two brave soldiers - Lieutenant Swayam and Finance, who are extraordinary heroes.
I tell you why extraordinary people have lost their lives in the service of Bharatmata, the husbands of both Swati and Nidhi.
When they fall on the world at this young age, you imagine how they will be mentally
But the martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadik's wife, Swati Mahadik, confronted such difficult situations and made his mind strong and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and joined the army and made his way to realise his husband's dream.
Likewise, Tubey's husband, Mukesh Tubey, served as a nayake in the military, surviving in the service of the Thailand, his wife, Nidhi, enjoyed the frustration of joining the army and joined the army.
There is no doubt that every citizen will respect our mother power and our heroes.
My dear countrymen, between Navratri festival and Deepawali, the youth of our country has got a great opportunity.
FIFA (FIFA) is scheduled to host a world cup of 17-year-olds.
I believe that on all four sides there will be a reflection of the footprints.
The interest in footwear will increase for every generation.
Everybody should participate in this game so that there are no youngsters who do not play football in any school and college ground in India.
Come, let us make sports a part of our lives when all the countries of the world come to play on Indian soil.
My dear countrymen, Navaratri is going on.
It's time to worship Mother Durga.
The environment is full of sacred fragrance.
There is a sort of spiritual environment, a fervor and a devotional atmosphere all around.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to the countrymen and urge Mother Parakshakti to fulfil the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of the country and to take the country to new heights.
The country has to get the opportunity to face every challenge.
The nation must progress at a rapid pace, 75 years after the independence of India by 2022, the effort to fulfil the dreams of the freedom fighters, the commitment of 125 crore countrymen, the uninterrupted labour, the unbearable energy and the psychologies, we should move ahead with the five-year plans for a New India and give our blessings to the mother power.
My best wishes to all of you.
Celebrate festivals and spread clubs.
This is the birthplace of Lord Buddha and Gandhi. Sardar Patel was born in the whole world for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have honoured the values and values of life that are commonly observed.
Ahimsa Paramodharma: - We have been listening to this sentence since our childhood.
This diversity is not found only in food habits, shelters and dresses
This diversity is visible in every activity of life.
You must have seen that all our festivals have been organised in accordance with the calendar of nature.
All these have a direct connection with nature.
Many of our festivals are associated with farmers and fishermen.
Today, when I talk about festivals with you, I would like to say that it is a misery for all of you.
Yesterday, the Jains celebrated the Samvatsari festival.
The festival of Paryushan is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
Samvatsari is coming on the last day of Paryushan celebrations.
This is a wonderful tradition in itself.
Samvatsari marks the day of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
The festival is a symbol of time, unity, equality and cleanliness.
Greetings to everyone on the auspicious occasion of Pilgrimage Chaturthi.
Now the festival of Onam is celebrated in Kerala.
Keralas Om Festival is one of the most important festivals of India.
Nowadays, our festivals have become a factor of attraction for tourism.
I would like to tell the countrymen that be it Navaratri festival in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal, these are in a way tourism attractions.
Our other festivals have also provided an opportunity to attract the neighbours.
We have to think about what we can do in this direction.
It is Eid-ul-Suha that the festival will continue to be held in a few more days.
At the same time, in New India, festivals should be a factor of cleanliness.
Festivals and cleanliness are also associated with family life.
Preparation for a festival is to focus on cleanliness and health.
Though this is not a new thing for all of us, it is essential to transform it into a social nature.
They put colours in them, one plants vegetables and one puts a piece of paper in it.
Every family is experiencing various kinds of benefits.
In a way, the biggest exercise of environmental awareness has been seen for the first time in this book festival.
Three years ago, we started the Swachhta Abhiyan and the completion of three years will take place on 2nd October.
The positive consequences are emerging.
The area of toilets has reached about 67 percent from 39 percent.
The people of Jamiat Ulema AHind have demonstrated an excellent example of unity in the cause of cleanliness and inspiring everyone.
If the efforts made with a sense of dedication and dedication towards cleanliness are transformed into our eternal nature then no peak can be achieved by our country
Whenever we get the opportunity, we will look for opportunities where we will get the opportunity.
But we all have to join in this thing.
Let us consider this as a preparation for Deepavali or preparation for Navaratri or preparation for Durga Puja.
Physical service.
We will work together on holidays and on Sundays.
We will go to the neighbouring habitations, we will go to the nearby villages, but we can do this as a movement.
I appeal to all non-governmental organizations, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government officials, district regimes and panchayat leaders - 15 days before Gandhijis birth anniversary on 2nd October, we will create an atmosphere of cleanliness which is actually an October 2, when Gandhiji dreamt of.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation MyGov.
After the construction of the toilet, your name and the name of those whom you have assisted in constructing a toilet can be recorded there.
Friends from my social media can intensify some constructive movements and you can motivate them to work at the grassroots level.
Through the commitment to cleanliness, a conceptual competition called Success in Cleanliness, organised by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation for essay competition, short film making competition and painting competition.
You can write articles in many languages and there is no age limit.
You can make a short film and make it on your mobile phone.
2-3 minute short film should be produced and it should be an inspiration for cleanliness.
I invite all of you to join this movement related to cleanliness.
After this 15-day Swachhta Hi Seva campaign, when we celebrate 2nd October, we will see how clean and cheerful we will get when we see Gandhiji who was accorded to him.
Hundreds of thousands of people write letters, give information, and many are delivering news through telephones, this is a great wealth for me.
This is a great opportunity to understand the mindsets of the countrymen.
I look forward to your messages more than what you look forward to for Mann Ki Baat.
I am thirsty because every thing of you gives me the opportunity to learn.
Yes, I too have made such a mistake.
Sometimes it will not be possible to tell us how many things are naturally transformed into ourselves.
Prime Minister, I am talking to Aparna from Pune.
I want to talk to you about my friend
She's always trying to help everyone, but one of her actions makes me nervous.
Once I went to the business complex to buy goods with her.
She spent 2000 rupees without any difficulty in buying a sack, then she spent 450 rupees to buy a beat.
But the Auto driver who used to come to the campus was actively involved in a bargain of five rupees.
When she bought vegetables on the way back, she bargained at every vegetable price and saved 4-5 rupees.
I'm very uncomfortable.
We are buying goods without asking anything in bigger places, we are fighting for retail money with our brothers and sisters who work and live.
After hearing this telephone call, I firmly believe that you might be surprised, why can you be ashamed and you might be convinced that I will not behave like this.
Have you ever imagined what will run in the minds of the poor
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the entire nation is going to celebrate Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of the Hockey sportsperson and Major Dhyan Chand ji, who is considered to be the world's heroine in Hockey.
His contribution to Hockey is unparalleled.
I recall this thing that the younger generation of our country should connect themselves with sports.
Sports must become part of our lives.
As we are a young nation in the world, we must reflect in our youth sports fields.
What else do you want to say is that sports gives strength, vigilance and personality development.
Sports in a way is an integral part of our minds.
I want to assert that the younger generation of our country should move ahead in the sports world and that in today's forecast is even more important in the world than in the field of sports and sports.
FIFA can play football in the calculations, but I can see football in the field.
You can play cricket in calculations, but in the field, play under the sky, its joy is incredible.
Sometimes when all the kids in the house go out, they ask that when will the mother come back
In today's era, if this has changed then as soon as the children come home, they sit in a corner and start watching a cartoon or drown in mobile camps.
Any child in the country who has achieved something in the field of sports, if they have the talent then they can provide information about themselves or video on this portal.
The portal will be launched by the Ministry of Sports tomorrow to impart training to select and developing sportspersons.
In India, from 6th to 28th October, FIFA is organising a Global Footwear Cup for 17-year-olds.
Twenty-four teams from all over the world will come and play in India.
Let us welcome young guests from many countries through sports festivals and let us enjoy sports and create such an environment in the country.
While talking about sports, in the last weeks, my heart-to-bearing event took place and I would like to share with you about it.
Six such women work in the navy.
Their feelings and their inspiration are a source of inspiration for all of us.
The six women's wealth is also travelling to the INS TARINI, a small vessel, attempting to cross the seas.
Navika Sagar Parikrama i. e.
They shall compass the world, and return to India after several months.
Sometimes they spend about 40 days in water.
Sometimes they may have to spend about 30 days continuously in water.
In the midst of the waves of the sea, six of our womens wealth passes through adventure and this is the first time in the world.
I am also organising an exclusive process for their experiences at the NarendraModi App and reading you
You must read it because it is a story full of courage, a story full of self-experience and I am happy to share with you the experiences of these womens wealth.
My best wishes and good wishes to these women.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
The former President of our country, Dr.
This is the birthday of Radhakrishnan ji.
Though he was the President, he presented himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always wanted to live a teacher.
He was dedicated to education.
Although he was the President of India as a scholar, a diplomat, he was a living teacher every moment.
I remember him.
This time when we celebrate Teachers Day, can we all take a pledge together
Because of its efforts, the events that have been successful in transforming the lives of every teacher will certainly be there in the lives of every teacher.
If we make social efforts then we can transform the country and we can make a big contribution in this thing.
Let us teach education to transform, let us take this mantra forward.
Ananya Hostile.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Centre at Howard University.
As an analyst, I am particularly interested in financial inclusion and related social programmes.
I would like to ask you the question of whether in 2014 you have started Jan Dhan Yojana, whether India is financially safer, whether it is power-growing, whether it is power-sharing, this power-sharing and facilities have reached our women, farmers, workers, villages, huts, all-round statistics.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been asked - financial inclusion - this has been a matter of discussion not only in India but also of expertise in the economic world.
I started this project on 28th August 2014 with a dream in my mind.
Tomorrow, on 28th August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be launched and 3 years will be completed.
30 crore new households have been connected and bank accounts have been opened.
This is more than the number of countries in the world.
Perhaps, if the money is swallowed in the hand, if it is in the pocket, if it is in the house, it will inspire the mind to waste.
65,000 crore through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY).
In a way, this saving of the poor will be their strength in the future.
Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, those who have opened their bank accounts will get insurance benefits.
Today, a new confidence has been created in the lives of the poor by paying a very simple fee of Rs. One rupee and Rs.
In many families, if a poor person faces a problem due to the fee of one rupee, if a family member dies then that family gets Rs. 2 lakhs.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start Up Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, crores of youngsters have been able to get the money under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, be it the under-privileged, the tribal, the women, the educated and the graduated youth, or be it the youth who are able to stand on their own feet, under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
They are engaged not only in their own feet but also in successful efforts to provide employment to two and a half people.
During the last few days, some people from the banking sector had come to meet me and they had said that they had got a lot of inspiring things while doing a survey of the benefits of the common man due to Jan Dhan Yojana, insurance schemes, RuPay card and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I will do my best to bring these to your sight
These include events that can be fully utilised by even media persons.
They can also interact with such persons and create a new zeal for the new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again my thoughts are with you all.
English rendering of the text of PMs address at the Indian Radio Games 2018
Monsoon is a time when people lose their hearts.
Animals, birds, plants and nature are all blooming with the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when it rains heavily, we are aware of the huge destruction potential that you have.
Mother Nature gives us life and breeds us all but sometimes natural calamities such as floods and earthquakes and their drastic forms cause great destruction.
Changing climate and climate change are affecting negatively.
Over the past few days, some parts of India, particularly Assam, North East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal, had to face natural calamities due to heavy rains.
Comprehensive surveillance measures are underway in flood affected areas.
The State Governments are also making great efforts to assist the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and even the citizens who are serving, are making every effort to help the people in this situation.
Farming, livestock wealth, infrastructure, roads, electricity and communication systems are all affected.
In particular, in order to compensate our farmer brothers for the loss of their produce and their produce, we have initiated schemes for the insurance companies, especially for the crop insurance companies, to meet the demand for compensation.
Besides, 24-hour and 1078 support systems have been fully operational to combat the floods.
People are expressing their hardships in this regard.
Prior to the start of the monsoon, a training drive was conducted at most places and the entire government machinery was put in place.
The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams were intensified.
They were trained at various places to develop a voluntary organization to help in disasters, to do what to do or not to do, to decide volunteers, to create a peoples organisation and to act in such situations.
Nowadays weather is already calculated, technology has grown, space science has played a major role in calculating this, which is why we almost get the right calculation.
Gradually, we have to change our activities according to climate calculations and to protect ourselves from catastrophic hazards.
Whenever I prepare myself for the Mann Ki Baat programme, I can see that the people of our country are also involved in its preparation.
This time there have been many letters and phone calls regarding the Goods and Services Tax
Even now, people have expressed their happiness over the goods and services and expressed their hopes.
I would like to hear this telephone call: "Greetings, Prime Minister, I am talking to Neetu Karg from Gurgaon.
Having spent a month, will you have the expected results
I want to know your thoughts about this and thank you.
It has been almost a month since the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax and its results have started to emerge.
I can see how this new reconstruction system has impacted the transport and services sector.
Items are also moving very fast.
Despite this facility, it has added strength especially to the pace of economic growth.
Due to the earlier separate tax regime, most of the resources of the Transport and Services Department were spent maintenance of documents and new warehouses had to be set up in each state.
This tax, which I say is Goods and Simple Tax, has really had a very positive impact on our economic system in a very short time.
The pace at which there has been a paradigm shift, the pace at which new changes have taken place, the new registrations have been made, all these have created a new hope in the entire country.
In many of the world universities, it will become a model research.
Because such a massive transformation, with the involvement of crores of people, successful implementation of this system in such a large country can be considered as a supreme success.
S. T.
All the states have a role and responsibility in implementing the GST.
All decisions and decisions have been taken in a unanimous manner in collaboration with the Central Government.
What was the price of a specific commodity through the App before this regulation, what was there after the new regulation, everything is available on your mobile phone.
This is a historic victory and a historic achievement.
This is also a kind of social reform movement.
I offer my heartfelt gratitude to millions and millions of my countrymen who naturally made such a big effort.
My dear countrymen, the month of August marks the revolution.
Obviously, we have heard about this thing since our childhood. The reason for this is that the non-cooperation movement was launched in August 1, 1920.
Then, on 9th August, 1942, the uit India Movement began, and we know it as the August Revolution
Next, on August 15, 1947, the country achieved independence.
In a way, many events in the month of August are specially associated with the history of liberation.
This year we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But he has put forward the slogan to get out of this white one.
Some people knew that Yusuf Meher Ali was there.
Our new generation should know what happened on the 9th of August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, we must inspire ourselves to create a great India, the historical pages of our countrymen, who had joined them in the liberation jurisdiction, who had embraced tyranny and atrocities.
What could be a greater zeal than the sacrifices, sacrifices and dedication of our freedom fighters
The uit India Movement is a very important struggle for India's freedom movement.
It was this struggle that gave the entire nation a solemn pledge to get rid of the British rule.
At that time, all of them joined hands with their shoulders in the struggle against the British rule, against every corner of Hindustan, against villages, cities, educated, uneducated, poor and wealthy, and took part in the White House uit India struggle against British rule.
The anger of the people was at the peak.
Hearing the challenge of Gandhiji, hundreds of millions of people took the mantra of do or die in our minds and took the struggle forward.
Millions of youth of the country gave their education and books in the freedom struggle.
The song of freedom was sounded, they went ahead.
Lahia and Jaiprakash Narayan have made a major contribution.
The Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920, the uit India Movement of 1942, showcases two different dimensions of Gandhiji.
The dimensions of non-cooperation differed, the extent to which the independence of 1942 had increased, there was a need to present a mantra like Gandhiji, a mantra of tax or death.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1857, continued till 1942, every moment in some part of the country.
This protracted period of time had created a sense of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was determined to do something.
Generations have changed, but there is no depression in depression.
People used to come and join themselves, they went and new people came, they joined themselves and made everyday attempts in the country to throw away the British rule.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle had created a new situation, which took this position to a higher level in 1942.
It was only five years since the British had to leave the country in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, the freedom struggle had reached all the people.
These five years, from 1942 to 1947, were the expressions of people's depression, these five years were the reason for nation's liberation.
These five years are your decisive years.
Now I want to connect you with this account.
We achieved independence in 1947.
Today we are in 2017.
Nearly 70 years have passed.
The governments came.
Organisations grew, transformed, flourished and developed.
Everyone in their own way tried to get the country out of its problems.
Efforts were made to increase employment, eradicate poverty and develop in the country.
Efforts were made in their own ways.
We also got success.
We must celebrate the 15th of August this year as the day of the Sabbath, 75 years after the independence of the country in 2022.
Remembering the Revolution Day of August 9th, everybody on August 15th, as an individual, as a citizen, I will do this for the country and as a family, I will do this as a society, I will do this as a city, I will do this as a government department and I will do this as a government.
Millions of people have to make a pledge.
Efforts should be made to fulfil the promises made.
Just as the five years from 1942 to 1947 were determined to ensure the independence of the country, similarly, these five years from 2017 to 2022 will go a long way in determining the future of India.
We have to celebrate 75 years of our independence after five years.
Every citizen, every social organisation, local government organisation, schools, colleges and various organisations should make a solemn pledge to build a New India.
Let it be a solemn pledge to make our resolve a success in the next five years.
What goal should we achieve as a nation
What can be my contribution as an individual
You can use technology to take forward all these things like video, posts, blueprints, articles and new ideas.
Let us convert this movement into a peoples movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will launch the uit India uit India Campaign for Young Community Friends in the App.
This questionnaire is an attempt to connect the youth with the proud history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am confident that you will spread this message very well.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Minister of India, I get the opportunity to interact with the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
I'm a tool.
I myself read them and I will try to express them on the 15th of August.
Accusation has been made before me that the speeches I delivered on August 15 last three times have been a little longer.
I am trying to lay down rules for me and I don't know whether I can do it or not.
But I have the desire to try this time how to briefly compose my speech.
Let's see if I have a success or not.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to talk to you about another issue.
India's economic system includes a socio-economic system.
We should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals and celebrations are not just occasions of joy.
Our festivals and festivals are also a movement for social rejuvenation.
But even more, each of our festivals is directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
A few days later, Rakshabandhan, Krishna Jayanti, Pillayar Chaturthi, then Saud Chandra, then Anant Chaturthasi, Durga Puja and Deepavali will come together.
These connect individuals and society.
The natural journey between these two continues.
Ah se Ah shyam i. e.
In terms of economic status, even months before the festival of Raksha Bandhan, several families start preparing rocks as small slum industries.
A variety of rocks are being made from cotton to silk mills
But today people have started enjoying the rocks being made at home.
It is directly related to the poor artisans who produce small lamps.
But today, while talking about festivals and the economic condition of the poor associated with them, I want to clarify the environment.
Sometimes I see that the countrymen are more aware and constructive than me.
Over the last one month, aware citizens have been writing to me about the environment.
You people have requested me to talk about the environment friendly child before the Pittaar Chaturthi so that it can be planned right now.
First of all, I express my gratitude to such a vigilant citizen.
At the same time, it is our commitment to create an eco-friendly, soil-produced child Turtles to protect the environment.
This time I have said this thing very early.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming festivals and festivals.
Just a few days back, our women and women have done a great job in the Cricket World Cup.
This week, I got the opportunity to meet all of them.
It gave me great pleasure to interact with them but I realized that they were pressing them on the burden that they were unable to win the World Cup.
This pressure on their faces had boiled the crisis.
I gave these women a different assessment on my side.
Look, today's era is a media world, expectations have increased, if we say that success is not achieved then it becomes angry
If the sportspersons of India lose, we have seen the country's anger thrilling on those sportspersons.
Not only this, they praised and boasted the achievements made by these women.
In fact, the youngsters of our country, particularly women, are engaged in a lot of things to make the nation proud.
Once again, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the younger generation, especially to our women.
We all have to take the country towards new heights, take it and take it to new heights.
Come, let us travel together, let us travel by doing something.
Let us move ahead with the hope that the future of the nation will be better.
Many congratulations.
Climate is changing.
After the rains, the cold winds have sufficiently succumbed to the heat of summer.
No matter how many difficulties are faced in life, no matter how much trouble is there, we can feel that there is a change in the mindset of all of us in the personal life, in the public life, in the rainy season.
Lord Jagannath is associated with the country's poor spiritually.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
In English there is a word called juggernaut, which means that a special chariot that cannot be stopped by anyone.
On seeing in Agartadi, it was found that this word 'Jagarnowt' has emerged beyond Jagannath's chariot.
On seeing all these things, we can understand how the world has accepted this greatness in their own ways.
On the auspicious occasion of Lord Jagannath, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the countrymen.
Come, let us collectively get inspired from these holy festivals and share the joy of our country and take the country forward in the path of development.
In this holy month of Ramlan, we are reminded of an extremely concentrated event in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
There are about 3500 Islamic brothers and sisters living in this small village along with their families, in a way there are brothers and sisters of a large number of Islamic families.
In this month of Ramlan, the villagers decided to construct toilets together.
So they have said that they should spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I compliment all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this holy occasion of Ramlan for the welfare of the society.
We know that in our country, the states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already declared themselves free from the practice of waste in open defecation.
Uttaranchal and Haryana have been declared Open Defecation Free States this week.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration, rulers and people of these five states.
We are aware that if we want to do something good, be it in individual life or in social life, then we have to work hard.
If our signature is bad, if we think that it should be corrected, then we have to make a lot of time conscious of it.
Only then will it become a habit of physical and mental.
Similarly, there are some other evil habits in our nature.
We must draw everyone's attention.
We must recall the inspirational events.
I am glad that today cleanliness has not stopped at the level of the government.
This has emerged as a movement of people's society.
This happened in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
What is its goal
Out of 71 Village Panchayats in 100 hours, 10,000 households have to be constructed.
My dear countrymen, the people and the government will also be happy to note that they have succeeded in constructing 100000 toilets in 100 hours.
in and through letters and aerodromes.
Prakash Tripathi ji recalled the Emergency and said that on 25th June, he was the greatest traitor in the history of democracy.
Prakash Tripathy is commendable for their awareness about democracy. This is not just a system but a culture.
At the same time, we have to take forward the good things of democracy.
It is a dark night on June 25, 1975, and no one can easily forget it.
No Indian can leave it.
The country's great leaders, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were imprisoned in prisons.
Students from today's media world, all those who work in the democratic system, all those who work in the media today, are constantly trying to generate awareness to remind them of the evil times.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
He had written a poem on the occasion of one year of the announcement of an emergency in the country, describing the situation in the country during that period.
We have to make this tradition more robust.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian feels a lot of pride with his head.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world is Yoga.
Everyone from the water to the mountains used to welcome sun rays in the morning through Yoga.
Yoga was not the case before, but today everyone has joined the path of Yoga and Yoga has become a bridge that connects the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have turned this opportunity into an opportunity for them to provide Yoga.
More than 4000 people from the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi were engaged in Yoga on the Chinese masses and on Machu Pichu, the world's heritage symbol of Peru, at a height of 2400 metres above sea level.
In Herah, Afghanistan, the India-Afghan ally, Salma Dam, engaged in Yoga, set a new stage for friendship.
Even in smaller places like Singapore, programmes were organised at 70 locations and they carried out this movement for a week.
This time again Yoga has made a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have made Yoga a new world record.
I also got an opportunity to participate in Yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time in the rainy season, Yoga has also become a good opportunity.
Our soldiers were also engaged in the art of Yoga even in Siachen with a temperature of 20, 25 and 40 degrees.
Our Army, Border Security Forces, Indian Border Police Forces, Federal Reserve Police Forces, Federal Industrial Security Forces, all of them have performed their duties and performed Yoga.
As this is the 3rd International Day of Yoga, I had requested the families of 3 generations to take a picture of Yoga and share it with me.
Some television channels also took the matter forward.
A lot of people had sent me photographs and some of them were selected from the Narendra Modi App.
Distinguished Prime Minister, I bow down to Dr.
I'm talking to Anil Sonara.
Sir, I recall that you have recently said in Kerala that instead of giving bouquet of bouquets at different places, we can give good memorials.
We cannot do anything to implement this idea throughout the country, sir.
I liked it very much.
I am once again reminded of one thing that has escaped from my memory.
Because when I was in Gujarat, we should no longer offer garlands, give books or we should welcome handcuffs and welcome them.
And that too we will give a handkerchief because it will inspire the doorsteps.
It was a habit when I was in Gujarat, but after I came here, this habit was lost.
But when I went to Kerala, I had an awareness again.
But when we deliver books, in a way it becomes a part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
We can also welcome the offer of paperwork so that how many poor people can be helped
The reduction in costs also works properly.
These things have great historical significance.
When I visited the UK last year, UK queen Elizabeth invited me to the banquet in London.
When I was married, Gandhiji conveyed his best wishes to me and presented this handcuff, he said in a loud voice.
For many years, the queen of Elizabeth had kept the handcuffs that Gandhiji had gifted.
A very small love of Gandhiji has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
These behaviours do not turn into night, but become subject to criticism.
At the same time, efforts should be made to engage in such conversations.
For this, whenever I go anywhere, if someone brings potatoes, I won't deny it, I can't do that.
The criticisms will only emerge, we have to repeat, gradually bring about a change.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister of the country, there are many issues.
Despite being immersed in files, I am developing a habit that is, I have been reading something in my letters and setting up an opportunity to connect me with the common man.
There are several kinds of letters and many people write to me.
I feel it is important to share with you a letter that I have read a few days ago.
Therefore, under the Mudra Yojana, I have started the work of getting money from the bank and buying something from the market.
In the meanwhile, the Government of India has focused on the Government e-Marketplace and Government e-Marketplace.
Whoever wants to give something to the government, whoever wants to sell something like electric bulbs, dustbins, blankets, chairs and tables, they can register on this platform.
And it has been made mandatory that the government departments should go to this site and buy goods by considering the quality of goods at affordable prices.
In this way, all the departments of the government are taking care of who is registered on E-GEM.
Due to lack of intermediaries, goods are available at cheap prices.
This is an opportunity to encourage entrepreneurship.
It also has immortality, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
I want all those who want to sell their products to the government to register themselves on this portal in a big way.
My dear countrymen, while we are proud of Yoga, the achievements that we have made in space science also keep our hearts immersed.
While our footsteps are lying on the earth attached to Yoga, Indias greatest significance is that we are realizing the dream of touching a far-flung application.
In the past, India has achieved a great achievement in sports and science.
Today, India is seeking its success not only on Earth but also on App.
ISRO has successfully launched 30 Nano satellites with Cartosat-2 satellites two days ago.
Apart from India, there are about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the USA.
This Nano satellite mission of India will be of great help in the field of agriculture and information on natural calamities.
1000 days is an important milestone in our scientific journey, in our space journey.
Nowadays, we can see that our youth is making great strides in the field of sports.
Apart from education, they are also realizing their future in sports.
The country is proud of our sportspersons, their efforts and their achievements.
Recently, India's badminton sportsperson, Kidambi Srikanth, has made India proud by winning the Indonesia Open Day.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to him and his teachings for this achievement.
T.
Sports play a big role in the overall development of governance.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If children are engaged in sports in our family then we should give them an opportunity.
You should not urge them to take them out of the ground, put them in the room and study.
Let him study, and do, and he shall prosper therein: but if he have great talent and desire in sport, then let him be encouraged by all that are in school, college, family, and neighbourhood.
Everyone has to dream of participating in the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the period of monsoon and continuous celebrations has been a time to create new experiences in a way.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you and join you in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
This year's summer heat is an unforgettable experience.
At the same time, we are expecting rain.
Today, while I am talking to you, Ramlan has started in the holy month.
On this auspicious month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and around the world, especially to the people of Islamic society.
In the month of Ramlan, there has been considerable importance in prayer, spirituality and charity.
It is a matter of pride for 125 crore people of our country that all religions of the world are present in India.
We must be fortunate that our ancestors have created this great heritage.
There are people who believe in God, there are those who deny God in this country, there are those who worship the idol and those who oppose the idol.
The art of living in harmony with a variety of ideals, a variety of worshipping systems and a variety of traditions has become a part of our emotions.
Be it religions or be it methods or be it philosophy or be it traditions, all these are the only messages that give us - peace, unity and harmony.
In this holy month of Ramzan we will be able to move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again my best wishes to everyone.
I am glad that a large number of people have registered their books.
Everyone wants to share their experiences with me individually.
I speak with Diksha Kut.
When the habit of reading is almost excluded from me, I decided to study on holidays.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how many sacrifices and struggles were required to achieve India's independence and how many martyrs had experienced prison atrocities.
The life of Bhagat Singh ji, who had achieved the greatest achievement at a very young age, inspired me and therefore I urge you people to give a message to the present generation about this thing.
I am glad that the younger generation is keen to know about our history, our freedom fighters, about the sacrifices made by the spirit, material and spirit for this country.
Innumerable great men have lost their youth in prisons.
Many young people have kissed the ropes.
Today, we can breathe the breath of a free India because they have experienced all the hardships they had said.
Those gentlemen who spent their time in the freedom struggle, they wrote books, reads, performed great tasks and their writings also contributed a lot to India's independence.
Several years ago, I had visited the Cellular Jail in Andaman and Nicobar.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar Ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book Maji Janmade in prison.
He wrote poems on prison walls.
They kept him in a small room.
Do you know how many atrocities the freedom fighters suffered
Savarkar ji wrote Maji Janmade - Only after I had to read the book, I had the desire to see the Cellular Jail.
There they organise a television show, which is very inspiring.
The people of all the states who sacrificed their youth in this Andaman and Nicobar Island Jail, called Kalabani, were speaking all the languages of India and had suffered a lot.
My dear countrymen, the 5th of June is the first Monday of the month.
Well, what does it mean to connect with nature
For me, we have to connect with us and we have to connect with us.
To connect with nature is to create a better planet.
Who can express this better than Gandhiji
Gandhiji once said - One must care about a world one will not see that it is our duty to take care of the world we cannot see.
You might have experienced that nature has power.
Perhaps you might have been very tired and if you might have sprinkled the water and sprinkled it on your face then remember what kind of freshness you have got.
The famine that has created our body, when it is connected with the famine, a new energy emerges.
Therefore, on June 5, the worldwide movement that connects with nature should become a movement that connects us.
The Vedas have shown the Earth and the environment as the basis of power.
The Atharvana Veda gives us a holistic guidance on the environment in a way that is thousands of years old.
Mother Earth: Budro Ahmed Prithviya is a case in our country.
It has been said in the Vedas that the cleanliness that we have is due to the Earth.
In our country, be it festivals or be it festivals or be it worshipping systems, be it unmarried, urban-ruralized, tribal communities or be it nature or be it love for nature or be it nature or be it nature.
However, we need to understand this in contemporary terms and contemporary ideas.
I have been receiving a lot of news from the states.
With the arrival of rains in almost all the states, a big drive for tree plantation begins.
Millions of trees are being planted.
We also have to contribute more and more in this rainy season for tree plantation.
My dear countrymen, 21st June is a day of great identification throughout the world.
Everyone in the world celebrates this as World Yoga Day.
The 21st of June has spread across the globe as World Yoga Day in a short span of time, which connects the people of the world.
On the one hand, while the separatist forces in the world are showing their worst face, India's biggest gift to the world is Yoga.
Through Yoga, we can connect the world with one another.
Just as Yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, Yoga can connect the world with the world.
Today, due to the emergence of life, due to the increasing responsibilities of emergency, due to pressure, life has become extremely desperate.
We see this situation in our childhood too.
Yoga will help us to lead a stressful life in the time of smuggling of unaccounted medicines.
Yoga guarantees both well-being and fitness.
Yoga is not just an exercise.
If we want to enjoy such an inclusive journey through physical, mental, mental and habits then it is possible only through Yoga.
Two days ago, on the occasion of Yoga Day, letters have been written to all the governments and leaders of the world.
Last year I had announced some competitions and some awards related to Yoga.
Gradually, the work is progressing in this direction.
I have been advised to convey my best wishes to him for this basic suggestion.
This is a very interesting thing.
On the occasion of the 3rd International Yoga Day, I would urge all three generations to join hands in Yoga.
Grandfather, parents and sons and daughters can work together for yoga practices and perform such photographs.
Yesterday, it will be an auspicious combination of tomorrow and a new dimension for Yoga.
Yesterday, this will be tomorrow's film and will guarantee a bright future.
I invite all of you.
As the International Yoga Day is still three weeks old, start the training from today itself.
You also share the topics related to Yoga for your part, spread and connect people.
In a way, it is a healthcare movement that will prevail.
I invite you all to join me.
From that time onwards, I have been touring various parts of India.
I have taken care of some of you very well that what Modi has done.
An interesting telephone call came to me and I didn't think about it.
But thanks to me for making such a different perspective.
I hope this telephone call will do the same to you.
"Congratulations Modi ji, I speak from Mumbai to Naina.
I often see that wherever you people are going, the people there are paying more attention to cleanliness in television and social media.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people are imbibing cleanliness as a movement by listening to your call.
On the one hand, there is awareness about cleanliness among children.
I have often seen their elders betray the dirt on the streets.
After launching a cleanliness drive in the fields of Kashi, you have been inspired by it and it has become a milestone.
"You are right, wherever I go, the government machinery performs the cleanliness drive, but nowadays cleanliness is also being celebrated at the social level.
A substantial amount of cleaning work is being done 5 days, 7 days and 10 days before I go.
Sometime back I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
There was a massive cleanliness drive.
I didn't see it attached to it, but it was only after this phone call came to me that yes, it was myself.
It is a matter of great pleasure that all other preparations being made by the Muslims to welcome the Prime Minister are comfortable, but giving importance to cleanliness is very important.
This is a joyous and compassionate thing for everyone who wants cleanliness.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all those who have strengthened the cleanliness drive.
Someone has given me a suggestion.
It's funny as it is.
Whatever the idea is good, I have to think about it.
Whatever is right, it is better to remove so many tons of dumplings than to give them a gift.
The Government of India, with the help of the State Governments, has decided to launch a massive movement on waste management with the help of city representatives.
On the 5th of June, World Environment Day, around 4000 cities in the country will have access to solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of dustbins are to be given, one green, the second blue.
Two types of waste materials emerge - one liquid waste and the other dry waste.
We have to follow the regulation, these dustbins will be installed in 4000 cities, we have to put dry waste in a blue ladder, we have to put liquid waste in a green dustbin.
In kitchen wastes such as vegetables, surplus food, eggs and leaves of trees, all fat waste should be placed on the green waste table.
If we remember the colourful greenery of the fields then we will recall what to put in the green dustbins.
The second type of waste is that it includes paper wastes, cardboards, iron ore, glass pieces, plastics, polythene, broken pockets, rubber products and metals - all should be placed in dry dumps and recycled in the machines.
A few days ago, one thing had come to the ears and Versova Beach, which is considered to be a dirty beach in Mumbai, has now become a clean and beautiful beach.
Afroz Shah was conferred the UNEP's biggest award for this work.
He is the first Indian to receive the Champions of the Earth award.
My dear countrymen, for the past 15 days and months, articles have been published in newspapers, TV channels and social media on the 3 years of the present government, discussions and analysis are going on.
Three years ago you gave me the responsibility of being the Chief Servant.
Integrated research has been carried out and a number of opinion polls have taken place.
I see all these as very healthy signs.
The last three years have been addressed in every lecture.
People at all levels of society have studied it.
This is an excellent function in the democratic system.
My obvious and remarkable view that the governments are obliged to respond to the democracy must be presented to the people of the princely states.
I express my gratitude to all those who have spent their time exploring our work in depth, counselling and supporting the grievances. I consider these things very important.
I also express my gratitude to all those who have made important meetings in mind.
Whatever crimes are there, when they are revealed, there is a possibility of a rectification.
Action can be good, less benefits can be feared, bad or bad, it can be learned from them and progress can be achieved through this.
Creative criticism strengthens the democratic system.
This discipline and research is very important for an aware country and a rational nation.
My dear countrymen, I too am an ordinary citizen like you, as an ordinary citizen, everything is evil as an ordinary citizen.
Some people see the voice of Mann Ki Baat as a dialogue, some criticize it from the political perspective, but after a long experience, I don't even think that Mann Ki Baat will change me as a member of every family of India.
I feel like talking about household topics in some household.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, all those who have been in such high positions gave importance to the voice of Mann Ki Baat by giving away their golden time.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given me a new dimension.
Some of our friends used to talk to me sometimes while working on the book Mann Ki Baat.
I am indebted to Akbar Sahab.
My dear countrymen, when we meet next time, there will be rainy season in all parts of the country, the climate will change, the results of the exams will come, the learning will start again.
Come, let us all come together in this environment and let us move ahead with the love of nature.
My best wishes to all of you.
Every time such powerful instruments come in the mindset of Mann Ki Baat, detailed analysis is being carried out by the government.
What are the types of complaints and what is the experience of the people
We can generally see that advising others is the nature of human beings.
When we travel in trains, buses and buses, if someone coughs then it is our nature to advise and advise someone to do this.
Initially, when there were suggestions on Mann Ki Baat, there were suggestions on it, it was a habit for many of us that it was a habit, but when we tried to approach it, I was indeed in a very happy flood.
After I mentioned, do you know that in the Narendra Modi App, MyGov portal has adopted innovative methods to prevent food wastage from all corners of the country
I don't even think that the younger generation of our country has been engaged in this thing for a long time.
We know that some social organisations are going on for years, but the youth of my country are engaged in this thing.
Many have sent me videos.
Roti Banks are being run in many places.
People offer bread from their side, they bring vegetables and those who need it, they come and get it.
The supplier is also happy and the buyer doesn't need to think of himself inferior.
This is an example of how to work with cooperation in society.
Today is the last day of April.
The foundation day of the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra is coming in May.
On this occasion, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of both the states.
Both the states have been making constant efforts to scale new heights of development and have contributed to the progress of the nation.
There has been a continuous emergence of great men in both the states and their lives in every sphere of society have inspired us.
Remembering these great souls, on the eve of the States, on the eve of the year 2022, when 75 years of independence, we will have to take a pledge to uplift our states, our nation, our society, our city and our family on the eve of the States.
We have to move forward in collaboration with all the citizens to realize that commitment.
I once again convey my best wishes to the people of these two states.
There was a time when climate change was only a matter of discussion at the level of academics and seminars, but today, in our daily lives, we are experiencing it and we are experiencing it.
Nature has changed the rules and regulations of its dance.
This time we have to enjoy the warmth of our country in the months of May-June this year in the months of March-April.
While I was considering peoples advice on Mann Ki Baat, most of the suggestions were about what we should do during the summer.
Although all the things are known and not new, it is very useful to re-think them at the right time.
Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra, D.
In the balcony, they have said that water should be placed in the upper stairs.
I have seen that even small children in the family do this thing better.
If they consider why they have to fill the water, they will leave ten times a day in the vessel.
Besides this, the birds shall come and drink, and behold the snare of the eye.
This may appear to us as a sport, but in reality, the wonderful experience of compassion has been enhancing in those pinch minds.
In our country, the composite life of birds, birds and nature is naturally mixed with our pulse nerves, but at the same time it is important to strengthen the efforts at the social level.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Dharmaguru Saiyatna Sahib of the Dawoodi Bohra community had completed 100 years.
He lived for 103 years.
In order to celebrate 100 years of his birth, Bohra community organized a massive movement to protect the gurus through the Burhani Foundation.
It also got place in the Ginnace World Records Book.
Sometimes we are so nervous that even if someone comes to our doorsteps like a dairy man, a vegetable seller and a postman, we forget to ask if you drink water in the summer.
My young friends, I would like to share some things with you.
Sometimes I am worried that some of our younger generations want to live in a comfortable place and a comfortable place.
Mother and father develop them in a very safe manner.
In such a way, there are others, but most people are in luxury circles.
Now the exams have been completed and you must have made plans to spend your holidays.
The summer vacation will be a bit sweet after the heat is over.
I would like to give you three suggestions to utilise your vacation time, all three of which are special, but I will try to do something or the other.
Take a new experience, strive and acquire a new talent, and go to a place where nobody has ever heard, no, no, no, no, no, no.
New places, new experiences and new skills will be available.
The test must be constructive and come out of your luxury circle.
We are from middle class families and are a comfortable family.
In the evening, take your football or basket or take other sports products and go to the neighbourhood of the poor.
Look at it with the poor kids and you will realise that you will get the joy that you have not yet got during your lifetime.
When such a poor child gets the pleasure of playing with you in the society then how big changes will be brought about in their lives
Once you go, you'll feel like going there again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many volunteers are engaged in service.
You should associate yourselves with a cow dung guru and associate yourself with some organisation for 15 days and 20 days.
Sometimes a summer camp will be organised, governance development camps will be organised, various constructive camps will be organised and you will be connected to them.
After participating in such camps, after you have been selected, you should teach the poor that you have learnt as a service free of cost and the opportunity to learn these things.
You can teach them how to do it.
Though technology is considered to be a means of reducing distances and destruction of borders, the evil consequences of these things are scattering my mind.
Six people in one house are sitting in one room but they cannot even imagine the distance between them.
Why
Everyone is swallowed up because of technology.
Social nature is a good value, social nature is an energy.
Another thing I have said is about talent and don't you want to learn something new
Sometimes there is a fear that our younger generation is becoming robots.
Friends, the dreams that we see in life are all good things.
But we should not interfere with the human elements within us, it should be kept in mind that we do not leave our humanity.
Can't we focus on skill development
A little away from technology, we are trying to spend time with us.
If you don't know swimming, you can learn swimming, you can learn painting, you can't draw excellently, but you can write Maitha in paper.
The feelings within you will start reflecting in it.
You will realise that all these capabilities and these activities will not only give you happiness but will also remove the restrictions that you have built on one side.
Do something different, guys
This is your opportunity to build your lives.
If you think that after all the exams have been completed, after a new level of your business, you will never get the opportunity.
That is why I want to tell you that if there is a country that learns Magic then you can learn the textbook.
Please do this to your friends.
If there is anything you don't know, try to learn it and it will definitely benefit you.
Awakening the creative efficiency that is within you, it will provide a wonderful platform for development.
Friends, we cannot imagine what we have to learn in the world, what I have seen in my experience.
There is a lot of new places, new cities, new villages and new areas.
Don't think of traveling too much.
Go to a place and spend 3-4 days there and then go to the next place and spend 3-4 days there.
This will give you a lot of things to learn.
Friends, this time the government of India has given you a wonderful opportunity.
The new generation has virtually left cash transactions.
Whatever you are involved in it, but you can also earn through this scheme and do you know about a scheme of the Government of India
But someone else can recommend it.
You can connect others with it and if that new person does 3 transactions then you will get 10 rupees.
In your accounts, 10 rupees will be deposited on the government side.
If you say that you have saved 20 people in one day, then within the evening, 200 rupees will be deposited in your repository.
Businessmen can also earn through this and students can also earn through this.
The project is scheduled upto 14th October, 2018.
You can make your contribution towards making Digital India.
You are the protectors of New India.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Greetings, Prime Minister, I am addressing Shiva Saubey from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I'd like to talk about the bright red light.
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic jam, I don't have to wait for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this decision taken by you people.
The government's decision to abolish the red light is a systematic measure.
But this culture, which is rooted in the mind, has to be rooted out.
If we all work together with awareness, we can overcome it.
When I say that my aim is clear - Everi Burson is Important, everyone is important.
If we accept the significance of 125 crore people, if we realise the importance of 125 crore people then it will be the greatest power to realise the greatest dreams.
We all have to do this together.
This year we are celebrating the 1000th anniversary of the 125 crore Indians.
Because of some reason we were stuck in the potholes, we were very small, we were used to think only about the centuries.
Centuries of other countries in the world are also considered to be very important.
Just imagine.
Even today, how difficult it is to break out the social conditions
How could it have been a thousand years ago
Only a few would know that Ramanujar had unleashed a massive struggle against the bitterness of society, the feeling that he was superior and inadequate, the state of caste.
He embraced and performed the task of embracing whom society considered to be incurable.
Thousands of years ago, he organised a movement to enter their temples and successfully entered the temple.
The Government of India will release a commemorative postage stamp on the 1st of May, 2019 to commemorate the commemoration of Shri Ramanujacharya.
I salute the holy Lord Ramanujacharya and see my devotional flowers.
My dear countrymen, there is another significance for 1st May tomorrow.
Workers in many parts of the world observe this as a day.
While speaking on the day of the workers, there is talk of labour and labour, and naturally I am reminded of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today, we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the concessions and honours being given to the workers.
The contribution of Baba Saheb for the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, while we talk about Baba Saheb, while talking about the holy Ramnujacharya, we have got the opportunity to remember the great saint and social reformer of Karnataka who lived in the 12th century, Jagadguru Basaveshwar ji.
He also had the opportunity to release a volume of his gold.
In the language of Kannada in the twelfth century, he spoke deeply about labour and labour.
In Kannada, he has called Gaya Kave Kailas, which means that only through labour can you attain the handicrafts of Lord Shiva, that is, only through action can heaven be reached.
While talking about the workers, it is natural to think about Tatopanth coconut.
My dear countrymen, a few days later we are celebrating Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world are happy to celebrate this festival.
Lord Buddhas thoughts are very relevant when the world looks at the violence, war, destruction and the conflict of arms.
Buddhism is a great example of the passing away of Ashoka's life war in India.
This auspicious day of Buddha Purnima is celebrated by the United Nations as Visakhapatnam.
This year's celebration will take place in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious day, I have got the opportunity to pay my tributes to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Especially for our neighbours.
We want to be in tune with our neighbouring countries and they also want to move forward.
There are many possibilities.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The capabilities and amenities of the Satellite will significantly help in economic and developmental activities in South Asia.
This is a good example of our vision for South Asia.
In every corner of the country, many families have joined the preparations for the selection of their children.
Today is 26th March.
It is a matter of pride for us that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are the wealth of all of us.
Jallianwala Bagh massacre was unleashed in 1919, when Rabindranath Tagore was one of the gentlemen who raised his voice against the massacre.
The massacre had a profound impact on the minds of a child full of twelve years.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, the British executed Bhagat Singh and his comrades Sukdev and Rajguru.
During the tragic incident on 23rd March, the faces of martyrs such as Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru enjoyed the blessings of Mother India and there was no fear of death.
They had blessed all the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three are still a fool for all of us.
The sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru cannot be uttered in words.
The entire British empire saw these three people and trembled.
They were imprisoned, the execution was confirmed, but the British were worried about how to treat them.
Several years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time then I could feel a shock on that land.
I appeal to the youth of the country that whenever you have the opportunity to visit Punjab, you must visit the places where the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru and Mother of Bhagat Singh and Bhageshwar Dutt are located.
It was a period of freedom and its intensity.
On the one hand, soldiers like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru used to inspire the youth to carry out armed revolution.
Approximately 100 years ago, in April, 1917, Gandhiji had performed Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in Champaran, the expression of Gandhijis thoughts and the ways of Gandhiji were expressed in the freedom struggle of India.
This was a turning point in the journey of freedom struggle, particularly from the point of view of ways of struggle.
It was the era of the deep impact of Gandhiji's thoughts and methods on Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha and Mill Workers Strike in Ahmedabad.
Gandhiji returned from abroad in 1915 and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new impetus to the country.
Today, we cannot estimate the Champaran Satyagraha in our hearts by keeping in mind Gandhiji.
Just imagine, the person who returned to India in 1915, experienced only two years...
He highlighted the magnificent power of Gandhijis integration through Champaran Satyagraha, the power to know the pulse of the Indian society, the power to inspire the poorest and the illiterate masses against the British and to bring them to the stage of struggle.
We can learn from him how to start public life and how to work for it and how to work for it.
The great leaders of that period like Rajendra Babu and Acharya Krupalani were all asked to go to the village by Gandhiji.
He taught people how to connect their work with the freedom struggle.
Today, we are traveling in the 21st century. Who would not want to change India in today's era, who wouldn't want to take part in the transformation of an Indian
This desire of 125 crore countrymen and their efforts for transformation will be a strong foundation for the creation of a New India.
New India is not a scheme of the government.
New India is the challenge of 125 crore people.
This is the feeling that 125 crore Indians should come together to build a New India.
This is a desire, a desire, a commitment and a thirst for the hearts of 125 crore Indians.
Peacefully, they are engaged in this kind of work like those who have been voluntarily voluntary.
Many people go to hospital every day and assist patients.
As soon as the news was asked, there were many people who ran away and donated blood.
If someone is starving, there are people who are good at feeding them.
Our country is a land of such valueless values.
Peoples service is called megasan service, it is all in our pulse nerves.
If we look at it as a whole, if we look at it in an integrated manner then how immense power it is.
When we talk about a New India, it is natural for us to get the criticisms of this idea that can be accepted in a democratic way.
But if the 125 crore countrymen have made a solemn pledge, if they decide their path, if they start taking steps one after the other then the dream of 125 crore countrymen of cooking a New India will be realised when we look at it.
It is not necessary that all matters should be included in the budget or the government scheme or to be spent on government money.
That is, I want to say that every citizen of the country should perform his duties as a citizen and should realise his responsibilities and work as a citizen.
Why shouldn't we take this journey, which will transform our autonomy into good faith, with regulation and dedication
I invite you to come and participate in this journey.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you today.
Over the past few months, a large number of people in our country have participated in Digital Payments Digital movement.
There is a lot of progress in the digital payment system after demonetization.
It has been only 2-3 months since we started the BHIM App, so far about 1. 5 crore people have left it behind.
My dear countrymen, we have to move forward in the fight against black money and corruption.
Can 125 crore people of the country fulfil the commitment of making digital transactions worth Rs. 12 lakh crore this year
In order to implement this, we can pay the school fee digitally, we can make travel ticket fees digitally for a train or aeroplane, we can purchase medicines digitally, if we are a cheap food shopkeeper, we can make digital payments.
In the past, several programmes for Digital Celebrations have been organised for public awareness.
100 programmes have been taken up across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
70,000 businessmen won the prizes.
Everyone is determined to take this work forward.
A big movement is also being organised.
I believe that we will create awareness about the BHIM App even more than the time we have spent on Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
We have to contribute to reducing cash usage.
My dear countrymen, every time you have been offering me a variety of suggestions that I would urge you to give advice on the Mann Ki Baat programme.
But I can see that in your suggestions you have always put greater pressure on cleanliness.
This river is passing through the Rispana bridge and it runs near my house.
We tried to create awareness among the people about the pollution of the river by going to a part of it and walking on foot but it did not benefit from it.
I urge you to send a team from your side or to create awareness about this thing through the newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, look at the pain in the minds of a student studying in class 11.
I see this as a good sign.
Awareness has also started since the commencement of the cleanliness drive.
Everyone has brought them constructively together.
This has emerged as a mass movement.
Humiliation against dirt has been increasing.
Be it awareness or be it creative contribution or be it a movement, there is definitely a significance.
Though the work is difficult, it has to be done.
I am confident that this feeling that has emerged from the new generation of our country, children, students and youth is indicative of a good sign.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat, everybody who has been listening to Gayatri's thoughts, I want to say something to all of them - the message that Gayatri has given to all of us must be a message.
My dear countrymen, since the beginning of Mann Ki Baat, I have had many suggestions about wasting my food.
We all know that when we feed in our homes and public events, we take more food than we need in our layers.
Have we ever imagined how much destruction is caused by the remaining remaining remains that we leave
If we don't save the rest, how many poor people would this be helpful in providing food
But the illusion shown in this regard is a great treachery against society.
This is injustice against the poor.
On the other hand, if you don't waste food, savings will result in economic benefits for the family.
This is a good thing when we think socially but when we look at it familyly then this is a useful thing.
I want to be more aware of this.
I know some youngsters who are running the campaign by creating a mobile app
If there is no food anywhere, they will be informed that they will collect the remaining food and share it to the needy.
This is the way in which the youth of our country is working for this thing.
You can meet such people anywhere in every state of India.
You see the ways to transform these things.
They will always say that those who are aware of health should keep a little less in the leaf and fill the stomach a little less.
7th April is World Health Day.
Universal Health Coverage (UNHC) has set the goal of healthcare for all by 2030.
A study says that more than 35 million people around the world are suffering from depression.
Tell your friends, parents, brothers and sisters, faculty and speak according to what is inside you.
Have you ever wondered why they are acting like this
You must understand that they are in the first step of depression.
Peace, depression, mental and physical disorders.
Just as diabetes provides a comfortable base for all kinds of diseases, depression also cripples all our capabilities in fighting against extreme conditions, self-sufficiency and decision-making.
If you are unable to speak openly to your colleagues then people should work with the feeling of service in some place near you.
Contribute in full swing and service, participate in their comfort, you can see your grief on your own.
And if you try to understand the sorrow of others, if you do it with the spirit of service, then a self-confidence will be instilled in you.
By interacting with others and by providing selfless service to others, you can easily dissolve and dissolve the burden on your mind.
Similarly, Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
You can start your efforts from now on.
Make sure that millions of people participate socially in Yoga Day.
If there is any suggestion in your mind about the 3rd International Day of Yoga, you must send your suggestions to me through the mobile app and guide me.
You can create songs and compositions related to Yoga, so that the understanding of the people can increase.
Today, I want to talk to mothers and sisters about one thing and today we have talked about several things about health.
In the last few days, the government has taken a major resolution.
The number of women working in our country is increasing day by day, their contribution is increasing and this is a welcome thing.
My dear countrymen, Ram Navami on 5th April and Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April and Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April are going to come.
May the lives of these great men always inspire us and give us the strength to cook a new India.
After spring, when crops start growing old and the farmers get the benefits of labour then this is the case.
This new year is celebrated in many corner of our country on several paths.
My New Year greetings to all of you.
The snow is now disappearing.
Spring is registering its presence in the lives of all of us.
After the autumn, new turtles have started blossoming in the trees, flowers flowering, forests, gardens and gardens are boiling in greenery.
Besides flowers, fruits are also shining in Adhavan's crown.
Mangani's pigeons have started to appear in the summer season.
Turmeric flowers of mustard beans in the fields give confidence to the farmers.
Martial flowers of priestly flowers commemorate the visit of Holi.
Ameer Kusru has described these moments of climate change as very tasty.
The fields are blooming with hard crops, the peacocks are blooming, the ears are flowering, the ears are flowering, the eagles are crying, the ecosystem is comfortable when the emergence of the natural cave, the environment is comfortable, the man is also enjoying the sweetness of this environment.
Spring panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals are enjoying flowers in the life of man.
In the ecosystem of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are going to finish the Stock Month and welcome the New Month.
Spring is a combination of these two months.
Whenever I hear your suggestions before Mann Ki Baat, I express my gratitude to the millions and millions of people for sending me many suggestions and helping me.
My thanks to all of you who have contributed in every way in the Narendra Modi App, in Twitter, in Facebook, through letters.
In the Narendra Modi App, Shri Shoba Jalan ji said that a lot of public does not know about the achievements of the ISRO.
He further said that you must also inform about 104 satellites and intercepted missiles.
Shobaji, thank you very much for recalling the glorious example of India.
Our scientists have embraced India on the world stage.
We all know that ISRO has succeeded in achieving many surprising achievements over the last few years.
ISRO has achieved a new world record in the space sector a few days ago, since Tuesday was successful in sending Mangalyaan to the planet.
At the same time, 104 satellites from different countries have been successfully launched in India.
This is a great historic achievement not only for ISRO but also for the entire India.
ISRO's low-cost space programme has made the world surprising, and the whole world has appreciated the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 satellites is of immense significance - Cartosat 2T - is Indias satellite, which will help in identifying mineral resources, infrastructure, development evaluation and planning for urban development.
In particular, the number of baths in the country, how they can be used and how they should be taken care of, our new satellite Cartosat 2D will be an aid to my farmer brothers and sisters.
As soon as we reach, our satellite has sent a few films.
It has begun to do its job.
It is a matter of great pleasure for all of us that all these works have been done under the leadership of our young social scientists and our women scientists.
This great contribution of young scientists and women scientists is a matter of great pride for the success of ISRO.
On behalf of the countrymen, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the scientists of ISRO.
Your objective of implementing space science for the public, keeping in mind the work of the nation is to keep sustainable as it is today, you are making several new achievements every day.
Whatever appreciations our scientists and their entire team, all of them are less.
India has successfully tested a missile to intercept continental missiles in the defence sector.
This is a major achievement in the defence sector.
It will give you even greater pleasure that these technological capabilities in the world are only with four countries of the world.
Indian scientists have achieved this.
Its strength is that even though a missile is coming from far flung areas to attack India, it is capable of destroying it in our missile system.
When we see new technologies, we see some new scientific achievements then our people are happy.
In the universe, the mind of man has been trying hard to find out the rules of creation.
New science and new technologies have emerged from this.
Every technology has created a new era in every new scientific form.
Dear youngsters, while talking about the hard work of science and scientists, I have often expressed my heartfelt desire to inspire our younger generation towards science.
Many scientists need the country.
Today's scientists are the factors of a stable change in the life of generations that emerge in the era.
No science jumped from heaven in full.
Gandhiji says that all scientific achievements have been achieved through experience.
Respected Babu ji has said that the real philosophy should not be forgotten by appreciating the thirst, perseverance and sacrifice of our neo-scientists.
Scientists must make the need of the people concentrate on how to adapt the principles to the principles, what kind of technology is the means for them, so that it can become an important role for the common man.
Over the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had organised a special event on the occasion of the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
In 2005, there was heavy rains in Mumbai, floods, oceans showed anger and suffered a lot.
Any natural calamity occurs, it is the doors of a poor household.
Two people decided to find a solution, they saved the house in such difficult times and saved the households from floods and improved a house that can prevent water-borne diseases.
I could see a lot of innovations like this.
I would like to say that many people have contributed to this kind of contribution in the country.
Our society is also becoming a society with the help of technology.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
Digital has been given a lot of importance in the past.
Gradually, people are moving from cash transactions to digital transactions.
Digital payments in India are growing at a rapid pace.
In particular, younger generations are getting digital payments on their mobile phones.
I see this as a good sign.
Over the last few days in our country, there has been a huge reception for the Lacky Grahak Yojana, the lucky consumer scheme, the Digital Business Yojana and the Digital Business Programme.
About two months ago, 15000 people have received a prize of one thousand rupees per day.
Through these two schemes, Digital procurement in India is becoming a peoples movement and the entire nation has welcomed it.
It is a matter of great pleasure that so far, 10 lakh people have received prizes, more than 50,000 traders have received prizes, more than Rs.
Under this scheme, more than a hundred traders have received one lakh prizes.
More than 4000 businessmen have received a premium of 50,000 rupees.
A lot of people like farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, industrialists, housewives and students are getting the benefit of this thing.
When I looked at it, I came to know that not only the youth, but also the elderly, had participated in it, including a 15-year-old boy and a 65-70-year-old senior citizen.
Santosh ji has expressed his happiness in the Narendra Modi App from Mysore and he has received 1000 rupees through the Lucky Clients Scheme (Lucky Crahak Yojana).
But I would like to share with you what I think is important in his writings.
Happy Gentlemen, your name and your work gives us joy.
You are doing a very inspiring job.
Sabir, a 22-year-old car driver from Delhi, has started using digital transactions in his industry after demonetisation. He has received a prize of Rs. 1 lakh in the government's fortunate customer scheme.
Today, even if he is driving a car, he has become the ambassador of this project in a way.
He will share information on digital payments with all passengers travelling in his car.
He is enthusiasticly sharing things and encouraging others.
Pooja Nemade, a young friend from Maharashtra, shares her experiences with her friends about how her family uses RuPay card and e-wallet.
Please come to the leadership of this movement.
You take this forward, this has an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
In my view, all those who are joining themselves in this task are the new warriors against corruption.
In a way you are the fighters of honesty.
The biggest prize winners will be held on April 14th.
There are still about 40-45 days left.
Can you do a job to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Just a few days back, Babasaheb Ambedkar passed his 125th birth anniversary.
To commemorate his memory, you should teach at least 125 people to display the BHIM App.
May this time be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the BHIM App and be a very important one
I would also like to mention this thing that we should strengthen the foundation of Baba Saheb.
You must ensure that the BHIM App reaches the hands of 125 crore people by going home and connecting everyone with it.
Due to the impact of this movement in the last two-three months, there has been a great impact on several cities, villages and cities.
Fellow Citizens, agriculture is the cornerstone of the economic system of our country.
The economic strength of the villages is boosting the economic pace of the country.
I would like to share a happy news with you today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and filled the stores.
This year there has been an unprecedented yield due to the hard work of the farmers of our country.
All the indicators show that our farmer brothers and sisters have defeated the old achievements.
Looking at the gathering, today we are celebrating the festival of Pongal and Paisakhi.
This year, gained more than 2,200 million tonnes.
This is 8 higher than the last achievement of our farmers.
In fact, this is an amazing achievement.
I would especially like to express my gratitude to the farmers of the country.
There is another reason to thank the farmers that apart from growing traditional foodgrains, they have also cultivated a variety of pulses because it is very rich in pulses.
The voice of the poor has fallen in the ears of my country's farmers, who have cultivated a variety of pulses in nearly two hundred and ninety hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but it is a great service to the poor of my country by the farmers.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the farmer brothers and sisters of the country who have made a record in the pulses collection by listening to my request.
Dear countrymen, in our country, everybody is travelling towards cleanliness through the government, through the society, through the organisations and movements.
In a way, everyone is somehow aware of cleanliness.
The government is engaged in uninterrupted efforts.
During the past, a programme for senior officers of 23 State Governments was held in Telangana under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation.
The seminar was not held within the closed rooms of the weekend in Telugu state, but was underscored by the importance of cleanliness at the grassroots.
In February 17-18, a training to evacuate toilets was started in Hyderabad.
Officials demonstrated how the toilets in 6 houses were wasted and cleaned, removed the toilets with two-house toilets and brought them back to use.
They demonstrated how comfortable the toilets used in this new strategy are, from waste to cleaning, there is no problem, there is no psychological barrier, there is no barrier.
Just as we are simply cleaning, we can also clean toilets.
An average Double Town Tower for a family of 6 members will be completed in about 5 years.
After this, the waste can be easily removed and it can be reversed to the second pack.
The number of things that are highlighted in it will be equally beneficial.
Even in the government, various departments are organising swachhta-related swachhta-related meetings every two weeks.
In the first meeting to be held in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs will collaborate to strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan.
In the second meeting of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Rejuvenation of River Ganga will take forward the Swachhta Mission for the last two weeks of March.
Any citizen in our country is engaged in good work, the entire country is feeling a new energy, it is boosting self-confidence.
We welcomed the adventures of our disabled sportspersons at the Rio Paralympics.
At the end of the T20 World Cup for Visually Impaired held this month, India defeated Pakistan and became the world champion for the second consecutive term and made the nation proud.
Once again I congratulate all the soldiers of the group.
The achievements of our disabled friends in the country make us proud.
I have always believed that our brothers and sisters with disabilities are more capable, full of dedication, achievers and mindset.
Every moment we have to learn from them.
Whether it is in sports or in space science, women of our country are not helpless.
They are moving ahead simultaneously and are enlightening the country's good name through their achievements.
Over the past few days, our women boys have won the silver medal in the Asian Rackbi Sevens Games.
My best wishes to all of you.
World Womens Day is being celebrated on 8th March.
In India, there is a need to increase awareness and understanding in the family and society to give importance to the girl child.
Today, this is not just a government scheme.
In a social understanding, it has emerged as a movement of education for all.
In the last year, this scheme has linked the people's society, it has kept this important thing in mind every corner of the country, it has transformed the mindset of the people about the old habits that have been going on for decades.
When it comes to ears that festivals are taking place after listening to the news of the birth of a girl child, it gives a lot of pleasure to mind.
In a way, a positive attitude towards the girl child is becoming a result of social consciousness.
I have heard that due to a special drive in Tamil Nadu district, Baliyan has been blocked.
So far, more than 175 child marriages have been blocked.
The District Administration has started banking accounts in the name of more than 55-60 thousand girl children under the SAMRUTI scheme.
According to the convergence model of Convergence Model in Dhawa district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments are engaged in the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao programme, Gram Sabhas are being organized and efforts are being made to ensure the adoption of orphaned girl children and their education through the district administration.
In Madhya Pradesh, a movement is going on for the education of every household girl child in every village under the scheme of Doordarshan.
There is a movement to re-school our children, our school, our movement in Rajasthan and to re-school the girls who have stopped schooling in half the country and re-school them.
I have to say that the movement of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao is being carried out in different forms.
This entire movement has become a mass movement.
This is accompanied by new imaginations.
It is being revamped according to regional requirements.
I consider this as a good sign.
When we celebrate the 8th of March as Womens Day, we must be united. Our Indian women, they are not very much in power, they are not very less.
You have come together constructively.
I have got a lot of things to learn from you.
I am blessed with the feelings of world behaviour, the condition of the villages and the feeling of compassion for the poor.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Our forefathers have made the system of cycle, economic cycle and social life an excellent place so that there should never be a recession in society in any circumstances.
In the last few days, we have celebrated several festivals.
Even after thousands of years, every festival is filling itself with a new inspiration and a new energy...
Sometimes he picked up the mountain, sometimes he took up the task of removing the food leaf, that is, we can feel an innovation in every activity.
Therefore, when I talk to you today, my thoughts are going to breastfeed two Mohans.
One is Mohan who bears the Sudarshan Chakra and the other is Mohan who bears arqa.
Mohn, bearing the Sudarshan wheel, drove off the banks of the river Jamaican, and went to the sea shores of Gujarat, and drove into the city of Dwarkah: but Mohano, who came to the shores of the sea, comes to the shores of Jamaican, and breathes his last in Delhi.
Mohan, who bears the Sudarshan Chakra, used his intellect, his duties, his ability and his thoughts in accordance with the circumstances of that period, to avoid war and to live without conflict thousands of years ago
At the same time, arqa bearing Mohano gave a new shape to the freedom struggle, to secure the country's independence, to protect human values, to empower the fundamental elements of governance and to give a new dimension to the entire world, which is still unique.
What is the importance of selfless service, what is the significance of wisdom, what is the significance of smoking in the middle of all the ups and downs of life
Today, while we are talking about festivals, India is engaged in a big celebration.
Not only India but the entire world is talking about it.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On 2nd October, 1869, at Porbandar on the seashore, today we have created an era, not an individual, in a small house called Keerti Mantra.
This has given a new dimension to the entire history of mankind and made a new achievement.
And there was always a thing connected with Gandhiji, in a way it was a permanent part of his life, it was service, compassion and service.
If we look at his entire life, he served the people of the societies that were suffering from apartheid in South Africa, and at that time there was nothing small, sir.
He served the oppressed farmers in Champaran region.
If anyone requires help at any time, he will be helpful in serving.
He not only insisted on service but also on the spiritual comfort associated with service.
But with this, the experience of enjoyment and self-sufficiency is also imbibed in service.
This is clearly understood through the lives of our mothers.
For Gandhiji, individuality, society, humanity and humanity are all.
Whether it is Africa's Phoenix Farm or Dalstoy Farm or Sabarmati Ashram or Vartha, he has always insisted on social mobilization in a different way everywhere.
I believe that I have got the privilege of visiting many important places associated with my brothers and I have got the opportunity to pay my homage there.
When it comes to society, there is one strength for it and in the event of Gandhi 150, there should be social expression and service.
Whatever Mann Ki Baat feels, it must be a good will, a good intention, a harmonious one, a service with full dedication and a spirit of compassion and a spirit of compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I had gone to Thandi in Gujarat.
Thandi, who was known for the Salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, was a major turning point.
In Tandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mother India.
I also urge you all to visit some place related to Anal Gandhi Ji.
Several events, competitions and exhibitions have been planned in the coming days.
But on this occasion, I would like to share with you a very interesting thing.
This time, in Venice Biennale, there are many interesting displays filled with Gandhiji's memories at the Indian Gallery.
The part of Haripura is very interesting.
You must remember that during the Haripura Congress convention of Gujarat, the event that was chosen as the leader of Subhas Chandra Bose was recorded in history.
A very beautiful past has been embraced in these art areas.
Prior to the Congress's Haripura conference in 1937-38, the then Chief Minister of Shanti Nikedhan's Kala Bhawan had called for Nandlal Bose.
Gandhiji wanted the lifestyle of the people of India to be displayed through art and exhibition at the conference.
This is the handiwork of the same Nandla Bose who is enhancing the beauty of our Constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited the villages adjacent to Haripura and finally painted the paintings to showcase rural life.
There were serious discussions in Venice about these priceless works.
Once again, with good wishes on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, every Indian should make a solemn pledge.
We have to do something for the country, for the society, for something good.
This can be a reverence and admiration for the good, genuine activity that we can do in the field.
Brothers and sisters of Mother India, all of you must remember that for the last few years, we have been running the Swachhta Hi Seva movement for two weeks before the 2nd of October.
This will commence on 11th September.
There is enthusiasm in all sections of society for this movement.
All my merchant brothers and sisters are hanging a table in their shops and they have written that when they come out of their house, they should be brave.
This will save money and contribute to protecting the environment.
This time, on the 2nd of October, when we mark the 150th birth anniversary of our mother, we will dedicate an India free from open defecation and at the same time we will have to lay the foundation for a new peoples movement against awareness.
I urge all sections of the society, every village, every small area and every citizen of the country to bow down and bow down to the city. This year we have to celebrate Gandhi Jayanti in a way to free our mother India from defecation.
I appeal to the private corporations to come forward to remove all these products after the collection.
They can be recycled.
They can produce fuel.
But there was a lot in the past.
Today, I want to touch a matter of greater importance than a sumscreen gold.
This is a matter written centuries ago but even today, do you know how important it is
The peacocks are known as gems.
Food has always been given great importance in our culture.
In any case, we have scientificized even the knowledge of food.
We need a balanced and nutritious diet, especially for women and infants, because these are the future foundations of our society.
Nutrition Mission i. e. under Nutrition Mission and nutrition in modern ways across the country is becoming a mass movement.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once a matter was brought to my attention.
In Nasik, there was a massive movement called Diabetes Grain.
During the harvest days, Anganwadi sisters collect a handful of grains from the people.
These cereals are used for hot food prepared for children and women.
This ritual is done when the child is being given solid food for the first time.
Not liquid food, solid food.
This is a wonderful effort and it can be implemented everywhere.
In many states, people have started a movement called Didi Bhojanam.
The family members prepare a nutritious diet, prepare a tasty meal and go to Anganwadi, go to schools, where the family members transfer their food and feed their own children.
They share their happiness and when they share that happiness then it does not diminish.
With the feeling of service, the feeling of joy is a wonderful union.
Friends, through such small things, we can intensify a strong war against malnutrition in our country.
Today, due to lack of awareness, the poor and the self-sufficient, both are suffering from malnutrition.
We will celebrate the month of September as a nutrition movement across the country.
You must associate yourself with this and get information and add new ideas to it.
If you bring out one or two people out of malnutrition then we can bring the country out of malnutrition.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I had a lot of confidence that one question would be asked about this thing.
Moreover, during the last few weeks, whenever I visited people, there was talk about Man Vs Wild.
I have never imagined that I will get such an opportunity to get a place in the minds of the youth of the world.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
As the Prime Minister, whenever I have the opportunity to visit, whenever I have the opportunity to visit, how the situation has become due to International Yoga Day, whenever I go to anybody in the world and whenever I have the opportunity to visit, they start questioning me about Yoga for 5-6 minutes.
Until now, I have become a world leader who has no debate on Yoga and this has been my experience all over the world.
But nowadays a new experience is being experienced.
Whoever I meet, whenever I get the opportunity, they talk about the issues related to forest creatures and debate on the environment.
165 countries are planning to telecast this programme in their language.
But one more interesting thing, some people ask me a thing with a little embarrassment, Modi ji, you are speaking in Hindi, Bear Grylls didn't know Hindi, how could you talk so fast among you
Has this been subsequently compiled
Look, there is no secret in this.
The reality is that the technology used to communicate with Bear Grylls was fully utilized.
After this event, a large number of people have started discussing with me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also go to places connected with nature and forest creatures.
I had told you earlier and I would like to reiterate it again and I would like you to visit the North-Eastern states in your life.
Your life is vast.
Your thoughts will be vast.
I have had the privilege of releasing the census of turtles in the past months.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
The number of tigers in India is 2967.
A few years ago, half of them were in number.
The LTTE-related summit took place in 2010 in St. Petersburg, Russia.
Concerned over the declining number of tigers in the world, it was finally confirmed.
This commitment is to double the number of tigers worldwide by 2022.
But because of this New India, we are achieving the targets at a rapid pace, we have doubled the number of tigers in 2019 itself.
India has not only increased the number of tigers but has also increased the number of protected areas and social security covers.
When I published the data on the LTTE, I was reminded of the lions in the forests of Keer in Gujarat.
I was there as the Chief Minister when the lion's habitat was decreasing in the forests of Keer.
Their number was also declining.
We have taken steps one after the other in the forests of Keer.
In 2007, we decided to place women police in charge there.
We have taken steps to boost tourism.
Whenever we talk about natural and forest creatures, we talk about maintenance only.
Therefore, we need to create a proper environment for our forests, flora and fauna that is sufficient to preserve and protect our forests and forest creatures.
My dear countrymen, who can forget Vivekanand Jis historic address on the eleventh of September, 1893
This young saint of India, who has raised the human society around the world, has left a glimpse of India in the world.
The slavery that the world saw in India, the same world changed the vision of India by listening to the words of Swami Vivekananda on the eleventh of September, 1893.
Come, let us strive to show that whatever form of India Swami Vivekananda ji had seen, whatever strength Swami Vivekananda ji had found in India.
It is within us, everything is there, we will move ahead with self-confidence.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate 29th August as National Sports Day.
It will be your own mission for children, adults, youth and women.
But today I am not going to say anything about their nuances.
I would like to inspire you to create awareness about fitness in your minds. We will collectively set some goals for a sure India, for our nation.
I believe that all of us will be able to free ourselves from witchcraft, we will be able to shout about it on social media platforms.
Thanks a lot.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
On the 26th of January, we celebrated the shores of the country with enthusiasm and joy.
In a way, the Constitution of India, the obligations of the citizens, the duties and the drive we have on the democratic system, is a cultural enthusiast and awakens the future generations by creating awareness about democratic responsibilities.
However, the widespread and deep debate over the duties and rights of the citizens in our country has not yet taken place.
Tomorrow, 30th January is the day of our death anniversary.
At 11 a.m. on 30th January, we will observe 2 minute silence and pay our homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the nation.
As a society and as a nation, it is our unwavering nature to pay two minute silence on January 30 at 11 a.m.
It is not only for two minutes but it has a social character, a sense of dedication and an expression of our concern for the martyrs.
We have expressed our natural respect for our country's military and security forces.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the soldiers and their relatives who have been honoured with various medals for the brave-hearts who have performed this Republic Day.
These medals include Keerthi Chakram, Shaurya Chakram, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I would particularly urge the youth to do a job as you are actively engaged in social media platforms.
Search for the soldiers who have been honoured this time and write two good words on the website and share them with your friends.
When we know deeply about the adventure, valour and might of those soldiers, we will be surprised, proud and inspired.
While we were excited and happy with the news on 26th January, on the other hand, some of our soldiers engaged in the defence of our country in Kachmid on the other hand have lost their lives due to snowfall.
I salute and pay my homage to all the soldiers who laid down their lives.
My young friends, you all know that I have been continuously shouting Mann Ki Baat.
The four months of January, February, March and April have been a challenging month for every family.
Even though there is a choice for a child at home, the entire family is driven by the burden of examinations.
I have always felt that I should come out of this situation and therefore today I would like to talk to my young friends in detail.
I would like to ask you how to make such an environment happy.
I know that even though Creator has asked this question, this question is in your minds.
Examinations must be an occasion of joy.
For most people, the time of selection is a period of pressure.
You should decide whether you consider it as a time of joy or whether you feel it as a time of stress.
Those who believe in a stressful period, they are pleasure for pressure.
Therefore, it is my view that you should consider the time of selection as a festival and a festival.
Whenever there is a festival or celebration, the speciality that is within us is evident.
The entire family must act as a team and enthusiastically contribute to the success of this celebration.
When you look at it, change will take place.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kach to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there is only one choice in these 3-4 months.
It is for all of us to celebrate these 3-4 months in accordance with their family environment by following their traditions, in their own ways.
If you say that you were happy, if you were with the face of fun and frolic, you would feel loyalty and in such a situation even the old things of several years will be easily reflected in your memories.
What the teacher had said in the classroom a year ago will clearly brighten your mindset.
Sympathy will not only fade away but it will also become a burden.
I can enjoy it by feeling it and I can imagine that if we have a feeling of depression, if we forget things and if we have been loyal, then we cannot imagine how many useful things will suddenly come to our mind.
Its not that you don't have information or that you don't work hard.
However, whenever there is pressure, your knowledge and your knowledge will sink away and pressure will drive on you.
That's why a happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet, I would say that a happy mind is the key to the highest marks.
Sometimes I have to say that we don't get the exams from the right point of view.
This is not the speech of your life.
How you lived your life, how you lived, how you lived, how you lived, how you lived, how you lived.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great example of condolence for all of us.
He went to the air force and failed.
Marks have become more important.
This has resulted in increased pressure on the minds of the students.
In such a scenario, I would like to share your views on the contemporary course of education and its future.
If you believe in these things then the marks will be buried behind you like the windstorm.
It is necessary to know what is the status of my knowledge till yesterday and where I have reached today.
If you talk about the world of sports then it will be instantly recorded in mind then I mentioned this example.
Most of the successes take place in their lives because the players compete with them.
You will take the life of Sachin Tendulkar Ji
He has been defeating many achievements for 20 years and has achieved a new milestone by repeating his previous achievements.
His journey of life is amazing because he himself has followed the path of making challenges by leaving competing with others.
Friends, in every sphere of life you will have to write your exams and will you be able to study for 3 hours when you have to study for 2 hours
You might have decided to wake up early in the morning and it might have been delayed but can you get up at the time of the decision
Therefore, I urge you to leave yourself to compete with others and challenge yourself.
What was my activity earlier, it should be careful how I should move forward and how to work better.
With this vision, you will be able to understand the changes that you have made.
S.
Sundar ji, you're absolutely right.
Even today, you might have noticed that those who ask me questions, those who give me advice, there is more number of women in them.
When we look at how mothers are aware of the future of children in homes and are working constructively then we find that they make many things easier.
You should act as a guide in the capacity of yourselves and give up your time for whatever work you may have.
Once you have a habit of accepting, most of your problems will come to an end.
The expectations of parents and teachers are synonymous with their problems.
Acceptance of what exists only indicates the way for solutions to problems.
Expectations make the path even more difficult.
You'll be comfortable loading.
In a way, we go to see the patient and create fear of disease.
I would like to tell my parents that sometimes we also create such a fear among our children.
Have you ever thought of creating a happy environment during the election days
You will see that the environment will change completely.
I got an amazing phone call.
He doesn't want to mention his name.
If you ask why he doesn't want to mention his name, you will understand it.
Greetings, Prime Minister, I don't want to mention my name because of the work done by me in my childhood.
Once there is a habit of insurrection, the thirst for learning in life will be lost.
A telephone call came, "Greetings Prime Minister, my name is Monica and I want to ask you two questions about my exams as I am studying in class 12.
It is a common belief that if students focus on sports, there will be a lack of focus on education.
This basic idea is wrong, this is the root cause of the problem.
If we ask for complete development, there is a life that can cross the syllabus, which is very large.
This is the right time to live and learn that life.
Whether it's a five minute time, you must relax a bit.
You can feel that your work is not difficult.
I don't know if everyone likes it or not, but this is my experience.
During the elections, when I addressed the dais, sometimes my voice would refuse to cooperate.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long you are sleeping.
So far, I have not even thought that there is a connection between my sleep, my speech and my voice, he gave me the basic treatment.
If we understand the significance of such fundamentals then we will get many benefits.
Do not do all this, otherwise your family will be angry with me.
On the day your score comes, if you don't see, I'll look in their eyes.
Please don't do that.
This is an extremely important milestone in keeping the mind, mind and body fit.
Well, young friends, while you are engaged in the arrangements for your exams, I am talking about something and perhaps what I have said today may be a relief for you.
But I also urge you not to consider what I have said as a burden.
If possible, don't do it if you don't.
Remember the resolution you have taken, trust you, go to the polls and my best wishes to all of you.
Transform the challenge into a celebration before facing every challenge.
Then there will be no challenge.
Keep this mantra in mind and move forward.
My dear countrymen, on 1st February 2017, 40 years of Indian Coast Guard will be completed.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to the officers and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their contribution towards the nation.
It is a matter of great pride for us that our coast guard with 126 ships and 62 aircraft is the 4th largest coast guard in the world.
The mantra of Coast Guard is Vayam Raksham.
With this objective, the Coast Guard is awakening day and night in adverse conditions to protect the coastal areas and beaches of the country.
Many people don't know that not only men are there in the coastal guard of our country, but women are also successfully performing their duties by standing shoulder to shoulder.
Our women officers of Coast Guard are not only pilots, monitors, but also driven by a hover grip.
As the Coast Guard has become the worlds biggest issue today, I convey my best wishes to the Indian Coast Guard for its 40th anniversary.
In our country, Vasant Panchami is a big festival of Saraswati Puja.
This is regarded as an occasion to praise education.
Not only that, it is a time that inspires the soldiers.
Mara Range de Basanti Sola, let me be a spring inspiration.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to my countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Spring Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani has always given new colours and new colours to its creative potential.
After the completion of my Mann Ki Baat in the last two months, they are broadcasting Mann Ki Baat in the vernacular languages.
This has received a very warm welcome.
I have got the great opportunity to travel with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Congratulations to all of you.
My dear countrymen, greetings and best wishes to you all on Christmas Day.
Today is the day when service, sacrifice and compassion should be given importance in our lives.
Many wealthy came and gave wealth.
In the end, a poor widow's mother came and threw two cereals.
Let us pay our emotional tributes today on their birth anniversary.
Just two days ago, I had the good opportunity to inaugurate several development projects in Varanasi, the land of Malavia.
I had laid the foundation stone of the prestigious Madan Mohan Malavia Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Centre to be established will be a boon not only for the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is also the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will not forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we also took pride in the field of nuclear energy.
As a party leader, as a parliamentarian and as a minister or prime minister, Atal jis exclusive contribution has made him an example.
Today, on the occasion of Atal ji's birth anniversary, I offer my deepest congratulations to him and I offer my best wishes to him for his excellent health.
As an employee, I have had a great deal to work with Atal ji.
His memories are green in front of my mind.
Today, on the eve of Christmas, the benefits of two schemes are available to the countrymen as gifts.
In a way, both of these could be the beginning of new schemes.
Whether it is village, city, educated, slaves, cashless transactions, how to make cashless businesses and how to buy non-cash products, we can see that the entire country has the keenness to know about it.
Everyone wants to learn the ways and means of learning from each other.
DigiThan Business Programme, which will inspire traders in the same way, will receive awards in the form of Christmas Prize on 25th December.
The project is scheduled for a period of 100 days beginning today.
Every day, 15,000 people will receive a thousand rupees per day.
Digi's business plan is mainly for businessmen.
And the business of the merchants shall be very great, and there shall be a wonderful opportunity for them to shut up their ears.
The scheme is designed to focus on all sections of the society, particularly the poor and the lower middle class
Those who buy goods worth Rs. 50 to Rs. 3000 will get the benefits.
This is not for those who buy more than 3000 rupees.
Even the neighbouring poor can use USSD, feature phone and simple phone to buy goods, sell them and pay the amount, all of them will be benefitted from this scheme.
People in rural areas can buy or sell goods through AEPS and win prizes.
Today, there are about 30 crore RuPay cards in India out of which 20 crore cards are of poor families and Jan Dhan account holders.
These 30 crore people will be able to participate immediately in this prize.
I am confident that the people of the country will take the country in this manner and they will be enthusiastic about getting the necessary information from the youth around them.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to see that awareness is spreading rapidly about how to use technology in the country, how to pay the money in electronic mode and how to pay the amount online.
Over the past few days, cashless business has grown from 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to take this forward.
Businessmen are well aware of how big this resolution is.
Those traders who make digital transactions, who are paying money online instead of cash in their business, have been given income tax concessions.
I congratulate all the states and Union Territories of the country.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Chandrababu Naidu has formed a committee under the leadership of Shriman Chandrababu Naidu and he has been examining several schemes.
At the same time, the governments have started and implemented several schemes in their own way.
I have been told that the State Government of Assam has announced that 10 tax deduction will be given to Digital Payments for Asset Tax and Business License.
If the branches of Rural Banks have made at least two digital transactions from January to March with 75 of their account holders, then the government will get a reward of Rs. 50,000.
The Committee has informed that in order to achieve 100 Digital Payments by 31st March, 2017, Rs. 5 lakh will be given from Government to Digital Payments by way of an excellent Panchayat.
Several organisations have been performing successfully to promote digital transactions for rural poor farmers.
The taste is that this year, compared to last year's GNFC's fertilizer sales, has seen an increase of 27 percent.
80 rupees in place of availability of 100 rupees and 50 rupees in place of availability of 80 rupees and those who are deprived of insurance and health facilities.
But now money is being paid in cashless manner.
Our country is a youth-dominated country.
Technology is the art of our hands.
A country like India should be at the forefront of all countries in this field.
Our youth have made substantial progress through startups.
This is a golden opportunity for the Digital movement.
Our youth should incorporate new ideas, Buddhist technologies and modern methods to strengthen this sector.
At the same time, we have to link ourselves with the movement to get rid of black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I used to pray to you in front of Mann Ki Baat every month to give your suggestions and express your views.
Accordingly, tens of thousands of letters have been accumulated in MyGov and the narendramodi app this time, of which 80-90 percent are related to corruption and black money laundering and demonetization.
After seeing all these things, I feel that they can be classified in three ways.
Some people have written in detail about the difficulties and difficulties being faced by the citizens due to this withdrawal.
Otherwise, they had mentioned about how the poets would adopt new ways of setting up filthy activities and irregularities in many places as the work is being done for the welfare of the country and the sacred work is going on.
My countrymen, I am grateful to you all for writing so many letters to me.
"This is a commendable way in which the money has been brought under control.
Though it is true that all of us citizens are facing difficulties, we are all at the forefront of the fight against corruption.
We are fighting against corruption and black money like a war by the armed forces.'
Gurumani Keval ji writes, every corner of the country is echoed by people everywhere.
They are really transformative factors, agents of change.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to those who have not only tolerated many difficulties themselves but also those who have given a stern answer to those who have been trying to take the people in the wrong direction.
Religious attempts have been made to counter corruption and black money.
Moreover, many people jumped on the floor and used their creative skills and innovation to tear off the pieces of those who spread rumours and highlighted the truth.
When 125 crore people of my country are connected to me, can there be something that is impossible
If the blessings of the poor people are there, isn't it Essen's blessing
I express my gratitude to the people of our country, I offer my greetings to them and people are taking part in this grand event against corruption and black money with full enthusiasm.
I looked forward to a detailed discussion on the political parties' funding for this war against corruption and black money in Parliament.
If there were sittings in the House, there would have been discussions.
It is absolutely wrong to say that political parties have been exempted in all respects.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and black money, they are spending their entire time in search of government grievances.
A question has also been raised why they are often changing the rules.
This government is working for the princely people.
The government has been making efforts to listen to the public after listening to their views.
When they pursue new strategies, we also have to adopt new methods to break their evil minds.
In the ongoing war as Vitag Khandan and Kodaikandan, an end must be made for corrupt big business, drastic practices and black money.
On the other hand, letters have been received from several people about what kind of bad practices are being carried out and what kind of new methods are being used.
On this occasion, I express my heartfelt gratitude to my beloved countrymen.
The Government has created a separate e-mail address to share such information.
Besides, you can also send MyGov online address.
The government has built a glass to fight against all kinds of evils such as the evils you indicate.
When your cooperation is not over, it is very easy to fight.
Third classes of the letter are also in large numbers.
"Mother, don't be afraid, don't hesitate, do whatever you want to do, do whatever you want to do, don't worry, but if you decide to travel on your way, you don't have the right to resolve on your own.
My dear countrymen, the last time when Mann Ki Baat was shouting, in spite of so many odds, our farmer brothers had made stern attempts to break the records of the previous year in the field of seeds.
From the perspective of agriculture, this is an auspicious sign.
Whether it is the worker of this country, the farmer or the youth, the hard work of all of them is going on in a new direction to the country.
Just a few days ago, on the global economic stage, India has made its name proud in many fields.
India has improved in the global rankings through individual indexes as a result of a series of efforts by our skilled countrymen.
Indias ranking in the World Bank report on free trade has risen.
In the World Economic Forum Report on Global Competitiveness, India has jumped 32 places.
We have moved 16 places on the Global Performance Index of 2016 and have moved 19 places on the World Banks Infrastructure Services Performance Index of 2016.
Many other reports indicate the same assessment and India is growing at a rapid pace.
My dear countrymen, this time the people of the country have read the anger of the Parliament.
Everywhere, there is anger over the functioning of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President expressed their frank dissatisfaction.
But even in such a scenario, the mind becomes happy when there are some good things.
Even in the midst of the implementation of the Parliament, the country's attention has not turned out to be an excellent task.
Brothers and sisters, I am happy and proud to say that the government's efforts have been made keeping in mind the goal of development of persons with disabilities.
I express my gratitude to the members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this achievement and I express my gratitude to them on behalf of millions of persons with disabilities across the country.
This government is working towards the welfare of persons with disabilities.
Individually, I also tried to increase its pace by taking this objective forward.
My objective was to ensure that the persons with disabilities get their rights and dignity.
Our differently abled brothers and sisters have strengthened our efforts and beliefs by winning four medals at the Paralympics.
They have not only given pride to the country through their successes but also through their capabilities they have made the people in a marvellous sea.
Our disabled brothers and sisters, like the other citizens of the country, have valuable assets and invaluable energy.
Employment generation for Persons with Disabilities has increased after the enactment of the Act in the interest of Persons with Disabilities.
Reservation limit in government works has been increased to 4 percent.
The Act provides for excellent arrangements for education, facilities and complaints of persons with disabilities.
In the last two years, 4350 camps have been organized for the Divyangjans and you can understand how the government is with the Divyangjans from the fact that 580,000 disabled brothers and sisters have been provided with equipment at a cost of Rs. 352 crore.
A new legislation has been enacted with the passion of the United Nations.
Earlier, the persons with disabilities were classified at 7 levels but now we have made it 21 by enacting the law, out of which 14 new positions have been added.
For the first time, they have got the opportunity to get justice through the integration of certain persons with disabilities.
For example, we have linked Thalassemia, Parkinsons, victims, and those who have been born-born idols.
The Indian Cricket Team has won 4 matches in the Test against the United Kingdom.
The performance of some youngsters is commendable.
The young man of our country, Shri Krun Nair, slapped 3 percent.
KL Rahul scored 199 runs.
Not only did Desert Captain Virat Kohli make a very good interview, but also led him well.
Indian cricket team off spinner R.
Ashwin's name was declared by the International Cricket Team, Cricketer of the Year, ICC 2016 and the Best Test Cricketer.
My congratulations and best wishes to all of them.
In the hockey sector, a wonderful, very good news has been received after 15 years.
The Junior Hockey team has won the World Cup.
This achievement is an auspicious sign for the future of India's hockey fire.
Last month, our women women have also worked well.
If the Indian women's hockey team won the Asian Championships, India's women's hockey team won the bronze medal in the Asian Cup for under-18 days ago.
This time, like every year on Diwali, I once again went to the borders of China to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I had celebrated Diwali on the summits of the Himalayas along with the ITBP and Indian Tibetan soldiers and soldiers.
I go to Deepawali every time, but the experience of this Deepawali is incomplete.
People are not only sending information but also connecting with their minds
One rendered poetry, the other painted films, the other produced cartoons, the other produced a video.
This means that every house is like a residential place of soldiers.
When I saw the letters, I assumed that how many imaginations and feelings were there in the minds of the people
A soldier from the Army had written to me - Prime Minister, all of us, the soldiers, will be present on the borders of every festival like Deepawali and Holi.
We will spend every moment in the country's security minds.
Yes, however, in the days of festivals, there is a feeling of a home.
But to tell the truth, this time there was no such idea.
On this day, there is no doubt that we are not at home.
Somehow, along with 125 crore Indians, we also felt that we are celebrating Diwali.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Deepawali, should the spirit of brilliance disappear among the security forces of our country for a few moments
As a society, as a nation, it should be our nature and I urge all of you to mix this feeling in our emotions, be it any festival or festival or be it a joyous occasion, we must remember the soldiers of our country in some way or the other.
When the whole country stands shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, it is certain that the strength and strength of the force will increase by 125 crore times.
Sometime back all the leaders of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had come to meet me.
They are from the Panchayat Sammelan of Jammu Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 leaders from different villages of the Kashmir Valley.
I had the opportunity to talk to them for a considerable time.
They had come to talk about some issues related to the development of their villages, some had come up with some demands, but when the conversation began to length, it was natural that the environment of the valley, law and order situation, the future of the children, and so on.
It was a heart-to-heart conversation with the leaders of the village with a very loving and open mind.
During the talks, when there was talk of burnt schools in Kashmir, I realized that the people of our country had suffered a lot due to this.
And they thought that the schools were not burnt, but that the future of the children was made fiery.
After you return to your cities, I urge you to pay attention to the future of these children.
I am very happy that all these leaders who have come from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise made to me very well.
They went to the villages and spread awareness among those who were far away.
A few days ago, 95 of the children of Kashmir participated in the board examinations during the board examinations.
The participation of such a large number of students in the board exams indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development through education.
While I convey my best wishes to those students for their encouragement, I extend my heartiest greetings to their parents, relatives, their teachers and all the rural leaders.
Dear brothers and sisters, this time when I had asked for advice from the people for Mann Ki Baat, everyone's suggestions came about one thing.
All of them have asked me to talk in detail about 500, 1000 rupees notes.
In my address to the people of India on 8th November at 8:00 p.m. on 8th November, I talked about the launch of a milestone that will bring about a transformation in the country.
Whenever I had made this resolution before you, I had publicly said that this decision was not simple, it was difficult.
But the more important the resolution is, the more important it is to implement.
I am sure that a variety of innovative hardships will be faced in our average life.
Even then this decision was huge and I had said that it will be 50 days to come back from its impact and only then can we take a step towards nature.
It cannot be easy to get rid of all the diseases we have been carrying for 70 years.
I understand the difficulties faced by you very well.
500 and 1000 rupees notes, such a large country, such a large number of notes, millions and millions of notes, such a resolution - the entire world is carefully watching it, every economist is imagining and evaluating it.
India has immense faith in 125 crore Indians and 125 crore countrymen are determined to achieve their goal of self-confidence.
Over 1 lakh 30000 bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, over 1. 5 lakh post offices, over 1. 5 lakh bank agents and overnight banking agents participated in this work with dedication.
In the midst of a variety of tensions, all of them were very quiet and fully involved in this thing as an attempt to transform this country by considering it as an individual.
As a result, India will succeed in this task.
I can see that despite all these difficulties, everyone works in banks and post offices.
When it comes to humanity, they are travelling a little more.
One person told me that an accident had happened to an old man in the place of Kandwa.
Suddenly money was needed.
I am glad to know that when this thing was taken to the attention of the banker there, he went to the elderly house and collected the money and took care of it without any hindrance.
Several such unaccounted events take place every day on TV, in the media, in newspapers, in conversations.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the comrades who work and contribute to this great youth.
But if evil is so widespread, even today, evil practices have become a habit.
Even now, they are contemplating to find a way out of this corruption money, this black money, uncounted money and benami money.
They have been trying to save their money by enjoying the poor, enjoying their words or by enjoying their hearts, putting money in their accounts and buying something from them.
Today, I would like to say to such people - whether it is shrinking or not, whether it is your favor or not, whether it is your favor or not, whether it is your favor or not, whether it is your favor or not, the law will take care of it.
But please do not play with the lives of the poor.
When the name of the poor comes in the registration, then during the investigation, my beloved poor should not do anything difficult due to your sins.
A very tough law has been enacted in respect of Benami property, which is coming into force, which will cause a lot of trouble.
The government wants that our countrymen should not face any kind of problem.
I live in Dhirali village of Dhirali Taluka in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
You have taught a good lesson to those who have black money and corrupt people through 500 and 1000 rupees notes.
If this action has not been taken then it will not have been a good time for every citizen of India.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for this thing.
Some things are being encouraged by the media, by the public, by the government.
There is unlimited joy and pride when the common man of my country knows what a wonderful talent is there.
It has been written that even if you have an old note, if you want to eat food, do not worry about money, do not go back hungry and leave the food and if you have to travel on this path then you must pay the money.
People go there, eat food, and after 2-4-6 days when they travel by that route then they pay back the money.
This is the power of my country, in which the spirit of service and sacrifice reflects.
During the election, I was in a tea-speaking conversation and this idea spread throughout the world.
People of many countries of the world have started talking about tea.
But I was unaware that during this Tea Dialogue marriages would also take place.
On November 17, a wedding took place in Surat with a Tea Dialogue.
In Surat, Gujarat, a woman gave only tea to her household married couples, did not participate in any other festivals, did not make any feasts, because there was money laundering due to currency discount.
The marchers also considered it a matter of pride.
Surat's Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar, who have enjoyed their participation in the massive fight against corruption and black money through their marriage, are extremely motivated.
While offering numerous blessings to Bharadesh and Daksha, I convey my warm greetings and good wishes to you all for converting the wedding jubilee into a great poet and making it a new opportunity.
When such difficulties arise, people make the solutions even better.
Some people have got immediate benefits through this movement.
In the days to come, the country will be benefited, but some have immediate profits.
When I asked about what had happened, I got some information from small towns.
But this time, on the 8th of this resolution, everyone ran away to pay their old notes.
Around Rs. 3000-3500 crore was collected in 47 urban units during the period last year.
3000-3500 crore, where is 13,000 crore
Whether sewerage systems are being set up for the poor, water supply systems are being set up or the Anganwadi centres are being established or not
There are many such instances in which the direct benefits are visible.
Brothers and sisters, our villages, our farmers, these are the strongest pillars of the economy of our country.
On the one hand, because of this new transformation of the economy, every citizen, in the midst of difficulties, is doing his best to reform himself.
But today I would like to offer my best wishes to the farmers of my country.
Now I was investigating the statistics related to sowing of this season.
Whether it is wheat or pulses or oilseeds, I have an account till 20th November, sowing has increased as compared to the corresponding period last year.
In the midst of difficulties, farmers have found a way.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given importance.
Under the Mudra Yojana, initiatives were taken to provide loans to them.
Several crores of rupees were given to the common man under the Mudra scheme because crores of people are engaged in such small enterprises and lakhs of crores of rupees are being given the speed of business.
Today, whatever I want to tell my younger brothers and sisters, use this as an opportunity to enter the digital world.
You can also download the bank's app through your mobile phone.
Your contribution to the creation of a society without cash can be immense. You can leverage the entire banking system through mobile phones to enhance your business and today we can manage the business in many ways without handling the notes.
There are technological ways, which are safe, quick.
I would like to assure you that your cooperation should be given to the success of this movement and I am confident that you will be able to lead this transformation and you will be able to lead this kind of leadership.
I am confident that you will be able to take up the business of the entire village with the help of this technology.
I also want to tell the working brothers and sisters that more injustice has been done to you.
One thing is that the wages of the paper are other than the sum of your hands.
You will have to pay your wages in full and no one will have to share it.
You should not be tortured.
If money comes to your bank account then you can also buy goods in the shops in the neighborhood through a small mobile phone so that there is no need for a smart phone and now even your mobile phone does the work of e-velot.
Therefore, my labouring brothers and sisters, I specially urge you to make your contribution in this scheme because I have made such a big decision so that the poor, the farmers, the labourers, the suppressed and the deprived section of the society can get the benefit of the victims.
Today I would especially like to talk to the youth.
We are putting Dandora around the world that 65 of the people in India are under 35 years of age.
I am also aware that you are contributing to taking this forward in a positive way.
Friends, you are my real soldiers, you are my true comrades.
There is a wonderful opportunity for all of us to serve Mother India. This is a golden opportunity to take the country towards economic summits.
My young friends, can you help me
You will be aware of the App, which means what is the App, you will be aware of online banking, which means that what is the banking system, and you will be aware of this thing.
These things are very simple for you and you are also using them.
But today, the immense work that the country wants to do is a society without our dream of a cashless transaction.
It is true that it is not possible that a society without a hundred percent cash transaction is possible.
But why shouldn't we start making India a less cash society
Once you start using this low-cash utility society, the goal of a society without cash transactions will not be far away.
I am confident that you will not always disappoint me because we all are carrying forward the desire to change the lives of the poor of India.
You are aware of the opportunities that are being created today to create a society without cash transactions, to introduce digital banking services or to introduce mobile banking services.
Each bank provides online access.
Wallace's direct content e-purse.
Various types of cards are available.
According to Jan Dhan Yojana, there are RuPay cards with crores of poor families of India, the RuPay card which was used very little has started to be used much after the 8th and it has increased by 300 per cent.
Like the prepaid card on the mobile phone, banks also get prepaid cards to spend money.
UPI is an excellent business base so that you can buy goods, send money and get money.
This work is as simple as you are sending information to the Wattspot.
He has also known how to send information to the Watts office today, and how to forward it.
Not only this, technology is very simple as it does not require a big smart phone for this work.
Transfer of money can also be made through ordinary phones.
Whether it is a labourer, a vegetable seller, a dairy seller, a newspaper seller, a tea seller, a manufacturer or a manufacturer, it can be used without any difficulty.
I have put pressure on efforts to make this method easier.
All the banks are engaged and are doing it.
Now we have abolished the extra fees for online business and we have brought an end to all such taxes related to cards to strengthen the notion of a cashless society and you must have seen it in the newspapers in the last 2-4 days.
My young friends, despite all this, this is uncomfortable for the entire generation.
I would like to know that all of you have been constructively involved in this great task.
I am listening to the creative news of WhatsApp, the slogans, poems, pieces, cartoons, new imagination and humor
If I see the creative potential of our younger generation in the midst of challenges then I see a fundamental creation emerges amongst you when we face such a huge transformation today, just like the fact that the Gita was born once even on the battlefield.
But, my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I once again say that I need your help and I hope that you and millions of youngsters of this country will do this work.
Please assure from today that you will be a part of a society without cash transactions.
Give up all the technology for online expenses on your mobile phone.
You must lead a cashless society, a movement emanating from the net of notes, a movement that liberates the country from corruption, a movement that liberates people from black money and a movement that frees people from other problems.
Once you learn how to benefit people from RuPay card then the poor will give you blessings.
Within a month, we will be able to stand as a new India and you will be able to do this work through your mobile phone
Go to 10 houses daily and join 10 houses daily.
I invite you, come, your support is not enough, we will become the architects of this transformation and we will make a difference.
We will move forward in this war that frees the nation from black money and corruption.
This country has created a massive revolution.
My dear young friends, once again I urge you people to take this movement forward.
I invite all of you to take up this task as socially and individually, every school, college, university, National Cadet Corps and National Cadet Corps.
We will take this task forward.
We have got an opportunity to serve the country with the best, we should not miss this opportunity of gold.
My brothers and sisters, today is the birth anniversary of a great poet of the country, Harivansh Rai Bachan ji and today on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai ji, Amitabh Bachchan has given a slogan for cleanliness drive.
You might have noticed that the artist Amitabh ji, who is very fond of this century, has taken forward the cleanliness drive with great vigour.
Harivansh Rai Ji has identified himself through this tax.
I pay my respects to Harivansh Rai.
I offer my heartfelt gratitude to Amitabh Ji for joining the Mann Ki Baat and leading the cleanliness drive.
My dear countrymen, now with the voice of Mann Ki Baat your thoughts, your feelings, your letters and your gov and narendramodi App keep connecting me with you.
Now, Mann Ki Baat (Mannatin Voice) will be broadcast at 11 o'clock, but in the state languages, it will start immediately after completion.
Thank you very much to you all.
Deepawali is being celebrated everywhere in India with fervor and enthusiasm.
In 365 days, in some corner of the country, our country is going to celebrate some festival.
But one thing that we can clearly see is that this complete journey of the festivals of India, their depth and acceptance of the people, all these are linked to a mantra - that is to take individuality towards society.
Festivals show responsibility for all trees, trees, rivers, animals, mountains and birds.
Now we are celebrating holidays on Sundays but you must have noticed that the people of the previous generation, be it the working class or the fishermen, had observed a holiday on the days of Paurnami and Amavasya.
Scientists have proven that what kind of change is there in the sea water during the days of Paurnami and Amavasya, and what kind of impact is there on nature.
This also affects the human mind.
That is, the tradition of celebrating holidays in our country is also blending with vastness and science.
Today, we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I have said before, it is the teaching and wisdom of every festival of ours.
This Deepawali festival also gives us the message of Damaso Maa Jyotirmaya, moving from darkness to light.
This is not merely the darkness of light.
The darkness of superstition, the darkness of illiteracy, the darkness of poverty and the darkness of social evils.
If we can free ourselves from the darkness of Deepawali and the darkness of individuality, which is bitter in the society, then this can be the aim of spreading light on Deepawali Dipawali.
One thing we all know very well, if you go to any corner of India and see whether it is a very wealthy house or a slum of the poorest of the poor, whether it is the festival of Deepawali, you can see that the cleanliness drive is being done in every family.
There is cleanliness in every corner of the house.
He will also keep his soil clean that the poor will have soil but Deepawali has come.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepavali is also sharing his film with Twitter.
The UK Prime Minister had organised a reception on the occasion of Deepawali in London to integrate all societies and participated in it.
With great celebrations, there is no city in the UK that does not celebrate Deepawali.
Singapore's Prime Minister shared a film with the world with great pride in Instagram.
Well, what do you know about that film
The film is about 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament who wear India's dress and stand at the doors of the Parliament.
All these have been done on the occasion of Diwali.
The thing I want to say is that Deepawali is a shining day and a great day to inspire people from all over the world towards light.
News about accidents, fires and premature deaths during the days of Deepawali are concerned.
There is another problem - when doctors go to Deepawali with their families in large numbers on the occasion of Deepawali then there is a more difficulty in getting together.
In particular, I appeal to the parents and the guardians to make a special appeal that when the child burns the butterflies, there should be adults with them and be careful not to make any mistake and look at the inconvenience.
Deepawali is celebrated in our country for a long time.
This is not a matter of one day
Govardham Pooja, Bhai Duj and Lap Panchami can go on saying this in a way that it is a long time to celebrate the bright festival of Karthik Poornima.
Along with this, we are also celebrating the festival of Deepawali and are also engaged in the preparation of the Chat Puja.
In the eastern parts of India, the festival of Sat-Pooja is a big festival.
In a way, it is a big festival, it is celebrated for four days, but it has a special significance - it gives a very deep message to society.
It is difficult to calculate that the Sun God gives us all and from him we reach everything, be it directly or indirectly or be it the calculation of the Sun God gives us all.
This sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers and the security forces have embarrassed my heart.
I want to share one thing with the world of these feelings - we will dedicate this Deepawali to the security forces.
I had invited the countrymen to participate in a movement called Sandesh2Soldiers, i.e. news for the soldiers.
I would like to salute the nation that there is no citizen who has immense affection for the soldiers, pride in the army and pride in the security forces.
The media has also turned this inspiration into a day of gratitude to the soldiers.
When we are in the mindset of celebrating, when we think of them then a new energy emerges in those memories.
Even a message gives multiple energy and the country has shown this thing.
Some dressed the pictures, clothed the rocks, made cartoons.
I can imagine how this is a moment of pride for the soldiers of my country.
So many things have been identified in Sandesh2soldiers.
I would like to read the poetry sent by Shri Ashwini Kumar Chouhan.
Ashwini ji writes: I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, all these are because of you.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country.
My dear countrymen, Sivani has sent a telephone call to me when the soldiers are full of soldiers at the birthplace and the soldiers are also filled in the house.
Let us ask you what the soldiers want to say.
Greetings, Prime Minister, I call on Shivani Mohan.
Their families and their wives, along with the army officers and soldiers, make a lot of sacrifices.
In a way, even the entire military community has received a very good news.
My dear countrymen, the brave soldiers are seen not only on the border but at every stage of their lives.
You might have heard that Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the practice of open defecation.
Vikas Thakur is a resident of Pathana, a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Our Armed Forces from the Indian Army went to their village on vacations.
He visited the village when there was a Panchayat and there was talk of constructing toilets in the village panchayat.
It was found that some families were unable to construct toilets due to lack of money.
He immediately took his cheque book and handed over a cheque of Rs. 57,000 to the head of the Panchayat, and in which 57 houses do not have toilets, give it to every family Rs.
Vikas Thakur ji has shown that he has given 1000 rupees per day to 57 families and has given a new energy to the cleanliness drive.
This is the reason why Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of waste in open defecation.
Similarly, I would like to express my gratitude to the youth for this thing that has happened in Kerala too.
Immediately, the National Cadet Corps (NCC) shields, national welfare programmes and engineering students came together to decide to construct toilets.
The students carried all the items needed for toilets such as brick, cement and walked on their shoulders all day long.
They constructed toilets in the village through their hard work and these youngsters freed themselves from the practice of toilets in the open defecation in the remotest jungle of the village.
That is why Kerala is going to become an open defecation free state.
The state of Gujarat has also announced that more than 150 municipalities and municipalities are free from open defecation.
10 districts have been declared free from this practice.
But generally no attention is paid to these things.
The old project and the ongoing new project are expected to be implemented and the next project is expected to be undertaken.
In our country, those households where there is gas connection, those households where there is electricity, they do not need kerosene.
But those who are worried about the government, kerosene is being provided, gas is being provided and electricity is also being provided, the middlemen are getting the opportunity to make money.
What kind of a big change will be brought about, black markets will be stopped, environment will be benefitted, our foreign exchange will be saved and people will be benefitted.
Yes, there is no doubt that intermediaries and non-monetary persons will suffer.
My dear countrymen, Gandhiji has always been a guide to all of us.
His claim on every subject determines the quality of the country where to go and how to travel.
The need of the hour is to focus on the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take steps one after the other so that they get rid of their problems.
Whatever our ancient belief, we have to free our society from the distinction of male and female.
Now there are toilets for girl children in schools and toilets for children.
This is a good time for our daughters to achieve a distinct India.
Even though the vaccine is being vaccinated on the government side, lakhs of children are getting rid of vaccination and are targeting diseases.
Mission Indradhanush, a vaccination drive for children who have been left out of vaccination, provides children with the power to get rid of dangerous diseases.
We are in the 21st century but the darkness of the village cannot continue. A massive movement to bring electricity to the village is progressing successfully.
After so many years of independence, the poor mother cooked food on wood and how her health would be when 400 cigarettes smoke in her body.
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore families from smoke and we are moving on the path of success.
Small traders, small traders, vegetable sellers, dairy sellers and end-to-end shopkeepers are lending interest to mortgage professionals.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana, these are the successful movements that have been launched to get rid of interest lenders.
Direct payment of money to the banks through Aadhaar and direct payment to the beneficiaries.
It is a good opportunity to get rid of the brokers in the lives of the owners.
We have to fill our hearts with the memories of the great personalities and do so.
But a telephone call from Punjab, its pain touched my heart. Prime Minister, Greetings, sir, I speak from Punjab.
Sir, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel had worked for uniting the country throughout his life, he had succeeded in this goal and united everyone.
I don't know what the country's misfortune is, but on that day Smt. Indira Gandhi Ji was assassinated.
We all know very well what happened in the country after that.
I would like to know your views on how to prevent such unfortunate events.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not just a human being.
After Chanakya, a Sardar and Sardar Vallabh Bhai have done the work of coordinating the country.
Sardar Patel had made efforts for unity and because of his prima vision of integration, he was very angry and yet he was not loosened by the path of integrity.
But on the birthday of the same Sardar, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardars' families were killed after the assassination of Ms. Indira Gandhiji.
The tyranny unleashed on the birthday of that great man, who spent his entire life in solidarity, is hurting all of us on one side of history.
But even in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move forward by putting forward the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the biggest strength of the country.
Although different languages, different castes, different clothing and different food systems, unity in diversity is the strength of India, the specialty of India.
Every generation has a duty and every government has a responsibility in search of an opportunity for unity in every corner of our country and in promoting the principle of unity.
We will keep ourselves away from separatist thoughts and divisive natures.
Sardar ji has given us a united India and it is our responsibility to make it a Great India.
The mantra of Integration is the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
The journey of life of Sardar ji started in the farmers' struggle.
He is the son of a farmer.
Today we hear the name of Amul.
Everything in Amul is well known in India and abroad.
But only a few are aware that Sardar's vision has created a dairy-producer cooperative union.
The district of GEDA was called GERA in those days, he added this idea in 1942, and today as an example of how Sardar ji had worked for the welfare of the farmers, Amul ji, the Amul ji.
I offer my homage to Sardar ji.
Wherever we may be on the 31st of October, the day of unity, let us remember Sardar ji, let us pledge for unity.
My dear countrymen, in this Deepawali series, Karthika Paurnami is celebrated with fervor.
Guru Nanak Dev Jis teachings belong to the entire humanity, not only to India, but to the entire humanity, it remains a guiding light even today.
This is the message of Guru Nanak Dev ji, the spirit of service, the essence, the strength of Sarva-Sabka Sath-Sabka Vikas.
Peace, unity and harmony are the mantras.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had in every respect aimed at liberating society from diversity, superstition and evil practices.
May your dreams and your commitments succeed in every possible way.
Over the past few days, we have lost 18 soldiers of our country, who have unleashed a terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir.
I offer my homage to all the brave and courageous soldiers.
This cowardly event has shaken the entire nation.
There is an increase in sadness and anger in the pulse of the people of the country
This loss is not only for the families of those soldiers who lost their children, lost their brothers and lost their husbands.
The entire country is experiencing this loss.
Therefore, my countrymen, I still say that day before you, the criminals will be punished and they will not be able to escape the punishment.
My dear countrymen, we have immense faith in our army.
They will defeat every manipulation by their might and the 125 crore people of the country will be able to express their utmost courage in a peaceful and peaceful manner.
We are very proud of our army.
Today, specially, I want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir.
Citizens of Kashmir have begun to understand the country's rival forces very well.
As they begin to understand the truth, they have begun to take away such destructive forces from them and travel on the path of peace.
Every Mother's wish is that schools and colleges should start functioning at a rapid pace.
Over the past few days, business has also started well.
We are aware that peace, unity and harmony can be the solution to our problems, can be the path of progress and can be the path of our development.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we will be able to provide a better way to the future generations of Kashmir if we have taken a peaceful consultation and set a path for every problem.
The responsibility of the security administration of the Kashmiri citizens.
The administration has to undertake some measures to preserve law and order.
I also urge the security forces of the country to follow the capabilities, power, laws and regulations that we possess for law and order and ensure peaceful living of the common people of Kashmir.
Sometimes those who think differently from our thoughts put forth new ideas.
Sharshvardhan, a student of class 11, has made a difference to my attention.
"After the real terror attack, my mind was overwhelmed with anxiety, there was a desire to do something, but I didn't know the way to do it.
Harsh Vardhan, in this environment of anger, in such a young age, you have thought positively and it gives me joy.
But Harsh Vardhan has a great value for the anger of the people of the country.
This is the expression of the feelings of the people of the country.
Yes, you have presented a constructive approach.
But you know that during the 1965 war Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had led the country and this kind of feeling was reflected in the entire country, it was passionate and patriotic.
Every citizen had a commitment to do something in his mind.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was trying to give this feeling of the country a grand year.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and encouraged the common man to work for the nation.
Every citizen must understand another attempt to express patriotism in the midst of the bomb blasts, which Lal Bahadur Shastri put forward.
While Gandhiji was leading the freedom struggle, during the period when the freedom struggle was intensely underdeveloped, he successfully worked to motivate the society towards constructive work when it needed another platform.
Let us and our army fulfil our duties, let those in charge of governance fulfil their duties, let the people of our country and every citizen contribute to this spirit of patriotism in a positive way and the country will certainly attain new heights.
My dear countrymen, the history of our sportspersons who have participated in the Para Olympic Games is a victory for human inspiration.
Varun Viswanathan ji has recorded the excellent performance of our sportspersons in the Narendra Modi App and has requested you to share this in your Mann Ki Baat.
Not only you two, but every citizen of the country has got an emotional connection with the sportspersons who participated in the Para Olympics.
Beyond sports, these para Olympic competitions and the achievements of our sportspersons have completely transformed the humanitarian outlook and the perspective that we see with disabilities.
I will not forget the words of our victorious sister Deepa Malik ji after winning the medal.
This time, 19 sportspersons, including three women from our country, participated in the Para Olympics.
In comparison with other sports, there is a greater issue of mind-set and determination than their physical strength and capability in sports when they play with disabilities.
Mariappan Thangavelu has won a gold medal in the tallest jump.
Mariappan has lost his right leg at just five.
Poverty cannot restrict her morale.
He is not a resident in a big city, nor a middle class family, nor a wealthy family.
At the age of 21, he has achieved medals by leading a life of hardships, not by neglecting physical discomfort, but by simply by simply conscience.
While they have raised our feelings, they have changed the perspective that we see with disabilities.
Can anyone imagine that the Persons with Disabilities can dismantle the routine Olympics
This time it happened.
Abdul Latin Pear of Algeria has won the Gold Medal at the 1500m Olympic Games.
I once again extend my heartfelt congratulations to our sportspersons and in the coming days, I will be travelling in the direction of creating a positive plan for the India Para Olympics for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a very different experience in Gujarat's navigation.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mega Campaign for Persons with Disabilities in which many world achievements were made.
I had to meet a little girl who had no vision and she was a little girl from the long jungles of Kauri Shardul - Nang district, and she was embarrassed with Ramakavima.
And she showed me some part of it: and when I had told it before the congregation, the people marvelled.
I believe that the Government of India has achieved a world record in the neo-governance.
600 disabled persons with disabilities (Divyangjan) have been processed within 8 hours.
This was placed in the Guinness World Achievement Book.
It is a matter of great honour for our countrymen that three world achievements are being achieved by the persons with disabilities in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on Gandhiji's birth anniversary.
I must remember that cleanliness should become our nature, it should be the responsibility of every citizen, it should be the responsibility of every citizen, it should be seen as dirt and filth.
Now, on 2nd October, I assure you that there is awareness of cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore people of the country on the occasion of the completion of two years.
Similarly, everybody has tried to take a step in the direction of cleanliness as we have said that we will take a step towards cleanliness.
That is, 125 crore feet of the country have moved towards cleanliness.
If the direction is right, then the results will be better.
Whether it is a common citizen or a ruler, government offices, roads, buses or railway stations, schools or colleges, be it a place of worship or be it a hospital or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or be it a village or a village or be it a village or be it a village or a village or be it a village or
Media friends have also done a constructive job.
This progress is not sufficient, we still have to make progress.
It's very important
This is the reason that while talking about rural India, so far 2 crore 48 lakh toilets, that is, about 12 crore toilets have been constructed, and there is a commitment to construct another 12 crore toilets in the coming years.
In Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, the habit of open defecation will soon come to an end.
During my recent visit to Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji in Gujarat, the officials had told me that the date of October 2 will be the end of the habit of open defecation.
Come, people, let us make a pledge and progress.
Especially my younger brothers are using technology completely today and I would like to put forward a scheme before them.
The Government of India has organised a telephone number 1969 to know about the status of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in your city.
You can fully utilise it, especially the younger generation.
The Government of India appeals to the corporate world to come forward and make your contributions better.
Support the professionalism of young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
We can utilize the districts as Swachh Bharat partners and Swachh Bharat fellows.
This Swachh Bharat Abhiyan cannot be progressed if it stands with the governments and it is natural that cleanliness will not be fulfilled.
Wealth from waste is also important.
Therefore, we have to move from waste to fertilizer along with cleanliness drive.
Fertilizers have been asked to buy fertilizer from waste.
The farmers who want to do organic farming should find ways to get this fertilizer.
These fertilizers should be provided to those who think of enhancing the prosperity of their land, who are interested in the welfare of the land, who have suffered significant losses due to chemical fertilizers, even if the requirement of this fertilizer is small.
Amitabh Bachchan has contributed to this work as a business ambassador.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors and Commissioners from all over the country are going to make deeper consultations on cleanliness.
What can be achieved by technology
What can be the financial model
There will be discussions on all such matters.
I see that there are new messages about cleanliness continuously.
I read in a newspaper that day that students of Gujarat Technical University went to 107 villages to create awareness about the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has also prepared a one year table in its Ministries.
Each department should take a 15-day pledge for better cleanliness.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayati Raj and Rural Development will jointly formulate and implement the Swachhta Pakhwada in their respective government boundaries from 1st to 15th October 2019.
During the last two weeks of October, three more Ministries - Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs - will be implementing the Swachhta Abhiyan within their respective territories from 16th to 31st October.
I urge the citizens to join if you have any work related to these sectors.
You might have noticed that the cleanliness drive is underway.
Initially, 73 cities were surveyed on how cleanliness was done and it was placed before the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh and now we have resided in every city and we have a hope that the next time we will progress.
There is a competitive environment related to cleanliness.
Every citizen of India should contribute to this movement as much as we can.
Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri will be born on 2nd October.
It has been two years since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali, I have been urging you people to buy a little bit of paperwork.
I once again urge every family to buy a rod, so that it burns light on Diwali in the houses of the poor.
On 2nd October, as a citizen, can we not take any action related to cleanliness
I urge you to associate yourselves with the cleanliness drive for 2 hours and 4 hours, and share a photograph of it with me in the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, share that video.
With our efforts, this movement will get strength and a new pace once again throughout the country.
Recalling Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we will commit ourselves to do something for the country.
As per my appeal to the countrymen to abolish gas subsidy in the last few days, the answers given by the countrymen are one of the most incentives for the country's survival.
This is a movement to collect food and clothing to the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers came out on the streets and took away the old sports stuff from their families and brought them to Anganwadi in the area of the poor.
Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya ji who explained the political thoughts and thoughts of millions of workers like me who have been motivated by political thoughts.
Today, the centenary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji, the political thoughts associated with the roots of India, the philosophy of respecting the tradition of Indian culture, the philosophy of musical political philosophy and the philosophy of humanity begins today.
Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukoy, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas.
Gandhiji also spoke of the interests of those at the end.
How to bring the benefits of development to the poorest of the poor
Deendayal had put forward a comprehensive economic programme in the same word for every hand, for every work, for every land.
The country must celebrate his birth centenary year as a good year for the poor.
The focus should be on the society, the government and the focus should be on how to bring the fruits of development to the poor.
I respectfully remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was an inspiration for us and an indomitable source of thought.
What kind of inspiration this country's commander gives me.
What are the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of this country
In my mind and mind, the record of the common man has emerged in Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to you all for broadcasting my views and for making full efforts to translate it into all languages.
They collected letters after Mann Ki Baat, gave suggestions and shouted slogans at the doors of the government, showed the grievances of the government, Akashwani prepared such letters and made special programmes and brought representatives from the government and set up a platform for solving the problems.
Mann Ki Baat does not stop with some 15-20 minute conversation, it is a new occasion for social transformation.
What could be more happy than this
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all those who have contributed to the success of this project.
My dear countrymen, next week there will be Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadasamy. There will be arrangements for Deepawali.
This is the strength of the country, the unity of society is the strength of the country.
Whether it is Navaratri or Durga Puja, we will think of making this Shakti Puja a way of social unity.
To take the country towards new heights, we will observe the pious days of Navratri and Durga Puja with the feeling of peace, unity and harmony.
We will celebrate Vijayadasami as a victory.
This day is being celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
He has done an important job in achieving Gold in India during the Olympic Games held in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
At that time it was only 10 minutes to get the decision.
And Dyan Chand put three rods in those ten minutes, and I put the rods in place of the wound.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a time for Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions on mygov Internet or narendramodi App.
They are varied.
This time, however, I had the highest demands for a comment on the Rio Olympics.
I feel that it is extremely positive when the public is so enthusiastic about the Rio Olympics, so much awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of India to talk about it.
Even beyond cricket, the people of India are so enthusiastic about sports, there is so much awareness and so much information.
Sachin has written, You must make an appeal this time in Mann Ki Baat about Sindhu, Shakshi and Deepa Karmaar.
One of these women is from North India, one from South India, one from East India and the other from the coast of India.
It appears that the daughters of India have accepted the responsibility of taking pride in the country.
On MyGov web site, Shikar Dagur ji wrote that we could have done even better in the Olympics.
My best wishes to you all for the two medals we have received in Rio.
There is a need to undertake long-term tours at sports events.
Our parents are focusing on studies today.
Even now, in society, they see sports with an outlook of time.
We have to change this idea.
The society needs to be encouraged.
Who else can do this work better than you
Likewise, Shri Satyaprakash Mehra has also written on the narendramodiapp - Mann Ki Baat on the need for extra-curricular activities.
In a way, the same feeling reflected in thousands of writings.
It is true that there is no alternative to the fact that we cannot work as per our expectations.
We have got only two medals in medals.
But if you do not get medals, you can see that for the first time Indias sportspersons have shown considerable talent in many respects.
Our Abhinav Bindra ji was ranked 4th in the shooting segment and he lost his medal in a very small way.
Likewise, Sania Mirsa-Rohan Bhopanna took place in the Tennis competition.
We have worked well in the athletics sector this time.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalitha Babar has qualified for their track field final competition.
For the first time in the last 36 years, men have succeeded in achieving the knock out in the hockey competition.
Vikas Krushan Yadav in boxing reached the final stage, but he could not get a bronze medal.
Several jawans, for example, Adi Ashoka, Dattu Pollution and Dhanu Das were very good.
My dear countrymen, we need to do more.
But if we continue to work as we have done so far, perhaps we may have to be disappointed again.
I'm announcing the formation of a committee.
The Government of India is deeply embarrassed and will consider what kind of activities the world is doing.
Action plan will be formulated on what sector we can do well.
We have to formulate our programmes with a vision of 2020, 2025 and 2028.
I appeal to all the enthusiastic Indian citizens to send their suggestions to me at the narendramodi app.
The state governments should send their suggestions after discussions.
My dear countrymen, the 5th of September is Teachers Day.
I could learn a lot with these little boys.
For me, the 5th of September is not only the Teachers' Day but also the Education Day.
But this time I have to go to the G20 Summit and today I have felt that my feelings can be expressed in Mann Ki Baat.
The more important place the mother has in her life, the more important it is the place of the teacher.
We have seen teachers who are more interested than us.
They have dedicated their lives for their disciples, for their students.
Today, I see Gopichand as an outstanding teacher across a sportsperson.
On Teachers Day, I salute Bullela Gopichand ji, his penance and his entire commitment to sports and his joy in the success of scholars.
Teachers' contribution is always felt in the lives of all of us.
On the 5th of September, the former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's birthday
Whatever he has achieved in his life, he has always tried to live up to himself as a teacher.
Not only that, he never dies as a student in good teachers.
The books he read in that month would have been referenced and cited.
He would have said that what I have done throughout the month is not correct in his view.
Something is like teaching me in his classroom even today.
Even today, he has been providing me a far-reaching education.
When I look at his 90th year and his signature, I wonder how he can write so many pearls in this old age
Because my signature is so bad that if someone writes beautifully then there is great respect in my mind.
You must have experienced as well as my experience.
Whatever good you people have in your life by your teachers, if you tell them to be world-class then there will be a change in the perspective of our teachers, it will be an honor.
It is our responsibility to increase the dignity of teachers in society.
If you have a photograph with your teachers, if there is any incident with your teacher then you must share it on the narendramodi App.
It is indeed a matter of valuable that the students should look at the contribution of the teachers of the country.
But when we talk about Venkata Chaturthi, it is natural to recall our memories about Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
It is the gift of Lokamanya Tilak to celebrate the legendary Ganesh Chaturthi socially.
He transformed the religious event into a day of national awareness through a demonstration and transformed it into a social cultural day.
Venkatesh Chaturthi also discussed all the questions that touched the lives of the society so that a new upheaval and a new flowering event could be organised in society.
Not only that, it is also a mantra he has given - 'Swarajya' is our birthright, it should be the focus of the country, it should be the strength of the freedom struggle.
Today, not only in Maharashtra, but also in the entire country, there is no social celebration of the Ganesh Chaturthi.
They discuss public matters, conduct competitiveness, and compete in the formulation of the rock.
The scenes in it would have artistically illuminated the things that touch society.
In a way, a movement that can create awareness for all is being carried out through socially demonstrated scriptures.
Lokmanya Tilakaraswarajam has given us the glory of our birth.
But now we are in independent India.
Come on, I'm calling you.
Celebrations are the forces of society.
They provide a new life to the individual and the society.
Life is not possible without celebrations, but it has to be changed according to the need of the hour.
I can see that this time many people have written about Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Pooja.
They are concerned about the environment.
Mr. Shankar Narayana Brashant has steadily appealed to you all to understand through Mann Ki Baat programme that you do not use the statues made by the Plaster of Paris.
He and many others have expressed their concerns that the idols made by the Plaster of Paris are not conducive to the environment.
I urge all of you to use the statues and statues made of clay and restore our ancient tradition.
Ganesh is the one who removes embarrassment.
In such a scenario, we should not build a statue that would create embarrassment.
I don't know how you will take what I'm saying, but I don't say that, many people say that.
A sculptor of Pune, Shri Abijit Dodbale, the organisations of Kolhapur such as Nisark Mitra, Vigyan Brabodini, Nisark Kata of Vidarpa, Gyan Brabodini of Pune, RA Raja of Mumbai.
Various such organizations and individuals take greater difficulty in building idols of silken idols and propagating them.
An unpolluted cattle is also a social service service.
There is still some time for Durga Puja.
And for the families of traditional idols, there shall be employment through such dust statues.
We will make a pledge that the environment will be preserved as our ponds and rivers will be formed by the soil.
When Mother Theresa, who served the poor of India, is now being given a holy title, it is natural for all the countrymen to be proud.
We have had the privilege of learning something or the other every moment from the holy sages, sages, saints and great men.
We have received something from them, we are learning and understanding good things.
My dear countrymen, when the Task of Progress is a movement then how big it will change
People's energy is seen in the form of a magic power.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments in the last few days, has been making a successful effort to clean the Ganga with the help of the people.
On 20th of this month, we called on the leaders of the villages living on the banks of the River Ganga to meet in Allahabad.
And these were men and women.
I convey my best wishes to all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have done this great job.
I also express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Ministers of five State Governments who have been associated with the peoples power and have taken a very important step towards the Ganga.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch my mind and I have a great respect for those who create such an opportunity.
On 15th July, 1.
More than 25 lakh students wrote to their parents socially.
Some people in English, some in Hindi and some in Chattisgarh had written to their parents saying that there should be toilets in their homes.
They had demanded to construct a toilet. Some boys had written that even if you don't celebrate my birthday this year, it's not okay, but they must have built a toilet.
Children between the ages of seven and seventeen have done this work.
There is a woman named Mallamma, a 16-year-old girl in the Koppal district of Karnataka who has done a Satyagraha against her family.
Something he didn't do to accomplish for himself, or to wear a good bracelet, or to eat sweets
Beti Bachao Mallamma's observation is that we need a toilet in our house.
Look at the significance of village leader Mohammad Shahfi, he arranged for 18000 rupees and he built the toilet within a week.
But everyone is connected to it in some way or the other, everybody is contributing to this thing.
I also urge television channels to make such short films and organize competitions.
There is no need for a big studio and big camera to produce a film
In today's era, you can use the camera in your mobile phone to produce a film.
Our respected President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new Akashwani Maitrey Channel in Kolkata.
Many people may be asked to launch a radio mission as the President of India.
Bangladesh is our neighbour.
We are aware that Bangladesh and West Bengal have a shared cultural heritage.
Here, Akashwani Maitri and BangladeshBethar Radio are beyond the borders and people speaking Bengali on both sides will be happy to hear Akashwani.
Connecting people with people is the biggest contribution of Akashwani.
The President has launched this programme.
I also express my gratitude to Bangladesh for fulfilling this task.
I also congratulate Akashwani friends for their contribution to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, all of you may have made me the Prime Minister of the country, but I too am a man like you.
Therefore, sometimes I feel sorry to touch some emotional events.
Such emotional events provide a new energy and a new concept, which inspires the people of the country to achieve something.
A letter that came to me just a few days ago touched my heart.
A mother, about 84, wrote this
If the retired teacher had not asked for his name, I would have mentioned his name.
I also forgot the subsidy and forgot about it, as you asked me to quit the subsidy for gas.
As far as I am concerned, the letter written by the Prime Minister of India is like the Padma Shri award.
My countrymen, you know that I have written a letter from my side to all those who have forgotten the gas subsidy, and have made an attempt to give somebody my representative to the disadvantaged.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
My dear countrymen, we have been suffering from drought last year but this August has caused the tragedy of continuous floods.
Some parts of the country were flooded again and again.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the Local Bodies, the Social Welfare Organisations and the citizens have made efforts in a smooth manner.
But some of the actions that have taken place amidst these tragic floods can be remembered.
It will remind us in August this year that what is the power of living together, what will be the impact of walking shoulder to shoulder with all.
In August 2016, the opposition political parties and 90 parties from all over the country and all the political parties in the Parliament have come together to enact the Goods and Services Tax Act.
Appreciations for the execution of this will embody all political parties.
This is a wonderful example of what will be the benefit if all political parties travel together in one direction.
Similarly, all the political parties of the country had discussed the Kashmir issue in one voice in relation to the situation in Kashmir.
The message to the world, the message to the separatist forces, and the understanding of the people of Kashmir was also expressed.
After talking to all the political parties about Kashmir, one thing was well-known and if I ask them to suppress it in two words then they are unity and love.
These two words blossomed into mantras.
Any death in Kashmir, be it the life of a young man or be it the life of a security force, be it the loss of ours or be it ours or be it the loss of ours or be it the confidence of our country, the confidence of the people of 125 crore country, the confidence of the country from the head of the village to the Prime Minister of the country.
One day there should be an answer to the filthy boys who initiate some minor girls to create unrest in Kashmir.
I have faith in 125 crore people of the country.
Yesterday morning, I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi. I hope that in the days to come, the inspiration for sports throughout the country will increase the enthusiasm and zeal of every young man.
We all know that the biggest Kumbh Mela of World Games is going to take place in a few days.
The word 'Rio' is going to be ringing in our ears.
Yesterday, in Delhi, the Government of India had made a grand arrangement for Run for Rio Run, Play, Live, Play and Growth.
In the days to come, in whatever area we may be, we will take up something to encourage our athletes.
I am ready to do this work from your side.
The country's Prime Minister is ready to make your best wishes to our sportspersons.
Come, let us all be able to honour every sportsperson in the days to come, encourage his efforts and do all that
Today, while talking about the Rio Olympics, I read a poem written by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a poet from Central University of Punjab.
Like him, many other poets may have written more poems in this regard, some may have become songs and songs in every language, but today I want to share with you the poetry written by Suraj ji.
Gold and silver is brass: and let the meat offering be poured forth into heaven.
Suraj ji, I dedicate your feelings to all these sportspersons and I convey my best wishes to you all from my side, to the people of 125 crore countrymen and to the flag of our flag on Rio.
Mr.
But whenever the name of Abdul Kalam ji is being named, a future picture of a capable India of science, technology and missiles shapes our eyes.
In such a way, has your government been making efforts to realise the dreams of Abdul Kalam
And if we want to compose our footsteps then we must do research and innovations that are the life of technology.
If research and innovation are not created then how foul smell will start spreading in stagnant waters, similarly technology will become a burden for us.
If we don't do research and innovation, but depend on the old technology, then we will be late in the era of change
Therefore, the government has been making several efforts to sow the dairy, technology and the dairy of research in the minds of our younger generation.
Therefore, I would like to say that we will aim to innovate and innovate.
When I say that I am AIM, it means Atal Innovation Mission.
If we want to build next generation innovators then we need to connect our students with this scheme.
That is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
Wherever such shining centers are being established in schools, Rs. 10 lakh will be provided and another Rs. 10 lakh will be provided for maintenance in five years.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre is directly related to the innovation crew.
If we have a powerful incubation centre, we will get an appropriate mechanism to create innovations, perform tests for start-ups and stabilise them.
While it is important to establish a new centre of innovation, it is also important to strengthen the old centres.
In our daily lives, there are problems in our eyes.
Now we have to find technical solutions.
As Atal Grand Challenges, we have made an appeal to the younger generation of the country to take up research, innovate and come forward with the help of technology to solve the problems faced by your eyes.
The Government of India wants to give a special prize and encouragement to the technology that has been designed to solve our problems.
When we talk about the tinkering lab, more than 13000 schools have applied for it and when we talk about the Centre of Excellence, more than 4000 non-educational organisations have come forward to set up such centres.
I am convinced that the real homage we can pay to Abdul Kalam is research, innovation, technology solutions to the problems we face in our daily life and simplify our hardships.
The more our younger generation pays attention to these things, the greater their role in building the modern India of the 21st century will be, this will be the genuine tribute to the memory of Abdul Kalam.
My dear countrymen, sometime back we were worried about famine and sometimes rain is enjoying it while news of floods is also coming up.
The State Governments and the Central Government have been working shoulder-to-shoulder efforts to help the flood victims.
Even if there is some difficulty due to rains, there is a refreshment in every human mind beyond them because it is the cornerstone of all our economic activities and agriculture.
Sometimes the diseases that make us sad throughout our lives also embrace us.
But if we get awakened, if we are at the edge, then the ways and ways of avoiding them are easy.
Take dengue fever.
We can protect us from dengue fever.
Even if the government, hospitals and doctors are doing their jobs, we should not allow dengue in our homes, in our areas, in our families, we should be aware that no disease that can be caused by water should not be close.
My dear countrymen, I would like to turn your attention towards one more issue.
If life becomes as urgent and as fast as it is, sometimes it becomes impossible for us to think about it.
You can get relief for a few moments, but you must stop the habit of taking antibiotics without consulting the doctors.
There is also a problem: if the doctor recommends taking 15 antibiotics in 5 days, please complete the recommendation within the timelines of the doctor.
If we leave no longer needed, the microorganisms will be beneficial and they will be further strengthened.
In the medical dialect it is called antibiotic resistance, and therefore it is important to follow the rules that take them as much as it is important to use antibiotic.
Government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance
You might have noticed that the antibiotic medicines sold nowadays are drawn on the bed with a red coat of red color. This is to make you aware.
When we talk about health, I want to add one more thing to it.
The health of pregnant mothers in our country is sometimes very anxious.
Every year about 3 crore women in our country are pregnant, but some mothers die during childbirth and some infants die during childbirth.
Sometimes both mother and child die.
Whatever the fact that the maternal mortality rate of mothers has declined over the past decade, we still remain incapable of saving the lives of pregnant mothers.
No one knows what kind of adverse effects such as anemia, congenital infections, high blood pressure will be beneficial to their lives during and after delivery.
Keeping all these in mind, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission in the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Can my medical brothers and sisters dedicate themselves to this work for 12 days in a year
Many people have written to me in the past.
I am sure you will associate yourself with it.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
Discussions are going on between people in the country and around the world.
India has been strengthening this idea for centuries.
In the song, Lord Krishna says, 'Sarvavrukshanam' means that I am a royal tree.
It is said that there is no vegetation that has no medicinal properties or medicinal properties.
An example of Sonal, a woman from Pune, attracted my attention, it came to my heart.
In Mahabharata's Anusana Mountain, trees also perform the duties of McChelva in the heavens, Sonal has accepted the challenge not only to his parents' wishes but also to fulfill the aspirations of the entire society.
Krishi Khandu Maruthi Mahadre of Narayanpur village in Jhunner Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra
Many people are making such efforts.
During my tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I have seen a large number of pilgrims visiting the Amba Devi temple during the month of Bhadra.
Once a social service organisation has provided a sapling to those who came to the temple by offering a prasad to those who come to the temple and if they take it and plant it in your village then mother Amba will continue to bless you.
Hundreds of thousands of pedestrians who came to pay hundreds of thousands of trees that year.
Even temples can start the tradition of planting trees in the rainy season instead of the prasad.
This can pave the way for a peoples movement related to tree plantation.
I would like to ask my farmer brothers again and again that why shouldn't we plant coconut trees instead of wasting our land by planting trees on the borders of our farmland
Today, we have to import a single tree from abroad for manufacturing and manufacturing goods like houses and chairs in India.
The government has created a mass movement and Rajasthan is a desert region.
Even there, a huge Van Mahotsav has been celebrated and a resolution of 25 lakh trees has been taken.
It is not a small thing to plant 25 million trees in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the land of Rajasthan know how big a challenge it is.
In Andhra Pradesh, a resolution to increase green cover by 50 by 2029 has been taken.
Even in Gujarat, Van Mahotsav is a very popular tradition.
This year, projects like Mamar Forest, Ekada Forest and Shahid Forest have been started in Gujarat, in which several crores of trees have been planted.
As a foreign tour, multilateral agreements have been signed in a wide range of areas such as diplomatic diplomacy as an integral part, discussions on trade and defence related dialogue.
But for me, the journey to South Africa is like a pilgrimage.
It is natural to remember Gandhiji and Nelson Mandela when they think about South Africa.
When words like Akims, Love and Forgiveness fall into the ears in the world, the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela will be seen before us.
As part of my visit to South Africa, I had to visit Phoenix and Gandhijis residence was known as Sarvodaya.
I got the opportunity to visit the Petermaritzburg Railway Station, where Gandhiji had sown the seed on which train travelled, on which the train had sown the seed that transformed Mohandas into Gandhiji.
This time I have got the opportunity to meet many great personalities who sacrificed their youth for equality and equality.
They fought shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela and spent 20-25 years with him in prisons.
In a way, they had sacrificed their entire youth, and I had the greatest opportunity to visit the great personalities of Nelson Mandela, Ahmed Kathada ji, Laloo (Christian EEBA), Siba ji, George Besos, Ronie Casserres.
While I was talking to them, while listening to their prison experiences, there was no bitterness or bitterness in their minds.
The feeling that everyone is equal, everyone is ours is a way to lead us towards a bright future.
Come, let us take pride in these Indians who have lived in the original mantras of our lives even in South Africa.
I recently read in a news article that a woman trapped in fraud and fraudulent email net had lost 11 lakh rupees and finally committed suicide.
I am extremely sad about the condition of a woman and her family.
I would like to know what your views on such fraudulent emails are.
A new strategy of using technology is spread all over the world.
The way technology is playing a big role in the economic system, its misuse is also increasing.
At a time when the daughter had to retire and get married, she said that one day she had paid a small fee to the person who owned a house, you have received a great reward from abroad, if you want to get it, put 2 lakh rupees in the bank account for the customs settlement.
Anybody can create a flawed Letter-Packet and send it through it, get your Credit Card number and Debit Card number and clean your bank account through technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, this is a digital fraud.
I believe that we should protect ourselves from this conflict, Id like to be awake and if such letters come to us then we should immediately share them with our friends and help them to create awareness.
My dear countrymen, I have got the opportunity to meet many people of the country while the Parliament is in session.
I had a comfortable experience during such a meeting.
Some students from Aligarh met me.
The enthusiasm of the student was drifting through the shore, they brought a huge album, enjoying their faces.
They brought films that beautify the Aligarh railway station.
They had constructed a layer garden constructed by plastic bottles at the railway station and had given a new look to the station.
If you have the opportunity to go to Aligarh then you must go to the railway station.
This kind of information has come to me about several railway stations in India and people from all the regions have come to beautify themselves with their regional artworks on the walls of railway stations.
A new feeling can be felt.
This is an example of how peoples participation can transform.
My congratulations to all those involved in this kind of work in the country, especially to my friends of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals also begins in our country along with the monsoon season.
You will also attend festivals in your homes and publications.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is very important.
Just like last year, during the Raksha Bandhan period, can you not present Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiJeevanJyotiJeevanJyotiJeevanJyotiJeevanJyotiBimaYojana to mothers and sisters of the country
Just imagine, brothers and sisters, give me a prize in life that is really safe and secure.
Why we may have placed a woman in our homes for cooking food or doing household chores, or she may be the daughter of a poor mother.
Whether it is possible to present Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Suraksha Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti JeevanJyoti JeevanJyoti JeevanJyoti Suraksha Bima Yojana on the occasion of Rakshabandhan
My dear countrymen, many of us would have been born after the independence of the country.
We can create such an environment.
Independence Day is not a programme of governments, it should be of the people of the country.
Like Deepawali, we have to celebrate this day as our festival.
I want to do something constructive in collaboration with the spirit of patriotism.
You can tell it to the people of the country and I would like to invite you to express it clearly from the Red Fort.
I don't want the comments from the Red Fort to be the Prime Minister's.
What is shown from the Red Fort should be a feeling of 125 crore rupees.
Many people plan programmes on holidays.
Awareness is spread in many villages
Someone told me a few days ago that the people of Hivre Bajar Gram Panchayat in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and the people of that village have emotionally approached the water problem.
There may be many villages that want to save water but after talking to the farmers they have changed the entire cropping pattern and farming system.
They decided that the crop which is used in excess of water, whether it is black or banana, should not be cultivated.
Something is simple to hear, but it is not so easy.
But see my farmer brothers and sisters, they immediately left the sugarcane due to the need for excess water.
They cultivated fruits and vegetables throughout the country, i.e. they cultivated only the minimum amount of water required.
They will make it clear that today they have succeeded in their own efforts to tackle the problem of water through various initiatives such as drip irrigation, rain water conservation, water recharge etc.
Well, I have talked about a small village, Hivere Bajar, but there may be many villages like this.
I convey my best wishes to the people of such villages for the excellent work you have achieved.
Someone told me about the Gorwa GORVA Gram Panchayat in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
When the Indian government brings water to Ladur through trains, I think it is a message to the world.
If there is a good news from somewhere, it is human nature to feel that the entire embarrassment has gone away.
This time, I feel like there has been some great pleasure since I heard that the rainfall is 106 to 110 per cent.
Though it is still raining, the news of good rainfall is also refreshing.
My dear countrymen, however, the kind of joy it provides, the same kind of opportunity it provides and presents the challenge as well.
Can we not start a movement that will save water from the village
Farmers need soil and this helps them in the field of farming.
Why shouldn't we put the soil in the lakes of the villages in the dusty fields
While the soil of the fields will grow, the water conservation of the reservoirs will increase.
What if in empty cement sacks and empty fertilizer bags filled with stones and soil and put it on the ways to come out
I have always said one thing that whenever we go to Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, we can see different places there, one of them is worth seeing.
It means that how the ponds were constructed under the house 200 years ago to save water and how clean the water was.
His concern is very natural because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments came and several schemes were formulated and the money was spent so it is natural to have such a question in the minds of millions and millions of people in the country like Bhaira Kumar Krishna.
Religious people consider the Ganga as a means of providing housing.
Ganga itself gives us work and it is the Ganga that gives us the power to live.
The way the river Ganga flows, there is a pace of economic activity in the country.
A bachelor brought the Ganga to us, but crores of peasants are required to save it.
People cannot succeed in work without participation and therefore we must become a change agent for cleanliness and cleanliness.
We have to tell and remind us of this thing again and again.
Several initiatives are being taken by the government.
Efforts are being made to seek comprehensive cooperation of all the states on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to integrate social and clean organizations.
Several measures have been taken to prevent surface cleaning, spread cleaning and industrial pollution.
Every day solid wastes are mixed in large quantities through canals.
In the coming days, in many more places, these mechanically evacuated projects will be implemented and the benefits of this will be immediately enjoyed by the people living on the banks of river Ganga.
My heart feels that this too will have good results.
I am glad that some officials have told me that the expulsion from the factories in the states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh has been successful in the last few days in terms of ero liquid discharge i. e.
Black liquid's expulsion from paper plants has almost come to an end.
This shows us that we are traveling in the right direction. Awareness has increased.
Not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the far-flung southern parts of the country, they are asking whether the Ganga will be clean or not.
This is a matter of faith of the masses that will certainly bring success in cleaning the Ganga.
People are donating money to clean the Ganga.
The system is being implemented in a very comfortable manner.
My dear countrymen, today is April 24th.
On April 14, we celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar. Today, on April 24, we are celebrating the Panchayati Raj Day.
This is a good thing that happened accidentally, since the mission of the Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, started from 14th April to 24th April, in collaboration with the State Governments, for a period of 10 days, from the day of his birth, from the day of his birth and from the point of view of connecting both the major combined villages of the Constitution.
Today, on 24th April, I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Day in Jharkhand, where our majority tribal brothers and sisters live, this movement has created a massive awareness.
How to strengthen the democratic systems in all corners of India at the village level
How to make villages self-reliant
How can the villages do their own projects for their development
Various programmes may have taken place in several villages of India in ten days, which may be less.
I convey my best wishes to all the state governments and rural leaders who have been using it as an opportunity to innovate in the most fundamental ways, for the benefit of villages, for the development of villages and for the empowerment of democracy.
Awareness has also been generated in the villages that is the guarantee of India's rise.
The foundation of India's rise is in the village rise
Therefore, we all are focusing on rural upliftment and we will achieve the desired results.
There has been a need for development in the education sector for the past several years.
Today, if every family has a primary dream for the parents then it is the need to provide quality education to the children.
The idea of home, vehicle, etc. is all after.
This feeling is superior in the minds of people of a country like India. This is the biggest strength.
Therefore, my request to parents is to take some time to discuss the practices of the schools in a comprehensive manner to the children.
If something gets up in mind then go to school and ask the teachers.
This awareness should lead to the reduction of many disabilities in our education system and the contribution of the people.
All the governments in our country have focused more on education and every government has made its own efforts.
It is also true that a significant period has come from the point of view of establishing educational institutions, expanding the education system, establishing schools and colleges, enrolling teachers and going to the maximum children's school.
In a way, the effort to spread education has been primarily achieved and it is also necessary.
However, the importance of expansion is more important than that of development in our education system.
We have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Our primary aim is to provide good education to all through education drive.
What is true is that we have to undertake a long-term journey.
But if the people of 125 crore country have decided that a long journey will also be possible.
According to Sharmila ji, it is very important that we have to bring about fundamental changes.
Indias universities can become world-class competitive universities.
Just as the importance of education is equally important, similarly the role of technology in education is going to be immense.
I am confident that distance education and technology will facilitate our education and in a short span of time the results will start to appear in the eyes.
Greetings to the Prime Minister, I speak to Mona Karna from Bijnor.
In today's era, sports is even more important than education for the youth.
They need a team spirit, a team spirit, a good leader and a complete development of them.
I would like to say this through my experience because I have been in the essence of the essence of India which has had a good impact on my life.
This required greater integration.
I was filled with such widespread satisfaction that they had a lot of enthusiasm and had to do something.
I myself have been a shield in the National Cadet Corps. I know that through these institutions, a new perspective is being created.
I have enjoyed the benefits of my pedagogy, I have to fill up a new energy in these institutions and give a new impetus.
This time I have put some things in front of them.
During this season, why should not our youth and all the organisations participate in the immense work of water conservation
How many circles, how many districts can we prevent open defecation.
My dear countrymen, today I have to talk about the issue that we all have to think about.
I also see this as a shocking thing.
You will be aware of the fact that how many gas cylinders the party will provide was a matter of discussion during the last several elections and the political situation in our country.
On the other hand, economists have been pressurizing subsidies to reduce subsidies, thereby setting up a number of groups, which gave suggestions and decisions on subsidies cuts.
Several crores of rupees were spent on the operation of these committees.
But today my heart is filled with the pride of my countrymen.
But if you look at the account, more than 80 percent of these 1 crore people went to the distributors themselves, stood in queues, gave them in writing and quit their subsidies.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government gives some exemption from any taxation system, it will bring rain in praise of the government on television and newspapers throughout the week.
They are forced to think of political leaders in a new perspective.
This is an event that has forced the country's economists to think in a new perspective.
Even the economists of the world presenting a variety of possibilities, this is an extraordinary phenomenon beyond their ideas.
We have to think about this at some point.
This is an extraordinary thing that if one crore families give up subsidies and get gas cylinders instead of one crore poor families, the survival of one crore families by quitting subsidies then it is an extraordinary thing.
I urge all the political leaders to say something wherever we go, believing in the people.
May you get the benefits you can't even imagine.
We have to travel in this direction.
For instance, in my mind, the 3rd stage, why the 4th standard workers should conduct a direct examination and why should we not put faith in their examination marks
My thoughts also arise in my mind that there will be no ticket checkers on some railway tracks.
Let us believe in the people of the country, let us do many such tests.
Once we trust the people of the country, we will get immense benefits.
This situation has not been created by any political leader, it has created one crore families of the country.
A person named Ravi has written to me - Good News Everyday, good day and every day, tell your officers to tell you about a good thing every day.
The bad news in every newspaper and the media is being said to be breaking news.
Is there no good thing happening in our country with 125 crore people
A few days ago, a newspaper had also sent me a letter, saying that we will not even release a bad news on Monday and will release a constructive message.
What is true is the situation of constructive news.
Everyone feels that good news and real news should be available to everyone.
Whatever a well-known person gives the best information, however beautiful he narrates it through words and explains it in a better way, he gets much more benefit from the news.
Good news is a condolence for good work.
The more we strengthen the good, the less space for evil is the truth.
If we adhere to the fire, darkness will automatically depart and surely depart.
You can also contribute to it.
Ravi ji, you have given good advice but please don't be angry with me.
Together we will make constructive efforts, we will be able to talk about constructive things and take positive steps.
Kumbh Mela is the specialty of our country.
Kumbh Mela can become a tourist attraction.
Many people of the world are unaware of the fact that millions and millions of people gather on the bank of the river for several days.
The festival is celebrated in a peaceful and peaceful environment.
These events systematically accomplish greater standards as peoples participation in programme management.
I have been watching the films related to the Simhastha Kumbh for the past two days.
I want the tourism department of the Government of India and the state governments to organize a photographic competition in this regard.
You can ask the people to showcase the best photographs.
This can certainly be done.
In the meantime, when the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh met me, he told me that special attention has been paid to cleanliness.
Cleanliness is not only during this festival but it is also aimed at bringing people to their minds about cleanliness from there.
While I accept that Kumbh Mela is a festival related to spirituality, I believe that it will also become a social opportunity.
How can we increase our love for water, how can we preserve water and how can we use Kumbh Mela to spread the message of water harvesting
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
I feel like seeing you speaking to me, however, I am trying to dedicate your thoughts and expressions to you in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Last time I had spoken about a book containing the stories of Breamsand ji and I would like to recall that whoever wanted to read it, share your thoughts about it through the NarendraModi App.
A large number of people have put forward their views on books on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and living standards.
Some others are asking me to talk about many other books.
I'm sure I'll talk about some other books.
But now I have to admit that I don't get enough time to read more books.
But I feel that we have to take forward the experience that we have experienced in the last one month.
Friends, Whatever is true about water conservation, I feel that even before this, water conservation is a matter that touches your hearts, it is a matter of favouriteness for the common man.
If there is a thing that has swept the entire country for a few days then it is water.
Several steps are being taken to ensure water conservation across the country.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
The media has also stepped up several innovative movements on water conservation.
I am very happy to know that Meghalaya, the most beautiful state of the Northeast, has created a water policy for itself.
I convey my best wishes to the state government.
Agriculture is being encouraged to cultivate less water consumption and no harm to farmers in Haryana.
Why should we not use these festivals for water conservation
Friends, some things in life fill us with enthusiasm
And especially the achievements of the children and their successes give us enthusiasm and new energy.
The things that I have said now can bring you pride and joy together.
We all know how a word called cancer can tremble in the world.
While death is waiting at the doorsteps, these 10 children have not only brought out cancer in their struggle for life, but have also lauded the country for their wonderful work.
This month the World Children's Winners Games World Child Winners Competition was held in Moscow.
The event is being organised to compete with gunfire, swimming, swimming, drive, timelines and table tennis.
These 10 winners of our country have won medals on this occasion and some of them have won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that the success that India has achieved in the space beyond Chandrayaan II will give you joy and pride.
Sanjeev Haripura from Jodhpur, Mahendra Kumar Taka from Golkata, B.
Many people like Arvind Rao have been calling on NarendraModi App and MyGov from different parts of the country to talk about Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
The year 2019 is a great year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists launched A-Sat in March, followed by Chandrayaan 2.
In the run-up to the election, we were unable to speak much about the great issue of A-Sat.
But the A-Sat missile is 300 km above the Earth in just 3 minutes.
On 22nd July, Pongal Chandrayaan swept the heart of the nation with pride.
Chandrayaan 2 - This goal is important in various angles.
Chandrayaan 2 will help in furthering our understanding of the Moon.
We will also face temporary setbacks in our lives
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to present an interesting competitive message to the student wealth of the country and the younger generation and I would like to urge our youth to participate in this quiz competition.
Space knowledge, Indias space programme and scientific technology will be the theme of this quiz competition.
For example, what is required to be done in rocket launch, how the satellite is placed on the circular track, what are we getting from the satellite, what is A-Sat
The competition is scheduled to be held on 1st August at MyGov portal.
I invite my young friends and student wealth...
I urge all schools, parents and enthusiastic teachers to work hard to make your school a success.
I encourage all the student wealth to connect with it.
The most interesting thing is that the Government of India will take the maximum number of students in each state to Sriharikota at their own expense.
Moreover, they will also get the opportunity to see Chandrayaan landscape in the area of land in September.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given a boost to the cleanliness drive at times
Similarly, the efforts being made for cleanliness have also inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that began five years ago today has set new benchmarks for cleanliness with the help of everyone's contribution.
I don't say that we have achieved the goal of cleanliness but the success of cleanliness drive from the habit of open defecation to the public places and the strength of the determination of 130 crore countrymen
But we are not going to stop with this.
This movement is now moving from unclean to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I had to know through the media about Yogesh Saini and his team.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer, who has quit his job in America and has returned to serve Mother India.
Sometime back, he made a challenge not only to make Delhi clean but also to make it beautiful.
Together with his team, he began his work from the rubbish dumps in Lothy Garden.
You might remember how the streets of Prayagraj were filled with paintings on the occasion of Kumbh.
I also came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team had shown their handwriting there.
We have experienced this in the beauty of cleanliness drive.
The principle of wealth from waste should be strengthened in our society and it should be our culture.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I had to read an interesting comment on MyGov.
Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Shobian area of Jammu and Kashmir, has recorded this.
I like Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy to note that I have contributed constructively in the Village Return Programme in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The Action Plan was organized in June.
I think this will be the first action plan that people directly engage with the government, Mahmoud said.
Many more things have been added to this programme to make it more interesting.
Children's sports events were organized under the Khelo India programme.
They were awarded sports equipment, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Certificates, List and Tribal Certificates.
In a way, this arrangement, the festival of development, the celebration of people's participation, is a celebration of public awareness.
People took part in this development festival of Kashmir in large numbers.
While it is a matter of great happiness that the developments of this Action Plan for Village Background had been done in the inner villages, the government officials had come out on difficult hills to reach such remote villages and walked on a two-day journey.
The officers also visited border villages across the border forever and beyond the border, and travelled without fear to the most nervous areas of Shobian, Pulvama, Gulkanw and Anantnag districts.
They have spent more than two days in these villages if the reception given to them has affected many officers.
Organizing Gram Sabha meetings in these areas, ensuring greater participation of people in these areas, and setting up their own programmes.
New determination, new zeal and wonderful results.
This makes it clear that those who seek to sow obstacles and obstacles during their journey of development will never succeed.
My dear countrymen, Dattatreya Ramachandra Bendre, who won the Gyanpeeth Award, has written about Mari Kaal in one of his poems
People from different cultures and languages across India are celebrating the month of Maritime in their own way.
If we look around us in this season then the earth will be seen as if we had wrestled some green cloth on it.
A new energy emanates from all sides.
In this sacred month many devotees take captivity, and take a pilgrimage to Amarnath, and many are fasting, and are eagerly waiting for festivals like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami.
This is the time when Raksha Bandhan is also a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
When we talk about Maritime, this time you will be happy to know that devotees have been participating in the Amarnath Yatra in more than four years.
Since 1st July, more than 3 lakh devotees have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than the number of people who took part in this pilgrimage for 60 days in 2015, the number has crossed in just 28 days.
I would like to specially congratulate the people of Jammu Kashmir and their hospitality in the backdrop of the success of Amarnath Yatra.
All those who have returned after completing their journey have been attracted by the hospitality and pride of the people of the state.
All these will be very useful for tourism in the future.
Even in Uttar Pradesh, this year Saradham has started a pilgrimage and more than 8 lakh devotees have come to Kedarnath temple in just about a month and a half.
For the first time since the terrible natural calamity of 2013, a large number of people have made such a pilgrimage.
I urge you people to go and enjoy the places of beauty in the monsoon season, wherever you may be in the country.
There cannot be any other person greater than tourism and pilgrimage to see such beautiful places of our country, to feel the feelings of our people.
May this beautiful month of Maritime bring new energy, new aspirations and new aspirations to all of you.
Similarly, in August, White House is bearing the memories of the uit India Movement.
On the other hand, there is heavy rainfall in different parts of the country and people of many parts of the country have been affected by floods.
When we look at the rain on television, we get a perspective - the floods, the floods, the waters and the transportation that we see.
I will come back after waiting for a month.
Today, people from all over the world will be celebrating Easter.
Today, when India is dancing with Australia, I extend my best wishes to the two contingents.
India won the gold medal in the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games, with India ranked 4th in the 1956 Olympic Games.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been brought down to the rankings.
Today, if our position in the FIFA rankings has declined, it is difficult to give up.
Be it EPL or Spanish League or be it Super League of India, today I can see the growing interest in footwear for the youth of India.
The youth of India are watching television to know more about football.
At the same time, we can use this opportunity to take footprints to every village and every street.
What kind of opportunity is the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup that we should strive to create a new zeal for youngsters in every corner of this year.
I consider this as an opportunity to brand India globally.
My dear students, you must have planned to visit tourism on holidays.
Maximum number of people go abroad and most of them travel in their states for 5 days and 7 days.
Some people leave their states and go to other states.
There is a doubt that there will be a district in India where I don't go.
There is an immense potential for tourism in creating our lives. Nowadays, the youth of India is showing great interest in tourism and their enthusiasm is increasing.
They don't travel on the path that the old model has built, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
I think it's a good sign.
There is also a case in our area that if coal keeps its hands shut then others will run away automatically.
But it is a pleasure to have a tourist circuit with the same coal.
This is just a beginning, so far, more than ten thousand people have enjoyed the coconut mining tourism that is suitable for the environment near Sawaner village near Nagpur.
It provides an opportunity to see an innovative one.
Can you contribute towards cleanliness while visiting other places during this holiday
This may not have been done very scientificly, but what is happening is true.
Can you also act as a tourist as a tourist with a strong commitment to cleanliness at the tourist destination
Compared to the world, tourism in India is far behind.
But if 125 crore people decide to strengthen our tourism sector with a determination then we can attract the world.
Come, let us move in this direction.
My young friends, I don't like that the holidays have come and gone.
You should also think in this regard.
Can we waste your vacation days, the great years of life and their immense moments
I'll put forth an idea for your thoughts.
Can you develop a skill during your vacation and add a new thing to your personality
If you don't know swimming then you can decide whether I will learn swimming during vacation or if you don't know how to drive a bike.
Even today, if I typically typically typically with two fingers, can I do the training of signatures
How many capabilities are there to nurture our governance
Why can't we learn them
Why don't we remove our grievances
Why shouldn't we develop our energy
Just imagine, there is no need for greater training, no trainee is required, no higher fee is required, no big cost is required.
Likewise, there will be discussions with other friends.
I am sure you will do this and tell me what you have learnt newly.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
Greetings, Prime Minister, during the last summer vacation, you had said that birds and birds should warm up, so we should keep them in a vessel at the balcony or at the bottom of the house so that they can get water.
I was very happy when I did this work, through which I became friends with many birds.
This time again I urge you to express it in your hearts.
He has telephoned me and reminded me of a good thing.
I was asking you to fill the water in the earthen vessels outside your house during the summer season.
Abhi has told me that he is doing this work throughout the year, so that many birds love him.
Mahadevi Varma, one of the world's greatest poets in the literature of Hindi, had a great deal of influence on birds.
He said in his poetry, I will not allow you to go far away, I will fill the whole with grains, I will fill the cold water everywhere.
Shilpa Cooke from Mysore has put forward a very sensible idea.
Have we ever given them water to drink
My sincere thanks to you, Shilpa, you have put forward a very emotional idea in a very natural manner.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people can think of this Digital India as a matter of some urban youth.
If you pay the App for the convenience of these farmers on your mobile phone then all the information related to agriculture and climate will be available in your hand.
What is the situation in the markets, what is the position in the markets, what is the tendency of good harvest and what kind of pesticides can be obtained from it.
And if you ask of them any questions, they answer or understand you.
I want my farmer brothers and sisters to unlock the App for the benefit of these farmers on their mobile phones.
We have made an effort to create wealth for water conservation through Manrekha.
The villages that have created this kind of awareness in the country may be several, the forerunners may be many, the citizens of the country may be aware.
I welcome this.
In 2014, there were about 612 crore diabetes patients in India.
According to statistics, 3 percent of deaths occur due to diabetes.
Diabetes is of two types, one type 1 and the other type 2.
Type 1 is genetically genetic, and the child is also born because of heredity and parents.
Type 2 is due to habits, due to age and physical fat.
This is the theme of the 7th World Health Day, because the world is raising concerns about diabetes.
Our lifestyle is a big reason for this.
Physical labour is declining.
Would we be able to embrace diabetes in our lives by 7th April
If every citizen of my country is healthy then India will be healthy.
Sometimes we don't get a medical check up done due to embarrassment.
It is only after the situation has worsened that there has been a diabetes disease for a long time.
The number of tuberculosis patients in other countries is low in our country.
This disease can be ended by proper treatment.
India must be freed from the grip of these diseases.
But without your cooperation, it cannot be eliminated only by governments, doctors and medicines.
Therefore, I urge the people of our country to end diabetes and eliminate TB.
My dear countrymen, several important events will take place in April, especially on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar ji.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated across the country throughout the year.
I am fortunate to visit Mhow, the birthplace of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April this year.
Baba Saheb has given us all that is required to become a better citizen.
We will be able to pay a special tribute to him by travelling on the way he showed and living as a good citizen.
Vikram will start the year in a few days.
The New Year is celebrated in different states in different forms.
My New Year greetings to everyone.
Last time I had told you that you can hear the voice of my mind whenever you want, you are aware of it and you can hear it in about 20 languages.
You can ask it at a comfortable time.
You can hear it on your mobile phone.
I am also happy to be with you.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Easter.
My young friends, all of you will be on the one hand and you will be on the other.
There is a wonderful inspiration.
Perhaps you are aware that India is going to host the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year in 2017.
If I say this thing then it is to insist that interest in footprint increases, but when such a huge opportunity reaches the doorsteps of India, can we fulfil our duties only by becoming devout
Last time also I had requested you people that wherever you are going, please portray the image of that place.
The work that was not done by the tourism department, the work that was not done by our cultural department, the work that was not done by the state governments and the government of India, has been done by millions and millions of people of the country.
When they look at the photographs that they have made, they really enjoy it.
We have to take this task forward and do the same thing this time too, but this time we should do something else.
You can not only send a photo but also showcase your creativity and you can see a lot of things while going to new places.
India is a diverse nation.
Once you start walking around, you will be traveling throughout your life, you will be enjoying yourself.
We would generally think that coal should remain away from mines.
When we look at the pictures of the people there, we can imagine what will happen there
I am confident that my young friends will definitely help me in this work.
Whether it is the government, the organisations, the society, the citizens, all of us will join hands in this task.
Your personality will be recognised by it and your self-confidence will increase to a large extent.
They are selling milk near our homes, newspaper sellers, postmen are coming, sometimes the client sellers and the brave sellers are passing through.
Have we ever asked if we want water to wash their thirst when the summer is hot
Only then can one drop of rain water be used wastelessly.
The beginning of farming for farmers is a very important one.
But if there is no water then we should think about what will happen to the people of the country.
This time you might have noticed that 5 lakh lakes are making efforts to construct irrigation ponds.
At my young age, I still remember that people are scared as soon as they hear the name of DP.
Appropriate treatment is essential to get rid of tuberculosis.
If you leave half the treatment, the disease will come back.
Give me a missed foot, whenever you have time, you can listen to the voice programmes of old Mann Ki Baat, you can listen to them in your language.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
In a way, this is my last episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be held in 2016.
In a way, we can say that every festival leaves the expectation of the next festival.
Sometimes India can also be called the fastest growing economy by festivals.
These are the reasons for the economic activity of the people below the society.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country on the occasion of Christmas and wishes for the year 2016.
May the year 2016 bring immense joy and joy to all of you, may it bring new zeal, new zeal and new determination to take you to new heights.
Whether it is terrorism, global warming, natural calamities or the embarrassment caused by mankind.
What can be a greater joy than this for humanity to live a peaceful life by eliminating them from all these things
Chawley Chawlakar ji is a tourist season, a large number of domestic and foreign tourists visit and people visit many places for Christmas celebrations
The way our tourist destinations are clean, I welcome the ideas and images of India and the spirit of others.
I am bringing the ideas of Ganesh ji among the people.
If guests come to our homes as guests in the tradition of seeing guests as gods then immediately we are engaging in cleaning and cleaning the house.
Similarly, we have to keep the tourist destinations, centres and tourist destinations of our country clean and clean.
I am glad that there are reports from all over the country about cleanliness.
From the very beginning, I have been conveying my appreciations to media friends on this topic.
Because they dug small and good things and take them to the public eye.
Considering that this work was extremely sacred, I had to study the fact that he had constructed 100 toilets in the village of Bhojpura only because of his hard work.
The country has been making rapid strides due to the continuous efforts of many.
The 125 crore people of the country are walking on the path of progress with shoulders and are moving ahead with the country.
Excellent education, improved skills and emerging employment opportunities
Life insurance schemes for citizens, banking facilities, unbroken global trading and setting up of new enterprises are on the one hand.
All the simple family members who cannot even go near the banks are now able to get loans easily through the Mudra scheme.
Indians have started to understand that the entire world has started taking part in the art of Yoga.
When the entire world celebrated the International Day of Yoga, how pride our country was, didn't it
This feeling is possible only when our thoughts and thoughts are enormous.
And it shall come to pass, when his mother opens the mouth of Jacob, that when he opens it, who can forget what she saw there, and what she saw there, and what she saw there
Similarly, Yoga Day has made us feel the importance of India as Indians.
Nowadays, talk about cleanliness is echoing in every household.
Be it a farmer, a poor, a young man or a mother, you have been the reason for a change in their lives that will bring about a massive satisfaction in the government officials who are engaged in the task of bringing electricity to those villages.
Can't I do everything alone alone
But when I talk about it, shouldn't I ever contribute to it
Even a simple citizen can join me in his mobile phone by offering an app called Narendra Modi.
I am sharing simple things in this regard.
It is a matter of happiness for me that people also share a lot of things with me.
Come, let us join hands in the interests of the common man, let us take it to the common man, let us motivate them to obtain their rightful things.
My dear young friends, on 15th August, I presented a fundamental idea of Start Up India and Stand Up India from the Red Fort.
After that, the idea of this thing has been intensified in all the departments of the government.
Can India become the start-up capital
Start-up India, Stand-up India, has brought a huge opportunity to the younger community.
My dear young friends, the Government of India is launching the Start Up India Stand Up India programme on 16th January at full swing.
We have a stable idea about start-ups that the start-up is only for those in the digital world and IT sector.
We have to make changes in this regard keeping in mind the needs of India.
The intellectual ability of our younger generation is spread all over the country.
This start-up India and stand-up India should not exceed in some of the cities, it should spread to the shores of India untouched.
Therefore, I appeal to all the State Governments to take this project forward.
On January 16, I will definitely have a detailed interaction with you.
I am eagerly looking forward to your suggestions.
My dear young friends, January 12 is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
There are millions and millions of people in this country like me.
From 1995 to January 12, we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda on the occasion of National Youth Day.
The celebrations are scheduled to take place in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from January 12 to January 16 this year.
I would especially urge my young friends to send your suggestions directly to me through my Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand what is in your mind.
Dilip Chouhan from Ahmedabad in Gujarat is a disabled person who observed the Accessible India Day in his school.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
Sometimes when we meet human beings like him in our lives, there will be solid thoughts in our minds.
The perspective of human beings like this will emerge from our thoughts.
There is no doubt that I have a significance in words.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Yojana, arrangements were made to participate in it.
But I could not participate in this program because I had to go there in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai due to the severe floods.
Though I could not participate in this programme, the thoughts about it were emerging in my mind.
Innovations need to be simplified in all forms such as schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, easy accessibility parks, lifts and vernacular writings, technology requirements, systems required and understanding.
They should not be clothed in the walls and die.
Isn't there any plans for the common man and the poor
Efforts were made a few days ago about how to simplify the benefits of the scheme to the beneficiary.
The subsidy for gas cylinders is being disbursed in our country.
For this, crores of rupees are being spent but no account has been filed for this.
The government has made a small change in the supply of subsidy to know whether the subsidy is reaching the real beneficiaries or not or not at the right time.
By the end of November, nearly 15 crore people are beneficiaries of the Pahal Gas Yojana.
Direct subsidy is being transferred to the bank accounts of these 15 crore beneficiaries.
This is happening without intermediaries, recommendations and the possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the movement for Aadhar Identity Card (AIC) and on the other hand Jan Dhan bank account opening and on the other hand, the Central Governments have been working together to prepare the list of beneficiaries and link it with Aadhaar Identity Card and Bank Account.
There were so many accusations about the scheme.
In many places, the bank accounts of the labourers who have made money are being directly credited.
So far, about Rs. 40,000 crore has been directly credited to beneficiaries' bank accounts for about 35-40 projects.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a golden moment for the Republic of India.
It is a very pleasant occasion to celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
We have to take this forward.
During the elections, more advertisements will be published on the walls and plates will be placed.
We will talk a lot about our duties during the elections but why not talk about the same duties in daily life
This year when we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, can we organise an essay competition, poetry competition and dialogue competition in schools, colleges, in our villages and towns, in different societies and associations on 26th January
When 125 crore people of the country take one step after the other with a sense of duty then how big a history will be created.
On 26th January, when we observe the Presidents Day on January 26, cannot the students of schools and colleges be decorated with the statues of the leaders of our city and the places surrounding it in a very special manner by the citizens
I would like to put forward this idea as a citizen.
We are dedicating ourselves to the maintenance of the statues of those leaders whom we are extremely passionate about setting up the shrines.
Can we continue to clean up as a society and as a nation
On 26th January this year, we will join hands in this effort.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes for the New Year 2016.
Thank you very much.
On the other hand, the start of the Christmas festival is going on.
There is a separate place for festivals in social life.
Sometimes festivals are also useful for causing wounds and sometimes they give a new incentive.
But sometimes when there are difficulties in the days of festivals, they are extremely sad.
There are constant reports of natural disasters from every corner of the world.
Until now, there have been unquestionable reports of disaster incidents.
Now we are enjoying the rapid impact of climate change.
State Governments are engaged in rescue and disaster relief operations at full swing.
The central government has always worked shoulder to shoulder.
I am confident that even after all these difficulties, Tamil Nadu will once again be on the path of rapid progress and will contribute to the progress of the country.
But when we face such a terrible situation from all sides, there is a feeling of a change.
Until about 15 years ago, the natural calamity was associated with the agriculture sector because at that time the natural calamity was only due to drought and famine.
Governments, civil society, citizens, small and large organizations have to work in the field of scientific development.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had to interact with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
I also suggested that a joint activity should be undertaken to collaborate with the South Asian nations to combat disasters.
I am happy to note that a theme workshop in this regard and a seminar on best practices to combat disasters has been held in New Delhi.
This is a good beginning.
I speak to Lakvinder Singh from Jalandhari, Punjab.
We are engaged in organic farming here and are also guiding many more in agriculture.
One of the reasons for this is that you are doing organic farming.
It is also a matter of great pleasure that you are not only doing this but also understanding the problems of the farmers.
Your concerns are justified but this is not happening only in the states of Punjab and Haryana.
This is our usual practice throughout India and we have traditionally burnt the agricultural waste after the yield.
We were unaware of the evil caused by the burning of this kind of burning in the past, all of us do it, so I do it too.
Because of this, it has continued and increased and today it has been associated with climate change.
After the impact of this embarrassment began to reach the cities, the voices of the people started shouting.
That's the real concern you've expressed.
In the first phase, our agricultural friends should be trained and they should explain the truth.
In such a scenario, burning of post-harvest agricultural wastes can reduce the time, reduce the difficulty and make the land ready for the next time.
But this is not the right regulation.
Post-harvest waste is also very precious.
They're naturally fertile.
We're wasting them.
Not only this, if we make them tiny pieces then they can be guests for animals.
Secondly, due to the burning of them, the layer on the ground will be lightened.
My farmer brothers and sisters, think for a moment, our bones are firm, our heart works well, our kidneys work properly, everything is fine but if the skin on the body burns then can we survive
If the skin of our body gets burnt then we cannot survive, similarly if we burn after harvest and the remains of farm produce, the skin of the mother Earth burns and the layer on our land burns
Therefore, we have to take constructive steps in this direction.
I got an opportunity to interact with the farmers engaged in banana cultivation.
They shared their excellent experiences with me.
Earlier, after harvesting the livelihood, they had to spend 500000, 15000 rupees per hectare to eradicate the livelihood.
No work was going on till the man who had to take them to the tractors.
Last time, in Mann Ki Baat, I had spoken about organ donation.
In this regard, I mentioned the NOTO free phone number.
Film actress Raveena Dundan and many others joined the film.
Organ donation can save many lives.
What could be a bigger donation than this
The National Level Organ Transplant Registration Centre (NLOR) was launched on November 27, 2019 with details of patients waiting for organs and body part donations.
I am confident that awareness will spread in this sector and I believe that those who need it will get help in time.
Because unless there is no one to donate, this assistance will not be available in any way.
I had told you earlier that on 3rd December we will be observing Divyangjans Day.
Physically challenged persons have unparalleled courage and disabilities.
Sometimes when they are portrayed as funny things, the mind becomes sad.
Sometimes compassion and compassion are expressed on them.
But if we change our perspective, if we correct their vision then they will become a motivation for us as well, they will become a motivation for us to achieve achievements.
Their determination, their devotion to life, their ability to transform embarrassments into favourites, their thirst, and their appreciation.
Today I would like to talk about Javed Ahmad Ji, 40-42 years old.
In 1996, extremists fired at Jawad Ahmad in Kachmir.
But Javed Ahmed did not accept the defeat.
The wounds of extremism did not make him coward.
There was no role in his motivation, a person who was not guilty of any crime had been punished and his youth was wasted, but there was no anger or hatred in his mind.
Although the body has not cooperated, he has dedicated himself to the cause of child education for the past 20 years.
As a social worker, as a conscious citizen, he has been a sovereign messenger of persons with disabilities.
Isn't it sufficient that Javed ji's life becomes compassionate for all Indians
I would like to commemorate the life and dedication of Javed ji on the 3rd of December.
Though I have been able to talk only about Javed Ji today due to lack of time, even though the hypnotising lamps across the corner of India are shining, they are giving a boost to live and they are traversing the path.
Thus, on 3rd December, we have to draw inspiration from them.
In many matters, we have to depend on governments.
The central elite, the lower middle class, the lower class, the downtrodden, the deprived, the deprived and the oppressed, are all in constant touch with government and state-related organisations.
As an ordinary citizen, they are likely to have a bad experience with government employees in some way or the other.
These couples are spending their wealth on the development of the poor in their retirement life.
The entire tribal population is the smallest village in Balasore district of Odisha.
It is a poverty-stricken village that is suffering from malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, an ASHA worker from this village, decided that I will ensure that no one from this Denthaka will die due to malaria.
He has stepped up the struggle against Malaria and prepared the entire village to face it.
There are so many such jubilee hours in the country.
You should not only study but also recommend to others.
Creative energy is the greatest power.
You should also share good events related to this, share these e-books and communicate with them.
My dear countrymen, the world is deeply concerned about climate change.
National Energy Conservation Day on 14th December
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
The LED pulp movement is progressing on the verge.
Once I had said that I should embrace the street lights on the night of Poornima and wet it for an hour in the entire landscape.
A friend had sent a link in my sight and I had the opportunity to see it.
I felt like sharing it with you.
He is trying to provide light to the poor by using solar energy, he is fighting with darkness, he is acting in accordance with his name and he has created a group of women.
He has also launched a solar-powered lunar lighting workshop.
He is offering these lunar lights at a cost of 100 rupees per month.
People take these lamps in the evening and give them light in the morning.
I know that as far as I have heard, nearly 500 households are giving away such e-listed lunars.
During the day, this Nurjahan has been working to provide e-mail to the lenders.
But a good start has been made.
In a very short span of time, 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42,000 crore through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am happy that out of 66 lakh beneficiaries, 24 lakh are women.
I had said earlier that Swachh Bharat would create such entrepreneurs.
They have acknowledged this in Silesh Bhonsle.
He is doing this by buying a tanker and in a short span of time he has repaid a loan of Rs. 2 lakh to the bank.
This is our objective of the Mudra Yojana.
Similar mention was made in the case of Mamta Sharma from Bhopal.
He also received 40,000 rupees from the bank under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He is engaged in the manufacturing work.
Because there is no need to pay more interest, it saves about 1000 rupees per month.
There is also a good business for his family.
But I want this scheme to be further popularized and expanded.
All our banks must access it with greater understanding and come forward to help small businesses in a big way.
In fact, they are acting as economic operators of the country.
These are the economic forces of the country.
We want to inspire them.
Good thing has happened, but it has to be more and more effective.
This means that the permanent awareness of Rashtrayam Jagriam Vyam, Eternal Vigilance is the price of our freedom.
The spirit of unity of the country should continue to shine.
But I expect more suggestions.
I am confident that your suggestions will certainly be in the process of benefitting.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is about to start.
Once again my best wishes to the people of my country Jai Hind
Once again I have got the opportunity to interact with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the 5th day cricket match between India and South Africa is being played in Mumbai.
The 5-day cricket competition is called Gandhi Mandela series.
Hence, interest in final competition has increased.
My best wishes to all sportspersons
Today, I congratulate All India Radio's visionary friends.
Therefore, I convey my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to all the friends of the Church Radio Station.
Once again I would like to mention about Kerala.
Clean Mary Upper Primary Schoolgirls from Chittor, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter was special in many respects.
One, these girls had registered their thumb mip and dressed Bharat Mata in a very large cloth.
They have sent me the map of Bharat Mata, the map of India.
First of all, I was surprised that they had portrayed the film with their thumb mip records.
But after reading the letter they wrote, I knew how large they had sent me the index.
They are involving themselves in the movement of awareness about organ donation.
The 80 year old Vasant Rao Suduke Guruji of Maharashtra has been running a movement for a long time.
He wants to celebrate body organ donation as a festival.
Nowadays, many news and information are coming to me through phone.
Even Devesh ji from Delhi has sent me such a message.
From Delhi, I am happy to note that the efforts of the government towards organ donation and the policy plans related to it.
Countries like China are at the forefront of physical organ donation and I feel that the goal of the government to donate one million organs is commendable.
More than 12 lakh kidneys, heart and liver donations are required every year in the country.
But in a country of 125 crore people, we can implement only 5000 physical organ transplants.
Every year it is necessary to provide light to one lakh eyes.
But we can only pay attention to 25,000 people.
We can give only one person that is required for four people.
Efforts are being made to provide directions to the State Governments in this regard.
Some states have made good strides in simplifying administrative procedures in this regard.
I am told that Tamil Nadu is at the forefront of organ donation.
A 24-hour helpline 1800 114770 service is provided.
Our ancestors are also shouting at the Honey Dyakadena Punjeeta
That is, the joy of being sacrificed is what they used to say with the words of Honey Dyaktena Punjitha.
During the last few days, the GST rates have been increased from Rs.
This operation was successful, saved a life.
A few days later, we are also celebrating the festival of Deepawali.
We also celebrated the festivals of Eid and Vinayak Chaturthi.
The India Africa Summit is scheduled to be held in New Delhi from 26th to 29th October, 2019.
This is the first time that such a massive conference will be held on Indian soil.
Heads of 54 African countries and Unions have been invited to participate in the conference.
The population of both our countries is one-third of the world.
Millions of years ago, India and Africa had been the only landmark, and later became two components of the Indian Ocean.
We have a lot of solidarity.
Indias wildlife and wildlife can have many similarities.
There is a lot of comparison with natural resources.
About 27 lakh Indians have lived in Africa for many years.
India and Africa have linkages in economic, culture and politics.
But, above all, India is playing a major role in training the younger generations of African countries.
More than 25,000 African students have studied in India in the field of human resource development and capacity building.
This time, the Government of India, particularly the Ministry of Human Resource Development, is organizing a very important event.
Competitions have been organised in schools connected with CBSE among all students in poetry writing and enhancing their contribution.
Thousands of schoolchildren had written about the information on Indian African connections.
Millions of school students visited the exhibition, the people of the village saw that what was the contribution of Ananth Gandhiji in the relationship between Africa and India, people knew and understood how his impact was on the minds of the people of these two regions.
There were many outstanding contributions in the competition.
A poem is my heart, it is my favorite, so I would like to teach you this.
I congratulate Kalaignar and all the students who have participated in this competition, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
On August 15, 2014, I had mentioned about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, the Model Village Programme of the Parliamentarian.
Thereafter, several member friends have completed this task.
They are fully involved in this.
A thematic workshop was organized in Bhopal last month.
The meeting was attended by leaders from the villages, district governments, some MPs and officials from the Central and State Governments in collaboration with them on Model Village Programme.
Through this, a variety of new ideas have emerged and they are inspiring.
I would certainly like to bring to your notice some things.
Jharkhand is one of the most tribal areas.
Unfortunately, it will be remembered when we talk about Jharkhand that is Mao extremists, bomb culture and massacres.
Several areas have been destroyed by the impact of these left-wing extremists.
However, our senior parliamentarian, Kariya Munda, who has been working as the deputy speaker of the Parliament, has dedicated his life to the tribal people.
He started going there, he lit up hope in the minds of the people, he tried to give life to the government systems, he encouraged the officers to come and work there.
He established the country to bring about development in the long-running neglected area.
Besides infrastructure in the Model Village Scheme, a successful effort to create awareness in the minds of the people was made in this Parsi village of Jharkhand.
I convey my best wishes to the distinguished parliamentarian Kariya Munda.
Other arrangements are going on and he has created a great innovation in this regard.
He handed over the schoolchildren to do a job.
He called upon the upper classes of school students to educate their parents in this class.
The school was thus educating students in the morning and their parents in the evening.
Similar children taught about 550 uneducated senior citizens.
Look, how a big change has been brought about in the society without any budget, without circularity, without any special facilities and with mere determination.
This is the lesson given to us by the Dwaraputi Gram Panchayat.
This village is known for its production of sugarcane and sugarcane festival.
Ruwala ji inaugurated the Sugarcane Festival in this village on 11th March.
He has drawn our attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I would like to remind you of one thing that after the festival of Deepawali last year, a movement was organised in our country, especially in the media.
Just as we are making efforts to ensure cleanliness before the festivals, similarly, even after the festivals, your idea of continuing it is correct.
This kind of work should be done in every public event.
Today, I congratulate all the media in India.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and the completion of one year after the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission, the India Today Group had the privilege of participating in the event called Safai Giri.
During the last one year, he has been encouraging Swachhta related work through E-TV, which has news coverage in his newspapers and focuses only on creative work.
He has connected about 55 to 56,000 schools in Andhra and Telangana to Swachh Bharat Mission.
Whether it is public places, railway stations, places of worship, hospitals or gardens, cleanliness drive is being carried out in many places.
These news also strengthens the formation of a Clean India.
ABP News Channel has launched an event titled India My Nation.
The people of the country had sown the idea of cleanliness in their hearts, inspiring the awareness of cleanliness among the people.
NDTV organised a mission to create a Swachh Bharat.
There are several channels, several newspapers in our country, and because of the lack of time, I could not mention the names of all but everybody took this movement.
For the past several years, this village has been working as a drive for cleanliness and every generation has been actively taking up the issue of cleanliness.
A few years ago, the Governor wrote that this village has been awarded the cleanest village in Asia.
I am happy to note that a village in Meghalaya, a remote north-eastern region of our country, has been engaged in cleanliness for several years.
This has become the culture of the village itself.
Such events give us confidence in ourselves that our country is clean.
My dear countrymen, when I was speaking from the ramparts of Red Fort on 15th August, I had said that corruption had become cheaper in the country.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
In the last budget, we made an important announcement.
As per this, you can get interest on depositing your gold in the bank, just as you get interest on your investment amount, similarly you can get the interest on the gold deposited in the bank.
Now the gold will be in the bank but the money will be given to you through bank interest.
Now tell me, my countrymen, will gold and money be spent or not
Wouldn't the unprofitable gold turn into an integral force
Don't keep gold in the house waste.
Do not miss the benefits of its safety and rotation.
Therefore, we will not have to buy gold, we will not have to protect gold and no one will ever get the papers.
I will certainly dedicate this project to the people of the country next week.
But we have either used foreign gold coins so far or have used foreign gold bonds.
Why shouldn't there be an independent index for our country
Thus, in the coming week, the Indian Gold Coin, which was compounded by the Ashoka Chakra of 5 Grams and 10 Grams, will be released before the Dentres Holy Day.
Besides, 20 grams of gold will also be provided to the people.
I am sure that this new scheme will bring a new transformation in the path of economic development, in which I am confident that your entire cooperation will be with me.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji was born.
When Patel, who was the theme of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, was thinking about them, the entire India would be inspired.
This great man has contributed immensely to India's unity.
Not only these diversities, but the beauty that has given us pride will not reach us.
Therefore, only diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last several years, a unity drive has been launched on October 31.
I have got the opportunity to take part in it earlier.
I have been told that this time too, arrangements are being made in different parts of the country and people are making preparations for unity with enthusiasm.
The movement of unity is actually a drive towards development.
In other words, the guarantee for development is the drive to unity.
Come, let us pay tributes to Sardar ji.
We will carry forward the mantra of unity.
My dear brothers and sisters, you all are preparing for the festival of Deepawali.
I specially urge parents to enjoy the festival of Deepawali, but we have to do something that will not affect our children.
My dear countrymen, the day after Diwali, I will go to Britain.
This time my visit to Britain is very interesting.
There is a special reason for this.
I am confident that this memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will be a place of pilgrimage and a motivation for our children to study in Britain.
This is the message that Baba Saheb Ambedkar has provided for his life as much as he can and lives for the rest of the country.
The work that Lord Basaveswar had done for democracy and empowerment of women several years ago is a matter of pride for everyone.
The dedication of the Thiruvananthapuram Statue of Lord Basaveshwar to the world in London is an excellent example of the idealism and vision of Indias great personalities centuries ago.
When such an event comes together, the hearts of all the people of the country are filled with sacredness.
in. Your suggestions are coming to me.
Later, programmes are being prepared in All India Radio with your letters, discussions are being held by inviting government officials and efforts are being made to find solutions when some people write about their problems.
In a country like India, we need to learn many languages.
It is true that even though I have the best to learn some languages, I cannot learn so many languages.
I will definitely try to enter your minds in your language at 8 pm.
Look at how beautiful our relationship is.
The last one year was over
Today we are stepping up in a new year.
Once again my best wishes to the people of our country.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all. This is the 12th edition of Mann Ki Baat.
Peoples power has great significance in democracy.
There is a feeling that is fundamental in my life and that is why I have great faith in this peoples power.
But Mann Ki Baat has learnt a lot of things, they have experienced and we all have to understand the immense power of the people.
Our ancestors have made it clear that Jan Shakti Mahesan Shakti.
I can say that keeping in mind my experiences in Mann Ki Baat, in the minds of our ancestors, there is great power and great truth.
In this regard, I congratulate All India Radio and they did not just see these suggestions in paper but they looked upon them as the expectations of the masses.
As far as the administration is concerned, information must be from the bottom to the bottom, and guidance must be from top to bottom.
Who would have imagined that Mann Ki Baat would be the source of information
But that's how it happened.
On 2nd October, we celebrate Gandhijis birth anniversary.
There was a time when there used to be threads for the country but today there should be threads for fashion.
I said no more, buy something a bit.
I am glad that in the last one year, the sale of pearls has almost doubled.
It is difficult to discontinue the subsidies of the society, the middle class and the lower middle class.
Nevertheless they were driven away.
Isn't this a peace revolution
Isn't this the expression of people's power
The governments must also learn the lesson that the power of the people is immense beyond the powers of the government departments and that it is capable, capable and determined.
Whatever I had faith in, after Mann Ki Baat programme, all these things have become my guarantee.
Therefore, today, through Mann Ki Baat, once again I would like to offer my heartfelt greetings to the people.
People considered the small things that I had said as one thing and made them their own for the welfare of the country and added them to it.
What could be more satisfactory than this
This time, in Mann Ki Baat, I thought of handling a new approach.
I had requested the people of the country to contact you through phone and register your questions and your suggestions.
Consultations from all parts of India are gathering so that there is no incoming calls.
It's a pleasant experience.
All age groups have given advice.
It was comfortable to ask some suggestions, while my team is focusing on the rest.
You might have spoken for a couple of minutes but for me, your suggestions and messages are very important.
The government will pay full attention to your suggestions.
It is generally felt that negative thoughts are negative on all sides.
But my experience is different.
Moreover, appeals from differently abled persons, particularly those with visual impairment, have received a lot of appeals.
They can't watch television, it may be one of the main reasons why they need radio.
Bhawan Acharya Ji from Alwar in Rajasthan is sharing a message with me.
I want the people of the country to listen to the advice of Bhawan Acharya Ji and follow it.
My name is Pavan Acharya, and I am of Alwar in Rajasthan.
On the occasion of Deepawali, I urge the people of the country to make use of kerosene lamps in large numbers, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji in his Mann Ki Baat.
Moreover, he has been asking for employment for thousands of soil-grained poor, while not polluting the environment through the use of soil erosion.
If we listen to the advice of Bhawan Acharya Ji on the occasion of the coming festivals then soil lights will be installed in our houses but I appeal to the people of the country that its light will spread to the poor family.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the three forces during the Ganesh Chaturthi.
After 50 years of the war with Pakistan in 1965, an exhibition titled Anjali for Gallantry is being organised near India Gate in Delhi.
We have been asking questions about the glorious moments of the war, the brave courage and sacrifice of our soldiers.
If you want to make history then you must understand the nuances of history very well.
History connects us with our roots.
Cleanliness should be our nature and we should also provide the means for it.
I didn't misunderstand this.
I have seen this thing in a good way that the country's parliament is also engaged in cleanliness debates.
Look, on the other hand, what can be a matter of pride for the country than the Parliament and on the other hand the children of the country are talking about cleanliness
The movement of ideas is taking place and an atmosphere is being created against pollution and an awareness has been created about cleanliness.
Do you know what Gandhiji said
Once he had said that if I want to choose between freedom and cleanliness, then I would like cleanliness first and then I would like the country's independence.
Cleanliness was more important than freedom for Gandhiji.
Kulshan Arora, from Delhi, has filed a report on the MyGov website.
Deendayal Upadhyay ji wanted to know about his centenary.
Even last year, I had said that the clothes of several types of fashions and clothes might be of different kinds, but I had told them that they should have a lot of fashion.
I urge you to give it something.
Last time you almost doubled the sales.
How many poor people have benefited from this
You have completed the work that the government cannot afford to spend several crores of rupees with a little help.
This is the people's power, so I once again appeal to you in this regard.
My dear countrymen, my heart is also joyful for something else.
I would like to share this with you.
I had gone to Kolkata in May and the family members of Subhas Bose had come to meet me.
His brother son Chandra Bose had organised the meeting.
Sandra Bose and his family were involved in this work and it was decided last week that more than fifty family members of Subhas Bose will come to the Prime Minister's house.
Can you imagine how it will give me immense pleasure
Many of Subhas Babu's family live in other countries.
Everyone is coming here for this reason. Do you know how enjoyable it is to me
I look forward to welcoming them.
We have to make it a habit.
I want the youth of the country to make efforts to connect themselves with the electoral rolls and participate in the voting.
During the elections, I am certainly saying one thing - first vote, then everything else.
Everyone should do this sacred work.
I met a young man studying class VIII Kshitij Pandey.
He is studying class 7 in the Kendariya Vidyalaya of Banaras Hindu University.
Likewise, there was a chance to meet a girl named Sonam Patel.
This 9-year-old girl, who lives in Sundarpur, Varanasi, is the daughter of Sadavaruj Patel.
She's a woman from a very poor family.
The whole singing of the girl was a singular lesson, but the greatest thing is that when she heard about any slogan of the song, she delivered it and gave her English explanation and Hindi language.
When I asked her father about this, she said she was telling this from her 5th year.
He added that it is a wonder to all of us in the family.
This had a big impact on me in your own right.
Some children have a sympathy for popularity, but child Sonamuk has no such commitment.
I only felt that God has given her some special power.
I met these two children during my visit to Kashi.
I wanted to share this with you.
Once a month you have to make the voice of your mind once a week because we get more zeal from it.
Surely, you don't know what you want from me to get a job
Now it is perfect for a month.
A year has passed since Mann Ki Baat began.
Do you know how Subhas Babu used the data
He started his broadcast in Germany and spread his ideas on the subject of freedom for the people of India through Radio.
Azad made the beginning of the Hindi radio through a weekly news report.
He broadcast radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Urdu and Pashtu.
Even me, a year has passed since my radio broadcast through Mann Ki Baat.
Your contribution is worthless to me.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
Once again I have got a good opportunity to inform you about the voice of my heart.
People are celebrating the festival of Onam in the southern part of the country and yesterday the festival of Raksha Bandhan was celebrated across the country.
The Government of India has implemented a number of new schemes for social security in the interest of the people.
I am glad that in a very short span of time all of them have joined themselves in these schemes in a broad way.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan tomorrow, I had made a small request to our sisters to bring the benefits of these security schemes.
I have been told that about 11 crore families have been connecting themselves with this scheme in a short while after the launch of the scheme.
I am glad that half of the beneficiaries are mothers and sisters.
I think this is a good sign.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
About a year ago, we started implementing Jan Dhan Yojana in a big way.
Several questions and doubts were raised whether a scheme which cannot be completed in 60 years can be implemented in such a short span of time.
However, it is a matter of great pleasure that all the departments involved in the implementation of this scheme, all the branches of the banks, the entire energy and mind are engaged in this thing and we have succeeded in this thing that on the basis of the information given to me so far, about 17.
They have saved 22,000 crore rupees in the same amount even though it was said that the geographical account could be started.
One of the major incentives of the economy is the banking sector, which has reached the homes of the poor.
Today 1.
25 lakh bank comrades are working on the ground.
This has provided employment opportunities to the youth.
Now thousands of people have become empowered to take overdraft due to this scheme.
There is hope that the poor will get bank loans.
Once again I convey my best wishes and congratulations to all those associated with it and I urge all the poor people not to break your bonds with the banks at all times.
Banks are yours, don't leave you in any way.
We have brought the banks to the doorsteps of your houses, do not leave it alone, take it firmly.
There should be cash flow in the bank accounts of all of us.
I have unwavering faith that you will certainly do it.
Over the past few days, the incidents in Gujarat, the violence and violence have caused the entire nation to lose peace, this is a natural feeling.
This kind of incident has happened on the soil of the birth of Gandhi and Sardar that causes deep sorrow and pain to all the people of the country.
Peace, integrity and brotherhood - this path is right
On the path of progress, all of us must walk shoulder to shoulder.
Progress can only be solved for all our problems.
India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, has visited Buddha Gaya.
I am proud that Buddhist certifications from all over the world are participating in this event.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I want to share my heart with you.
I am ready to accept any suggestion regarding the welfare of the farmers. I have been saying this several times.
My farmer brothers and sisters, my dear farmers, do not be drunk, do not be afraid.
I assure you that we will not take any action so that anybody can lead you on the wrong path in order to make you sick and frighten you.
For us, every citizen of the country has a value but there is a unique significance in the thoughts and voices of the farmers.
We brought an emergency law.
The Ordinance will expire on 31st August tomorrow.
This will ensure that farmers do not face economic losses.
For us, the words Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan are not mere words but I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that this is a mantra.
The interests of the poor farmers in the villages are in our hearts.
Therefore, in my Independence Day address, I had mentioned that not only the agriculture sector but also the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.
We are taking this resolution forward at a rapid pace.
I'd like to talk about another thing.
Two days ago, the war ended in 1965, 50 years.
Whenever we talk about the war in 1965, it is natural to recall Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
Similarly, the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan will also remind us.
Our scientists are really making great strides.
I have been given a lot of new information.
This is inspiring and educating for me.
Many young scientists have very quickly shared things with me and I have dreamt in their eyes.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said that we should lead our student wealth towards science.
I had also spoken on the occasion of my Independence Day as to what is the need for a direct selection in the lower level jobs.
On the invitation of the Direct Examination, every poor family and widowed mother have to wander about issues related to receiving letters of recommendation, seeking help from whom to get jobs.
This is also one of the reasons for corruption at the bottom.
I had said that there should not be a direct choice under a specific condition.
I am glad that the government has been making rapid strides in this direction, the suggestions are being given, the decision will be passed almost and the method of direct examination for grass root level posts will be wasted.
Today, there have been international leaders coming to India.
In order to reduce the maternal and child mortality rate, 24 countries of the world have organized a conference in India in coordination with implementing the Call to Action Action Plans.
For the first time outside the US, this ideological meeting was held in India.
Every year about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die after childbirth.
Just as we were released from the polio, we were released from Tedans, a cause of mother and child deaths.
It is also accepted by the world.
But even today we must save our mothers and our children.
Brothers and sisters, today the dengue pole is spreading.
It is true that dengue fever is dangerous, but it is very easy to get rid of it.
My request for a Swachh Bharat is linked to it.
Even if we watch advertising on television, our focus is not on them.
While advertising in newspapers, our minds are not paid.
Awareness is being generated on small issues at homes, clean drinking water and safe drinking water.
However, we don't care about it, we live in good houses, there are many facilities in it, but we don't know that sometimes water is stagnant around us.
I urge you not to extend your handkerchief to death so easily.
Life is a very valued one.
This is not the case with calls for death due to lack of water conservation and neglect of cleanliness.
About 514 dengue fever centres have been set up across the country and free tests have been conducted here.
Timely testing and treatment is something that suits life-saving.
Your cooperation is very important in this regard.
From Raksha Bandhan to Deepawali, there will be celebrations and festivals in the coming days in our country.
Why shouldn't we connect all our festivals with cleanliness
Good records become a habit, huh
My dear countrymen, I want to share a happy news with you people.
Hydendra Mahajan, Dr.
The interests of our tribal people are shining in the minds of Mahendra Mahajan.
These two brothers have made India proud.
This year, these two brothers have succeeded in this festival and have made India proud.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to these two brothers.
But they are taking into consideration the interests of ethnic groups - Team India, Vision for Tribals - in all these efforts.
See how everyone is contributing to the country's progress.
When one hears about such events, one feels proud.
Sometimes we do terrible injustice to our younger generation because of our perspective.
I believe that this trend has been going on for centuries.
But my experience with the younger generation is different.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth, we can also learn many things.
On Sunday on cycle, I have met many young people who have decided to ride a bike.
Some people pursue it as a cycle day one day a week that I will travel on a bike.
They say that I get the pleasure that my body is healthy and good for the environment, that is why I have the pleasure of being young.
Nowadays, cycle clubs are operating in many cities of our country and there are many people who are encouraging the cycle journey.
This is a good effort for health and environmental well-being.
Just as the achievement of two youngsters of India has made the country proud, the vision of the youth of the country is remarkable.
The monument of Baba Saheb Ambedkar in the Hindu Mills land of Mumbai has been dragging it out for a long time.
When the Indians around the world go to London, there will be a monumental monument of Baba Saheb Ambedkar who will form the Maharashtra government.
I also extend my heartfelt congratulations and congratulations to the state government of Maharashtra, who are trying to set up these two monuments to make Baba Saheb Ambedkar proud.
My best wishes and thanks to you all.
There is a shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor need pulses, and there is a need for some number of pulses to be mixed in porridge.
I am glad that this time, there is an increase of 50 per cent in pulses and about 33 per cent increase in oilseeds.
I extend my heartiest greetings to my farmer brothers in this regard.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of July has been recorded as a successful day in our country's history and Kargil war.
The Kargil war is not only on the borders, but every village and city of India has contributed to it.
I consider July 26 as a matter of great importance.
In a few months after the formation of our government in 2014, we launched the MyGov portal on 26th July.
I am glad that nearly two crore people have visited the MyGov portal after the completion of nearly a year after the formation of the government and about 5.
It is also a matter of great pleasure that more than 50,000 people have given their suggestions on PMO application, have spent their golden time and have put their thoughts on it.
They have given very good advice.
However, the people in the government have not yet taken into consideration this thing but the government has taken into consideration the suggestions of brother Akhilesh Vajpayee Ji and today we are implementing it.
Today, logo and tag lines are being created for any scheme of the government, projects are being devised, policies are being formulated and more constructive suggestions are being received on the MyGov website.
Nowadays, on 15th August, I have also been receiving suggestions on mygov address regarding what I should address.
Susitra Photovacharya from Chennai has given me many suggestions.
He said that we should protect our daughters, keep our daughters studying, talk about Clean Ganga, Clean India.
This has boosted one thought in my mind and this time you can register your views on what I should address on 15th August.
You can send it to Mygov address, write it to the radio, send it to the Prime Minister's Office.
In my speech on 15th August, it is a wonderful idea that I should get the place from the public.
I am sure you will give me the best ideas.
My thoughts went on an accident in Delhi two days ago and after that accident, the life of the person who had travelled in a scooter sparked for ten minutes.
He did not get any help.
On several occasions people have been asking me to talk about road safety and create awareness.
It's all right for you.
If we ignore statistics, the heart will stop.
Every minute an accident is taking place in our country.
But I urge the parents to create an environment in the family that is related to safety, whether it is a two-wheeler vehicle or a four-wheeler.
The government has also taken several initiatives in this regard - be it awareness of road safety, engineering of road construction, law enforcement, providing emergency treatment to those injured after the accident, we are bringing the Road Transport and Safety Bill in mind.
In the coming days, we are planning to make several important efforts to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Agenda.
From Kutgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara to Mumbai and Ranchi, we have given importance to cashless treatment on national highways.
Accordingly, we are thinking about the best possible life saving measures and how to provide maintenance in the first 50 hours by postponing the issues relating to whoever does not have the money.
We must approach it first from the perspective of how accidents are not taking place, in fact, the value of every living being is precious.
Sometimes I say that the workers should be Karma Yogis.
In the last few days, I share with you some of the events that touched my heart with this idea.
It is a good feeling to see how they can bring life even in their works.
Vijay Biswaal ji has shown how his country, his artistic vision and his openness can be linked to his work.
I believe that the picture of Vijay Biswale will be a thing to talk about in the days to come.
A large group of government officials from the Harda district of Madhya Pradesh is working on a project that touches my heart, it is my favourite.
Sometimes even a few things are very pleasant and that is why I share them with you.
There is a village called Kashla in Rajnandka, Chhattisgarh.
Over the past few months, they have made efforts to build toilets.
Now no one from that village needs to spend natural resources in the open.
Whatever be the case, when it was completed, the entire village celebrated it like a big festival.
The best examples show how values change in social life, how people's outlook is changing and how citizens of the country are taking the country on the path of progress.
Bavesh Day from Guwahati has written to me about the problems faced by the North-Eastern states.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country, a Ministry named DONER was created which means the Ministry of Development of North Eastern States.
Well, we cannot decide the interests of the North-Eastern states by sitting in Delhi or not
Therefore, a team of officials from the Government of India visited the North Eastern region of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim.
This effort is going to have good results in the coming days.
This is a wonderful effort, an effort to move from Delhi to far-flung areas, and this is what I call the ACT EAST policy.
My dear countrymen, I am delighted to be successful in the SEVAYA mission.
Just a few days back, India has launched 5 satellites in the UK through its PSLV C28.
This is a great achievement, even if this news is not one of the most attractive things.
Sometimes when we ask the younger generation of the country, what do you want after you have grown then one hundred of them will answer that I want to become a scientist.
It is a matter of concern that the country is seen less in terms of science.
With this, the Ministry of Human Resource Development of India has launched a National Innovation Mission.
I have been urging the officers of the Government of India to spend one or two hours a week to encourage the students of your neighbouring schools and colleges to share your experiences with them and it will certainly help them.
Whether our villages should get 24 hours of electricity or not
Though this work is difficult, it has to be completed.
Today, we have to go to another village even if we want to charge the mobile.
The benefits available to the cities should be extended to the villages and these facilities should be made available to the poorest of the poor.
Towards this end, we have launched the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti.
Our country is the largest country, there are thousands of villages here and we must ensure that electricity is supplied to the most remote areas.
Your suggestions will be my favour.
Thank you very much
When I said so, I didn't expect you to get such a huge response.
Hundreds of thousands of people had sent photographs through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
I'm also retweeting some of them that attracted my views.
If it is said that some people did not record photographs of the Bay of Bengal caves in Andhra Pradesh, many people in the country would not have known that there were such caves.
This is the photo of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh
We know that Rajasthan is always a water-less state, but it is very surprising that a person from there sends photos of Mann Ki Baat.
That is, in fact, a wonderful thing has happened.
I can assert that Yoga is not going to hide the sun in the world.
Looking at how the world is spreading its red carpet on Yoga, which Indian will not be proud and proud of it
And I, even I, wept in a flood of joy, and the soul fainted.
While the Cheen River and the Eiffel Tower are very proud of the people of France, they also chose these monuments to be the background of Yoga.
The people of New York learnt the Times Square to practice Yoga.
Immediately, Abra House scenes shine in the minds of Australia's Sydney.
The Australians undertook Yoga exercises in front of the Abera House.
Rajpath has become Yoga.
A new upheaval, a new spirit, a new zeal and a new zeal in all over the world was felt.
A few days ago, a Vietnamese child had devised a picture of Yoga by her family, which was very delicate and popular throughout the world.
Women, men, elderly, children, rural people, urbanisation, developed countries and developing countries have joined hands in Yoga training.
Yoga actually became a factor in connecting the world.
I don't know how intellectual creatures will bother and criticize the world.
But I feel that the world is very enthusiastic about India is a matter of pride for every Indian.
An interest in India has increased and the world wants to know about India's values, traditions and culture.
But if we have the honour and pride of our heritage then we can show this to the world.
Sometimes we think of what is innovation in it, for example, our family values, and we don't know that Indias family values are the biggest thing for the world.
I would like to appeal to the youth of the country, particularly the youth in the field of Information Technology - all of you, the youngsters, to join hands in the programme on online yoga.
Do you know that there is a sector called Ayush in the government
Nobody's attention will return to it.
It will be reported 2-4 times in 5 years, a small sector in a corner.
But it presided over Yoga Day.
The smallest sector has been the largest in the world.
This is an example of how small institutions can accomplish immense tasks when the goal is before us.
The world was surprised to see how our people rescued the victims of Yemen.
In a few hours, the world saw that Indians had moved in Nepal and extended their hand to help.
If we start moving ahead with our resolve then the government will work faster, the government workers will work faster, the goods will also be celebrated with their heads up.
This is my own experience.
This is the real power that makes the country progressive.
Last month, we had announced three life insurance schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been involved in some or the other life insurance schemes but we have to take this forward.
I want to present an idea in my mind and I want to put it before you.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is being celebrated in August and we can all start a strong mass movement before the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Come, let us work together with me to fulfil this pledge.
Many people give me advice when I shout Mann Ki Baat.
This time, many people have suggested to me that I should tell you something about the rainy season.
Thiruvananthapuram, Yogesh Thandekar of Nagpur, Harsh Vardhan of Mysore, Praveen Dinakarni and Divyaanshu Gupta have been asking you to talk about the monsoon in your hearts.
They have also given good ideas to their share.
You too must have been enjoying this rainy season with hot pakora, bajji and sweet tea.
Just as the rays of the sun give us life, the rain also gives us strength.
Every drop of rain is valuable.
As a citizen and as a society, we must develop the spirit of preserving every drop of water.
Water in the village should remain in the village as well as water in the city should be used for urban use.
Be it vaccination or water management or be it small ponds or be it lakes, we have to protect every drop of water.
If you want to visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji, if you want to visit his house then you can see that there is a water-served land in his 200-year-old house where rain water can be directly transported.
You must see this.
So much interest has been taken even at that time.
We can do this too
It must be transformed into a mass movement.
Every village should be followed this way.
Similarly, Green is looting our eyes.
How charming is the green life
Tree plantations, gardens and gardens make their lives green, right
We all have to implement the plantation and the movement related to it during this rainy season in a big way through social organisations and youth.
I offer a suggestion from my own experience that this rural technology is a very successful one.
When you are in the middle of the tree, put an old earthen pot near the tree, and fill it with water.
Due to the presence of moisture in the environment, microorganisms are multiplying and health becomes very important.
Cleanliness is very important.
There is a need to drink clean water.
Most people boil water in this season.
It also has good results.
The more we take care, the more we get protection from diseases.
There is a need for water and rain, but it is also important to be safe from the disease.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we have just introduced three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
Under the Amrid Yojana, we have launched a movement to make our cities livelihood-friendly.
By 2022, when India will celebrate 75 years of its independence, every Indian should have a house.
Keeping these three things in mind, we have started a big scheme.
This inspired all fathers to take a selfie photo with their daughters and register on social networks.
In Haryana, the rate of girl child is very low as compared to male children.
There are 100 such alarming districts in the country.
This is the highest in the state of Haryana.
In some way we will transform the programme Beti Bachao Beti Padhao into a mass movement.
Keep in mind, you will realise how happy the movement will bring about the rise of daughters, pride and protection of daughters.
Search the rainy season well
Make our country green
I am saying this in an experienced manner.
Take this forward.
Next time I will meet you for the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes I think that in my Mann Ki Baat programme, some people think that the welfare schemes of the government should be announced.
This is what makes me happy.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine how this intermediate period would have passed.
And it shall come to pass on Sunday, and on the last Sunday of the month, at 11 a.m. and, behold, it shall come to pass, that I shall go up to you, and you shall feel that something is gone away.
But I thought that what was happening at that time - no, it should be a Sunday programme.
But I was eagerly waiting for this Sunday.
Many people have asked me why I travelled to Kedarnath in the midst of the electoral storm.
But if I have started traveling in that direction then it can change the course of Mann Ki Baat.
Therefore, when the polling was still on, I went on with conjectures about the electoral turmoil and the defeat.
Many view it as a political implication.
As far as I am concerned, I consider it an occasion to meet me.
In a way, I'm going to meet myself.
I cannot say when I will do it but I will certainly do it because it is my duty to inform you about your right to know.
Just as people have expressed their willingness to know about Kedar, I have been consistently recognising your efforts to strengthen constructive things.
The inclusions in the letters to Mann Ki Baat are entirely different from the customary governmental affairs.
Sometimes your words are opening up the bed between my thoughts and drives.
When one writes about cleanliness, he expresses his anger against cleanliness and collaborates with the efforts to make cleanliness.
If one discusses the environment, it reflects his pain
But at the same time, he also mentions his efforts and the thoughts he has inspired in his mind.
That is, in a way, a vision of how the solution to the problems can be inclusive of the entire society will shine in his words.
Mann Ki Baat works as a mirror to the country and society.
This shows that there is no dearth of determination, energy and efficiency in the depths of the countrymen.
It is necessary to integrate these strengths and capabilities, create opportunities for them and make a constructive effort.
Mann Ki Baat tells us that 130 crore people of the country want to join the country in a strong and constructive manner.
One writes a letter to the Prime Minister of the country, but you can imagine that he has not submitted any application for himself...
How excellent is the feelings of millions of such people in the country
When I examine all these things, I leave your imagination that how much pleasure I feel and how much enthusiasm it is there in me.
You're driving me, you're driving me fast, you can't imagine that you're keeping me alive every moment...
Without this relationship, I was waiting for salvation.
Today my mind is filled with happiness.
In this spirit, Ponga, with passion, we will move ahead with Mann Ki Baat.
When emergency was created in the country, the struggles against it were not limited to political limitations or political leaders.
It has not been imprisoned even in the midst of prison wire.
Every citizen was furious with anger.
There was a vision for the liquidated democracy.
If we eat food every day without fault then we do not know what hunger is .
Similarly, whenever one comes to know about the right to democracy in normal life and its joy, one breaks down our democratic rights.
During the period of emergency, every citizen of the country knew that something had been stolen.
I can proudly say that India is a sustainable society because of this legacy.
This is why the people of the country felt the absence of democracy, and during the Emergency, we enjoyed this absence.
Therefore, the country dedicated an election, not for itself, but for the protection of democracy.
We have ignored the miracles of any thing that is far away from our pockets and we have underestimated its importance.
More than 61 crore people have voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
This number may seem simple to us, but if we see China out of the outlook of the world then more people have voted in this election than in any country of the world.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha election is more than double the total population of the United States, which is higher than the population of the whole of Europe.
This reflects the vastness and broadness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections is the worlds largest democratic election in history.
Just imagine yourselves how great abundance of goods and men's wealth shall be required to govern such a great election.
This has become possible as a result of the hard work done by millions of teachers, officers and staff overnight.
This time, because of the hard work of all of them, there has been a lot more voting than the last time.
Nearly 1 million polling stations, more than 4 million voting machines, more than 17 lakh weighted appliances across the country to vote...
I leave the grandeur of the arrangements to your imagination.
All this was implemented to ensure that no voter should be denied the right to vote.
In a remote region of Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station was set up for only one female electorate.
You will be surprised to know that it took two days for election officials to reach there.
This is the genuine respect for democracy.
The world's highest polling station is located in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet at Lahoul Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
Besides this, there is another matter of pride in this election.
This may be the first time in history that even women have enthusiastically participated in the voting for men.
In this election, the voting rate for women and men was almost identical.
One more encouraging thing about this is that the number of women members in the House today stands at 78.
My dear countrymen, you might have heard several times that there is no bouquet of bouquets.
I was asking you to give books instead of flowers on occasions such as receptions and glory.
Since then, people have started giving books at many places.
Now someone has given me a book titled Bremchand ji's famous stories and I like it very much.
We have not had time for several days but we have got the opportunity to re-read some of his stories due to his foreign travels.
Bremchand has described the reality of the society in his stories and when he reads, those scenes begin to migrate in your mind as a painting.
Everything he wrote is alive.
My young days were shadowed in my mind...
In the second episode, I touched the depths of my mind and its name is Idkah.
And the compassionate understanding of a young man, and his pure love to his mother, and his compassionate heart at such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes to his grandmother by buying a bread-feeding rod from the festival, the human spirit really touches the height.
Likewise, the name of a jewellery is 'Bhushkee Rath'.
This story depicts a contradiction in the lives of a poor farmer.
Even after his yield wasted, why is a farmer named Haldu happy because he does not need to sleep in his field in the bone melting cold
But even though these stories were written about a century ago, we can feel that these stories are relevant today.
After reading these things, I felt a lot of experience.
When I was talking about the subject of studies, I was reading about the Akshara library in Kerala in some media.
Sometimes they came with books tied in bundles and carrying them on their backs.
Today, this library is showing a new direction not only to the children of the tribal community but also to all.
Gujarat's Vange Gujarat campaign is a successful effort.
In this movement to read books, all age groups participated in hundreds of thousands.
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I urge you to spend some time in the middle of your daily routine to provide a place for books.
In fact, you are very fond of this thing and write about the book you have read and on the NarendraModi app so that the voice lovers of Mann Ki Baat can also know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to know that our countrymen are thinking about things that can emerge as challenges in the future and not stop with the present.
When I was reading these comments on the NarendraModi App and Mygov, I was able to observe what many people wrote about water.
Apart from Pawan Gaurai from Belgaum and Siddamsu Mohan Parita from Bhubaneswar, many others have written about water challenges like Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf.
Water has great significance in our culture.
This is said about the water in the occupation of Rig Veda: Apohishta Myobhuva: Place Yaje Dattatana, Maharanaya Chakshase, Yova: Sivadhamoras: Dasya Bhajayadehana: Ushtiriva Matarah, i. e.
Water is equivalent to mother i.e. motherhood will enhance her blessings and embrace her compassion.
Water scarcity has affected many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water available due to rain can be stored in our country throughout the year.
Just 8 percent.
So the time has come to find a solution to the problem.
I am confident that we will be able to solve this embarrassment with the help of peoples participation, with the help of peoples participation, with the help of 130 crore countrymen, with the help of collaboration and dedication.
Recognizing the importance of water, the Ministry of New Jal Shakti has been set up in the country.
This will facilitate quick decision making on all matters related to water.
A few days ago, I started doing something different.
I drafted a letter to the heads of Panchayats and village leaders of the country.
I had written to them to collect water, to collect water, to maintain every drop of rain water, to collect village councils and to interact with the villagers.
It gave me great pleasure that they were involved in this work and on 22nd of this month millions and millions of people participated in thousands of panchayats.
Every villager made a solemn pledge to save every drop of water and contributed to his companionship.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about a Panchayat leader.
The people there are once again ready to contribute to their positive contribution towards water conservation.
My best wishes to all the Panchayat leaders and all the rural leaders who have worked constructively from my side.
There are several leaders who have taken up the challenge of water conservation throughout the country.
In a way, this is an opportunity for the entire village.
There is a feeling in my heart that the villagers are now competing to raise some water in their village.
As I said, positive results are achieved through social initiatives.
There is no way out of the country to face water crisis.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country and in different ways.
But the goal of all is to save water and to maintain water.
Punjab sewerage canals are being improved.
This effort will get rid of the problem of blockade.
There is a change in the lives of the villagers due to water logging at Thimayyapalli in Telangana.
There has been a major change in Kabirdham in Rajasthan due to the small ponds being constructed in the fields.
When I was studying a social initiative in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, I knew that there were 20000 women mobilizing the revival work of the Naga river.
At the same time, I also read about the women of Garhwal region who have done a great job of collecting rain water in accordance with each other.
When people gather, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I have made three appeals to the people of the country.
My first appeal - just as the countrymen have made cleanliness a mass movement, let us initiate a mass movement to convert water conservation into a peoples movement.
Together we will make a solemn pledge to save every drop of water, it is my belief that you are God's gift and it is a miraculous pillar of Rasamani.
It was said that Rasamani will be iron gold.
But you are also such a rasamani that a new life is being produced due to the stagnation of water.
We have to create a campaign to save every drop of water.
My second request to the countrymen was that there have been several traditional methods of water conservation in our country for centuries.
I urge you all to share these traditional methods with you all.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to Porbandar to the place of birth, then there is a 200-year-old water conservation kitchen in a house behind the mother's house.
Come, let us create a complete list of water conservation and inspire people to engage in water conservation.
All of you, JanShakti4JalShakti, use this to share your thoughts.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you and to the people of the world for one more thing.
The Presidents of many countries of the world, Prime Ministers, eminent people, ordinary citizens, have shown me through Twitter that how Yoga is being taught in every country.
On that day, the world appeared to be a happy family.
We know that Yoga ensures that healthy and understanding persons are required to establish a healthy society.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great service to the social service.
Shouldn't it be honoured to recognise such a service
In 2019, the announcement of the Prime Minister's Awards for outstanding contribution towards the promotion and development of Yoga has given me immense pleasure.
This award is conferred on the outstanding contributors to the spread of Yoga throughout the world.
Japan Yoga Niketan conducts multilateral and training courses there
Likewise, Ms.
He is an example of concentration.
When it comes to Yoga then whether India will stay behind or not
Yoga should be widely celebrated and those who bring the message of Yoga to every household should be honoured.
My dear countrymen, our journey has begun today, new feelings, new experiences, new determination and new openness.
Yes, as always, wait for your suggestions and views.
We all will meet again and again and we will be happy to interact.
I listen to your feelings, I gather and understand.
Perhaps I'm trying to live up to those feelings.
Let your blessings continue.
You are my concepts, you are the ones who give me strength.
Let us come together to enjoy the voices of Mann Ki Baat and fulfill our duties in life on Tuesday.
Once again we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat next month.
Many-many thanks to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, my heart is filled with immense vigour when Mann Ki Baat begins.
10 days ago, Mother India has lost her brave sons.
These brave soldiers have lost their lives to save our 125 crore countrymen.
Our brave sons and sisters had dedicated themselves to sleeping peacefully day and night without me.
After the martyrdom of our brave soldiers in Pulwama's terrorist attack, the hearts of the countrymen have been wounded and are boiling in anger.
There have been condolences from all over regarding the martyrs and their families.
I salute the brave soldiers of the country who sacrificed their lives to save Mother India.
The task of facing this challenge before the nation should be forgotten by all differences of opinion like casteism, religiousism and regionalism so that our endeavours and decisions against terrorism can be firmly and rigid.
Our Armed Forces have always displayed an adventure and might that no one has ever had.
On the one hand, while expressing their excellent ability to maintain peace, they also responded in the same language as they could understand the attackers.
You can see how the operations were carried out within 100 hours of the attack.
The military is determined to throw Kelly with the roots of the extremists and their subsidiaries.
After the valour of the brave soldiers, the words and ideas expressed by their relatives through the media have been widespread and have strengthened the mindset throughout the country.
Meena, wife of Prasanna Sahu, a martyr from Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, commemorates her unlimited courage throughout the country.
He has vowed to include one of his sons in the Central Border Security Force.
When Vijay Shorena's glory reached Kumla in Jharkhand, his son-in-law said I would join the army.
It is the greed of this pinch that has grown in the body of every child in India, in the body of every child, in the life of every person.
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya, the parents of Thilakraj, the martyr of Kangra or the six-year-old Balakanad of Hemraj, a martyr of Kota, the story of every family of the martyrs is a source of inspiration and inspiration.
I urge the younger generation to know, understand and understand the spirit and goals that these families have expressed.
In order to know about patriotism, sacrifice and penance, we do not have to reverse the past papers of history.
My dear countrymen...
The moment we all had waited for a war memorial for so long after we got independence, the time of the wait is going to come.
It is natural for the countrymen to have inspiration and enthusiasm in this regard.
Shri Onkar Shetty, a dresser from Karnataka, expressed his happiness at the establishment of the National War Memorial at the NarendraModiApp.
It is a matter of surprise and anguish that no National War Memorial has ever been established in our country so far.
I wanted it to be a memorial decorated with the tales of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation.
I am sure that such a monument must have been established in the country.
The second wheel, the cycle of valour, reveals the courage and courage of the soldiers.
The walls of the exhibition would have engraved the brave adventures of the soldiers.
Subsequently, the Martyrdom
This chakra reflects the sacrifices of the soldiers.
The names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the nation were engraved on the golden pages.
Subsequently, the Raksha Chakra symbolizes security.
There is a queue of dense trees in this chakra.
It is impossible to contribute in words and contributions of our Armed Forces, Police and Para Military Forces to the progress of the country.
I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation in October last year.
This memorial was also an expression of the feeling that we should be grateful to the men and women of our police forces who have always been protected.
I am confident that you will definitely visit the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you visit those places, you must share the photographs that you have taken there on the social portal so that others get inspired to visit these holy places.
My dear countrymen, thousands of letters and comments come to me in different ways for Mann Ki Baat.
This time when I was reading your thoughts, an interesting idea of Adisha Mukhobadhyay ji drawn my attention.
His age was only 25 when the British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3, 1900.
Similarly, it is also a coincidence that the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata Ji is on 3rd March.
He further said that while these two men belong to different family backgrounds, both of them have fulfilled the legacy and history of Jharkhand.
Giving charitable tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat is in a way equivalent to respecting the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great men have illuminated not only the name of Jharkhand but also the name of the whole country.
The entire country is grateful for their contribution.
If an inspirational person is required today for the guidance of our youth then he is Lord Birsa Munda.
And when the British slept with jealousy and jealousy, they seized him.
Do you know why they have taken such a wound
Because even the British who had established such a magnificent empire were afraid of him.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda, with the help of his traditional arrows, swept the British rule using guns and artillery.
Indeed, if we get a leadership that compasses the people, society's confidence is greater than the power of arms.
He brought those who were deceived and those who were persecuted from darkness to the illuminated sun.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda was martyred at the end of his 25 years of life.
Like Birsa Munda, the sons of Mother India have emerged from all parts of the country.
Such great men were filled everywhere so that they could not find any part of India that had not contributed to the freedom struggle that had taken place for centuries.
Unfortunately, their stories of sacrifice, heroism and sacrifice did not reach the new generation.
If people like Bhagwan Birsa Munda have realized our existence then people like Jamshedji Tata have given great institutions to the nation.
True, Jamsetji Tata ji was a visionary prophet, who not only saw India's future but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He was well aware that making India a hallmark of science, technology and industry would be a future requirement.
Because of his vision, the Tata Institute of Science was established and now it is known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Moreover, he established many trusted institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
As a result of this conversation, the Indian Institute of Science was born.
My dear countrymen, the birthday of former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai is 29th February.
You all are aware that this day will come only once in four years.
Accordingly, a peaceful person, Morarji Bai, was one of the leaders of a regulated country.
Morarji Bhai Desai will emulate the record of presenting the largest budget report in the Parliament of India.
Morarji Bai Desai was a powerful leader of India at a very difficult time and at that time the democratic system of the country was in a big threat.
Morarji Bhai Desai dedicated himself to the cause of democracy against emergency.
For this, he had to pay a huge price in his old age.
The then government arrested him and imprisoned him.
But when the Janata Party won in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his reign, the 44th Constitutional Amendment was passed.
If this is important, the 42nd constitutional amendment was brought to promulgate a state of emergency, in addition to slashing the powers of the Supreme Court, some of the other elements in it have broken down our democratic values, so they were withdrawn.
That is, the 44th Constitutional Amendment proposes to empower the functioning of the Parliament and the legislatures to be printed in the newspapers.
The Presidents proclamation of Emergency was made for the first time only on the recommendation of the Cabinet in writing and the period of Emergency cannot be increased by more than six months in a manner.
Morarji Bai ensured that the Democracy was assassinated in 1975, proclaiming the state of emergency, could not be restored to the stage.
His contribution to the preservation of the glory of Indian democracy is immense, and the future generations will remember it.
Once again I see my tributes to such a great lord.
They have made a positive change in the lives of others in different ways with the help of their hard work.
And as they are, they are genuinely carnivorous, who are doing the service of the people, the service of the society, and above all, the service of the country in a selfless manner.
When Padma Awards are announced, you might have seen the people asking who he has won the award.
In a way, I consider this as a big success because they cannot be found in the television and press cards, they are away from a humble world.
But those who don't care about their name, they believe in working on the ground.
Their lives are by the singing of a song called Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam.
I would like to share with you about such people.
You might be aware of Odisha's Taitari Nayak but there was no reason to call him the canal man of Odisha, and Tathari Nayak ji had cut the mountain by his hands in his village and made a canal path up to three kilometres.
I presented the commemorative presentation of the Tree of Life created by Abdul Kafur to former US President Barack Obama.
Of the Padma awardees, Shaper Saiyat from Maratwada is known as Pasutha's servant.
It is incredible and wonderful how he dedicated his whole life to the service of the cow.
Small Bull from Madurai, for the first time, attempted to contribute to the empowerment of the victims and the oppressed, through the Kalanjiyam movement in Tamil Nadu, and initiated socially micro-constitutions.
Even after hundred years, he teaches people around the world Yoga, so far he has made 1500 people Yoga practitioners.
Jamuna Tudu, a famous woman named Lady Tarzan of Jharkhand, has done an adventurous job to oppose tree pirates and naxalites, preventing the destruction of 50 hectares of wildlife and inspired tens of thousands of women to protect trees and wildlife.
Because of this untiring work of Jamuna Ji, today every villager has 18 trees while every child is born and 10 trees are being planted during the marriage of every woman.
The story of Rajkumari Devi, a farmer from Musafarpur, Bihar, is very conscious.
Nowadays, wherever I go to the country, I am trying to meet some of the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana - Ayushman Bharat.
Brothers and sisters, about 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme in the last five months.
I can clearly see how big a change has been brought about in the lives of the poor.
This scheme belongs to all such poor people.
My dear countrymen who are present here in my heart, the exams are going to start in schools.
Various educational boards across the country will start the selection of boards for class 10 and 12 in the next few weeks.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are going to appear for the examination.
A few days ago, a major programme of Pariksha Pe Charcha i. e.
One of the salient features of the interaction on exams is that discussions are taking place without interruption on various issues related to exams.
Because we have a tradition of thousands of years old culture.
A few days later, the holy day of Mahashivaratri is coming. This time, when Sivaratri comes on Monday, a special significance spreads thrilling smell in our hearts.
Just a few days ago I had gone to Kashi where I got the opportunity to spend some time with the disabled brothers and sisters.
We could talk to them about many things, their self-confidence was really impressive and inspiring.
While talking, a young person with visually impaired person said that he was a platformperson and when he introduced himself as a mixer on joke programmes, I asked who you would speak.
He said I would mix with him like the Prime Minister.
I was just waiting for a comfortable surprise when I could do something right, just like I used to speak in Mann Ki Baat, he showed Mann Ki Baat through Mimikri.
I was glad to know that people not only listen to Mann Ki Baat but also remember it on several occasions.
In fact, I was very surprised to see the power of the youth with disabilities and they had a big impact on me.
My dear countrymen, connecting with you all through Mann Ki Baat has given me a unique experience.
In a way, I have been interacting with crores of families every month through Radio.
Whenever I talk to you again and again, while reading your letters and listening to your phone calls, I feel that you consider me as a member of your family.
This feeling blossoms into a comfortable experience in my heart.
Friends, elections are the biggest celebrations of democracy.
For the next two months, we'll all be drowning in the electoral fray.
I am also standing as a candidate in this election.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be held on Sunday, the last Sunday of May to honour the healthy democratic tradition.
That is, on March-April, all my feelings of these three months, after the elections, with the strength of a new confidence and blessings, once again I will start my conversation through Mann Ki Baat and I will travel together for years with the voice of your mind.
Once again I express my gratitude.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Sivakumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Sivakumar Swami will be following this philosophy.
In his 111-year career, he served for the social, education and economic development of thousands of people.
If his punditism was so widespread, he was well aware of English, Samskrit and Kannada languages.
He's a social reformer.
He spent his entire life in feeding people, sheltering, teaching and spiritual enlightenment.
The main objective of Swami ji's life was to provide all kinds of benefits to the farmers.
Siddhaganga Monastery is organising cow and agricultural fairs in a smooth manner.
I have often enjoyed the blessings of Swamiji.
During the Centenary Celebrations of Shri Sri Sri Sivakumar Swamiji in 2007, our former President Dr.
During this occasion, Kalam siya showed a poem written for the venerable Swamiji.
This poem by Dr. Kalam Iyeah explains the life of Shri Sri Sri Sivakumar Swamiji and the aim of Siddhaganga Math in a beautiful way.
There is a very important institution in our country
This is an integral part of our democracy and it is more ancient than our democracy. I talk about the Election Commission of India.
This is the foundation day of the Election Commission on 25th January, which we celebrate as National Voters Day.
Looking at the level of elections held in India, the world is surprisingly turning its back on the nose
Polling stations are also being set up in Himachal Pradesh at an altitude of 15,000 feet and also in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
You might have heard about Gujarat
In the jungle of Kir, a polling station has been set up for only one voter in the far-flung area.
Imagine, friends...
In order to ensure that the voter gets the opportunity to use the voter's ballot, the entire team of ECI staff goes to far-flung areas and conducts the voting system. This is the beauty of our democracy.
I heartily appreciate the Election Commission which has been continuously working towards strengthening the democratic system.
I compliment the Election Commissions of all the States, all the Security Forces and other officers who are free and discriminatory in the electoral process.
Lok Sabha elections are going to be held in our country this year
This is the first time that youngsters born in the 21st century are going to vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
And they shall have the opportunity to bear the responsibility of the land in their shoulders.
Now they will become partners in the process of taking decisions in the interest of the nation.
The time has come to connect their dreams with the dreams of the nation.
I would like to urge my young friends to register your name in the electoral rolls if you are eligible to vote.
If we cannot vote for some reason only in life then we should feel that it is sad for us.
If we say something wrong has happened in the country then we should feel sad within us.
This activity has to be transformed in our nature.
I urge all of us to join hands in registering a voter and vote on the day of polls this time that we should run a movement and create awareness.
I am sure that younger generation voters will register their names in large numbers and their contributions will be beneficial for our democracy and will further strengthen it.
My dear countrymen, there have been great personalities on this great land of India, such great personalities have done some marvellous and unforgettable work for humanity.
On 23rd January, he celebrated his birthday in a new way.
On Netaji's birthday, I had a great opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated exclusively for the brave soldiers who contributed to the freedom struggle of the country.
Inside the Red Fort, several such rooms and memorials have been closed since the time of independence.
The closing Red Fort rooms have been transformed into museums, a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.
The museum, which was built in the memory of India's first war of independence in 1857, has dedicated this entire complex as the Grand Mandir, the Revolutionary Temple.
The aroma of our glorious history resides in every brick in these museums.
It was here that the British Government prosecuted India's brave sons Colonel Brem Siegel, Colonel Kurbaksh Singh Tillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was listening to the memories associated with Netaji in the Revolutionary Temple of Red Fort, one of Netaji's family gifted me a very special hat.
Indeed, there is a need to bring the bravery and patriotism of our heroes to our new generations again and again in different dimensions.
About a month ago, on December 30, I had gone to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose has given me the opportunity to fly the Tricolour in any place 75 years ago.
On this occasion, the announcement regarding the Government of Assam was made 75 years ago.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a capable administrator.
Such a brave soldier has played an important role in the freedom struggle.
With the slogans of 'Delhi Salo', give me a boost, I give you freedom, 'Neta Ji's heart is filled with a lot of fervor and enthusiasm.
There was a demand for public disclosure of secret files about him for years
I am extremely happy that we are doing this work.
I don't really think that Netaji's family had come to my house one day.
Together we talked about several things related to Netaji and we made our sacrifices for Netaji Pose.
Efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road, Sardar Patel Museum and Granth Mantra associated with Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
If you come to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, while today we are discussing about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, I would like to share with you an event related to the life of Netaji in Mann Ki Baat.
I have always considered radio as an important media that connects people.
I have been told that this radio station has been broadcast once a week, which has been broadcast in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjab, Pashto and Urdu.
In this radio station management, M.
R.
Vyas Jis contribution is significant.
The programmes broadcast on the Azad Hind Radio were very fond of the common man and its events gave a lot of strength to our freedom fighters.
A gallery museum has been built in this Revolutionary Temple.
Efforts are being made to describe Indian art and culture in a way that brings more thought.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum, with more than 450 paintings and art works of 3 centuries old.
The museum showcases the outstanding works of great artists like Amruta Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avnindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandal Bose, Jamini Rai and Sailos Mukherjee.
I would particularly urge you all to go there and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji.
You might be wondering what this is about art, but you might be wondering if you go here and talk about the great works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You all must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I want to tell you that Gurudev is also a painter.
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to his majority works.
He said that the person who sees the image should himself understand it, and he should look at the news given through that image in his own perspective.
His paintings have been displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
I am confident that you will definitely visit Grandhi Mandir and see his paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is a land full of sacred people.
Our holy people have given the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Such a holy person is Chand Ravidas.
Ravidas ji was born on 19th February.
In fact, if God is in all human beings, it is not apt to distinguish him from caste, creed and creed.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Prince Ravidas ji, through his message, tried to understand the significance of labour and worker in his entire life.
It would not be exaggerated to say that he had told the world the real objective of the greatness of labour.
Once again I remember the holy Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar ji in MyGov has been urging me to speak in Mann Ki Baat on the Indian Space Sector and the dimensions associated with its future.
Vikram Sarabhai has contributed immensely to Indias space programme.
Our space programme involves the contribution of countless young scientists of the country.
It is heartening to note that the advanced satellites and soundingrockets of our students are reaching out to space.
This was the 24th of January, when our students launched the Kalamsat App.
Even the sounding rockets created by university students in Odisha have earned fame.
In the last four and a half years, the number of space missions that were carried out since the independence of the country from 2014 to 2014 have been carried out.
We have successfully launched 104 satellites in one spacecraft.
We will soon register Indias presence in the moon through Chandrayaan-2.
Our country is making use of space technology in a very special way for the protection of vital resources.
Space technology is providing substantial assistance in all these areas, be it cyclone or rail or road safety.
NAVIC devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which protect them and help in economic development.
We have been using space technology to fulfil the service delivery and accountability of the government.
Under the scheme of Housing for All, about 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been provided with geo-take.
Besides, geo-tagging of nearly three crore properties has also been done under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme.
Our satellites are the symbols of the growing power of the country today.
It is because of its contribution that we have made excellent relations with many countries of the world.
There is an exclusive effort in the name of South Asian satellites, which has given the glory of development to our neighbouring countries.
Today, through its excellent competitive mobility services, India has not only launched the satellites of developing countries but also of developed countries.
Heaven and earth have always been a matter of attraction for children.
Our space programme is creating opportunities and opportunities to think greatly, whatever is impossible so far, to move beyond those borders.
Our children are attracted by children and inspires them to look for new stars and gives them a vision.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that whoever plays, they grow, they blossom, this time the sportspersons in Khelo India have brightened.
In January, about 6000 sportspersons participated in 18 games for Khelo India youth in Pune.
If a sportsperson at the local level performs well, he will be able to perform the best globally.
This time, sportspersons from all the states have shown their talent in Khelo India.
He lives in a car with his family.
Like him, Captain Sonali Helvey of the Maharastra Kathak group of women aged 21 is residing in Sadara.
He lost his father at an early age, his brother and his mother inspired and encouraged Sonali.
In many cases, we see that women do not get much encouragement in sports like kabaddi.
But Sonale chose the harvest beyond all this and did a great job.
Abhinav Shah, a 10-year-old from Asansol, is honoured to have won the gold medal at the youngest in the Khelo India Games.
Akshata Vaswani, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, has won a gold medal in the weightlifting sector.
His father is a farmer from Belgaum.
But did you hear about the competition to light the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets have participated in this wonderful competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is a clean and beautiful toilet.
People used to beautify their toilets and used some paintings to enhance their beauty. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, a lot of photographs related to clean toilets are available in social web sites.
I urge all the Panchayat leaders and the village leaders to take the leadership of such a movement in your Panchayat.
Definitely share the photograph of your clean toilet with MyIzzatGhar on the social network.
Friends, Together with the aim of cleaning the country and to get rid of open defecation, we have made a memorable journey on 2nd October 2014.
Today, due to the collaboration of the people of India, today, on the 2nd of October, 2019, we are fast moving towards achieving freedom from the practice of open defecation so that we can dedicate ourselves to him on the 150th birth anniversary of Anna.
In this memorable journey of a Swachh Bharat, the contribution of Mann Ki Baat is immense and that is why I am happy to share this thing with you that more than 5. 5 lakh villages and 600 districts have been declared Open Defecation Free (ODF) and 98 percent of the rural Indias sanitation coverage has reached and nearly 9 crore households have been provided toilets.
My little friends, the election days are getting closer.
Ansual Sharma MyGov, a resident in Himachal Pradesh, is asking me to talk about examinations and about exam warriors.
And they said, Thank you, O you men of Anshua, for the preaching of this thing.
Yes, the first part of the year is for several families.
Students, from their parents to teachers, are all inclined towards exams.
Moreover, students from many foreign countries are going to participate in the event this time.
In this Pariksha Pe Charcha, I would like to talk to our young friends about all the angles related to examinations, especially in the unconscious examination.
I have been urging people to send inputs and ideas for this thing.
I am happy that a large number of people are sharing their views on MyGov.
Some of these ideas and suggestions will definitely be put forward during the Down Hall programme.
You must take part in this program.
You will also be able to see its direct telecast through social media and NAMO App.
May this visit of 2019 be a successful one.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
That is when we get the benefits of experience and self-confidence that we have to do something new.
What we do is not only transform our lives but also contribute to taking the country and society forward.
This will be an honour for all of us.
In 2018, Ayushman Bharat, the world's largest health insurance scheme, was launched.
Electricity has been provided to every village of the country.
All the world's prestigious organizations have said that India is getting rid of poverty at the pace of achievement.
The countrymen have also increased the coverage of cleanliness due to their observations and have moved up from 95 to 95.
For the first time since independence, the foundation stone was laid for the first time in the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
The Statue of Unity, the tallest statue of the world, was built in our country to pay homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great man who connected the nation with the threshold of unity.
The world has recognised Indias efforts in the field of solar and climate change.
In India, the first International Solar Alliance (ISA) International Solar Alliance was organised.
Because of our social efforts, our country has improved so far in the ease of doing business rankings.
A new strength has been created for the country's self-defence.
On this day, our country has successfully completed the Nuclear Triad, that is, our water, land and heaven have achieved the goal of atomic energy.
The women of the country have made the country proud by trying to roam around the world in a boat named Navika Sagar Parikrama.
Indias first waterways started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the waterways sector.
The Bogibeel Bridge, the longest rail-road bridge in the country, was dedicated to the service of the people and dedicated to the nation, the first and 100th airport of the state of Sikkim.
India won the World Cup for the Under-19 World Cricket Cricket and the Global Cricket for Disabled Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan).
This time, India has won medals at the Asian Games.
India has performed very well in the Para Asian Games.
If I talk about the efforts and social efforts of every Indian then the voice of our mind will be very long and it will be born in 2019.
All this is due to the relentless efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
Jayachandran joined Lord.
People say that he was keen to provide treatment to patients at any time.
Similarly, Sulakitti Narasamma from Karnataka also entered Goddess on 25th December.
Sulakitti was a drug addict and was helpful in delivery to pregnant mothers.
He has provided his services to thousands of mothers in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
At the beginning of this year, he was awarded the Padma Shri award.
When we talk about healthcare, I would like to talk about the social efforts of the doctors in Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some of our party members had told me that some young doctors in the city used to camp and provide free treatment to the poor.
Every month several poor patients are benefiting from this camp.
The enthusiasm of these medical friends, who are serving with selflessness, is truly commendable.
Today, I would like to express my pride here that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful movement due to social efforts.
A few days ago, some people had told me that in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people worked together in the cleanliness drive.
In this Mahayana of Swachhta, people from all walks of life, including municipalities, volunteers, students from schools and colleges, and the people of Jabalpur participated with great enthusiasm.
The success stories about innovative youngsters and entrepreneurs have been explicitly narrated at com.
Well, shall we do a job
Would we share information on such portals
We will spread the positive spirit in a better way.
With this, a large number of people will know about our heroes who are transforming society.
There is a special significance for sports in all communities.
While playing, the minds of those who see it are also filled with energy.
We are experiencing many things like name, identity and respect for sportspersons.
But sometimes behind these things there are things that are even bigger than the world of sports.
I would like to mention about Hannaya Nizar, a girl from Kashmir who has won a gold medal in the Karate competition held in Korea.
Hannaya is a 12-year-old girl from Anantnag in Kashmir.
He was trained by Karate because of his hard work and hard work. He knew this very well and made a record.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I wish him a bright future.
Hannaya has many good wishes and good wishes.
Like him, there was a lot of news in the media about Rajini, another 16-year-old girl, and you must have read.
Rajni has won a gold medal in the junior category for women in the boxing competition.
When Rajini won the medal, he immediately went to a nearby milk shop and drank a cup of milk.
After that, Rajani dressed his medal in a cloth and put it in his bag.
Yeah, why did Rajni drink a cup of milk, all of you think, huh
He did this to pay homage to his father Jasmer Singh, who is selling luxury at a shop in Panipat.
Rajani later said he had sacrificed his father to reach this position and tolerated many difficulties.
He has also won a medal in Serbia.
This year, Vedangi Kulkarni, a 20-year-old girl from Pune, became the first Asian woman to grow the world at a rapid pace.
He travelled 159 days a day at a rate of about 300 km per day.
His unwavering enthusiasm for cycling is truly commendable.
Whether we feel motivated when we hear about such achievements and achievements
The names of all these festivals may be different, but the feeling of celebrating all these festivals is the same, in some way these festivals are associated with harvest and swimming, integrated with the farmers, with the villages and with the crops.
It is time to enter the sun rays and sun rays during the sunrise.
Then gradually it starts increasing day by day and it starts harvesting cold crops.
My best wishes to our brothers and sisters who feed us.
The fragrance of the spirit of unity in diversity - Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat spreads through our festivals.
We can see how close our festivals and festivals have relations with nature.
Many of our festivals have been specially created in the spirit of conservation of rivers and water.
On the day of Sat Punya, rivers and water bodies are sun-charged.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people bathe in the holy rivers.
Share your photographs during these festivals with everyone so that everyone can enjoy the diversity of India and the beauty of its culture.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela is of great dimensions, the more divine it is, the more glorious it is.
People from all over the world come and join the Kumbh Mela.
People in the Kumbh are mixing the ocean with faith and triumph.
At one point, millions and millions of people from the neighbouring countries are connected to one place.
The tradition of Kumbh Mela is immensely saturated by our great cultural tree.
This time, the world famous Kumbh Mela being organized in Prayagraj starting 15th January is awaiting you all.
Saints and saints have started coming to Kumbh.
We can calculate its special significance by incorporating the Kumbh Mela of UNESCO last year on the list of INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF HUMANITY i.e. the abominable cultural heritage of humanity.
A few days ago, ambassadors from several countries visited the preparations for Kumbh.
The flags of many countries were flown simultaneously.
People from over 150 countries are likely to participate in the Kumbh Mela being organized at Prayagraj.
With the divinity of the Kumbh Mela, India's glory will showcase its glory in the world stage.
The Kumbh Mela is a great instrument for self-reliance, and every person who comes here has a different experience, who sees and understands the things of the world with a spiritual eye.
This is particularly an opportunity for youngsters to experience great learning.
I had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I could see that arrangements for Kumbh are being done very critically.
The people of Prayagraj are seen with great enthusiasm for the Kumbh.
There I dedicated the Integrated Command  Control Centre, the Integrated Command and Control Centre to the people.
Cleanliness along with difficulty in the arrangements will also reach the remotest areas.
This time devotees can also have a holy vision of Akshayvad after the holy dip in the Sangam.
This symbol of the faith of the people has been stuck in the fort for thousands of years so that even if the devotees wanted it, they could not see it.
Now the doors of Akshayvad are open for all.
May this spiritual pillar become the glory of Indian philosophy.
May this group of beliefs become the glory of the nation.
May this holy shrine of national unity and may this holy shrine of devotees become the holy shrine of the world tourists.
Babu had an unparalleled connection with South Africa.
In the same South Africa, Mohan became Mahatma.
In South Africa, Gandhiji started his first Satyagraha and voiced a resolution against inequality.
He established Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, from where the voices of peace and justice began to shout.
He was blessed with patience and zeal that he could spend years in prison.
Do you know what Mandela had said about her brother And if the songs were an integral part of our history, he did his first experiment with poetry here.
This is where he clearly expressed his commitment to justice
This is where he foiled the path of his Satyagraha philosophy and struggle.
He set up his own model.
And Mandela has been a source of inspiration for the world and their aims will always inspire us to build a compassionate society.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a conference of Directors General of Police was held at Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where there were discussions with the top police officers of the country.
There were detailed discussions on how efforts should be made to further strengthen the security of the country and the country.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the nation.
He was always involved in building the unity of India.
Sardar Patel believed that he had the power to unite in diversity.
We will be able to pay our homage to Sardar Patel for this spirit through this award.
My dear countrymen, on 13th January, Guru Gobind Singh ji was the holy birth anniversary of Guru Gobind ji.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
Until a large part of his life, his work was in North India, and he joined the throne of Maharastra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and the final moments of life are in Nalanda.
In a way, the whole of India is blessed with his blessings.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji and the Sikh Gurus had the courage to fight for justice.
But whenever efforts were made to suppress the voices of the poor and the weak, injustice was done to them, then Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice for the poor and the weak and fought firmly with his shoulder, that is why he used to say: awa Lakshe Ak Ladaum, idione Son Main Baz Tudaum, abe Gobind Singh Nam Kahagam.
"He will say, "Conflicting with the weak cannot express their power.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji considered it a great service to alleviate the sufferings of humanity.
He was a well-known gentleman of valour, heroism, sacrifice and conduct of rituals.
Besides, Gurumukhi, Brajbasha, Samskritam, Persian, Hindi and Urdu were experts in many languages.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji.
My dear countrymen, there are several programmes that have not been discussed in the country.
FSSAI is such a different effort.
Programmes are being organized across the country to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
A healthy India Yatra is being undertaken through the mission of Eat Right India to make a proper diet.
When India becomes clean and healthy then it is self-reliant.
Nutritional food is the most important necessity for good health.
Knowledge of the importance of food is essential since childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the closing ceremony of 2018. We will rejoin in 2019, we will renew our hearts.
Whether individual life or in the life of the nation or in the life of the society, inspiration is the source of development.
Come, let us inspire new zeal, new zeal, new zeal, new triumph, new summits, new heights, we will succeed, we will also change, we will make changes in the country.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On the 3rd of October, 2014, on the occasion of Vijayadasami, we all undertook a journey together through Mann Ki Baat.
This time most of the letters and telephone calls from you have come up with this 50th episode.
In MyGov, Anshu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Delhi, Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jain from Narendra Modi App, Brasenjit Sarkar from Bardhavan in West Bengal and Sangeeta Sastri from Nagpur have raised the same question.
Your zeal is natural.
In today's era, when the radio has been forgotten, why does Modi connect through radio
I want to tell you about an incident.
This happened in 1998.
I was a BJP worker in Himachal Pradesh.
I was going to a place in May.
Take a lamb, which was kept in a vessel of corn from him, and eat the lamb first before it becomes tea.
I was surprised to know why, what happened to someone at home like a wedding
No, brother, don't you know
I don't know what to do.
Look, let's hear the radio first.
He was talking about it on radio.
In this forest, in such an unpopular area, in the midst of snowy mountains, an ordinary man sells his own tea and asks for radio throughout the day.
Therefore, it is not surprising that when I was the Prime Minister, I turned my attention to the powerful media radio.
Mann Ki Baat has been inspired by the urge to take the farmers and young professionals from far-flung villages to cities of the country.
Every month lakhs of letters were read, telephone calls were heard, app and MyGov were criticised
The journey of these 50 regions, which have been connected with all these things in a single corner, has been accomplished in an interesting manner.
Today, Indian Radio and Mann Ki Baat have also been analysed.
Some of the receptions in it are very interesting.
Seventy percent of those who have been analyzed are constantly calling for Mann Ki Baat.
People consider the creative spirit of the society as a great part of Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat has inspired mass movements in a big way.
There is widespread discussion about individualism.
All these underscore the positive sentiments and positive sentiments of our countrymen.
People share their feelings that the spirit of self-confidence has increased due to Mann Ki Baat.
It is a big change in the mindset of the people that they want to join social service.
But people are not only connected with this programme with it.
Besides TV, FM, Mobile, Internet, Facebook, Direct Broadcasting, Pariscoff, people in Mann Ki Baat are ensuring their contribution through the NarendraModi App.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the stalwarts of Mann Ki Baat for believing in Mann Ki Baat and turning it into a part of it.
Your doubts are correct.
At the end of their analysis, it was also a conclusion that the event was unpolitical.
When Mann Ki Baat started, I had decided that Modi should not be seen anywhere in it.
The opposites of lovers in the letters, comments and telephone calls that came in front of every Mann Ki Baat were evident.
Modi will come and go, but this country will remain forever and will not be destroyed by our culture.
There will always be small stories of 130 crore countrymen.
I read the letter and if the same emotion had appeared in another letter, I would like to add that to it.
Besides, I also share my experience with you.
No government can have the power to spread such widespread awareness and spread awareness from a small village in Haryana to the entire country and abroad.
Today's generation understands this thing and the visually impaired awareness is being generated when every department and celebrities of society join in a new interpretation of contemplation change in society.
India's soul is about social justice and social power.
There are thousands of dimensions of social life, one of which is politics.
If politics becomes all, it is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes, how political events and politicians dominate, the various capabilities and efforts of society are suppressed.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
In a way, you have been asked because of your concurrence.
If I have to answer the question you asked directly, then it is that I will not engage in any preparation of the Muslims.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy job for me.
Peoples letters are coming in front of every Mann Ki Baat.
That letter is not merely a paper for me
In fact, I have lived the life of a saint for nearly 40-45 years, I have gone to most parts of the country and have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
The truth is that in Mann Ki Baat, the voice is mine, but the examples, emotions and sentiments are all of my countrymen.
I have not yet been able to mention the names of lakhs of such people in Mann Ki Baat but they are sending their letters and comments without disappointment.
I have full confidence that your thoughts will contribute to making me more interesting and more effective than ever before.
Efforts are being made to relate the letters and comments of the letters which have not been written in Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to express my gratitude to all my friends from All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other television and social media platforms.
In this way, they become Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I express my gratitude to all of them for their capabilities and capabilities.
I appeal to all of you that you must listen to this event in your state languages.
No politicalist will ever be happy with the media, but rarely gets the coverage and that too is negative.
But the media made their own theme of many things raised in Mann Ki Baat.
Cleanliness, road safety, non-vegetarian India and a selfie with daughters have been used by the media in innovative ways to transform it into a movement.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been unfulfilled.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
To tell the truth, I have no secret.
And it becomes easier for anyone to understand, until the consequences of our lives are cut off.
Sometimes we talk about the gap between the elderly and the elderly in the family and those in the aging age.
In fact, talking to most of the adults is rare.
I have always been trying to interact with the youth through exclusive programmes or social networks.
I have always been trying to learn from what they are doing or what they think.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I am trying to give a lot of importance to the efforts of the youth.
But I believe that there is no time for youngsters to waste, it is this thing that helps today's younger generation to innovate more because they want to finish things quickly.
We feel that today's youngsters are very talented and think about big things.
Well, let them realise big dreams and achieve great successes.
Some say that younger generations want to do many things at the same time.
I'm asking, what can this be wrong
Scientists are doing a lot of work at the same time.
If we look around us, it is the social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports and other sectors, it is the youth who are transforming the society.
These youngsters start questioning and are capable of dreaming.
If we sustain the thoughts of the youth on earth, if we provide an independent environment to shape them then we can bring a positive change in the country and they are doing it.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to Vineeta ji to MyGov, in Mann Ki Baat, I urge you to talk about the Constitution Day on November 26th.
And he added that on this day, we have stepped up in the 70th year of our adoption of our Constitution.
Vinda Ji, thanks heartily for your advice.
Yeah, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
This is the day when we think of the great men who gave us the Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
It took two years, 11 months and 17 days for the Constituent Assembly to complete this legitimate task of drafting the Constitution.
Just imagine, within three years, these gentlemen have followed such a broad and deep constitutional legislation.
The rapid pace of enactment of the Constitution of India, even today, is an example of time management and productivity.
We also motivate to fulfil our responsibilities in a time bound manner.
The salient feature of our Constitution is the detailed description of rights and duties.
It is a memorable occasion for youngsters to enhance awareness about the Constitution and link them with the various aspects of the Constitution.
By 2020, as a Republic, we will complete 70 years of our journey and 75 years of our independence will be completed by 2022.
Come, let us take forward the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, development and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, you should not forget the contribution of that great personality who was at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
That gentleman is an admirer.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
The 6th of December is his Mahaparinirvana Diwas i. e.
I pay my homage to Baba Saheb on behalf of all my countrymen, and he has given the right to live with dignity of crores of Indians.
Democracy is blended with the nature of Baba Saheb and Indias democratic values are not imported from outside, he added.
What is democracy and what is a parliamentary system is not a new thing for India.
Once again, my best wishes to Baba Saheb.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, the birth anniversary of Lord Christ was celebrated and next year in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Dev ji always thought about the welfare of humanity.
He always showed the path of poetry, work, service, compassion and brotherhood in society.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate this occasion very well.
Similarly, the 550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
Moreover, a train will also be built on the path of holy places associated with Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Now when I was participating in a meeting related to it, I was reminded of the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Saheb.
The Gurudwara suffered a major impact during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat.
But it is still an example that the state government has restructured it in collaboration with those circles.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat, we will meet again in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat and for the first time I have got the opportunity to express the sentiments behind Mann Ki Baat before you.
The more I join you, the more our journey will be deeper, it will be a pleasure for everyone.
The question of what I got from Mann Ki Baat could arise in some people's minds.
Today, I would like to say that through Mann Ki Baat, one of these things touches my heart and when all the family members sit together and listen to Mann Ki Baat, our family leader sits with us and shares our concerns with us.
Your comforts, my blessings.
Your expectations, my expectations.
Your desires are anointed, my desires are anointed.
Come, let us take this journey further.
Thanks a lot.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
October 31 is the birth anniversary of our great Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This year, the youth of the country are ready to participate in the Ekta Radio event.
Currently, the climate is like this.
Therefore, I urge a large number of people to participate in the race for unity.
Approximately six months before the independence of the country, on January 27, 1947, the world famous international journal "Time" appeared on its front page with a photograph of Sardar Patel.
The newspaper also published a map of India in its headline
But the map doesn't look like it's still there.
India showcased the map as a piece of bit.
It consisted of more than 550 estates.
When they left the country, India was convinced that India should be different pieces.
The Times reported that India faces various threats such as separation, violence, food shortages, price rises and power politics.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had said that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel would be able to unite the country and heal the wounds caused by the people.
The article was also a reflection of the history of biography of India's iron man.
The article included the manner in which he carried out relief operations during the floods in Ahmedabad by 1920 and the Bardoli Satyagraha.
His honesty and commitment were to the extent that he had full confidence in farmers, workers and industrialists.
Sardar Patel took up every issue and resolved the issue of integration of the country, as it was weaving the garb through a single book print.
He ensured that all the ecosystems in the country are connected with a united India.
Whether it is Junagadh, Hyderabad, Thangur or Samasthan in Rajasthan, if we can see the Integrated India that we see now, Sardar Patels magnificence and vision are the main reason.
Built on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, this statue is double the height of the statue of the free goddess of America.
This will be the highest statue in the world.
Every Indian will be proud to see the world's tallest statue in India.
Sardar Patel, the real son of our soil, will decorate our airspace.
I believe that this statue, which has made Mother India proud, will make every Indian proud.
Because it is natural for every Indian to have a desire to see a statue of unity.
I am confident that this statue will be a place for people across the country.
My dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we all celebrated 'Kalaad Badi'.
I salute everybody who is a part of India's security forces.
I also salute the families of our soldiers.
You must be aware of the fact that today we are celebrating Balladesh Day.
Indian forces today took a foothold in Kashmir and saved the valley from being caught by the occupation.
This incident is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I read an old interview with our respected army officer Sham Manekshaw.
Field Marshal Sham Manekshaw recalled his tenure as Karnal.
That was the time when military operations began in Kashmir.
Field Marshal Manekshaw noted how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had reprimanded him for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir.
After this, if our forces flew to Kashmir then we know how our army worked successfully.
The commemoration of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is on 31st October.
Let us pay our respects to Indira Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, who are those who do not want to play
If the youth of our country have these qualifications then our country will not only grow in the field of economic and scientific technology but will also look for pride in the field of sports.
I am delighted to have two recent meetings.
I congratulated them and their determination to break barriers and achieve success will be an inspiration for all of our countrymen.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the 2018 Youth Summer Olympics in Argentina.
You are aware that the performance of our youngsters in the summer Olympics of 2018 has been immensely remarkable.
We got 13 medals in this competition and three medals in the mixed dual segment.
You must remember that the performance of Indian soldiers in the recently held Asian Games was very good.
You must have noticed that I have often mentioned the word 'Magnificent or never before'.
This is a reality that reflects the progress being made in the sports sector of India every day.
India is making new achievements not only in sports but also in numerous sectors.
For example, I would like to indicate to you the disabled sportsperson, Narayan Thakur, who won the Gold in 2018 Asian Games for Persons with Disabilities.
He is a reproductive person.
He lost his father when he was only eight.
He then lived in the house for eight years.
He then left the house and lived in Delhi Transport Corporation buses and worked in roadside restaurants.
It is Narayan who has won medals on behalf of India in international competitions.
Besides, it should also be noted that how fast the Indian sports sector is getting special place.
Moreover, India has not yet won a medal in Junior or Senior category in Judo.
But in the Youth Olympics, India's Tapabi Devi won a silver medal and made a historic achievement.
Tapabi Devi, 16, belongs to a village in Manipur.
His father is an ordinary worker and mother is doing a fishing business.
It's a time when there's no money to buy food.
In such a situation of poverty, his passion and dedication have not diminished.
He has made a history by winning medals for the nation.
The entire world appreciated the success of this competition.
The World Cup for FIFA under the age of 17 has achieved a record number of eyewitnesses in the field.
More than 12 lakh sports enthusiasts have seen football competitions in different sports hubs across the country and have given a big boost to the youngsters.
This year, we have got the opportunity to host the 2018 World Cup men's hockey competition in Bhubaneswar.
The World Cup hockey competition is being held from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian will certainly be interested in the hockey competition if he plays any game or is interested in any game.
In the hockey game, India has achieved a record of golden writings.
India has won gold medals in various events and has won the World Championships once.
India has also produced many of the best hockey players.
Whenever he quotes a hockey game, he cannot finish it without mentioning our accomplishments.
Major Diyanchand, who is regarded as the father of Hockey, is known all over the world.
Further, the Indian hockey hockey has a long tradition from Uttam Singh to Dhanraj Puli, Leslie Claudius Mohammad Shahid.
Even now, the Indian Army is an inspiration for the younger generation by looking at their hard work and goals.
This is a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts who want to see the best competitions.
Go to Bhubaneswar and encourage the Indian team and every soldier who is playing there.
Odisha is not only a historical background but also a cultural heritage.
The people of that state are very fond of it.
This is a unique opportunity for sportspersons to visit Odisha.
One can enjoy sports competitions along with world famous archaeological places like Konark Sun Temple, Puri Jagannath Temple and Silka Lake.
I convey my best wishes to the participating Indian mens team and assure them that they have the support of 125 crore Indians.
I convey my best wishes to all the teams participating in this competition from various countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, the morale of those who have come forward to serve the society is indeed a source of inspiration and enthusiasm for all the people of the country.
But in the present era, the new generations are bright and enthusiastic with innovative methods that can fulfil their dreams.
I participated in the opening ceremony of a new portal called Me for Community which has been launched by my Government and the IT and Electronics Industry of the country to provide opportunities for workers to work in this field and to encourage them to take up social activities.
Their dedication, courage and valour will make every Indian proud.
The change that we are, from individuals to individuals, has created a new ecosystem for working the society.
Some people give lessons to older people.
Some have dedicated themselves to the cause of cleanliness and some have helped the farmers.
However, no one has any intent behind their actions, it is the motivation behind their determination.
But a person who sits in a wheel chair and learns to play basketbacks can help the disabled persons with disabilities to wear a wheel chair and play with disabilities.
This spirit and dedication is a work culture.
It will make every Indian proud.
"No, we" will certainly inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, while looking at your suggestions on today's Mann Ki Baat, the idea of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry was very encouraging.
Tribals and their traditions and rituals are examples of nature, he added through the Mann Ki Baat App.
He said that how tribal traditions can be pursued in our lives and achieved sustainable development and what can be known from such traditions.
I congratulate you all for presenting this issue among the leaders of the Mann Ki Baat programme.
It will inspire us to know our rich past and ancient traditions while the entire world, particularly the West, is discussing environmental protection and exploring new ways of pursuing a balanced lifestyle.
Our country is also facing the same problem.
But if we need to find solutions then we need to recall the golden age of our past and understand our traditional riches, especially the way of life of our tribal people.
Living in close collaboration with nature is an integral part of the lives of our tribal people.
Our tribal brothers and sisters salute the trees, plants and flowers as gods.
BHIL tribals reside in central India, particularly in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, have planted peepal and Arjun trees.
The people of Fischnoi who live in the desert areas of Rajasthan are guiding us to protect the environment.
In particular, they are prepared to give their lives rather than damage a tree, in the matter of protecting trees.
The Mishmi tribal people of Arunachal Pradesh are closely associated with the LTTE.
They regard the LTTE as their brothers and sisters.
The LTTE is also a forest guard in Nagaland.
The Varli people of Maharashtra consider the LTTE as their guests, who believe that the LTTE is with them and reflect their prosperity.
The Kohl community of central India considers the LTTE as a direct link to their lives and feels that if the LTTE does not get food, the entire village will be hungry.
The millions of people of central India also stop fishing in the Kaitan river during the first period of fishing.
They consider the area as a fish sanctuary and believe that nutritious fish will be available in large quantities due to this belief amongst them.
The tribal people are also building their habitats with strong and environment friendly natural commodities.
Dhodars reside in some individual areas of the Nilgiri mountain range in southern India, only by means of things available in the region.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a testimony to the fact that the tribal people believe in living in a very peaceful and harmonious manner and that if someone attempts to harm or harm their natural resources, they will not hesitate to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that many of our freedom fighters were among the front runners of the tribal community.
No one can forget Lord Birsa Munda, who fought hard against British imperialism in order to defend his forests.
In addition to what I have mentioned so far, the tribal communities who have taught us how to co-exist with nature can list a lot and we are very grateful to our tribal people for keeping the forests in the country intact and constantly being forested.
Everyone should come forward to express their gratitude.
My dear countrymen, we have spoken about individuals and organisations who have played an important role in society in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
However, all these things are not enough but they have inspired a deep sense of thought to show a new way to work for the society.
A few days ago, I had read about the farmer brothers of Panchayat Kurbachan Singh.
The marriage of the son of the hard working farmer brother Kurbachan Singh is going to take place.
Kurbachan Singh has specifically told the bridegroom's parents that the wedding should be done in a very simple manner.
He said there is no need to spend a lot of money on wedding reception or any other matter.
He said that this should be considered as a very simple one, and he suddenly imposed a condition.
He said that the condition is that a female household will not burn straw and agricultural waste in their fields.
You should think well about the social strength of this idea.
But it shows how high his quality is, how many families in our society can solve their personal problems in a way that benefits the entire society.
The family members of Thiruvananthapuram Kurbachan Singh have shown us such an example.
I also read about Kalarmajra village near Naba in Punjab.
Instead of burning the steel, the village of Kalarmajra has come to light by farmers following new techniques of soil mixing them with soil.
My congratulations to Gurbachan Singh
My congratulations to the people of Kalarmajra village and to all those who have not been polluted in their surroundings.
You all have been the real way forward in the Indian tradition of a healthy lifestyle.
As the ocean is formed by the consolidation of small drops of water, every constructive activity is necessary to create a good environment.
My dear countrymen, this is what our ancient scriptures say: God, there must be peace around us in all three worlds - water, air, land, fire, respiratory, pharmaceuticals, plantations, gardens and deep-rooted works.
Every soul within me and within you, every heart and every magnificence must be at peace.
Om Shanti . Shanti .
Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be engraved by golden writings.
As far as India is concerned, November 11 this year is important because the First World War was concluded on November 11, a hundred years ago.
It makes us realize that hundred years after the end of that war, the catastrophe and humanitarian casualties are over a century.
For India, the First World War is very important.
In fact, we have no direct connection with the war.
However, our soldiers fought bravely in that war and made the highest sacrifices.
Indian soldiers have also pointed out that Indians are not helpless when they come to war.
Our soldiers have shown their courage and courage in difficult areas and in bad weather.
The only aim was to create peace.
This world knows that there was a great number of deaths and goods in the first world war.
It is reported that nearly one crore soldiers and equally innocent people have died.
This is the significance of peace in the entire world.
The meaning of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
Today, peace is not only a war but also a need for global cooperation and coordination to address the menace of terrorism, climate change, social change and economic development.
The development of the poorest of the poor will be a real example of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-Eastern states have a special place.
There is no link between the natural beauty of the North-Eastern states - the people of this region are very talented.
Now the North-East is renowned for their excellent performance.
The North-Eastern region has made great strides in organic farming.
In order to promote sustainable food, the State of Sikkim has won the Golden Prize for the 2018 precious future policy a few days ago.
Not only this, Sikkim has won the award by postponing the recommendations received from 25 countries.
I heartily congratulate the people of Sikkim for this thing.
I believe that such festivals will be an opportunity to adopt new promises.
Your progress is very important for the progress of the country.
If you develop then this country will also grow.
My best wishes to all of you.
