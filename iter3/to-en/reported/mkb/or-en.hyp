However, as a friend of yours, I would like to give some suggestions on how you will harvest the summer.
I believe that any of you will use it and write to me.
I tell you three things to use the heat wave, if you do three things then it will be a good thing or not, if you do it then you will definitely use one another.
New places, new cities, new cities, new cities, new villages and new areas.
Go to another place and spend three-four days there too.
This will give you a lot of opportunity to learn.
I would also like to hope that whenever you go there, share some photographs with me.
Have you seen a new one
Thousands of years ago, he had made a movement to enter their temples and made them enter the temple.
We are really fortunate that in every age we have born great men amongst us to wipe out the evils of our society.
In other words, he said, "Shram is Shiva," and I repeatedly call "Shramev Jayate".
My best wishes. Thank you.
In every corner of the country, most of the families are engaged in exams for their children.
The most funny thing about Gurudev Rabindranath was that he was not only the first person in Asian continent to win the Nobel Prize in 1913, the British conferred on him the Night Prize and when the British conquered in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath was one of those personalities and great men who laid his voice against the British government and had a deep impact on a young child of 12 years.
A small child playing in a rocky drill, the scene of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre inspired a new inspiration and in 1919, the 12-year-old boy, Vigat, was a source of our inspiration - Shahid Bhagat Singh.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, the British Government had imprisoned his friend Sukhdev and Rajguru with the British Government on March 23. And everyone knows that on the 23rd of March such an event - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had the pleasure of serving Bharatmata (Mother India) on that day - there was no fear of death.
He dedicated all the dreams of life to the service of Mother India.
And these three brave martyrs are a source of inspiration today.
We cannot narrate the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
It can be a good beginning for India.
India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to express my gratitude to you.
We can do this in our daily lives.
Look, brothers and sisters, there is a lot of disorder in the minds of a student of class 11.
There is a lot of anger in his mind when he sees filth and filth.
I remember this auspicious moment.
I want this thing that there should be anger towards cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore countrymen.
Once there was anger and dissatisfaction, we started doing something against cleanliness.
It is a good fact that the passengers are expressing their anger, giving me suggestions and also saying that they have failed in many attempts.
I know some youngsters who have started this kind of drive.
The biggest problem is that we are not aware of such incidents around us, even if we are hesitant to talk openly about it.
He who feels depression doesn't say anything on his own because he feels ashamed.
If he doesn't want to stay alone without being with you, then you don't want to be like that.
This is the best way.
This will be the third year.
Millions of Community Yoga festivals should be celebrated.
If you want to give some suggestions on the 3rd International Day of Yoga, you must tell me through my mobile app, my guide.
Definitely do as much poetry or poetry can be written about Yoga as people can easily understand it.
I would also like to tell the mothers and sisters one thing because today there is talk of health and a lot of discussion about health.
Just a few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
The number of working women in our country is increasing day by day, the partnership is increasing.
But they have some special responsibilities.
Previously working women were given maternity leave of 12 weeks during their pregnancy and now it has been extended to 26 weeks.
There are probably two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this direction.
India has taken a very important decision for these sisters.
On the Narendraodi app, through Twitter, in the letter...
Be it fighting poverty, fighting illness, establishing relations with the world, spreading knowledge or information, technology or science has created a special place for itself.
It is also heartening to note that this is the 38th successive inspiration of PSLV.
This is an important achievement in the defence sector and you will be happy to know that only 4 or 5 countries in the world have this capability.
Both the people have worked tirelessly for this thing and they have developed such houses that will save their homes in such a difficult situation.
In our country, there has been a lot of support in the 'Lucky Grahak Yojana' and the 'DG Dhan Business Yojana'.
More than four thousand businessmen have been awarded 50 thousand rupees.
They are understanding and encouraging with great enthusiasm.
A young friend of Maharashtra, a Post Graduate student, is also experimenting with Rupay Card, e-allet etc. in his family and I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
And a prize of Rs. 1 lakh is important for him, but he has taken up this work as a campaign and is also motivating others for this work.
I urge the countrymen, especially the youth of the country, and those who have received awards under this Locky Grahak Yojana, the Digi-Dhan Business Scheme, to take the leadership of this movement, be it its ambassador or Ambassador.
In a way, you are an individual of piety.
This is not just production of pulses, it is the biggest service of the poor of my country.
We know that when a citizen of our country does something good then the entire nation feels a new energy, the confidence of the country increases.
We have welcomed the disabled persons of our country at the Rio Paradise.
India has emerged as the world champion for the second time in a very short span of Pakistan at the Under-20 World Cup Cricket Finale this month.
Once again I congratulate all the team players.
The country is proud of these achievements of our Divyang friends.
I am extremely grateful for your participation.
Therefore, when I talk to you today, my vision is drawn towards both the people.
Today, when we talk about festivals, India is preparing for another big festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but all over the world.
After observing his entire life, we can see that in South Africa, he served the people of those communities who used to be colourful, and at that time it was not an ordinary thing.
They served those farmers who were being discriminated against in Champaran.
He taught the service not in language but in his life.
I believe that there may have been 130 crore concepts in the minds of 130 crore Indians, 130 crore programmes.
This is the Nand Lal Bose whose artwork enhances the dignity of our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
Once again, congratulations to Gandhiji on his 150th birth anniversary, I hope to make some solemn pledges from every Indian.
Something should be done for the country, for the society, for anyone else.
This will be the best, true and authentic mission for Bapu.
Friends, you must be reminded that for the last few years, we have been running the Swachhata Hi Seva movement across the country for nearly two weeks before 2nd October.
When we celebrate Bapus 150th birth anniversary on 2nd October this year, we will not only dedicate ourselves to Open Defecation Free India but also lay the foundation of a new mass movement against plastic across the country.
Old Pazankheshu Ratnasangha.
It means water, food and sunlight are the three gems in the world.
But fools call stones a chariot.
The glory of food is immense in our culture.
Even we have transformed the knowledge of food into science.
It is important especially for women and children because they are the foundation of our future in the society.
Under the Poshan Abhiyan, modern scientific methods of nutrition are being made a mass movement across the country.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and wonderful systems.
Once upon a time, one thing was brought to me.
This was a very good initiative which could be done in all the regions.
Friends, There are so many small things that our country can effectively fight malnutrition.
Today, the poor families and the rich families are also affected due to lack of awareness.
The month of September is being celebrated as a nutrition drive across the country.
There was a time-tested translation and a small cordless instrument was started in the ears of Bear Grylls.
After this programme, a lot of people are seen talking about the Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also travel to places associated with nature and wildlife.
I have already told you that you must visit Northeast India once in your life.
On 15th August, I had requested you from the ramparts of the Red Fort to visit at least 15 places in the next three years.
Last month, I got the opportunity to release the number reports shortly.
The number of tigers in India is 2967.
But this is a New India. Here we have fulfilled the goal.
I was reminded of the Gir forests of Gujarat when I was publishing the news related to the tiger.
I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat at that time when the lion's residence in the jungles of Gir started getting familiar.
But now we have to go beyond conservation and think about sensitivity.
We have to keep ourselves healthy and keep the country healthy.
I know that all these campaigns will also sweep into social media.
Let us move forward with a new zeal, a new resolve and a new energy.
I will wait for you and your views.
Let us all strive to build the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters, to fulfil the dreams of Gandhiji - Swatantra Sukhayah.
May the joy of ourselves be served and move forward.
Thank you very much.
When I had announced this thing, several teachers, parents and students sent me messages, suggested, raised problems and discussed the problems.
The strength of the society is felt during the festival itself.
Sometimes we don't see the exams with the right perspective.
Like, this is the question of life and death.
The test that you are going to give is a test of your reading year after year.
This is not a test of your life.
You will see his experiences, his wisdom and his achievements.
Therefore, when we are burdened with this number, stop us from moving properly.
Because there is a general perception that if a student turns to sports then his attention diminishes due to his studies.
I didn't know whether it would be right or not, but I realized that in such a scenario, Dep Breathing is very much beneficial.
No, take as much sleep as you need, so that your reading time cannot be wasted.
This will help in increasing reading power.
Your concentration will increase.
You will feel better.
Your skills will grow in a holistic manner.
Whenever I hold elections, I feel tired.
A folk singer came to meet me.
Yes, young friends, you have prepared for exams and I have kept you in mind.
Therefore, the more I suggest to your parents not to raise the burden, the more it comes to me.
Please make the exam a festival to cross each exam.
The examination will never be examined again.
Please take this mantra forward.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to connect with you.
Happy Battu.
It is said in the story that Jesus stood near a house of treasure.
Today, the people of the country are going to get the benefit of two schemes as a gift on a big day.
In fact, two new schemes are going to start.
An atmosphere of curiosity has emerged around the country, be it villages or cities, be it educators or illiterates, how cash-free transactions can be made and how they can be purchased without cash.
Therefore, the Government of India is going to launch the Promotion Scheme for Consumer and Small Businessmen to create e-payment habits.
In order to encourage customers, the scheme is "Lucky Grahak Yojana" and the scheme to encourage traders is "Digit Dhan Vyapar Yojana".
Every day 15000 people are going to get awards for thousands of rupees.
With these 30 crore people, this award will be a part of the scheme.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased from 200 to 300.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have made considerable progress in start-ups.
This digital event is a golden opportunity.
Our youth should emphasize on this sector with new emotions and ideas, new technologies and new systems but we must be fully involved in the campaign to free the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge people to share their thoughts and suggestions before Mann Ki Baat every month.
Whenever I saw these things, I would say that I am dividing them in three parts.
This law will also work in the coming days.
Whatever is required for the benefit of the country, for the welfare of the people, is our priority.
As per the Investment Report, India is at the third spot in the Possibly Top Economy 2016-18.
The inclusion of students in such a large number of board exams indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education.
I congratulate the students for their enthusiasm and convey my heartfelt congratulations to their parents, their friends, their teachers and the heads of all the villages.
My dear brothers and sisters, I would like to mention that this time I have asked for Mann Ki Baat.
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation, I see a lot of efforts to mislead you.
Their capabilities were identified.
Today, once again they have accepted this challenge and I believe that the resolutions of 125 crore Indians, all the efforts made by them will reinforce this country as a new force.
But the tragedy is so widespread that we don't leave the bad habits of some people.
Some people still feel that the money of this corruption, this black money, the amount of money spent on this account, the E-Benefit Rupee will be brought back to the system once again.
They seek unlawful ways to save their wealth.
Sadly, they also preferred the way to use the poor.
Some people are trying to save the wealth by misleading the poor, depositing the money in their accounts by tempting them or by doing some work by them.
A lot of laws have been enacted for Benami Property so that there is a lot of hurdle in the system.
Whether the government wants any problem for the countrymen or not
Mr. Ashish from Madhya Pradesh praised the declaration of war against corruption and black money through this fifteen and fifteen hundred rupees and told me in a telephone: Aajna Namaskar, my name is Ashish Pare.
I am an ordinary citizen of Tirali village of Tirali Tahsil in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
This is the strength of my country in which there is a sense of service, a spirit of sacrifice and truth.
During the election, I used to talk about Cha and it was spread all over the world.
The people of many countries of the world had also learnt to discuss the issue.
There was no festival, lunch, nothing because there was some financial hurdle due to the closure of the note.
Passengers also accepted it as an honour.
Bharat Maru and Dakasa Parmar of Surat have contributed to the struggle against corruption, black money and this is inspiring.
I bless the newly wedded Bharat and Dakasa and convey my best wishes to you all for converting the wedding into a new occasion by converting it into a great Yajna.
Friends, you are my real soldier.
I am very well aware that all of you are active in this great work.
Once the poor people will bless you by teaching people the use of RuPay card.
He taught the common man that he would be free from all these concerns.
I believe that if all the youth of India are engaged in this work then it will not take long.
Within a month, we can stand as a new modern India in front of the world.
We will take this struggle to make the country free from corruption and black money.
People from far flung areas will realize that Indian life is the reflection of the festival and it is natural.
Deepawali's Deepawali Deepawali is the festival of Deepawali going towards the light of Deepawali.
One thing we all know very well that if we go to any place in India, if we go to the house of the richest of the rich, if we go to the Kutch of the poorest of the poor then we can see the cleanliness drive in every family on the occasion of Diwali.
I mean, the festival of light is going to be an inspiration for the people of the world to move from darkness to light.
When we are celebrating Diwali, someone is standing in the desert, someone is protecting the airport in the Himalayan summit.
Besides, I would like to say that his family also sacrifices many sacrifices along with army officers and soldiers.
In a way, the entire army is getting very good news and I want to give you an appy Diwali.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the Armed Forces are present not only on the border but also in every sphere of life.
The need of the hour is to fulfill the hopes that have been created among the poor of the country.
There is darkness in the villages in the 21st century and this will not happen anymore.
Sardar Saheb has given us an India and the responsibility of all of us is to make it the best India.
It is the root of unity that creates a strong foundation of the best India.
Sardar Saheb was not only a man of struggle but also a creative person.
On this Ekta Diwas, we will be committed to remember Sardar Saheb and unity wherever we may be.
My dear countrymen, in this festival of Diwali, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of light.
My dear countrymen, once again I will dedicate this Diwali to the soldiers of the country.
My dear countrymen, I salute all of you.
A few days ago, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri sector.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
The citizens of Kashmir have understood the anti-national power well and, as soon as they know the truth, they have separated themselves from such people and moved on the path of peace.
However, I would also like to mention that the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country has a huge value.
This time, very few people would be aware of the valour disabled persons in the Paralympics.
Moreover, I was surprised to know that among the Divyangjans who were at the fourth position in the run, who did not receive any medal, they took less than the gold medal winners among the general category competitors.
Congratulations to all those who have done this work, best wishes to all those who have tried to do this.
I urge the countrymen to free our country from this problem for the dignity of mothers and sisters and for the health of small children.
Let us move forward with a pledge.
They worked hard and contributed to the construction of about 9,000 toilets.
The common man of this country inspires me in some way or the other.
What is the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country

He played a key role in bringing gold medals to India in 1928, 1932 and 1936 at the Olympic Games.
We all know the name of cricket beloved Bradman.
Reading these messages of the people became a source of inspiration for me.
One Mrs Ajit Singh has written in the NarendraodiApp: Please tell me about their participation in the education and sports of daughters in Mann Ki Baat this time because they have made the country proud by winning medals in the Rio Olympics.
Thousands of people have displayed this kind of idea.
We cannot deny that we cannot demonstrate by our hopes.
In some cases, it has happened that what our sportspersons did not even reach that level and they got two medals in the medal list.
But it is also true that despite not receiving medals, for the first time in many sports, India's players have performed well.
Something like this happened in Tennessee with the involvement of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
Several sportspersons like Aditya Ashok, Dudu Ukhnal, Atanu Das, who had a good performance.
But, my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
And if we do what we have done, we shall be ashamed again.
I have announced the formation of a committee.
They dedicate their lives to their disciples, and to their little ones.
Teachers' contributions are always felt in our lives.
And there he was always a teacher.
Moreover, he always used to say, The best teachers are those who never die.
You will also have a feeling like me.
Whatever good you have done in your life due to your teachers, the world will be able to change the vision of the teachers and their pride will increase.
It is our responsibility to increase the glory of teachers in the society.
We all hope that the lives of our country, our society, our families, and every individual of us should be disintegrated.
But now we live in a free India.
Therefore, let us move ahead with this mantra of 'Swaraj Our Rights' at the Ganesh Festival.
May the Kingdom be our priority.
Can we not propagate this message through a public Ganesh Utsav
Why should we not use the Ganesh statue of the village poultry instead
The idols made of Plaster of Paris have adverse effects on the environment.
He has shown many more things to him.
I also urge all of you that why dont we illuminate our ancient traditions by using earthen statues
Lord Ganesh destruction.
Therefore, we should not build Ganesh, who will create evils.
We have always learnt something from saints, from sages, from great men.
I also congratulate the friends of the aerospace that they have contributed to the foreign policy of the country.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the responsibility of the Prime Minister but I am a person like you.
You can imagine that an ordinary teacher, a pensioned woman, a poor mother who wants to get rid of smoke and gas connections, this is not a small thing.
50 thousand rupees is not big, it is the feeling of that mother, it is the blessings of millions and millions of mothers and sisters.
Sometimes those who are trying to create peace in Kashmir by placing these little children in front of them will have to be responsible for this girl child.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to keep this country united with diversity that we will strengthen and awaken the theme of unity so that the country can brighten its future.
I believe in the power of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Thank you very much today.
My dear countrymen, a few days back, we were thinking about Marudi but today we are also getting the pleasure of rains and the news of floods is also coming.
Sometimes there is an attack on such diseases that we have to live forever.
But if we beware, if we beware, if we beware, if we beware, if we beware.
Keep an eye on slight hygiene, observe some precautions and keep a safe eye on children.
We must understand that Dengu is the first to attack the prosperous region.

In the song, Lord Krishna has said, I am Ashwattha: Ashwattha sarvaganana among all the trees.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims visit the Ambaji Temple in the month of Bhadrab.
Those who know about the land of Rajasthan can understand how big it is.
This year, Gujarat has undertaken several projects like Amravan Forest, Ekta Van, Shaheed Van as a Van Mahotsav to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but they deserve congratulations.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa.
This was my first visit, where there is a diplomacy in foreign travel, there is a discussion on trade and security.
But what I want to say is that this time I got the opportunity to meet the dignitaries who have sacrificed their youth for equality.
Indians, however, went wherever they went, they were ready to sacrifice their lives for those who came to them.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have transformed the essence of our lives in South Africa.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to the industrialist Burma for giving me this message.
And I am the first Prime Minister of India to be born in a free India.

The letters that are being received for Mann Ki Baat and the inputs that are getting are completely different from that of the government.
People are asking for something but I have not seen anything like this in the last five years.
And, you have given me the opportunity to say this once again.
Therefore, the entire country has given an election not only for its own interest but also for the protection of democracy.
Their hard work has resulted in more votes than the last time.

You will be surprised to know that this library is located in a village in the midst of the dense forests of Idukki.
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I will also urge you to take some time out to place your books in your daily life.
A few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I wrote letters to Sarpanch and Gram Pradhans across the country.

Let us sit together and fulfil the responsibilities of life by enjoying Mann Ki Baat.
On the whole, the National Soldiers Memorial will be identified as a place where people will come here to receive information about the great martyrs of the country, to express their gratitude and research on them.

From the beginning of this year, he was honored with Padma Shri.
He used to run about 300 km of cycles daily for 159 days.

Whether we cannot get inspiration from these achievements
The people of Prayagraj are very excited about the Kumbh.
He had gained patience and inspiration from Bapu who had spent so many years in jail.

That letter is not just a piece of paper for me.
I have spent 40-45 years in a ceaseless manner and travelled to most of the districts of the country and spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
