Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Shatrubudhdhi Vinashaay, Deepajyoti Namostute
I salute the divine flame respectfully.
To make this Diwali memorable, what could be a better way than an attempt to let light spread its radiance, encouraging positivity, with a prayer to quell the feeling of animosity
These days Diwali is celebrated across many countries.
And notably, it is not limited to Indian communities even governments, citizens and social organisations wholeheartedly celebrate Diwali with gaiety and fervour.
In a way, they nurture a microcosm of India at their respective places.
Friends, festival tourism has its own exciting attractions.
Our India, the country of festivals, possesses limitless possibilities in the realm of festival tourism.
It must be our endeavour to ensure that we should welcomingly include people of other states, other countries when we celebrate Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal or Bihu, spreading their true spirit.
Here, every state, every region is replete with distinct festivals, generating a lot of interest in people from other countries.
Hence, the Indian Diaspora has a significant role to play in promoting festival tourism in India .
My dear countrymen, in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided to do something different this Diwali.
I had urged all of you to celebrate Indias Nari-Shakti, the power and achievement of women, thereby felicitating the Lakshmi of India.
And within no time, there followed a slew of innumerable inspirational stories on social media.
Kodipaka Ramesh from Warangal has written on Namo App-My mother is my strength.
In 1990, when my father expired, the responsibility to raise five sons fell on her shoulders.
Today, all five brothers are doing well in their respective professions.
Ramesh ji , respectful greetings to your mother.
Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for her, Major Khushbu Kanwar, daughter of a bus conductor, who has led an all women contingent of Assam Rifles, is the Lakshmi of India.
For Kavita Tiwari, her daughter is the Lakshmi of India, her strength.
She is proud of her daughters excellent painting ability.
She has also secured a good rank in the CLAT exam.
Whereas Megha Jain has mentioned that a 92 year old woman has been offering free drinking water to passengers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Megha Ji is truly inspired by the humility and compassion of this Lakshmi of India.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
Do read them, get inspired and share similar instances.
I respectfully salute all the Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the well known 17th century poetess Sanchi Honnamma has penned a poem in Kannada that embodies the same thought, the same words pertaining to every Lakshmi of India that we referred to.
One feels the foundation of the idea was laid in the 17th century itself.
You will notice the beauty of word, sentiment and thought in this poem in Kannada: (Penninda permegondanu himavantanu.
their prodigious virtuosity cradles our social fabric, ensuring its bright future.
My dear countrymen, the 12th of November, 2019 is the day when the 550th Prakashotsav of Guru Nanak dev ji will be celebrated across the world.
The luminescence of Guru Nanak Dev jis influence can be felt not only in India but around the world.
Many of our Sikh brothers and sisters settled in other countries committedly follow Guru Nanak dev jis ideals.
I can never forget my visits to Gurudwaras in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is much about Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can share with you, but it will require many an episode of Mann ki Baat.
He accorded the highest significance to the spirit of service.
Guru Nank Dev ji firmly believed that any service done selflessly was beyond evaluation.
He stood firm against social ills such as untouchability.
Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji radiated his message to all corners of the world.
He was the widest travelled of those times.
And wherever he went he won hearts through his straightforwardness, humility and simplicity.
Guru Nanak Ji undertook many significant spiritual journeys called Udaasi.
Carrying the message of harmony and equality, he travelled north, south, east and west, meeting people, saints and sages.
It is said that the revered Assamese saint Shankar Dev too was inspired by him.
He also travelled to the holy land of Haridwar.
During his Yatra to Bidar, Karnataka, he devised a solution for water woes the place was grappling with.
Gurunanak Jhira Sahib is a famous place in Bidar dedicated to him, cherishing reminiscences of him.
During one Udaasi, Gurunanak Dev Ji travelled north to Kashmir and neighboring areas.
This forged a strong bond between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji also went to Tibet where people accorded him the status of a Guru.
He is revered in Uzbekistan too, which he had visited.
During one Udaasi, he widely travelled to Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He secured a revered place in the hearts of millions who followed his messages with complete devotion, a practice that continues even in the present times.
Just a few days ago, Ambassadors of approximately eighty-five countries went to Amritsar from Delhi.
There in the Golden Temple itself, they undertook a holy Darshan, commemorating the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
Besides Darshan, all these Ambassadors had the opportunity to know more about Sikh traditions and culture.
Following that, many Ambassadors shared those photos on social media, writing about their glorious experiences.
It's my devout wish to imbibe Guru Nanak Dev Ji's thoughts and ideals into our lives may we be all the more inspired to make it happen.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure all of you remember the significance of the 31st of October.
This day marks the birth anniversary of the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the unifying force in bonding us as a Nation
On the one hand Sardar Patel, possessed the rare quality of uniting people on the other, he was able to strike a balance with people who were not in ideological agreement with him.
Sardar Patel used to observe even the minutest of things in-depth
He was a 'Man of Detail' in the true sense of the term.
Along with that, he was also adept at organising skills.
In 1921, in the Congress Session in Ahmedabad, thousands of delegates from across the country were slated to participate.
Sardar Patel was entrusted with overlooking all the arrangements.
He utilized this opportunity in improving the citys water supply network.
He ensured that not a single person would face a problem on account of water.
Not just that, he was also concerned about the safety and security of the delegates shoes and baggage. To ensure that, what he did will surprise you.
He contacted farmers and urged them to craft khadi bags.
These were made and sold to the delegates.
They carried the bags with their shoes inside, free from any tension of the footwear getting stolen.
On the other hand, it led to a major rise in the sale of khadi.
Our country will always be indebted to Sardar Patel for his steller role in the Constituent Assembly.
He strove to ensure enshrinement of fundamental rights that obliterated any possibility of discrimination on the basis of caste and community.
Friends, all of us know that as Indias first home minister, Sardar Patel undertook the colossal, historic task of integrating Princely states.
Scrutinizing the minutest of events closely was his rare quality.
Actually, when we refer to Sardar Patels endeavour, his role in the unification of just a few notable States is discussed.
He urged the Mudaliar brothers, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar and Arcot Laxman Swamy Mudaliar to immediately undertake a mission with people of Travancore to Lakshadweep and take the lead in unfurling the Tricolour there.
Following his orders, the Tricolour was promptly unfurled there and the nefarious dreams of the neighbour of annexing Lakshadweep were decimated within no time.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliar brothers to personally ensure all assistance for development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly in Indias progress.
It is an attractive tourist destination too.
I hope you get the opportunity to visit the picturesque islands and its pristine beaches.
My dear countrymen, the 31st of October, 2018, is the day when the 'Statue of Unity',in memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
It is the tallest statue in the world.
It is double in height compared to the 'Statue of Liberty' located in the US.
The distinction of having the world's highest statue fills every Indian with pride
the head of every Indian is held high.
You will be happy to note that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists visited the 'Statue of Unity'.
This means that an average of eight and a half thousand people witnessed the grandeur of the 'Statue of Unity' every day.
The reverence and devotion for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in their hearts was reflected in the form of homage paid to him. Besides, at present,it houses many centres of attraction such as Cactus Garden, Butterfly Garden, Jungle Safari, and Childrens Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery, which are all constantly evolving and providing a fillip to the local economy.
Local people are not only getting innovative opportunities of employment but for the convenience of visiting tourists, many villagers are providing facilities like home stays.
And these hosts are being professionally trained in the technique of running a home stay.
The locals have now started the cultivation of Dragon fruit and I am sure that it will soon become a major source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, for our nation and the constituent states, as well as for the tourism industry, this 'Statue of Unity' can be a subject of research.
We are all witness to the fact that how within a year a place developed as a world famous tourism destination.
People arrive there from the country and abroad.
And one after the other, ancillary services like transport, lodging, guides and eco-friendly services are getting inducted by themselves.
A large economy is developing and people are generating facilities as per the requirement of the tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, which Indian will not be imbued with pride for the fact that recently, Time magazine has included the Statue of Unityin its list of 100 important tourist destinations around the world.
Of course I hope, that all of you will devote some of your precious time to visit the Statue of Unity.
But my appeal is, that every Indian who takes out time to travel must visit at least 15 Tourist Destinations of India with family and experience a night stay at whichever place you go to this still remains my appeal.
Friends, as you know that 31st October every year since 2014 has been celebrated as 'National Unity Day'.
This day imparts the message to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
On 31st October, this year too Run for Unity is being organized in consonance with previous years.
It will include people from all walks of life, from every segment of our society.
Run for Unity is a symbol of unison, that the nation being united, is moving in one direction and collectively aims for- One goal
Anyway, at present, people have adopted and found a passion for the marathon.
Run for Unity is also one such unique provision.
We also find ourselves connected with Ek Bharat- Shrestha Bharat
And so, not just our body, but our mind and value system get integrated with ushering unity in India to take India to loftier heights
And so, in whichever city you reside, you can find out about the Run for Unity schedule.
In this portal, information has been provided about the venues where Run for Unity is to be organized across the country.
I hope you will all run on October 31st not only for the unity of India, but also for your physical fitness
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the nation with the thread of unison.
This mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our life and in a country like ours filled with diversities, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unison on all paths, at every bend, and at every pit-stop.
My dear countrymen, our nation has always been very proactive and alert in strengthening unity and communal harmony in the country.
Friends, I remember when the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi in September 2010.
You could jog your memory a bit and reflect about the atmosphere then.
Various kinds of people took to the arena
Various interest groups were playing games to take advantage of that situation in their own way
The kind of language that was spoken in order to generate tension in the atmosphere
There was also an attempt to instill shrillness in the tone of different speakers.
On the one hand, the machinations went on to generate tension for week or two, but, when the decision was taken on Ram Janmabhoomi, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all sects and saints gave restrained and balanced statements.
There were attempts to reduce the tension in the sociopolitical environment.
But I remember that day vividly.
These incidents should always be remembered as they impart us a lot of strength.
It is an example of how the voice of unison can bestow strength upon our country.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the same day... the former Prime Minister of our country Smt Indira ji was assasinated.
It was a traumatic moment for our country. Today, I pay homage to her too.
My dear countrymen, today, if one story that rings from home to home, and rings far and wide,is heard from north to south, east to west and from every corner of India, then that IS the story of cleanliness and sanitation.
Every person, every family, every village wants to narrate their pleasant experiences in relation to the cleanliness mission, because behind this effort of cleanliness is the effort of 125 crore Indians.
The outcome also belongs to 125 crore Indians.
But therein lies a pleasant and interesting experience too.
I heard it and I think, I will share it with you too.
Just imagine the highest battlefield in the world, where the temperature drops from zero to 50-60 degrees minus.
Oxygen in the air is also at a miniscule level.
Living in the midst of such adverse conditions and challenges is not less than any display of valour.
In such a difficult situation, our brave heart soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country, but are also running a Swacch Siachen campaign in that arena.
On behalf of our countrymen, I commend the Indian Army for this amazing commitment.
I also express my gratitude.
It is so cold there that its near impossible for anything to decompose.
In such a situation, the segregation and management of garbage is a very important task in itself.
In this scenario, to remove 130 tons and more of garbage from the glacier and its surrounding areas fragile eco-system is a great service
We all know that Siachen as a glacier is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, running a cleanliness campaign here means ensuring clean water for those who live in low-lying areas and also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok.
My dear countrymen, festivals are occasions that awaken a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially during Diwali, it is customary in every family to buy something new, get something from the market in smaller or larger quantity.
The more we try to buy our local things the 'Gandhi 150' will become a great event in itself.
And I keep insisting that we must buy some handloom products made by our weavers, our khadi artisans.
Even during this Diwali, you must have bought quite a few or a lot of things before Diwali.
But there are many people who think that if they go shopping after Diwali then may be they could get a good bargain.
So there will be many people, who still have their shopping left.
Hence along with the best of wishes on Deepawali, I would urge you to come forward and become a patron of local things and buy local.
And witness for ourselves, how we can play an important role in making Mahatma Gandhi's dream come alive.
But, sometimes fire is caused due to carelessness.
An injury can also occur.
I urge all of you to take utmost care of yourself and also celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Every Indian, irrespective of region, caste, religion, sect or language, is ever eager to express joy and show solidarity with our soldiers.
Yesterday, one hundred and twenty-five crore Indians celebrated the Paraakram Parva, the festival of Valour.
We remembered that surgical strike carried out in 2016, where our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the audacity of a proxy war under the garb of terrorism.
At various places in the country, exhibitions have been organised by our Armed Forces in order to apprise the maximum number of citizens, especially the younger generation, of the might we possess
how capable we are and how our soldiers risk their lives to protect us citizens.
A day such as Paraakaram Prava reminds our youth of the glorious heritage of our Army. It also inspires us to maintain the unity integrity of the country.
I too participated in a programme held at Jodhpur in the land of the valiant, Rajasthan.
It has now been decided that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to whosoever makes an attempt to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our Nation.
we are committed to taking it forward... but NOT at the cost of compromising our self-respect and sovereignty of our Nation.
India has always been resolutely committed to peace.
This too was an act of valour on part of our soldiers on the path to peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest contributors to various United Nations Peace Keeping Forces in terms of sending forces personnel.
For decades, our brave soldiers wearing blue helmets have played a stellar role in ensuring maintenance of World Peace.
My dear countrymen, the sky offers the rarest of hues.
One of the notable features eagerly awaited by spectators during the Republic Day Parade is the Flypast comprising the magnificent display of the might of our Air Force through their breath taking aerobatic manoeuvres.
We celebrate Air Force Day on the 8th of October.
From the core of my heart, I congratulate those Air Warriors and their families who rendered service to the nation.
In 1947, when Pakistani attackers resorted to an unprecedented attack, it was indeed our Air Force which ensured that Indian Soldiers and armaments reached the battlefield promptly.
The Air Force also retaliated befittingly in 1965 too.
Who does not know about the Bangladesh Freedom Struggle of 1971
The Air Force played a very significant role in 1999 by pushing back the intruders and liberating Kargil from their clutches.
The Air Force defeated the enemy at Tiger Hill by carrying out air sorties on their positions round the clock.
Be it the relief and rescue work or disaster management, our country is indebted to our Air Force for the commendable efforts of our Air Warrior.
They have always displayed a unique spirit in times of natural calamities like storms, cyclones, floods and forest fires to extend full assistance to our countrymen.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equality and has opened its doors for our daughters of India.
Now, the Air Force is offering the option of Permanent Commission to Women besides the Short Service Commission, which I had announced on the 15th of August this year from the Red Fort.
Indian can proudly claim that in the armed forces, our Army not only man-power but woman-power too is contributing equally.
Women are already empowered and now getting armed too.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, Officer Abhilash Tomy of our Navy was struggling between life and death.
The whole country was concerned about saving Tomy.
You know, Abhilash Tomy is a very courageous, brave soldier.
He was the first Indian who set on a global voyage in a small boat without any modern technology.
For the last 80 days, he was moving ahead in South Indian Ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race maintaining his speed but suddenly a severe cyclonic storm landed him in trouble. Yet, this brave heart from the Navy kept struggling for many days in mid-ocean.
his grit spirit, his determination to make another similar attempt is an inspiration for our younger generation. I pray for Tomys sound health and I am sure that his courage, bravery and resolve to fight and emerge a winner will inspire our younger generation.
My dear countrymen, every child in our country knows the importance of the 2nd of October for our nation.
The 2nd of October, this year, has a special significance.
For two years from now on, we are going to organise various programmes throughout the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhis philosophy has inspired the whole world.
Everyone including great personalities like Dr. Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela derived strength from Gandhijis ideology to be able to fight a long battle to ensure right of equality and dignity for the people.
In todays Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk about another important work of revered Bapu which maximum countrymen should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started penning down a few thoughts in the shape of a constructive Programme.
Later, in 1945, when the Freedom Struggle gained momentum, he prepared an amended copy of those ideas.
Revered Bapu, put forth his ideas on various subjects like Farmers, villages, securing of labour rights, cleanliness and promoting of education.
This is also known as the Gandhi Charter.
Revered Babu was a peoples person.
Getting connected with people or connecting people with him was Bapus special quality, this was in his nature.
Everyone has experienced this as a most unique part of his personality.
He made everyone feel that he or she was very important and absolutely necessary for the country.
His biggest contribution in the Freedom struggle was that he made it an expansive Jan-Aandolan (Peoples Movement).
During the Freedom Struggle people from all sections and all regions dedicated themselves at Mahatma Gandhis call.
Bapu gave an inspirational mantra to all of us which is known as Gandhijis Talisman.
Will he be able to get some control over his life and destiny through your step
Meaning thereby that will your step help millions of those people in getting Swaraj who have an empty stomach and a dissatisfied soul
Then, you will see that your doubt is waning away and your ego is also getting quelled.
My dear countrymen, one of Gandhijis mantras is very relevant event today.
The swelling middle class of the country, its increasing economic power, increasing purchasing power can we remember revered Bapu for a moment while going out for shopping
Who will be the fortunate one to get a direct or indirect benefit from your purchase
I will feel much happier if my purchase will benefit the poorest of the poor.
Keeping this mantra of Gandhiji in mind while making any purchases during the 150th Anniversary of Gandhiji, we must make it a point to see that our purchase must benefit one of our countrymen and in that too, one who has put in physical labour, who has invested money, who has applied skill must get some benefit.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I firmly believe that a small step of yours can surely bring about a very big benefit in the life of the poorest and the most underprivileged person.
But this did happen and India got freedom.
In the same way today we may feel that even by making a tiny contribution I may be contributing in a big way to help in the economic upliftment and economic empowerment of my country and help fight a battle against poverty by lending strength to the poor.
I feel that this is true patriotism, and a perfect tribute to revered Bapus work.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothes have been woven after putting in a hard labour, every thread of these clothes must be utilized.
This spirit of attachment towards the country and fellow countrymen was deeply imbibed in that great person of a very short physical stature.
Two days later, we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji along with respected Bapus birth anniversary.
The very name of Shastriji evokes a feeling of eternal faith in the hearts of us, Indians.
His mild persona always fills every Indian with a sense of pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastriji had a unique quality in that, he was very humble outwardly but he was rock solid from inside.
His slogan Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is the hall mark of his grand personality.
It was the result of his selfless service to the nation that in a brief tenure of about one and a half years he gave to our jawans and farmers the mantra to reach the pinnacle of success.
My dear countrymen, while remembering revered Bapu today, it is quite natural not to skip talking of cleanliness.
A movement Swachhta Hi Sewa was launched on the 15th of September.
Crores of people got connected with this movement and luckily I also got a chance to participate in the voluntary cleanliness shramdaan with the children of Delhis Ambedkar School.
I went to the school, the foundation of which had been laid by none other than respected Baba Saheb himself.
On the 15th of September, people from all sections across the country connected themselves to this voluntary cleaning movement.
Institutions also extended their contribution enthusiastically.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, youth organisations, media groups, the corporate world, all of them offered voluntary cleanliness service on a large scale.
I heartily congratulate all these cleanliness-loving countrymen for their efforts.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission or Clean India Mission has become a success story not only in our country but in the whole world and everyone is talking about this movement.
This time India is hosting the biggest Sanitation Convention of the world so far, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Sanitation Ministers from countries across the world and experts on the subject of sanitation will converge and share their experiments and experiences.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will conclude on 2nd October, 2018 with the commencement of Bapus 150th Birth Anniversary celebrations.
a L kr (Nyayamoolam Swarajyam Syat) meaning justice lies at the root of swaraj and while discussing the subject of justice, the spirit of human rights is inherent in that.
This is specially essential for the freedom and peace of the exploited, victimised and deprived people and to ensure justice for them.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar, many provisions were inserted to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the 'National Human Rights Commission' (NHRC) was formed on 12th October 1993.
A few days later NHRC would complete 25 years of its existence.
The NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also promoted respect for human dignity over the years.
Our most beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of our country, had clearly said that human rights are not analien concept for us.
In the emblem of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal mantra harking back to Vedic period- "Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah" is inscribed.
NHRC has instilled widespread awareness of human rights and has played an important role in preventing their misuse.
In its journey of 25 years, it has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence in the countrymen.
For a healthy society, and for lofty democratic values I feel that, it is a very hope inspiring event.
Today, with NHRC operating at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and inculcate them into practice - this is the very basis of Sab ka SaathSab ka Vikas'.
Even this year, we should try to organize 'Run for Unity' in our village, town, city or metropolis.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb, because he worked for the unity of our nation throughout his lifetime.
I urge you all that on October 31, through 'Run for Unity', to strengthen our efforts and bind every section of the society as a unified unit. This will be a great tribute to Sardar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, be it Navratri, Durgapuja or Vijayadashmi, I offer all my heartfelt greetings to all of you on account of these holy festivals.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating Rakshabandhan.
Heartiest greetings to all fellow citizens on this auspicious occasion.
The festival of Rakshabandhan symbolizes the bond of love trust between a brother a sister.
In a few days from now, we shall celebrate the festive occasion of Janmashtami.
The whole atmosphere will reverberate to the sonorous chants calls of Hathi, Ghoda, Palki, Jai Kanhaiya Lal ki and Govinda-Govinda.
It is indeed an extremely joyous experience to imbue the essence of Bhagwan Krishna revel blissfully.
My salutations to you.
On the occasion of Sanskrit week, I extend my best wishes to all countrymen.
Friends, apart from Rakshabandhan, Shravan Poornima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
We Indians also feel proud that from Vedic times to the modern day, Sanskrit language has played a stellar role in the universal spread of knowledge.
Sanskrit language literature encompasses a storehouse of knowledge pertaining to every facet of life.
It is said that our Vedas have detailed reference on Mantras, on ways means to counter the challenges of global warming.
You will be pleased to know that even today, residents of village Mattur in Shivamoga district of Karnataka use Sanskrit as their lingua franca.
You will be astonished to know that Sanskrit is a language that possesses the capacity for infinite word formation with two thousand verb roots, 200 suffixes 22 prefixes
For example, in order to illustrate the significance of the Guru in ones life, it has been said : r - , u.
My dear countrymen, the monsoon comes along, bringing a new ray of hope to our toiling farmers.
It provided much needed succor to the scorched trees shrubs, and to parched water bodies
on the other hand excessive rainfall causes devastating floods.
Its a vagary of Nature that some places have received higher rainfall compared to other places.
I earnestly pray for those injured in this natural disaster to get well soon.
But one gets to witness facets of humanity, humaneness during disasters.
From Kutch to Kamrup, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everyone is endeavoring to contribute in some way or the other so that wherever a disaster strikes, be it Kerala or any other part of India, human life returns to normalcy.
They have left no stone unturned as saviors of those trapped in the floods.
The Air Force, Navy, Army, BSF, CISF, RAF, every agency has played an exemplary role in the rescue relief operations.
We pray for Onam to provide strength to the country, especially Kerala so that it returns to normalcy on a newer journey of development.
Once again on behalf of all Indians, I would like to re assure each everyone in Kerala and other affected places that at this moment of calamity, the entire country stands by them.
In a way, he was cut-off from active politics for the last 10 years.
Ten years is a huge gap but on 16th August our country and the whole world witnessed that there was not a gap of even a single moment in the common mans heart.
India will remain ever grateful to Atalji for bringing the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change brought about two important changes in Indias politics.
First one is that the size of the cabinet in states was restricted to 15 of the total seats in the state Assembly.
And the second one is that the limit under the Anti Defection Law was enhanced from one-thirds to two-thirds.
Besides, clear guidelines were defined to disqualify the defector.
Atalji was a true patriot.
It was during his tenure that the timing of presenting the budget was changed.
In the year 2001, Atalji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 am.
A number of such rules have been included in this code which made it possible to unfurl the tricolor in public places.
This provided a chance to more and more of our countrymen to unfurl our national flag.
Thus, he brought our beloved tricolor closer to the common man.
The Government and the opposition both are putting forth their view points.
Reiterating our resolve to fulfill his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I along with all of you pay tributes to Atalji.
You will be glad to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha remained 118 percent and that of Rajya Sabha was 74 percent.
This Act will give more security to the interests of SC and ST communities.
Earlier, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh awarded the death sentence to the guilty after a hearing of just five days.
Courts in Rajasthan have also taken similar quick decisions.
This Act will play an effective role in curbing crimes against women and girls.
Economic growth will be incomplete without a social transformation.
In the Monsoon session, this time, everyone jointly presented an ideal approach.
Today, I publicly express my heartfelt gratitude to all MPs.
My dear countrymen The attention of crores of Indians is focused on the Asian Games being held in Jakarta.
The Asian Games are going on.
I wish to congratulate all players who have won medals for the country.
Among those winning medals for our country are a large number of our daughters which is a very positive sign
I request every citizen to make it a point to play and take care of their fitness because only a healthy India will build a developed and prosperous India.
Namaste Bhawnaji, I respect your sentiments.
Anybody will feel overawed on seeing Rani Ki Vaav of the 11th Century in Patan in Gujarat.
Our land has been an engineering laboratory.
There have been several engineers in India who made the unimaginable possible and presented such marvels of engineering before the world.
In this lineage of great engineers, we were blessed with a diamond whose work is still a source of wonder for all.
He was Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
Visvesvaraya.
Lakhs of farmers and common people continue to benefit from the Krishna Raj Sagar Dam built by him.
It is called Bhoonga in Kutch.
This house has faced three earthquakes.
I myself have seen three in this house itself.
But, you did not find any damage anywhere.
These houses were built by our ancestors in sync with nature and surroundings of this place.
And she was saying all this with such a feeling of pride that it made me think that engineers in that era had constructed such structures according to the local situations which kept the common man safe and secured.
While observing Engineers Day, we should think of the future as well.
Workshops should be held at different places.
What are the things we need to learn in the changing times
What do we need to teach
What do we need to connect to
Nowadays, disaster management has assumed immense significance.
The world is facing natural calamities.
What then should be the new form of structural engineering
What courses should be designed to that end
What should be taught to the students
All such points need to be pondered upon when we observe Engineers Day.
My dear countrymen
There is a mood of festivity and with this the preparations for Diwali also begin.
We will keep meeting through Mann Ki Baat, and will keep sharing matters close to our hearts.
We will join hands in taking our country forward with heartfelt vigor.
With these feelings, I extend my best wishes to you all.
at some places, people are anxiously waiting for the rains to begin.
The vastness and diversity of India, in fact, at times even rains play hide seek through partiality laced likes dislikes.
And that is why it becomes our collective responsibility... Let us be lovers of nature, protectors of Nature, conservers of Nature...
and thus, ensure spontaneous balance in her myriad bounty.
All of you must have watched it on T.
Usually it takes a few hours to enter and exit that cave.
Not able to find a way out, they perched themselves a top a mound inside the cave
not for a day or two, but an entire 18 days.
One can only imagine the predicament of these teenagers in the face of death, where every second was fraught with danger.
On the one hand they were struggling against all odds on the other, the world over, humanity joined hands in expressing the noblest the most righteous of human virtues.
I feel the self-control exercised by each one of them in conduct is worth understanding and emulating.
It is not that the parents were not aggrieved, it is not that the mothers eyes had ceased to be moist.
Their patience, their restraint, in fact the calm composure exercised by the entire society is commendable worth following.
During the operation, a sailor from Thailand Navy sacrificed his life.
The whole world is be wildered at the way they held on with courage and patience, without losing hope, despite the odds against them in the water-logged dark cave.
This proves that when humanity stands together, it creates wonders.
What is certainly required is focusing on your goal with a calm steady demeanour and the will to strive.
A few days ago, the countrys beloved poet Neeraj Ji left us forever.
Neeraj ji was blessed with a special quality...
it was a combination of hope, faith, a firm resolve and self-confidence.
Every word of Neeraj jis work can instill a lot of strength inspiration in us Indians.
Usually, the months of July and August are very important for farmers and the youth.
This is the time which is Peak season for colleges.
Like Satyam, Hundreds of thousands of youth leave schools to join colleges.
July is the month when the youth step into a new phase of life, where the focus shifts from questions and veers towards cut-offs.
The attention of students steers from home to hostel.
Students submit themselves to the tutelage of Professors vis a vis the shadow of their parents.
I firmly believe that my young friends must be enthusiastic happy on the commencement of their college life.
Leaving home for the first time, moving out of ones village, coming out of a protective environment amounts to taking charge of the course of ones life.
This multitude of young people leave their homes for the first time to chart a new direction for their lives.
All I would like to say to you is Be calm, enjoy life, seek inner happiness in life.
There is no alternative to books, one has to study, yet ones bent of mind should be towards discovering new things.
Old friends are invaluable.
how Asharam Choudhury a student from an extremely poor family in Madhya Pradesh overcame lifes many challenges to achieve success.
In his maiden attempt, he cracked the Entrance exam for MBBS at AIIMS, Jodhpur.
or Gurgaons divyang angel Anushka Panda, who suffers from a hereditary disorder called spinal muscular atrophy...
all of them overcame each every obstacle through their firm resolve and eal, attaining success for the world to see.
If we look around, we can see many such examples.
Any commendable incident from any part of the country infuses my heart with energy and inspires me.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago I happened to glance through a news item, it said- Two youths make Modis dream come true.
On reading further, I came to know how our youngsters put in efforts to transform the lives of the common man by making smart and creative use of technology.
It so happened that once I was interacting with Indian youth in San Jose town of America hailed as a Technology Hub.
I had appealed to those young people to think over how could they use their talent to Indias benefit and do something in that direction whenever they found time.
I had made an appeal to change brain-drain into brain-gain.
Two IT Professionals from Rae Bareilly Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Bajpayee ji accepted my challenge and made a unique attempt.
With their joint efforts, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have developed a SmartGaonApp by utilizing their professional skills.
This App is not only connecting the villagers with the whole world but now they can obtain any information on their own mobile phones.
Residents of the village Taudhakpur in Rae Bareilly, village chief, District Magistrate, CDO and every one joined in to create awareness amongst the masses.
Actually, Pandharpur Wari is an amazing journey in itself.
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which fell on 23rd July, is celebrated as a day of grand transformation of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a holy town in Solapur district in Maharashtra.
Wooden foot wear or padukas of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram are placed in a palki and pilgrims begin their pilgrimage chanting Vitthal-Vitthal.
Pilgrims go to have a darshan of Vitthal who is also known as Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vitthal safeguards the interests of the poor, the deprived ones and the ones who are suffering.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana have deep devotion and respect for Vitthal.
Visiting Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and its grandeur, beauty and spiritual bliss is a unique experience in itself.
May they be compositions like Bharud (Hkk:M) or Abhang (vHkax), we get a great message of amity, love and brotherhood.
We get the mantra to enable the society to fight against blind-faith through devotion and bhakti.
These were the people who, at times restrained and corrected the society, even showed a mirror and ensured that old evil traditions get eradicated from the society and that people inculcated a culture of compassion, equality and righteousness.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and self-confidence.
The British were so afraid of Lok Manya Tilak that they tried to charge him of sedition thrice in two decades
this is no small thing.
I want to narrate an interesting incident to the countrymen which is connected with Lok Manya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When in October 1916, Lok Manya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, more than 40,000 people that time gave him a welcome and during that very visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had a chance to talk to him.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was greatly impressed by Lok Manya Tilakji.
When on August 1 1920, Lok Manya Tilakji passed away, Patel ji had decided then itself that he would build his statue in Ahmedabad.
Finally, the statue got built and Sardar Saheb got it unveiled by none other than Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 1929
And my dear countrymen, the speciality about this statue is that this is a rare statue of Tilakji in which he is sitting in a chair and in this Swaraj is our birthright (Swaraj Hamara Janma Sidhha Adhikar Hai) is inscribed right below Tilakjis statue.
The celebration of Ganesh Utsav publicly had become an effective medium in promoting a spirit of social awakening, integration, amity and equality among the masses besides projecting a sense of dedication and festivity in them.
This was the period when there was a need for people to get united in the fight against the British
these festivals, by breaking the barriers of casteism and communalism served the purpose of uniting all.
Such events gained more popularity with the passage of time. Thus, it becomes clear that our younger generations still care for the brave heroes of our ancient past, its heritage and history.
Today, you can see Ganesh pandals in almost every street of various cities.
All families in that street collectively organize these pandals.
This is an excellent chance for our youth wherein they can learn qualities of leadership and organization and inculcate these in themselves.
Right from Ganesh idol to all decorative material everything ought to be eco friendly and I will appreciate that separate competitions be organized in each city, prizes be awarded for these
Every Indian should have access to good governance and positive results of development.
I am talking about none other than Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad put his life on the stake, but he never bowed in front of the foreign rule.
It was my privilege and good fortune that I had the opportunity of going to Chandrasekhar Azads native village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I had the opportunity to pay homage in Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad, Chandrasekhar Azad Ji was a brave man who did not wish to die by the bullet of foreigners - he wished to fight for independence as a free man and if he had to die, he wished to remain a free man
This is what was so special about him.
Once again, I bow and pay tributes to the two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilakji and Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland, India's brave daughter and a farmer daughter Hima Das made history by winning the gold medal in the 400-meter race event.
Ekta Bhyan, another daughter of the country, in response to my letter, has emailed me from Indonesia, where she is now preparing for the Asian Games.
Ekta in her e-mail writes - 'The most important moment in the life of any athlete is that when he or she holds the tricolor and I am proud that I could do that.
' Ekta, we all are proud of you.
You have brought glory to the Nation.
Ekta has won the gold and bronze medals in World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 held in Tunisia.
May you go further than these successes, keep on playing and keep on blooming.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is significant because it is filled with historically important dates and festivals, but due to the weather sometimes sickness also enters the house.
We will meet once again for Mann Ki Baat' next time.
Many Many Thanks.
NNamaskar.
My dear countrymen, Im fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru.
Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan.
Both teams performed par excellence.
Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year.
Im also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan.
This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship.
Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents skills of our youth.
I felicitate both the teams of India Afghanistan.
I sincerely hope, that in future too, well play with each other with the best sportsman spirit shine together.
My dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights.
In the European Parliament in Brussels, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Japanese naval warships, there were sights of people performing yoga.
Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women.
On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison.
Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people.
ealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival.
If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over
It is a matter of great pride for a hundred twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea sky.
A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines
some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same.
Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth.
Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air.
Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues.
Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries.
Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets
yoga has proved them in a concrete manner.
I believe that the concept of wellness today is bringing about a revolution.
We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life.
On the other hand, there are times when it is the Doctor who gives us re-birth.
The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments.
Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health.
Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills.
Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctors Day on the 1st of July.
India has had a rich historical canvas.
I am sure you know about Kabirwad in Gujarat when I used to work there, I had organized a National session of people belonging to the tradition of saint Kabir.
You must be aware that in eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a place called Maghar. It is here that Sant Kabir Das ji attained Samadhi.
Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar
In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in ones pathway to heaven.
On the contrary, breathing ones last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven.
Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view.
Sant Kabir Das ji, through his verses Saakhis and Dohas stressed upon the virtues of social equality, peace and brotherhood.
These were his ideals.
We can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions.
I quote a doha , , The true saint is the one who recognizes understands the sufferings of others.
Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate.
Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion.
He was a thinker way ahead of his times.
Anger is sure to devour you,Forgiveness is a great virtue.
He said , Never ask a saint his caste or creed Ask him about his repository of knowledge.
He appealed to the people to rise above divisions of religion caste and make knowledge wisdom the sole basis of recognition.
His principles are relevant even after several centuries have gone by.
Since we are referring to Sant Kabir Das ji, I am reminded of a doha couplet in which he says,", "Such is the exalted status accorded to the guru, the teacher.
And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev.
He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries.
Guru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God.
Wherever he went, he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society.
The establishment of a kitchen free of social discrimination where a person of any caste, sect, religion or community could eat or what we know as the langarsystem was initiated solely by Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019.
In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity.
It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end
Shyama Prasad Mukherjees birthday and he wants me to talk about Dr.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed significantly.
He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal.
Come
During the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call.
I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them.
In far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers.
Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages.
I am glad that in this entire programme I witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government, of the country's power, the power of New Indias dreams, the power of the resolve of the new India this is what I experienced
In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government's credit.
An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people.
With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more.
There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and youre left with renewed fervour and inspiration.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength.
I again want to express my gratitude to you all.
On one hand, where we have professionals and engineers, on the other hand, there exist farmers tilling the fields, our brethren-sisters associated with agriculture.
Now you must be wondering that these are two completely different occupations - what is the relation between these professions
This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers.
On one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops, whereas on the other hand, to make certain the farmers' participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right.
Friends
Your youth-power is really inspiring for any young person.
'One Nation, One Tax' was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today.
If Ive to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of One Nation One Tax reform, then I credit the states of our nation.
GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far, there have been 27 meetings of the GST Council and we can all feel proud that people from different political ideologies have been involved in these meetings.
Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country.
GST is not only the victory of integrity but it is also a celebration of honesty.
Earlier, in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country, there were rampant complaints of Inspector Raj.
GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world.
It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption.
Just a while ago, from the 4th of April to the 15th of April, the 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia.
An air of excitement, zeal, enthusiasm, hope, aspirations, the determination to achieve who would want to stay away from an atmosphere like that
These were the times when people all over the country pondered eagerly everyday on the line-up of sportspersons, scheduled for their respective performances.
How will Indias performance be, what will our medal tally look like These questions were but natural.
Our sportspersons too lived up to the countrymens expectations and displayed stellar performances, winning one medal after another.
Shooting or Wrestling, Table Tennis or Badminton, it was a record performance for India.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze, India bagged a tally of around 66 medals.
This success makes every Indian swell with pride.
Of course, winning medals is a moment of joy glory for a sportsperson
it is equally so as a festival of laurels for the country her countrymen.
Perhaps, to express those sentiments Ill run short of words.
But I want to share with you what I heard from these heroes.
Special in the sense that this time there were many pathbreaking firsts.
Manika Batra won a medal in each of the events that she competed in.
She is the first Indian woman to win a gold in the individual table tennis category too.
India clinched the maximum number of medals in shooting.
15 year old Indian shooter Anish Bhanwala became the youngest sportsperson to win a gold for India.
Sachin Chowdhary is the sole Indian Para Power Lifter to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games.
This edition of the games was special on one more count- a majority of the medalists was women athletes.
In squash, boxing, weightlifting and shooting the performance of women turned out to be par excellence.
Everyone was thrilled for the fact that despite there being competition, the ultimate medal winner had to be India.
Athletes who participated in these games hail from various parts of the country, even from smaller towns.
Even their friends have contributed by boosting their morale under all circumstances.
Last month during Mann Ki Baat, I had urged our countrymen, especially the youth to espouse Fit India.
I had invited everyone to join Fit India, lead Fit India.
I was overjoyed to see people getting connected to it with a lot of enthusiasm.
Expressing support for this, many people have written to me, sent me letters, shared fitness mantra- Fit India stories on social media.
A gentleman Shriman Shashikant Bhonsale, sharing his photo by the swimming pool, has written, My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Rooma Devnath writes, I truly feel happy healthy through my Morning Walks.
She further adds, For me, fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
Devnathji, indeed, happiness is fitness, and theres no doubt about it.
Dhawal Prajapati, sharing a photograph of himself trekking, has written For me, travelling trekking is Fit India.
It was heartening to see many eminent personalities encouraging our youth in interesting ways for Fit India.
Cine artiste Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
Many other young people have shared their experiences, having joined the Fit India efforts.
I feel movements like these are beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
I would additionally like to mention, that the movement of Fit India, without any expense, is called YOG.
the significance, the merit of 21st June, International Yog Day has been accepted welcomed globally.
Do begin preparing for the Day rightaway.
And not just yourself- your city, village, neighbourhood, school, college, men, women, everyone should make an attempt to connect with yog.
I would like to talk to you today, to invite you on a new task. Ive seen a lot of young people these days, spending time in learning new things.
Dear young friends, today I urge you to undergo a special internship.
Three Ministries of the Government of India maybe four- Sports, HRD, Department of Drinking water have come together to launch a Swachch Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
College students, young people from the NCC and Nehru Yuva Kendra, whoever want to do something substantial learn something for the sake of society, the country, those who want to get connected with transforming the country and be a reason for it, those who want to do something or the other for society with a positive energy- for them, there is a great opportunity
Even the cause of the cleanliness campaign will get a boost, and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, well surely attain a sense of fulfillment. And let me tell you, the best out of the best interns who have strived in schools colleges with excellent work will be rewarded with recognition at the national level.
Not just that, those interns who accomplish their tasks well, will be awarded two credit points each, by the UGC.
Once again, I invite students young people, boys girls to avail of the benefits of the internship.
You can register yourselves for the Swachch Bharat Summer Internship on Mygov.
I hope our youth will lend a hand in taking this movement of cleanliness forward.
Let us turn this vacation into a learning opportunity, for a totally new experience.
This group of youngsters has started a big campaign in Delhi for providing education to the street children and slum dwellers.
Initially, shocked to see the condition of children begging around or doing some menial jobs that this group of youngsters got dedicatedly, selflessly involved into this creative mission.
Starting with just 15 children from the slums near Geeta Colony in New Delhi it is now being run at 12 places and two thousand children have been brought under its fold.
Young teachers associated with this campaign find out a free time of two hours from their busy schedule and contribute in this stupendous mission of bringing out a social transformation.
Dear brothers and sisters, in this very way, some farmers from hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
With their collective efforts, they have not only changed their own fortunes but have changed fortunes of the whole region.
In Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, main crops sown are Mandwa, Chaulai, Corn or Barley.
What they did was that they started production of biscuits from their agricultural produce and sold those biscuits directly in the market.
These farmers have formed a cooperative society in Munar village and set-up a biscuit factory there.
Impressed by the bold initiative of these farmers, the administration has also linked this to the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being supplied upto Almora and Kousani besides being sold to about fifty Aanganwadi kendras in Bagheshwar district.
With the hard work of these farmers, the annual turnover of the society has gone up from 10 to 15 lakh rupees and with more than 900 families getting employment here, people have stopped migrating to other places.
My dear countrymen, we often hear that in, times to come, the world will face a war because of water.
Everyone talks about this but do we not have any responsibility towards conservation of water
Do we not feel that water conservation must be a social responsibility
This must be a collective responsibility.
Our forefathers have lived this as a way of life for centuries together.
They gave due priority and importance to each single drop of water.
They found out newer methods in order to conserve every single drop of water.
Those of you who might be getting a chance to visit Tamilnadu might have noticed that in some temples in the state, there are carvings on stone depicting irrigation system, water conservation methods and drought management.
May it be Mannarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai you will get to see massive stone inscriptions to this effect.
Several baodis (stepwells) are famous as tourist spots but please do not forget that these are the living symbols of the water conservation campaigns which our forefathers had accomplished.
Adalaj and Patan Ki Raniki Vaav (Baodi) in Gujarat is a UNESCO World Heritage site and its grandeur is to be seen to be believed.
Baodis are water temples in a way.
If you happen to go to Rajasthan, you must visit Chand Baodi.
This is one of the biggest and the most beautiful baodis of India and the point to be noted is that this is situated in a water-scarce area.
April, May, June and July is the most suitable time when rain water harvesting can be done and if we make preparations in advance, we can reap a rich harvest.
Budget under MNREGA is also utilized for this water conservation activity.
During the last three years, everyone in his or her own way has contributed towards water conservation and water management.
An average of 32,000 crore rupees have been spent besides the MNREGA budget each year on water conservation and water management.
If we talk of 2017-18, 55 percent of the total outlay of Rupees 64 thousand crores, which comes to around rupees 35 thousand crores, has been spent on works like water conservation.
In last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land got more benefit through water conservation and water management measures.
After receiving the reports of Remote Sensing Imagery and Inter Department Coordination, the district administration took up the responsibility of soil and water conservation on a massive scale.
They succeeded in reviving the dried out Sasur Khaderi river with the help and cooperation of people from 40-45 villages of the area.
This grand achievement is a big boon for animals, birds, farmers, crops and villages.
I emphasis that once again April, May, June and July are before us and we must also take up some responsibility for water harvesting and water conservation, we should also chalk out some schemes, we should also do and show something.
When Mann Ki Baat approaches I receive messages, letters and phone calls from all sides.
Aayan Kumar Banerjee from Devi Tola village of North 24 Parganas in West Bengal in his comment on My Gov has written We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people are not aware of the Nobel Laureate Rabindra Naths philosophy of living peacefully, aesthetically and with integrity.
Kindly discuss this point in Mann Ki Baat programme so that more and more people may get to know about this.
I thank Aayanji for drawing the attention of all listeners of Mann Ki Baat towards this point.
Gurudev Tagore was a personality full of knowledge and intellect whose writings left an indelible mark on everyone.
Rabindra Nath was a personality full of talent, a multi directional personna but a teacher in his inner self can always be felt.
And, whenever I got a chance to listen to poems like Anandloke and Aaguner, Poroshmoni, I used to feel as if my mind was being energised.
You must also have been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay my respectful homage to Rabindra Nath Tagore.
Within a few days from now the holy month of Ramazan will dawn upon us.
The month of Ramazan is celebrated with full reverence and respect throughout the world.
The sociological and collective aspect of fasting is that when a person experiences hunger himself, he comes to realize the hunger of others.
When he is thirsty, he realizes the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings of Prophet Muhammad-peace be upon him- and his message.
It is our responsibility to follow the path of equality and brotherhood as morals from his life.
Once a person asked the Prophet (peace be upon him): "Which is the best thing in Islam
" The Prophet Saab said, "feeding a poor and needy and meeting everyone cordially, whether you know him or not
"Prophet Mohammad Sahib (peace be upon him) believed in twin principles of knowledge and compassion.
He did not possess an iota of ego regarding himself.
He preached that knowledge alone defeats ego.
Prophet Muhammad Sahib believed that a person is rich because of his inherent spirituality, and not materialistic wealth.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We must be proud of the fact that India is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, the very synonym of power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of all of our obligation to emulate Lord Buddhas teaching as well as, pledge ourselves to follow his footsteps.
Lord Buddha was the fountainhead of egalitarianism, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are human values, which are most desired in the world today.
Baba Saheb Dr.
Ambedkar stressed that Lord Buddha has been a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Baba Saheb strengthened the oppressed, exploited, deprived and crores of people standing on the brink of marginalization via the Constitution of India.
There cannot be a bigger example of compassion than this.
This form of compassion was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha for the alleviation of suffering of the people.
The Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries carrying with them the rich ideals of Lord Buddha and this has been occurring throughout the ages.
We have inherited the wisdom of Lord Buddha throughout Asia as part of our legacy.
It forges a link between us and many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar where Buddhist traditions and his preaching are a part of their origins. And this is the very reason that we are developing Infrastructure for Buddhist Tourism, which is going to connect Southeast Asia with the important Buddhist sites of India.
I am also very pleased that the Government of India is a partner in the restoration of many Buddhist temples which also includes the centuries old magnificent Anand Temple in Bagan in Myanmar.
Today, when there is confrontation and human suffering prevalent everywhere in the world, Lord Buddha's teachings show the way to rid hatred from the world with compassion.
I wish people spread all over the world who revere Lord Buddha and believe in the principles of compassion- I wish all of them an auspicious Buddha Purnima.
I seek benediction from Lord Buddha for the entire world, so that we can fulfill our responsibility in building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, as we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the idols of laughing Buddha, it is said that laughing Buddha brings one good fortune, but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in India's defense history.
Now you will be wondering what is the connection between smiling Buddha and India's military might
That day also was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On May 11, 1998, at Indias western end a nuclear test was conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan.
It has been 20 years since Pokhranand this test was done on Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
India's test was not only successful but in a way, India had demonstrated its might in the field of science and technology.
We can also say 11 May 1988 is engraved in the history of India as a demonstration of her military power.
Lord Buddha has shown the world- that the power of inner strength or that of the soul is necessary for peace.
Similarly, when you are sturdy as a nation, you can be at peace with others.
The month of May, 1998 is not just important for the country from the aspect that nuclear tests were conducted this very month, but the manner in which they were carried out is also important.
It has revealed to the entire world that India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can reach loftier destinations and earn new laurels.
On that day, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra - "Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan, Jai-Vigyan.
Now that when we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Pokhran test conducted on May 11, 1998, I ask the younger generations of our nation to imbibe the mantra of 'Jai-Vigyan' given by Atalji for enhancing the might and the power of India, to build a modern India, a powerful India and a self-reliant India.
Synergize your energy with the strength of India.
Witnessing the journey that Atal ji started, we while continuing onwards on that very path with a renewed joy will derive great satisfaction in getting ahead.
My dear countrymen, looking forward to our conversation when we will meet for another episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the holy day of Ram Navami.
A while ago, when distinguished dignitaries of all ASEAN Countries were here on the 26th of January, they were accompanied by cultural troupes from their respective countries.
And its a matter of immense pride that a majority of these countries presented the Ramayan in front of us.
This signifies that Ram Ramayan continues to inspire and have a positive impact, not just in India, but in that part of the world too.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ramnavami.
My dear countrymen, just like every time earlier, I have received a rather large number of letters, e mails, phone calls and comments from you.
I read a post written on MyGov by Komal Thakkar ji, where she has referred to starting on-line courses for Sanskrit.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji of Village Baraakar, District Nalanda, Bihar I read your comments written on the Narendra Modi App.
The concerns you have raised on the depleting ground water levels is indeed of great importance.
Shriman Sakal Shastriji, you mentioned Karnataka... you beautifully maintained a delicate balance between words when you wrote Ayushman Bharat
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresha Ji has asked me to speak to the youth concerning their health.
He feels that our youth are physically weak, compared to those of other Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, I feel I should speak in detail to all of you on Fit India.
Prashant ji, the Government of India has already done that on social media and the Narendra Modi App, beginning that very day.
You may now like them, re-tweet them, post them to your friends.
Anagha, Jayesh and many other children from Chennai have written posted to me their heartfelt thoughts on the gratitude cards, the post script to the book Exam Warriors.
Let me tell Anagha, Jayesh other children that these letters enliven me up after a hard days work.
Now, if I start including all those phone calls, comments, whatever I could read or hear, many of which touched my heart
if I exclusively speak about them, perhaps Ill require a few months to respond to them in some way or the other.
This time, maximum number of letters are from children who have written about exams.
They have shared their vacation plans.
Theyve expressed their concern on the availability of water for birds animals.
Our farmer brothers sisters have written on Kisan Melas, Farmer Carnivals and activities revolving around farming, being held across the country.
uite a few active citizens have sent in suggestions on the subject of water conservation.
Ever since we have begun conversing with each other in Mann Ki Baat through the medium of radio, I have noticed a pattern that in the sweltering heat of this season, most letters focus around topic pertaining to summer time.
Just before examinations, letter pour in, touching on the anxieties of our young student friends who are about to appear.
And its equally true that our heartfelt thoughts do bring about a change of season in someones life, figuratively speaking. And why should not things change
When I get to read in your letters how a rickshaw puller from Karimgunj in Assam, Ahmed Ali, has built nine schools for underprivileged children, I witness firsthand the indomitable will-power this country possesses.
When I heard the story of Kanpur based Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhary, of how he visits the underprivileged on footpaths and offers free medicines to them, it gives one an opportunity to feel the sense of brotherhood that prevails in the country.
His cab passengers too contributed large-heartedly.
A young engineer girl donated her first salary for this noble cause.
This way, after mobilizing funds for twelve long years, Saiduls mammoth efforts paid rich dividends.
Today, through sheer hard work and a firm resolve, a thirty bedded hospital has finally come up at Punri Village near Kolkata.
Today the whole world has changed the way it looks at India.
the reason behind it is the Purusharth, the resolute yet selfless inner strength of such illustrious sons daughters of Mother India.
An atmosphere of positivity built on a self confidence filled with hope has pervaded all over.
This self confidence, this very positivity will by a catalyst in realising our resolve of New India, of making our dream come true.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very crucial for our farming brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji, Chaudhari Devi Lal ji they all recognized agriculture and the farmer as vital aspects of the nations economy and also for the common mans life.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastriji generally insisted on conservation of trees, plants and vegetation and also highlighted the importance of an improvised agricultural infrastructure.
Chaudhari Charan Singh in his speech in 1979 had urged our farmers to use new technology and to adopt new innovations and underlined their vital significance.
This state has a small area but it has attained a grand success.
Our farmers in Meghalaya, in the year 2015-16, achieved record production as compared to the last five years.
They have showed that if once the targets are set, spirits are high and with a strong resolve, the set targets can most certainly be attained.
Brothers and sisters, in this years budget a big decision has been taken to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce.
It has been decided that the MSP of notified crops will be fixed at least one and a half times of their cost.
If I may elaborate on this, MSP will include labour cost of other workers employed, expenses incurred on own animals and cost of animals and machinery taken on rent, cost of seeds, cost of each type of fertilizer used, irrigation cost, land revenue paid to the State Government, interest paid on working capital, ground rent in case of leased land and not only this but also the cost of labour of the farmer himself or any other person of his family who contributes his or her labour in agricultural work will also be added to the cost of production.
Moreover, an extensive exercise on agricultural reforms is being undertaken across the country in order to ensure that our farmers get a fair price for their crop.
Efforts are on to connect local village mandis to wholesale market and then on with the global market.
Twenty- two thousand rural haats in the country will be upgraded by creating the necessary infrastructure and these will be integrated with APMC and e-NAM platform- so that the farmers would not have to go to distant places for selling their produce.
In other words, such a system is being set up where in farms in any part of the country will have a market-connect.
My dear countrymen, this year Mahatma Gandhis 150th birth anniversary celebrations will begin.
How should the country celebrate it
Swachch Bharat is already our resolve besides this, how can our 125 crore countrymen pay the best tribute to Gandhiji by working in close harmony
What should be the logo for Gandhi 150
We all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and have to take the country to newer heights by drawing inspiration from Bapu.
In the health sector the nation has now moved ahead from the conventional approach.
Earlier, every aspect regarding health used to be a responsibility of the Health Ministry alone.
But now, all departments and ministries- be it the Sanitation Ministry or Ayush Ministry or Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, Consumer Affairs Ministry or the Women Child Welfare Ministry or even the State Governments- they are all working together for Swasth Bharat and stress is being laid on affordable health alongside preventive health.
Preventive health care is the least costly and the easiest one as well.
And, the more we become aware about preventive health care, the more beneficial will it be for the individuals, the family and the society.
Also, extensive work is going on to set up Health Wellness Centres across the country.
Yoga has attained worldwide recognition as a measure of preventive health care.
Yoga is a guarantee of both fitness and wellness.
It is the result of our concerted efforts and commitment that Yoga has now become a mass movement and reached every house.
Less than a hundred days are now left for the International Yoga Day on 21st June.
On the previous three International Yoga Days, people in our country and people all over the world participated with great zeal and enthusiasm.
This time too, we need to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and motivate our family, friends and all others from now itself to do yoga.
Yoga has to be made popular among the youth, the senior citizens, men and women from all age groups through interesting ways.
Usually, the countrys Television and electronic media do a variety of programmes on Yoga the whole year.
Can we, beginning now, till the Yoga Day, devise a campaign to spread awareness on Yoga
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
But yes, I surely am a Yoga practitioner and yet some people, through their creativity, have made me a Yoga teacher as well and 3-D animated videos of my yoga practice sessions have been prepared.
I will share these videos with you so that we may do aasans and pranayam together.
Presently, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country and more than eight hundred medicines are being made available there at an affordable price.
More such centres are being opened.
I appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to provide this information about Jan Anshadhi Kendras to the needy ones it will cut their expense on medicines. This will be a big help to them.
The cost of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
Knee implants cost has also been regulated and reduced by 50 to 70.
Under Ayushman Bharat Yojana , the Government of India and insurance companies will jointly provide 5 lakh repees for treatment to about 10 crore families or say 50 crore citizens per year.
In the present 479 medical colleges, MBBS seats have been increased to about 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being opened in various states with a view to providing better treatment and health facilities to people across the country.
One new medical college will be set up for every three districts.
A target has been fixed to make the country TB-free by 2025.
This is an enormous task.
Your cooperation is needed to create public awareness.
All of us will need to make united efforts to become TB-free.
My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
According to him the industry was an effective medium by which jobs could be made available to the poorest of the poor and the poorer.
Today, the campaign of Make in India is progressing successfully in consonance with Dr.
Ambedkarjis dream of India as an industrial super power-that vision of his has become our inspiration today.
Today India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the highest foreign direct investment or FDI in the world, is flowing to India.
The whole world is looking at India as a hub for investment innovation and development.
In continuance with his vision, smart city mission and urban mission were kick-started in the country so that all kinds of amenities whether good roads, water supply, health facilities, Education or digital connectivity are available in the big cities and small towns of the country.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance.
He did not want anybody to languish in poverty forever.
He also believed that poverty cannot be ameliorated by mere distribution of capital among the impoverished.
Today our monetary policy, Start Up India, Stand Up India initiative have become seedbed for our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
Baba Saheb who envisaged water power as nation power.
He stressed the utilization of water for the development of the nation The genesis of different river valley authorities, different water related commissions - all these were possible due to the vision of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today there are landmark efforts, being embarked upon for waterways and ports in our country.
New seaports are being constructed on a number of seaways of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
In the era of 40s, while most of the discussions were centred around the Second World War, the looming Cold war and the partition it was during those times Dr.
Ambedkar had laid the foundation of Team India's spirit in a way.
He had talked about the importance of federalism, federal system and stressed on Center and states working together for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted in all aspects of governance the mantra of co-operative federalism and going a step further, we have adopted competitive cooperative federalism but most importantly, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people like me, who belong to backward classes.
He showed us that to succeed it is not necessary for the person to be born in an illustrious or rich family, but even those who are born to poor families in India can also dare to dream their dreams and realize those dreams by achieving success.
And of course, this is exactly what happened as many people mocked Dr.
It is an India which is Ambedkars India, of the poor and the backward.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar from April 14 to May 5 Gram-Swaraj Abhiyan, is being organized.
Under the aegis of this campaign, separate programmes on village development, poverty amelioration and social justice will be held throughout India.
I urge you all to be a part of this campaign.
My dear countrymen, a spectrum of many festivals would dawn upon us in the next few days- Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and the Baisakhi.
The day of Bhagwan Mahavir's birth anniversary is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavirji, the apostle of non-violence will inspire us all.
I extend felicitations to all on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti.
The very mention of Easter reminds us of the inspirational preaching of Lord Jesus Christ which has always impressed on mankind the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion.
Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and in parts of western India in April
Many many thanks.
All of us have seen that the sea appears blue, but we know from routine life experiences that water has no colour at all.
Have we ever thought why water acquires colour in rivers and seas
The same thought occurred to a young man in the 1920s.
The same question gave rise to a great scientist of modern India.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light scattering.
One of his discoveries is famous as the Raman Effect.
We celebrate the 28th of February as National Science Day since on this very day, he is said to have discovered the phenomenon of light scattering, for which the Nobel Prize was conferred upon him.
This land has given birth to many a great scientist.
On the one hand, there has been a tradition of great Mathematicians like Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupt and Aryabhatt on the other, in the field of medicine, Sushrut Charak have bestowed upon us a place of pride.
Right from Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargobind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose have brought laurels to India.
The famous particle BOSON has been named after Satyendranath Bose.
Recently I got an opportunity to take part in a programme in Mumbai the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was interesting to know about the ongoing miraculous accomplishments in the field of Science.
Artificial Intelligence aids in making robots, Bots and other machines meant for specific tasks.
Through self learning, machines today can enhance their intelligence to a smarter level.
This technology can be harnessed to better the lives of the underprivileged, the marginalized and the needy.
In that programme on Artificial Intelligence, I urged the scientific community to deliberate on how Artificial Intelligence could help us make life easier for our divyang brothers sisters.
Can we make better predictions of natural disasters using Artificial Intelligence
A few days ago, I got an opportunity to accompany the Prime Minister of Israel to Ahmedabad, Gujarat for the inauguration of I create.
There a young person referred to developing a digital instrument that converts the written word into voice. This is to aid those who are incapable of speech to converse normally like any other person.
I feel we can harness Artificial Intelligence in many such fields.
Any machine will work the way we want it to.
It entirely depends on us what task we want it to perform.
the use of Science for the sole purpose of human welfare, with the endeavour to assist human lives touch the greatest heights.
Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, failed many a time in his experiments.
Once, on being asked about it, he quipped, I have devised ten thousand ways of how NOT to make a light bulb. What I mean to say is, Edison transformed even his failures into his own strength.
Coincidentally, I am fortunate today to be in Auroville, the land, the karmabhoomi of Maharshi Arvind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged British rule, fought against them and questioned subjugation.
Thus, as a great sage, he questioned every facet of life.
Extracting answers, he showed the right path to humanity.
The relentless quest to ask questions for knowing the truth is very important.
And this is the very essence, the real inspiration behind scientific inventions and discoveries.
Never rest till every why, what how are answered.
I congratulate our scientists, and all those connected with Science on the occasion of National Science Day.
May our young generation be inspired for the quest of truth knowledge may they be motivated to serve society through Science.
Friends, safety in the times of crises, disasters are topics on which many messages keep coming in- people keep writing to me.
In a comment posted on Narendra Modi Mobile App, Shriman Ravindra Singh from Pune has referred to occupational safety.
He writes that in our country, safety standards at factories and construction sites are not upto the mark.
Since the 4th of March is National Safety Day, the Prime Minister should include safety in the Mann Ki Baat programme in order to raise awareness on safety.
When we refer to public safety, two aspects are very important- proactiveness and preparedness.
Safety is of two kinds one is safety during disasters and the other is safety in everyday life.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, if we are not able to attain a certain level, it will get extremely difficult during the time of disasters.
If we stay alert, abide by the prescribed rules regulations, we shall not only be able to save our own lives but we can prevent catastrophes harming society.
There are times when we come across many slogans on safety at the work place but none following their letter and spirit.
I urge the fire brigade under corporations and municipalities to visit school children once a week or once a month and perform mock drills for them.
This will have a dual benefit the fire brigade will undergo an exercise in readiness and the new generation will get lessons in alertness. And all this at no added cost.
India is a land of geographic and climatic diversities.
As far as disasters are concerned, this country has borne the brunt of many a natural as well as man made disaster, such as chemical industrial mishaps.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority, NDMA is the vanguard when it comes to dealing with disasters in the country.
During earthquakes, floods, cyclones, landslides, NDMA reaches the area within no time.
Training and awareness have a very important role to play.
Two- three years ago, thousands of people would lose their lives every year due to heat-wave. After that, NDMA organized workshops on heat wave management as part of a campaign to raise awareness in people.
This proves that if we accord priority to safety, we can actually attain safety.
Our Fire Rescue services, National Disaster Response Forces Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces... these brave hearts go beyond the call of duty to help people in distress, often risking their own lives.
Organisations like NCC and Scouts are also contributing in this task
India has made a pioneering effort BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan Nepal a joint disaster management exercise involving these countries was undertaken.
Well have to make it part of our life, our being.
My dear countrymen, in the current budget, emphasis has been laid on turning waste to wealth and waste to energy through Bio gas, under the Swachch Bharat Campaign.
An effort was initiated which was named GOBAR-Dhan - Galvanizing Organic Bio Agro Resources.
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other Bio-waste to produce energy. But India was lacking full capacity utilization.
Under the Swachch Bharat Mission (Rural), we are taking rapid strides in this direction.
A target has been set to use cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste to produce Bio gas based energy.
Under the Gobardhan Scheme our farmer brothers sisters in rural India will be encouraged to consider dung and other waste not just as a waste but as a source of income.
Under the aegis of 'GobarDhanYojana', many benefits will accrue to rural areas.
Farmers and cattle herders will be helped in augmenting their income.
There will be novel opportunities for newer jobs linked to waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc.
An online trading platform will be created for better implementation of 'Gobar Dhan Yojana', it will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers can get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially our sisters residing in rural India, to step forward, and through creation of self-help groups and cooperative societies extract full advantage from this opportunity.
I invite you to become part of the movement comprising clean energy and green jobs, to become a part of the initiative to convert waste in your village to wealth and by converting dung into Gobar dhan.
Different types of artifacts were made utilizing garbage.
Many Workshops were organized to inform people on the entire aspects of waste management.
Many individuals taking initiative on their own behalf shared innovative ideas, held discussions, conducted poetry recitals.
A festive atmosphere regarding cleanliness got geared up.
The way the school children took part in the entire endeavor was amazing.
For the innovative manner in which importance of waste management and cleanliness were displayed in this festival, I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the entire populace of Chhattisgarh, its government and administration.
Every year on March 8, 'International Women's Day' is celebrated.
There are many programs that are held in our country and the world.
On this day, women are also felicitated with 'Nari Shakti Puraskar' who have performed exemplary tasks in different sectors in the past.
Today the country is moving forward from the path of Women development to women-led development.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
Hed said 'The idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence' - This idea of Swami ji about one hundred and twenty five years ago expresses the contemplation of woman power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure the participation of women in every field of life, be it social or economic life, it is our fundamental duty.
We are part of a tradition where men were identified due to women-Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Putra, these were identities of a son.
After all, our dream of 'New India' is the one where women are strong and empowered and are equal partners in the development of the country.
A few days ago, a gentleman had given me a very sound proposition.
There were about one lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water carriers, 10 thousand female cleaners and 50 thousand women masons were involved in this campaign.
You can imagine what a mammoth undertaking it was
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is an integral component of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will change the course of the campaign of cleanliness in general life, the effective role of hygiene in the nature of the people ingeneral.
My dear Brothers and sisters, I was just watching the TV news two days ago that electricity has reached three villages of the Elephanta island after 70 years of independence, and this has led to much joy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all know very well, that Elephanta is located 10 kms by the sea from Mumbai.
For 70 years, the lives of the denizens of three villages of the Elephanta Island, Rajbunder, Morbandar and Centabandar, were engulfed by darkness, which has got dispelled now and there is brightness in their lives.
I congratulate the administration and the populace there.
I am glad that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lighted due to electrification.
This is not just electricity, but a new beginning of a period of development.
There is no greater contentment and joy than the fact that the lives of the countrymen be full of shine and there be happiness in their lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
And now the month of March beckons us with ripe crops in the fields, playful golden earrings of wheat and the captivating blossom of mango pleasing to the mind are the highlights of this month.
But this month is also very special to all of us because of the festival of Holi.
On 2nd March the entire country immersed in joy will celebrate the festival of Holi.
In The festival of Holi, the importance of colors is as important as the ceremony of 'HolikaDahan' because it is the day when we burn our inherent vices in the fire.
I wish and hope that this festival forever remains a festival of colourful cheer in the lives of all the countrymen- this is my wish.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first episode of Mann Ki Baat in the year 2018.
Just a couple of days ago, we celebrated our Republic Day festival with gaiety fervour.
This is the very first time in history that heads of 10 Nations attended the ceremony.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathi has written a rather long letter on the Narendra Modi App, urging me to touch upon the subjects he has referred to.
Its a matter of joy that women in India are taking rapid strides of advancement in all fields, bringing glory to the Nation.
In our country, respect for women, their status in society and their contribution has proved to be awe inspiring to the entire world, since ancient times.
There has been a long tradition of Vidushis...
Many Vidushis of India have contributed in composing the verses of the Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee... its a long list of names.
This woman power binds closely together society as a whole, the family as a whole, on the axis of unity oneness.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee be it the learning devotion of Akka Mahadevi or Meerabai, be it the governance of Ahilyabai Holkar or the valour of Rani Lakshmibai, woman power has always inspired us. They have always brought glory to the Nation.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi has further cited some examples.
He writes that the flight of our courageous Defence Minister Nirmala Seetharaman in a Sukhoi 30 fighter plane is inspirational for him.
Three braveheart women Bhavna Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become fighter pilots and are undergoing training on the Sukhoi- 30.
A few days ago, Honble President took an initiative.
He met a group of extraordinary women who have achieved something significanty new in their respective fields. Women achievers of our country...
Our woman power achieved extraordinary feats, breaking the age old shackles of social mores, creating new records.
They proved that through perseverance, grit and a firm resolve, all kinds of obstacles and barriers can be broken crossed, to chart out an all new path...
a path that could act as a beacon of inspiration not just to their contemporaries, but for generations to come.
This is also available as an e-book on the Narendra Modi Website.
The countrys woman power has contributed a lot in the positive transformation being witnessed in our country society these days.
Today, as we speak of women empowerment, I would like to refer to a railway station.
You must be wondering what a railway station has got to do with women empowerment.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India which is run by an all woman staff.
All departments have women performing duties...
This time, after watching the Republic Day Parade, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media that a major highlight of the parade was the BSF biker contingent comprising women participants.
Daredevil stunts performed by them was awe inspiring for our foreign guests.
Empowerment is another form of self reliance.
Today our Nari Shakti is assuming leadership roles.
It is becoming self reliant.
But the woman power of Chattisgarh, the tribal women there broke this stereotype presented an all new picture of themselves.
Dantewada in Chattisgarh is a Maoist infested region.
Violence, torture, explosives, guns, pistols... the Maoists have created a scary reign of terror.
In this dangerous atmosphere, Adivasi women are becoming self reliant by driving e-rickshaws.
The benchmark of any living society is its self correcting mechanism.
In our country, there have been unending endeavours against social ills and evil practices, both individually collectively.
Just a while ago, Bihar launched an interesting initiative.
In order to uproot social ills in the state, the worlds longest human chain spanning over thirteen thousand kilometers was formed.
This campaign made people aware of social maladies such as child-marriage and the dowry system.
The entire state thus resolved to fight against these social evils.
Children, the elderly, the youth full of energy and enthusiasm, women, girls turned out to participate in this battle.
The human chain that commenced formation from Gandhi Maidan in Patna gained momentum, touching the state borders.
In order to ensure that the fruits of progress rightly reach all sections of society, it is imperative that our society is freed of these ills.
Come, let us pledge to come together to wipe out these evil customs from our social fabric... let us build an empowered, capable New India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister, the administration, in fact every member of the human chain for this massive, special initiative towards social welfare.
But now that hes come to know of the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, he has begun purchasing medicines from there and his expenses have been reduced by about 75.
This is great help for the common man, especially for senior citizens who require medicines on a daily basis and results in a lot of savings.
Generic medicines sold under this scheme strictly conform to prescribed standards set by the World Health Organisation.
That is why good quality medicines are made available at affordable prices.
Today, over three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This has led to not only availability of cheaper medicines, but also new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are now available at Amrit Stores at Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jan Aushadhi Centres at hospitals.
The sole aim behind this step is ensuring availability of uality affordable health service to the poorest of the poor, so that a healthy prosperous India comes into being.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
It was such a striking photo that my attention was magnetically drawn towards it.
The photo showed that a grandson was participating in the 'Clean Morna River' along with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organized a cleanliness campaign to clean the Morna river under the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan'.
The second painful fact was that the river was completely filled with wild grass and hyacinth.
A lot of garbage was being dumped into the river and along its banks.
An action plan was chalked out and on January 13th a day before Makar-Sankranti, in the first phase of 'Mission Clean Morna' sanitation of the two sides of the bank of the Morna river at fourteen places spread over an area of four kilometers, was carried out.
On January 20th, 2018, this Sanitation Campaign continued in the same vein and Ive been told that this campaign will continue every Saturday morning till the Morna river is completely cleaned.
'Mission Clean Morna' shows that if a person is determined to do something, then nothing is impossible.
Huge social reforms can be brought about through mass movements.
My dear countrymen, these days you must be hearing a lot about the Padma Awards.
There was a certain methodology of awarding Padma Awards every year, but this entire process has been changed for the past three years.
Now any citizen can nominate any person in our country.
Transparency has been brought about in the entire process by making it operable online.
Now the identity of the awardee is not the deciding factor of the award, rather the importance of his work is increasing.
You must have heard the name of Arvind Gupta ji.
It will gladden your heart to know, that Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent all his life creating toys for children.
He has been trying to get children inspired to conduct scientific experiments using waste
towards this end he has been encouraging children by showing them films made in 18 languages in three thousand schools across the country.
A similar story is that of Sitavaa Jodatti from Karnataka.
She has not been hailed as 'Goddess of women empowerment' just for nothing
For the past three decades, in Belagavi, she has made a great contribution towards changing the lives of countless women.
At the age of seven she had dedicated herself as a Devadasi but in a turnaround, for the welfare of the Devdasis, she has spent her entire life.
Not only this, she has done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women too.
You must have heard the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor tribal family.
He was employed in a small job for eking out his living, but he was also fond of painting in the traditional tribal art form.
Today, due to this hobby, he garnered respect not only in India but the entire world.
He has exhibited his paintings in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who made India proud in many nations abroad, was also recognized and he was awarded the Padma Shri.
She has created five hundred herbal medicines relying solely on her memory.
Identifying her anonymous persona, she has been honoured with the Padma Shri for her contribution to society.
I would like to mention another name today, that of 75 year old Subhasini Mistri, hailing from West Bengal, who was selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistri is a woman who, in order to construct a hospital, cleaned utensils in the homes of others and also sold vegetables.
At the age of 23 she lost her husband due to lack of proper treatment, and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in this hospital that has come up through hard-work.
The failure to identify such people is also a loss to the society, the Padma awards are only a medium of acknowledgement, but I would also like to tell the countrymen that people serving the society around us, people giving up all that they have got for the sake of society, millions of people who have worked for a life time for us bestowed with one or the other useful attribute should be acknowledged in our midst.
They do not labour for any honor, but their work inspires us.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas on January 9th every year.
It was on the 9th of January, when our revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond that exists between Indians in India and Indians living around the globe.
You will be pleased to know that in this programme, Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Surinam, South Africa and America, and many other countries wherever our Mayors or MPs of Indian Origin exist, all of them participated.
I would thus like to thank the European Union, for recognizing the people of Indian origin and through them in making people in India and people the world over aware of their exemplary work.
The 30th of January is the death anniversary of our revered Bapu, who showed us a new path.
The path of peace and non-violence, is the path of Bapu and this is applicable not only for India or the world, but also for a person or a family or a society.
Namaskar.
This is the last edition of Mann Ki Baat this year and its a coincidence that this day happens to be the last day of the year of 2017.
You and I shared many thoughts and ideas the entire year.
Your steady stream of letters to Mann Ki Baat, your comments, this exchange between minds always infuses new energy in me.
A few hours later, the year will change, but this sequence of our conversation will go on, just the way it is.
We will renew this exchange of thoughts on newer topics in the year to come, well share new experiences.
Heartiest New Year greetings to all of you.
Over the last few days, the festival of Christmas was celebrated across the world with gaiety and fervor.
The essence of the spirit of service can be felt in the Bible too.
The Son of Man has come, not to be servedBut to serveAnd to give his life, as blessingTo all humankind.
This conveys the immense significance attached to the sanctity of service.
Be it any religion, caste or creed, tradition or colour in this world the spirit of service is an invaluable hallmark of the highest human values.
In our country we refer to NishKaam Karma, selfless deeds, meaning a service done without any expectations.
It is mentioned in our land Sewa Parmo Dharmah...
Service to living beings is service to god. Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans used to cite, serve living beings as if worshipping the almighty.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The illustrious life of Guru Gobind Singh ji, full of instances of courage sacrifice is a source of inspiration to all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached the virtues of sublime human values and at the same time, practiced them in his own life in letter spirit.
A guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, Guru Gobind Singh ji, in all these roles, performed the great task of inspiring people.
He fought against oppression injustice.
His teachings to people focused on breaking the cordons of caste and religion.
In this endeavour, he stood to lose a lot on his personal front.
But he never let antagonism raise its ugly head in his path.
In every moment of his life, the message of love, sacrifice peace was palpable.
His personality was filled to the brim with the greatest of virtues.
Im fortunate that at the beginning of this year, I got an opportunity to participate in the 350th birth anniversary celebration organized at Patna Sahib.
The 1st of January, 2018, i.
Youll be surprised, since the New Year comes every year, the 1st of January arrives every year
But, when I refer to it as special, I really mean it as special.
I congratulate our youth urge them to register themselves as voters.
The entire nation is eager to welcome you as voters of the 21st century.
As voters of this century, you too must be feeling proud.
Your vote will prove to be the bedrock of New India.
The power of the vote is the greatest strength of a democracy.
The vote is the most effective tool in bringing about a positive change in the lives of millions of people.
And its not just about you acquiring the right to Vote.
Its about you determining deciding the course of the nation in the 21st century, your dreams in the India of the 21st century.
You too can be the makers of 21st century India and this opportunity comes into being, very specially, on the 1st of January.
I firmly believe that the dream of our New India will be realized through the skill fortitude of these energetic youth.
When we talk of new India then that new India will be free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption
free from filth and poverty.
New India will be a place where peace, unity and amity will be our guiding force.
My New India Youth should come forward and deliberate on how this New India would be formed.
One should decide ones own path and also decide a way for connecting along those attached to one and the Caravan should get going.
You should move forward and thus should the country move ahead.
Right now, while taking to you I got an idea whether we could organize a mock parliament in every district of India
Where the youth between 18 and 25 could sit together and brain storm about new India, find ways and chalk our plans.
How could we realize our resolves before 2022
How could we build an India of the dreams of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom movement into a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is that we build up a mass movement for making a magnificent- glorious 21st century India
Today, a lot of new opportunities have been created for the youth.
Our youth are coming forward in areas like skill development, innovation and entrepreneurship and are achieving success.
I wish that the New India Youth get information and details of all these new opportunities and plans at one place and a system be created so that every young person on turning 18 should automatically get to know all this and benefit from it.
My dear countrymen, I had talked about positivity during the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Nothing is impossible for a man having positivity and zeal.
In English too, it is said, Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power. During the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen to share their positive moments of 2017 and to welcome 2018 in a positive atmosphere.
I am very glad that a large number of people gave positive responses on social media platform, MyGov and the Narendra Modi App and shared their experiences.
Some people even shared their personal achievements.
SOUND BITE My name is Meenu Bhatia.
I reside in Mayur Vihar, Pocket-1, Phase- I, Delhi.
My daughter wanted to do M.
B.
A.
I needed to take a bank loan which I got very easily and my daughter was able to continue her studies.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Waade.
I am speaking from Bodal.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
A national highway has been constructed in 2017 through our village Bhinnar.
As a result of this, our roads have improved a lot and business there will surely get a boost.
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja.
I live in Mohalla Saadatganj, district Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bewani.
We had a problem of water scarcity in our area and we used to depend on an army pipeline for the last forty years.
Now an Independent pipeline has been constructed.
Let us enter into the New Year with such little achievements, begin our New Year and take a concrete steps in the journey from Positive India to Progressive India.
When we all talk of positivity, I also feel like sharing one experience.
Recently, I came to know about the inspiring story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak who is a topper in Kashmir Administrative Service Examination.
He actually extricated himself from the sting of terrorism and hatred and topped in the Kashmir Administrative Examination.
He overcame the adverse situation and scripted his own success story.
Today, he has become a source of inspiration not only in Jammu Kashmir but for the youth of the whole country.
Anjum has proved that however adverse the circumstances be, the clouds of despair and disappointment can easily be cleared by taking positive steps.
Just last week, I had a chance of meeting some daughters of Jammu Kashmir.
I was amazed at the spirit that they had, the enthusiasm that was there in their hearts and the dreams they nurtured.
I was listening to them on how they wanted to make progress in various facets of life and, how their lives were filled with hope.
I talked to them, there was no sign of despair
there was only enthusiasm, optimism, energy, dreams and a sense of resolve.
Whatever little time I spent with these daughters, I got inspired myself.
These are the strength of our nation, they are my youth, they are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a reference to famous religious places, not only of India but of the whole world, it is very natural to mention about the Sabrimala temple of Kerala.
Millions of devotees come to this world famous temple, seeking blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami.
One police officer P.
No one is big or small in this campaign.
Every devotee considers doing physical labour in the cleanliness drive as a part of the Lords worship.
However big a celebrity be, or however rich one might be or however high an official be each one contributes as an ordinary devotee in this Punyan Poonkavanam programme and becomes a part of this cleanliness drive.
There are many such examples before us.
Here, a strong resolve of maintaining cleanliness also is as important as the strict discipline observed during worship.
My dear countrymen, all of us made a resolve on Bapus birth anniversary on October 2, 2014 to take forward Bapus unfinished task of building a Clean India and a filth- free India.
Efforts in the direction of cleanliness are being widely taken across the whole country.
A change can now be seen in the form of public participation in rural and urban areas alike.
Cleanliness Survey 2018, the largest in the world, will be conducted from the 4th of January to 10th of March, 2018 to evaluate achievements in cleanliness level of our urban areas.
This survey will cover a population of more than 40 crores in more than four thousand cities.
During this survey, the matters to be surveyed include freedom from defecation in the open in cities, collection of garbage, transport facilities to lift garbage, processing of garbage using scientific methods, efforts to usher in behavioural changes, innovative steps taken for capacity building to maintain cleanliness and public participation in this campaign.
Separate teams will go to cities for inspection.
They will talk to the people there and gather their reactions.
They will analyse the use of the Cleanliness App and also about bringing reforms and improvements in various kinds of service centres.
It is not for the government alone to maintain cleanliness.
Every citizen and peoples organizations have a big responsibility.
And I appeal to every citizen to actively participate in the Cleanliness Survey to be undertaken in the coming days.
And take the full onus to ensure that your city should not lag behind and your street or mohalla should not look to be wanting.
I am very sure that using blue and green dustbins to collect dry and wet garbage respectively must have become your habit by now.
For waste- collection the principle of reduce, reuse and re-cycle is very effective.
Now ranking of cities will be done on the basis of this survey- if your city has a population of more than one lakh, ranking will be done on the national level and if the population of your city is less than one lakh than it will be ranked on regional level.
Achieving the highest ranking must be your dream and you should put all out efforts in this direction.
And all of you must have a dream Our city our efforts, Our progress countrys progress.
Let us all, once again remembering revered Bapu and taking a resolve to build a Clean India, put in our best endeavours.
My dear countrymen, there are a few things which appear small but they have a far reaching impact on our image as a society.
Today, in this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you.
It has come to our notice that if a Muslim woman wants to go on Haj Pilgrimage, she must have a Mehram or a male guardian, otherwise she cannot travel.
Even in many Islamic countries this practice does not exist.
But Muslim women in India did not have this right.
And I'm glad that our government paid heed to this matter.
I not only reiterate this wholeheartedly but it is my firm belief that the journey of Indias progress has been possible due to women-power and on the basis of their talent and we will continue to march onwards on this path of progress.
It should be our constant endeavor that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities just like men get so that they can proceed simultaneously on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for all of us.
But 26th January, 2018, will especially be remembered through the ages.
The Republic Day will be celebrated with leaders of all ten ASEAN countries coming to India as Chief Guests.
This time, not one but Ten chief guests would grace the Republic Day.
The year 2017 has been special for both ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years of formation in 2017 and in 2017 25 years of India's partnership with ASEAN were completed.
On 26th January the arrival of great leaders of 10 nations of the world as a unit is a matter of pride for all Indians.
My Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, by the way our country is a country of festivals.
There is hardly a day which does not have a festival ascribed to it.
May the New Year bring greater happiness, glad tidings and prosperity for all of you.
Let us move forward with all renewed zeal, enthusiasm, fervor and new resolve.
The month of January is the period of the northward movement of the Earth on the celestial orbit around sun and in this month Makar-Sankranti is also celebrated.
In Rajasthan, it is called Sankrant, Magh-bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu - all these festivals are special in their own right and they have their own importance.
All of these festivals are usually celebrated between 13th and 17thJanuary.
I Thank you my dear countrymen.
We shall converse again in 2018.
There must be hardly an Indian citizen who does not show deep regard for her, does not revere her.
She is elder to most of us and has been a witness to myriad phases, different eras the country has passed through.
Before leaving on the foreign tour, I was blessed with an opportunity to converse with her on the phone.
This chat was akin to a younger brother speaking to his elder sister affectionately.
I usually refrain from sharing such personal conversations
Listen to it for yourself how Lata Didi is earnestly concerned and eager about everything concerning the country.
the India on the path of change the India that is gaining newer heights.
Modi Ji : Lata Didi, Pranaam.
This is Narendra Modi speaking.
Lata Didi: I was touched when I came to know that you would be giving me a call.
Lata Didi: Okay, Okay.
Whats there to celebrate on a Birthday
Your attainment through your glorious achievements are the result of your perseverance, your Sadhana Tapasya.
I am a nobody.
Lata Didi: Yes.
I keep getting your letters and gifts as well.
I do not wish to trouble you further, since I can see how busy you are with myriad pressures on the work front. There are so many things that you have to think of.
Modi Ji : Your affection made Mother very happy.
Modi Ji : But I could not be there because of paucity of time.
The ensuing weeks shall be witness to the sparkle of festivals throughout the country.
Homes will be filled with joy
you must have felt this... there are many people around us who remain deprived of these celebrations.
And this is what is termed as Chiragh Tale Andhera, darkness just beneath the lamp
Perhaps this adage is not just a set of words for us, it is an order a philosophical thought, or an inspiration.
On the one hand, when we experience the Delivery In of sweetmeats, apparel, gifts and so on, let us think for a moment on the process of Delivery Out.
At least in our homes, items that are in excess and thus, not required anymore, could be allocated for Delivery Out.
In many cities, many NGOs run by young friends have formed Start ups for this endeavor.
They collect clothes, sweets, food from homes, look for the needy and hand them over discreetly.
The smiles thus accrued on the faces of numerous underprivileged families will more than double your joy during festivals... your faces will be lit up with a glow that will brighten your Diwali immensely.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi, the goddess of wealth, makes an entry into each and every household in the form of fortune and prosperity.
Can we, this time, introduce a novelty in welcoming her
In our culture, daughters are considered Laxmi, since they are harbinger of fortune and prosperity.
Can we, this time around in society, organize programmes to felicitate daughters in villages, towns and cities
This Diwali, can we arrange programmes to honor the Laxmi of India
If you look around, youll find many daughters and daughters-in-law who are performing extraordinarily.
Some must be engaged in teaching underprivileged children, others could be occupied in spreading awareness in the field of sanitation and health, while many could be doing society a service by working as Doctor and Engineers. Or striving for justice to someone by working as Lawyer
Our society must recognize such daughters, honor them and feel proud of them.
Programmes to felicitate them should be held throughout the country.
We could do something more
we could highlight the achievements of these daughters by sharing their achievements on social media, using the hashtag BHARAT KI LAMI.
The way we jointly ran a mega campaign Selfi with daughter, which spread globally. Similarly, this time, let us do a campaign BHARAT KI LAMI.
Encouraging the Laxmi of Bharat amounts to strengthening the paths of prosperity for the country and her citizens.
My dear countrymen, as I have mentioned earlier, a great advantage of Mann Ki Baat is that, Im blessed with the opportunity to converse with a lot of people, known or unknown, directly or indirectly.
A few days ago, AleenaTaayang, a student from far off Arunachal has written an interesting letter to me. And the contents are...
I hail from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
On my exam result this time, some people asked me if I had read the book Exam Warriors
I replied in the negative.
But on returning, I purchased the book and read it more than twice.
My experience after that has been very good.
I felt, had I read the book before my exams, I wouldve benefitted a great deal.
if you are thinking anew on a new edition, do include a few mantras for parents and teachers and of course new content.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors more than twice and special thanks for pointing out shortcomings in the book.
At the same time, my little friend has entrusted me with a task, in fact there are orders for me.
I shall certainly comply with your directions.
As you have told me, I shall positively try to write something for parents as well as teachers, as and when I get the time to pen a new edition.
But I urge all of you... can you be of help to me
It is about experiences in your daily lives.
Once again, I express my gratitude to our little friend, student Aleena Taayang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you update yourselves with the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and television, you even discuss the engagements.
But, I hope you are aware that I am just as common a being as you are. Being an ordinary citizen, whatever affects you has the same effect on me, since Im just one amongst you.
Hence I too heard the speech and watched the match.
It surely stirred me. Moments before this speech, he had suffered defeat at the hands of Tennis legend Rafael Nadal, 19 times grand slam winner.
Spectators welcomed his reflections with warmth and fervor.
He also touched upon Nadal being the inspiring force in Tennis for millions of young people, adding how difficult it was to face him in the game.
The way Medvedev heaped praise on his opponent after a defeat in a fierce duel makes him a living example of the true essence of the spirit of sportsmanship.
Of course, on the other hand champion Nadal too showered glowing praise on Daniils game.
It holds much for people across the age and class spectra to see and learn.
These are moments that go way beyond winning and losing, wherevictory and defeat cease to be.
The wisdom of our ancestors is truly praiseworthy.
Our ancient texts observe: : Meaning, when ability and humility amalgamate in a person, whose heart will he not be able to win over
As a matter of fact, this young player has won the hearts of people across the globe.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I am going to tellyou now is directly for your benefit.
Discourses and debates will continue, the support and opposition will continue, but, if some things are checked before they proliferate, then there is a huge benefit.
Things that spawn and spread a lot are very difficult to stop at later stages.
But, if we become aware at an early stage and put a stop to it, then a lot can be saved.
Continuing in the same vein, I feel, today, that I should definitely have a talk with my young friends.
We all know that addiction to, tobaccois very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit this addiction.
Tobacco intoxication occurs due to the nicotine present in it.
Brain development is hampered by its consumption during adolescence.
But, today, I want to have a discourse with you on a new topic.
You must be knowing that, recently the e-cigarette got banned in India.
An e-cigarette is a type of electronic device unlike a typical cigarette.
In ane-cigarette, theheating of nicotine-containing fluids creates a type of chemical smoke and this is the pathway through which nicotine is consumed.
While we all understand the dangers of common cigarettes, a misconception has been generated about e-cigarettes. The myth that has been spread is that e-cigarettes pose no danger.
Like the conventional cigarette, it does not spread odour as fragrant chemicals are added to it.
We have seen around us, that, even if the father in any house is a chain smoker, still he tries to stop the rest of the household from smoking and wants his children not to fall prey to the habit of cigarettes or bidis.
But the case of e-cigarettes is quite different.
You are aware of the fact that when someone smokes around us, we come to know about it through its odour.
Even if there is a packet of cigarettes in someones pocket, the smell can be detected.
However, this is not the case with an e-cigarette and many teenagers and young people, unknowingly and sometimes proudly displaying an e-cigaretteas a fashion statement, keep itbetwixt their books, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes hold it in their hands and thus fall prey to it.
The younger generation is the future of our country.
The e-cigarette has been banned so that this new form of intoxication does not destroy our demographically young country.
It does not trample the dreams of a family and waste the lives of our children. This scourge and this obnoxious habit should not become rooted in our society.
I urge all of you to quit the addiction to tobacco and do not harbour any misconceptions about e-cigarettes.
Come, let us all build a healthy India.
Do you still remember Fit India
Fit India does not mean that if we go to the gym for two hours every morning and evening, it will suffice
All these addictions have to be avoided to be a part of Fit India.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great providence that our India has been the birthplace and work-place of extraordinary denizens, who spent all their lives, not for themselves, but for the good of the society.
Many gems of human beings took birth here. India has not only been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, but also the land of their karma. And these are the people who have spent themselves in service of others.
One such illustrious Indian is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that, on the coming 13thOctober, His Holiness Pope Francis will declare Sister MariamThresia a saint.
Sister MariamThresia, in her short lifespan of 50 years, worked for the good of humanity becominganoble example for the entire world.
She rendered service in the fields of education and social service.
She had built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and throughout her life, remained devoted to this cause.
She founded the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Family which is still continuing on the path of her lifes philosophy and mission.
I once again pay heart felt tributes to Sister MariamThresia and congratulate the citizens of India, and especially our Christian brothers and sisters, for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world today, while we are celebrating Gandhi 150, our 130 crore countrymen have pledged to be rid from the menace of Single Use Plastic.
In view of the kind of lead that India has taken towards environmental protection, today the countries of the entire world are looking towards India as a model example.
I am confident that you will all be a part of the campaign for liberation from the menace of Single Use Plastic on 2ndOctober.
In India, citizens are contributing in this campaign in their own way. But, a young man from our country has initiated a very unique campaign.
My attention was drawn towards his work, so, I talked to him on the phone and tried to understand the new experiment being attempted by him.
It could be that this attempt of his may work for other people of our country. Mr.
RipudamanBelviji is making an unique effort by attemptingplogging
When I first encountered the term Plogging, it was novel even to me.
You have designed this entire programme in a very innovative manner, in a way that it will be liked, especially by young people.
Heartiest congratulation to you.
And friends this time on the anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports too is organizing a Fit India Plogging Run.
On the 2nd of October, plogging for two kilometers
and it will be held across the country.
We heard through the experiences of Ripudaman Ji, how this programme should be organised
This campaign is resulting in raising awareness levels in people as far as sanitation and cleanliness, along with fitness levels.
I do believe that a single step towards freedom from single use plastic taken by 130 crore countrymen will give India a lead by a 130 crore steps.
Ripudaman ji, once again, many thanks to you.
And to your team, and your imaginative, innovative bent of mind, heartiest congratulations from my side.
I would like to remind you one thing in advance.
Although in the next episode of 'Mann Ki Baat' I shall dwell upon it in detail, still today I am telling this ina advance so that you get time to prepare.
You do remember that, 31stOctober is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and that Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat is our common dream
So, better start preparing from this instant onwards
I shall talk about it in detail later, but right now we have time on our hands
some people can begin their practice, whereas some can chalk out a plan.
My dear countrymen, you will remember, that on 15 August, I had in my address said from the ramparts of Red Fort that by 2022, you should visit 15 tourist destinations in India.
At least 15 places and if possible, make a program to stay over there for an over night, two-night stay.
You should observe, understand and experience India.
We have so much diversity.
And when holidays come in the shape of Diwali and allied festivals, people do travel and that's why I urge you to visit any 15 such places in India.
My dear countrymen, the 27th of September, two days prior to today, was celebrated as World Tourism Day and you will be happy to know that certain reputed tourism agencies of the world which rank standards of travel tourism have shown that India has displayed a lot of improvement in the Travel Tourism Competitive Index.
And all this has been possible due to your cooperation and especially because understanding the importance of tourism has increased.
If we tried all that harder, then by the 75th year of our independence, we would have carved a place for ourselves amidst the major tourist destinations of the world.
Whatever precautions or preventive care is to be taken, should be taken during Diwali.
Happiness should co-exist with joy, and of course there must also be enthusiasm and our festivals do indeed bring the aroma of collectiveness, and also the rituals connected with communal harmony.
My dear countrymen, namaskar
A while ago, I had a chance to have an indirect dialogue, with young friends from Karnataka.
The Times Group Newspaper Vijaya Karnataka started a new initiative urging the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
And if we impart knowledge about nature to our children then in future they may prove very useful in protecting the environment.
A child Reeda Nadaf from Laxmeshwara has written that she is the daughter of an army man and feels proud of being so.
Which Indian would not be proud of our soldiers
And, you being a soldier daughter should naturally take pride in that.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has written that her school is 5 Kilometres away from her village and she has to start early in the morning and it gets quite late in the evening by the time she returns home.
She says that as such she does not find time to spend with her friends and has suggested that there should be a school nearby.
But, my countrymen, I liked this initiative taken by a newspaper that helped these letters reach me and I got an opportunity to go through these.
This was a very good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
The 26th of November is our Constitution Day.
The Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on this day in the year nineteen forty-nine.
Our constitution was implemented on the 26th of January, 1950 which we celebrate as our Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the spirit of our democracy.
This is the day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They all worked hard for about three years to draft the Constitution.
There probably is no area, no aspect of nature which remained untouched.
Equality for all and sensitivity towards all is the unique characteristic of our Constitution.
It is our duty that we abide by our Constitution in letter and spirit.
Citizens and administrators alike must move ahead in accordance with the spirit of our Constitution.
The message that our Constitution conveys is that no one should be harmed in any way.
Seventeen separate committees were constituted by the Constituent Assembly on various important issues.
One of most significant of these was the drafting committee and Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of this drafting committee.
He was playing a pivotal role in it.
He ensured the welfare of every section of society.
We remember him and bow before him on his Mahaparinirvan Diwas on 6th of December.
Babasahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and strong can never be forgotten.
15th of December is the death anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Sardar Patel rose from being a farmers son to be known as the Iron Man of the country, undertaking the extraordinary task of uniting India into one nation.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on fundamental rights, minorities and tribals.
2611 is our Constitution Day but how can the nation forget that on this very day nine years ago, terrorists had launched an attack on Mumbai.
The country remembers and bows to those brave citizens, policemen, security men and each one who lost their lives then.
This country can never forget their sacrifice.
It is bent upon destroying the humanitarian forces.
So, not only India but all humanitarian forces will have to keep fighting unitedly to defeat the menace of terrorism.
Lord Budha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi this is the land which gave the message of love and non-violence to the world.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to weaken and destroy our social fabric.
That is why, the need of the hour is that humanitarian forces should become more alert and cautious.
My dear countrymen, we shall observe Navy Day on the 4th of December.
Indian Navy secures and protects our maritime boundaries.
I congratulate all those who belong to the Navy.
All of you must be knowing that our civilization developed along river banks.
Be it the Indus, the Ganges, the Yamuna or the Saraswati our rivers and seas are both economically and strategically important.
These are our gateway to the whole world.
This country, our land has an unbreakable bond with oceans.
And as we peep into our history, we come to know that about 800 to 900 (eight to nine hundred) years ago, during the rule of the Cholas, the Chola Navy was considered one of the strongest navies.
This navy had a big role in the expansion of the Chola-rule and in making it an economic super power.
Numerous references of voyages and expeditions of the Chola-Navy are found even today in Sangam - literature.
Very few people might be aware that most navies of the world allowed women on their warships pretty later.
But in the Chola Navy, a large number of women played leading roles and that too about eight to nine hundred years ago
to the extent that women actively took part in battles.
The Chola rulers possessed a very rich and sound knowledge of ship building.
When we talk of navy, who can ignore Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the capabilities might of his navy.
Konkan coast, where the sea has a significant role, was under Shivaji Maharajs realm.
Many forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Swarn Durg, etc were either situated on the sea coast or were encircled by sea.
The security of these forts was the responsibility of the Maratha Navy.
There was a combination of large ships and small boats in the Maratha Navy.
His naval forces were very efficient and skilled in attacking the enemy and in defending their attacks.
And how can we refer to the Maratha Navy and not remember Kanhoji Aangre
He took the Maratha Navy to newer heights and established Maratha Naval Bases at a number of places.
After Independence, our Indian Navy showed its valour on various occasions
be it the liberation struggle of Goa or the Indo-Pak war.
many fishermen were rescued from the sea and handed over to Bangladesh.
In May-June this year when there was a severe flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our navy reached there immediately and helped the government and the people there.
In September, during the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh, our naval ship INS GHADIYAL delivered humanitarian assistance there.
The Government of Papua New Guinea sent an SOS-message to us in June and our navy rendered help in saving the fishermen of a fishing boat.
On 21st November, during an incident of piracy in a merchant vessel in the Western Gulf, our naval ship INS TRIKAND reached there to help them.
I am happy that the Ministry of Defence has decided to run a campaign from December 1 to December 7 during which they will reach out to the people of the country to disseminate information about our ARMED FORCES and to make them aware.
Throughout the week every one, old or young, should wear the flag.
A movement to instill respect for our forces will come into being in the country.
We can distribute ARMED FORCES FLAGS on this occasion.
Experiences and acts of valour of those from the armed forces who are our neighbours or acquaintances and related videos and pictures can be posted on hash-tag armed forces flag day (armedforcesflagday).
People from the forces could be invited to schools and colleges to share information about the forces.
Our new generation can get a good opportunity to get information about the forces.
This is also an occasion to collect funds for the welfare of the jawans of our armed forces.
This amount is spent through the Sainik Kalyan Board on the dependents of those who lost their lives and also for those who got injured during wars, for their rehabilitation.
Come, let us do something on this occasion which may raise the morale of our armed forces.
We should also contribute towards their welfare.
My dear countrymen, World Soil Day is on the 5th of December.
I want to tell something to my farmer brothers and sisters.
An important component of the Earth is soil.
Whatever we eat is linked only to this soil.
In a way, the complete food chain is connected to soil.
Just imagine, what will happen if there is no fertile soil in the world
How will animals and birds survive
This concern was touched upon a long time ago in our culture and that is why we are aware of the significance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, there has been efforts to foster a feeling of devotion and gratitude towards our farms, our soil among the people and at the same time scientific farming methods and techniques have been adopted which provide nutrients to the soil.
In the life of the farmer of this country both aspects have been important- reverence to his soil and preserving nurturing it scientifically.
We all feel proud of the fact that the farmers of our country are rooted to traditions and also take interest in modern science, they keep trying and resolve.
I had heard about the farmers, of Tohoo village in Bhoranj block of Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh.
Farmers here were earlier using chemical fertilizers indiscriminately which deteriorated the soil-health.
Produce reduced which resulted in lower income and gradually the productivity of the soil also was going down.
Some enlightened and alert farmers in the village noticed and understood the gravity of the situation, and after that got their soil tested on time and followed the advice about the quantity of fertilizers, micro-nutrients and organic fertilizers to be used.
And, you will be surprised to know about the results achieved after the farmers received the information and guidelines about soil health.
In the Rabi season of 2016-17, wheat production per acre increased three to four times and their income also increased by four to six thousand rupees per acre.
And, now the farmer also realizes that proper soil care is needed if production is to be increased and that if we take care of our soil, it will also care for all of us.
Our farmers across the country have got more than 10 crore soil health cards made so that they may understand their soil better and accordingly sow the crop.
We worship mother Earth but have we ever thought as to how much damage is caused to the health of our mother- Earth because of the usage of fertilizers like Urea
This has been proved by all scientific methods that a serious damage is caused because of an excessive use of urea.
The Farmer is the son of the soil, how can a farmer see the mother Earth falling sick
The need of the hour is to revive the mother-son relationship.
Can our farmers, the sons of our soil make a resolve that by the year 2022, when we complete 75 year of our independence, they will cut down the urea usage to half of what is being used presently
If this son of the soil, my farmer brother once make this resolve then we will see the health of mother Earth improve and production will increase.
A transformation shall start to usher into the life of the farmer.
All of us are experiencing Global warming, climate change now.
There was a time when winter would set in even before Diwali.
And now, December is knocking on our doors, yet winter is advancing at a leisurely pace.
But the moment winter sets in, we all have experienced that we dont like coming out of our quilts one bit.
Despite such inclement weather there are some extraordinarily aware people who deliver results that are exemplary and inspiring for all of us.
But his grit and determination were exponentially greater and mightier.
The eight year old is speech impaired, but he used a whistle as an armament.
He would wake up at 5 in the morning, visit households one by one, awaken them and used gesticulations to wean them away from Open defecation.
Covering 30 to 40 homes everyday, spreading the message of cleanliness, this boy transformed the village into Open defecation free.
We get to learn something or the other every moment.
They are performing well in every walk of life.
Whether it be the field of sports, any kind of competition or a social initiative, our Divyang brethren are second to none.
You must be aware that our Divyang sportspersons won 4 medals in the Rio Olympics through their stellar performances. They also emerged champions in the T-20 Cricket World Cup for the Visually Challenged.
Myriad competitions take place all over the country.
Recently, the 17th National Para-Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
One of them happens to be 19 year old Jigar Thakkar from Gujarat, whose body suffers from 80 muscle atrophy.
It is on account of this feat that he has been chosen as one of the 32 Para Swimmers for the 20-20 Paralympics by the Sports Authority of India.
They will be imparted training at the Centre for excellence at Gandhinagar in Gujarat.
I salute the spirit of the young Jigar Thakkar wish him the best.
A few days from now, the pious occasion of Id-e-milad-un-nabi will be observed.
Paighambar Hazrat Mohammad Sahab was born on this day.
I extend best wishes to all countrymen. And I hope that this holy occasion of Id gives us new inspiration, fresh energy and the strength to resolve anew, to foster peace communal amity.
(Phone call)'Hello Mr. Prime Minister, I am Neerja Singh calling from Kanpur.
I request you that out of the entire gamut of your thoughts reflected during the programme Mann Ki Baat throughout the year, if you could share ten of your best thoughts, so that we all remember these opinions and we get to learn something from them.
And you have given some sound advice.
But continuing from your point of view I feel like adding something more to it and modifying it a bit.
And as in our villages, our elders, the old people of the village are always reminding us - forget the sorrow but also do not forget the joy.
Whether they be conveyed through photographs, in the form of a small story, or as a small video, I invite all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a benefic atmosphere, with positive memories, with positive thinking and with positive tidings.
Come, let us share our positive experiences with PositiveIndia (Hashtag Positive India) on the Narendra Modi App or MyGov portal.
Remember to recollect the incidents that inspire others.
Let all of us together witness the strength of this collective momentum and its impact.
And I will definitely share the positive thoughts that arrive on positiveindia (hashtag positive India) with the rest of our denizens in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I will be back amidst you next month, with another episode of Mann Ki Baat.
We will have another opportunity to talk a lot.
Many - Many thanks
The mega festival of Chatth, celebrated 6 days after Diwali, is one of those festivals which are celebrated in accordance with strict rituals regimen.
In everything associated with it like cuisine or attire, traditional norms are adhered to.
The unique festival Chhath Pooja is deeply linked with nature worshipping nature.
Surya Jal The Sun Water are central to the veneration in Chhath, whereas utensils made of bamboo clay and tubers are an essential part of the Pooja articles.
the Chatth Pooja bestows upon us the sanskaar to respect revere those whose setting, whose dusk is imminent.
The expression of the significance of cleanliness in our lives is intrinsic to this festival.
Before the advent of Chatth, people come together to clean up their homes, and along with that cleansing of rivers, lakes, pond banks and pooja locations, that is ghats, with utmost enthusiasm fervour.
Sun worship or Chhath Pooja is a festival of protecting the environment, ushering in wellness and discipline.
Usually, people shy away from borrowing from others.
But in Chhath Pooja, it is specially customary to ask for Prasad after the morning Arghya ritual.
It is believed that the rationale behind this tradition is that, it destroys his ego that proves to be an impediment in ones path of progress.
It is natural for each one of us to feel proud of this great tradition of India.
But whenever I look at the overall outcome of Mann Ki Baat, it reinforces my belief, that it is intrinsically, inseparably woven into the warp weft of our common citizens lives, cent per cent.
Take the examples of Khadi and handloom.
On Gandhi Jayanti I have always advocated the use of handloom and Khadi. What has it led to
You will be glad to know that on the 17th of this month on the day of Dhanteras, the Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan store in Delhi witnessed a record sale of Rupees one crore, twenty lakhs.
You too must be feeling happy with a sense of satisfaction at this mega sale in just one Khadi Handloom store.
During Diwali, Khadi gift coupon sales recorded an overwhelming 680 per cent rise.
Compared to last year, the total sales of Khadi Handicrafts have risen almost by 90.
One can clearly see that today, the youth, the elderly, women, in fact every age group is taking to Khadi handloom.
I can imagine how many weaver families, poor families, and the families working on handlooms must have benefitted from this.
Khadi was Khadi foundation earlier and we talked of Khadi fashion but with my recent experience I can say that after Khadi for nation and Khadi for fashion now, it is becoming Khadi for transformation.
Khadi and handloom have transformed the lives of the poorest of the poor and are emerging as a powerful means of empowering them.
It is playing a very important role for gramodaya.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written on NarendramodiApp that he wants to know about my experience of celebrating Diwali with security forces and he also wants to know how the security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwad has also written on NarendramodiApp whether there could be an arrangement to send our homemade sweets to the security forces.
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that our homemade sweets must reach our countrys soldiers.
All of you must have celebrated Deepawali with traditional fervour.
To me, Diwali brought a special experience.
On behalf of all our countrymen, I salute every soldier of our security forces who guard the countrys borders with utmost dedication and a spirit of sacrifice, braving all odds.
Whenever we get a chance or whenever there is an opportunity we must try to know the experiences of our soldiers and listen to their tales of valour.
Many of us may not be aware that the jawans of our security forces play an important role not only on our borders but they play a very vital role in establishing peace the world over.
Everybody recalls the efforts and constructive role of the UN in establishing peace throughout the world.
And, we are believers in Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam which means the whole world is our family.
And with this belief, India has been cooperating very actively in various important initiatives taken by the UN.
You may be aware that the preface of the Indian Constitution and the preface of the UN Charter both start with the words We the people.
India has always stressed on the importance of equality for women and the UN Declaration of Human Rights is a living example of this.
In its initial phrase, it was proposed as all men are born free and equal which was amended and adopted as all human beings are born free and equal with the efforts of the Indian representative Hansa Mehta.
It appears to be a minor change but it reflects a vision of a healthy thought.
Indias most important contribution under the UN umbrella is its role in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
More than 18 thousand Indian security personnel have lent their services in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
Presently, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN Peacekeeping initiatives which is the third highest number of soldiers from any country.
Till August 2017, Indian soldiers had lent their services in about 50 of the total of 71 Peacekeeping operations undertaken by the UN the world over.
These operations have been carried out in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and many other parts of the world.
In Congo and Southern Sudan more than twenty thousand patients were treated in hospitals of the Indian army and countless lives were saved.
Indian security forces have not only saved people in various countries but also won their hearts with their people friendly operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peace keeping efforts.
Very few people may know that India was the first country which sent a female police unit to Liberia for the United Nations Peace Mission.
And see how this initiative from India became a big source of motivation for other countries too.
Later, all countries started sending their women police units.
You will surely feel proud to know that Indias contribution is not limited to just peacekeeping operations but it is also providing training to peacekeepers from about eighty five countries.
The brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Budha have sent a message of peace and amity around the world.
Peacekeeping operation is not an easy task.
Jawans from our security forces have to perform duties in difficult and remote areas.
Every Indian feels proud while remembering him.
He was the only UN peacekeeper, a brave-heart, who was awarded the Param Veer Chakra.
Lieutenant General Prem Chand ji is one among those Indian Peacekeepers who carved a special niche for themselves in Cyprus.
In 1989, at the age of 72, he was appointed the Force Commander for an operation in Namibia and he gave his services to ensure the Independence of that country.
General Thimaiyya, who had been Indias army chief, lead the UN Peacekeeping force in Cyprus and sacrificed everything for those peace efforts.
India has always been giving a message of peace, unity and harmony to the world.
We believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move ahead to carve a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our holy land has given great souls who selflessly served humanity.
Sister Nivedita, whom we also know as Bhagini Nivedita, was one such extraordinary person.
She was born in Ireland as Margret Elizabeth Noble but Swami Vivekanand gave her the name NIVEDITA.
And Nivedita means the one who is fully dedicated.
She later proved herself true to her name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
She was so impressed by Swami Vivekanand that she renounced her happy- prosperous life and dedicated herself to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita felt very hurt by the atrocities of the British rule.
The Britishers not only made us slaves but they tried to enslave us mentally as well.
Constant efforts to belittle our culture and make us feel inferior were on.
Bhagini Nivedita ji revived the dignity and pride of Indian culture.
She brought the people together by infusing a sense of national-awakening.
She travelled to various countries and raised her voice against the mischievous propaganda against Sanatan Dharma and ideology.
Renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanya Bharati is well known for his revolutionary poem Pudhumai Penn or New woman and is renowned for his efforts for Women empowerment.
It is said that Bhagini Nivedita was the inspiration.
Bhagini Nivedita ji also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
She helped publication of Basus research and publicity through her articles and conferences.
This is Indias unique beauty that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are a powerful testimony to this.
In 1899, plague broke out in Calcutta and hundreds of people lost their lives in no time.
Sister Nivedita, without caring for her health, started cleaning drains and roads.
She was a woman who could live a luxurious life but she dedicatedly worked for the poor.
Getting inspiration from her sacrifice, people came forward and joined her.
Through her work, she spread the message of the importance of cleanliness and service to mankind.
And, it is inscribed on her grave Here reposes Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India.
Undoubtedly, she did so.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, many felicitations to all the children on the occasion of Children's Day celebrated on the birthday of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
Children are the emerging heroes in the creation of new India.
Your concern is correct that the diseases which surfaced in old age, or emerged around the last lap of life - have started to appear in children nowadays.
Such diseases were very rare in young people.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders.
One of the main reasons for being afflicted with such diseases at a young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in our eating habits.
Society and the family need to pay attention towards this crisis.
If youll start paying attention to it, you will see that there is no need to do anything extraordinary.
You just need to make small regular changes in order to transform your habits, making them a part of your way of life.
The children can be made to take the stairs instead of taking the lift.
After dinner, the entire family can go for a walk with the children.
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga will be helpful for especially our young friends, in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and protecting them from lifestyle disorders.
It can also be practised at home and the specialty of Yoga is that it is easy, simple and accessible to all.
I am saying this because a person of any age can easily practise it.
It is simple because it can be easily learned and it is accessible, since it can be done anywhere.
No special tools or fields are needed.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, we have been getting glad tidings from the field of sports.
In different games, our athletes have made the country proud.
In hockey, India has won the Asia Cup hockey title through its dazzling performance.
Our players performed magnificently and on the basis of their sterling efforts, India has become the Asia Cup champion after an interval of ten years.
India had earlier won the Asia Cup in Hockey in the years 2003 and 2007.
I extend felicitations on behalf of the entire nation to the entire team and support staff.
After hockey, good news for India also came in badminton.
Badminton star Kidambi Srikanth has filled every Indians heart with pride by clinching the Denmark Open title with his excellent performance.
After Indonesia Open and Australia Open, this win has completed the triad of the super series premiere title.
Friends, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month.
Teams from all over the world came to India and all of them exhibited their skills on the football field.
I also got an opportunity to go and watch a match.
There was a lot of enthusiasm among the players and the spectators.
This world cup was a super event where the whole world was watching you.
Such a big spectacle, I was astounded to see the energy, enthusiasm, and zeal of all the young players.
The world cup was successfully organized and all the teams performed their best.
Regardless of the fact that India could not win the title, the young players of India won the hearts of everyone.
The whole world including India enjoyed this mega festival of sports and this whole tournament was both full of interest and entertainment for football lovers.
The signs that the future of football is very bright have started to appear.
I extend my congratulations and good wishes to all the players, their colleagues, and all the sports lovers once again.
My dear countrymen, a multitude of people write to me about Swachch Bharat, I feel that if I have to do justice to their feelings then I will have to do the program Mann Ki Baat every day and every day Mann Ki Baat will be dedicated solely to the subject of cleanliness.
Some listeners send photo graphs of the efforts undertaken by children whereas others mention the role of youth in these efforts.
Sometimes there is a story of an innovation to bring about cleanliness or winds of change that get ushered due to an officials zeal.
A few days ago I received a very detailed report highlighting the story of transformation of Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
An NGO called Ecological Protection Organization launched a cleanliness campaign in Chandrapur Fort.
In this campaign lasting for two hundred days, people performed the task of cleaning the fort, non-stop, without any fatigue and with team-work.
I was overwhelmed on seeing these and whoever will see these photographs, no matter how upset he is on witnessing the filth around him, and wondering how the mission of cleanliness will be fulfilled - then I have to tell such people that you can see for yourself the toil, resolve and determination of the members of the Ecological Protection Organization, in these living pictures.
Just on seeing these pictures, your disappointment will transform into hope.
My dear countrymen, well celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the 4th of November.
Guru Nanak Dev ji is not only the first guru of Sikhs hes guru to the entire world.
He envisioned the welfare of all humanity and considered all castes to be equal.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
Guru Nanak Dev ji undertook a 28 thousand kilometre journey on foot and throughout the journey spread the message of true humanity.
He entered into a dialogue with people and showed them the path of truth, sacrifice dedication.
He advocated the message of equality in society, not through mere words but through concrete endeavour.
He ran a LANGAR which sowed the seeds of the spirit of service amongst fellow beings.
Partaking of LANGAR together created a feeling of unity oneness in people.
Guru Nanak Dev ji voiced three messages for a meaningful, fulfilling life- Chant the name of the Almighty, work hard and help the needy.
In order to convey his ideals, Guru Nanak Dev ji composed the Gurbani.
Come 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th PRAKASH VARSH of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Come, let us try advance on the path of his ideals teachings.
My dear countrymen, we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji, two days from now, on the 31st of October.
All of us know that he was the one who laid the foundation stone of modern, unified India.
We can learn a lot from the unparalleled saga of this great son of Mother India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels speciality was that he not only put forth revolutionary ideas
he was immensely capable of devising practical solutions to the most complicated problems in the way.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took on the reins of weaving a unified India.
He ensured that millions of Indians were brought under the ambit of one nation one constitution.
His decision making ability infused in him the strength to overcome all obstacles.
Wherever respectful coercion was needed, he proceeded gently.
Wherever the use of force was imperative, he did not hesitate.
He set a definite goal and moved forward on its path with grit determination.
It was only he who could achieve this task of uniting India.
He conceived a nation where everyone was equal.
One ideal of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will always be inspiring to all of us.
He had said No division of caste or creed should be able to stop us, all are the sons daughters of India, all of us should love our country and we should carve out our destiny on the foundation of mutual love harmony.
These lofty ideals of Sardar Sahab are relevant to and inspiring for our vision for a New India, even today.
And that is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
I urge you to participate in Run for Unity, the festival of mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, you mustve returned to your respective routines after the Diwali vacation, with a new resolve, with a new determination.
May all your dreams come true, my best wishes to you.
Many many Thanks.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
It is now a full three years since I started speaking to you over Mann Ki Baat.
This is the 36th episode today.
Most of these are inspiring to me.
A large number of these ideas are regarding improvements in the functioning of our government.
There are personal grievances and complaints and sometimes attention is drawn to community problems.
I just take half an hour of your time in a month but people keep sending suggestions, ideas and other material over Mann Ki Baat during all 30 days of the month.
And, the result of this whole exercise is that the government has started realizing the sensitivities and powerful ideas of the people of far off places.
And, this is why the three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is in fact a journey of our countrymen, their emotions and their feelings.
I am thankful to our countrymen for having provided me an opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one sentence of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
He always used to say A- sarkari, Asarkari, meaning non government is effective.
I have also tried to focus on the people of the country in Mann Ki Baat, have kept it away from political hues tried to remain connected with you with a stable mind rather than being diverted by the heat of the moment or anguish.
I surely believe and feel that now after three years, social scientists, universities, research scholars, media experts would undertake its analysis and highlight its every aspect, positive as well as negative.
And I am sure that this brainstorming could be useful for Mann Ki Baat in future and will infuse a new energy into it.
And, in one episode of Mann Ki Baat I had said that while having our food, we must also be conscious of consuming only as much as we need and see to it that there is no wastage.
But, later, I received letters from all corners of the country.
Many social organizations and many youth are already observing this in practice.
I come to know about a lot many people who were involved in ensuring that leftover food was best utilized.
Once, I saw a selfie of a sarpanch with a daughter and referred to the same in Mann Ki Baat.
In no time, Selfie with Daughter became a big campaign not only in India but across the whole world.
This is not only an issue of social media.
It became an incident to create a new self-confidence and a feeling of self pride in every daughter.
I was in a meeting with the Tourism Department recently.
I asked people who were planning to go travelling that where-ever they visit Incredible India, they must send photographs of those places.
Lakhs of photographs from every corner of India were received which actually became a treasure for those working in the tourism sector.
Ive experienced through Mann Ki Baat that even a tiny incident can launch a massive campaign.
Today I felt like sharing it, since I thought that it has been three years, and events incidents over those three years ran across my mind.
The nation is always ready to move in the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the benefit of others, for social good, for the countrys progress.
This is what I gathered, learnt and understood from our countrymen during three years of the Mann Ki Baat campaign.
I heartily bow to my countrymen.
In one episode of Mann Ki Baat I had discussed about Khadi and Khadi is not a fabric but an idea, a principle.
I once again urge that we should try and take forward the Khadi movement.
We should follow the spirit of helping the poor to be able to light a Diwali lamp.
The poor of our country will derive strength from this and we must do it.
How do we bring in new technology, how do we increase productivity, how do we introduce looms driven by solar power
How do we rejuvenate our traditional heritage which was lying inactive for 20, 25 or 30 years
Sewapuri Khadi Ashram at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh was lying closed for 26 years but has got a fresh lease of life now.
A number of thoughts were implemented.
New employment opportunities were created for a number of people.
Khadi Gramodyog revived its training centre at Pampore in Kashmir and in this sector Kashmir has so much to offer.
With the reopening of this training centre, the new generation will get a boost in jobs in manufacturing , in weaving, in creating new things and it feels so good to see that even big corporate Houses have started including Khadi items as Diwali gifts.
Even people have started exchanging Khadi items as gifts.
We shall connect people through cleanliness.
Our Honourable President inaugurated this programme and the country got connected.
The old or the young, men or women, city or village everyone has become a part of this Cleanliness campaign now.
And when I say Sankalp Se Siddhi, we can see for ourselves as to how a Cleanliness Campagin is advancing towards Sankalp Siddhi, that is Attainment through Reslove.
Everyone accepts this, co-operates in this and makes a contribution in realizing this.
I am grateful to our Honourable President.
But, every section of society has taken this as its own campaign, everyone has got connected to this.
It is a good thing and I am pleased to know that just in the first four days of Swachhata Hi Sewa Abhiyan more than 75 lakh people joined these activities with more than 40 thousand initiatives. I have seen that some people are continuously working and are determined to bring out results.
I noticed something else this time one is that we clean up a place, and the second is that we become aware and do not spread filth but if we have to inculcate cleanliness as a habit, we must start an idea- based movement also.
This time a number of competitions were organized on the theme Cleanliness is Service.
More than two and a half crore children took part in an Essay Competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children made paintings.
They drew pictures based on their own imaginations.
Many people wrote poems and these days I post drawings made by our young children on social media and praise their efforts.
Whenever there is a reference to cleanliness, I do not forget to express my gratitude to media persons.
They have taken this campaign in a religious manner.
They have made a big contribution in creating a positive environment and are leading the Cleanliness Campaign in their own ways.
We can see in Swachhata Hi Sewa movement as to how the electronic media and the print media in our country can render a big service to the country.
Just a few days ago some one drew my attention towards Bilal Dar, a young man of 18 years from Srinagar.
But not in this case.
Bilal Dar got connected to the Swachhata Abhiyan or Cleanliness Campaign since the age of 12-13 years and has been working for the last 5 to 6 years.
He clears plastic, polythene, used bottles, dry or wet waste every piece of dirt from Aisas biggest lake near Srinagar.
Bilal is very young age wise but is a source of inspiration for all of us who are interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we will have to accept the fact that history begets history and when there is a reference to history, it is but natural to recall our great men.
The month of October is a month to remember so many of our titans.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, 11th October is the birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narain and Nanaji Deshmukh and Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyays birth anniversary falls on 25th September.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deen Dayal ji.
And, what was the main focus of all these great men
Nanaji Deshmukh left politics and joined the Gramodaya Movement and while celebrating his Centenary year, it is but natural to honour his contribution towards Gramodaya.
Indias former President Shriman Abdul Kalamji used to speak of Nanajis contribution in rural development while talking to the youth.
He used to mention Nanajis contribution with great respect and he even went to a village to see Nanajis work there.
Like Gandhiji, Deen Dayal Upadhyayji also talked about the last person at the farthest fringes.
Sardar Saheb unified the country.
We also have to run for unity in order to promote the mantra of unity.
The element of Unity in diversity being Indias speciality comes naturally to us.
We feel proud of diversity but have you ever tried to feel this diversity
I would like to re-iterate to my countrymen, and specially to my young friends that we are alive aware beings.
There are vacations, Diwali is drawing near, all around in our country, there is an inclination to travel to some place or the other
people go as tourists and it is very natural.
But, it is a matter of concern when we do not see our own country, we do not know about its diversities nor do we understand them.
You travel around the world, I have no issues but have a look at your own country too.
Our country is full of such myriad diversities. If you refer to Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekanand, our former President Abdul Kalamji then you will notice that when they toured around India, they got to see and understand India and they got inspired to do and die for the country.
All these great men travelled widely in India.
At the beginning of their endeavour, they tried to know and understand India
There will be a value addition in tourism only when we travel not only as a visitor but also like a student and make efforts to assimilate, understand adapt.
In more than four hundred fifty districts, I had a night stay too. And now, when I am shouldering this responsibility in India, that travel is coming in very handy and proving to be very useful.
That helps me a lot in understanding things.
I request you too, to feel the Unity in Diversity which is not a mere slogan but is a storehouse of enormous energy.
How many varieties of cuisines there are
If we eat a new dish every day, we wont have to repeat any variety throughout our life.
This is the power of our tourism.
I am sure that even this time if you go, you will lend further fillip to my campaign.
You must send photographs on incredibleindia.
If you happen to meet people there, send their photos too.
A thought comes to my mind, that in order to promote tourism in India what could be the seven best tourist destinations in your state every Indian must know about these seven tourist spots of his state.
If possible, one must visit these seven places.
Can you provide some information about that
Can you post on Narendra Modi App
Can you post on incredibleindia
You see, if all the people of one state will do this, then I will ask the government to do a scrutiny of it and prepare publicity material based on seven common things received from each state.
In other words, how can tourist destination be developed keeping public aspirations in mind
The Government of India will work on that.
Come, get connected with me.
You can also act as a major catalyst in promoting the tourism of our country by utilizing the time from this October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, being a human being, there are many things that touch me too.
They agitate my heart.
They leave a deep impression on my heart.
After all I am also a human being just like you.
The Indian Army has got two extraordinary brave women officers they are Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi.
Their husbands laid down their lives in the service of mother India.
One can imagine ones agonizing mental state if her world gets shattered at such a early age
But Swati Mahadik, the wife of martyr colonel Santosh Mahadik resolved to face the difficult situations and she joined the Indian Army.
She received training for 11 months putting in great efforts and she put her life at stake to fulfill her husbands dreams.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubeys husband Mukesh Dubey was a Naik in the army and attained martyrdom while fighting for his country.
His wife Nidhi also took a resolve and joined the army.
It is very natural for every countryman to have a deep sense of respect for these two bravehearts, our Matri Shakti.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to both of them.
Many congratulation to these two sisters. My dear countrymen, there is a big opportunity for our younger generation between Navratra festivities and Diwali.
FIFA under- 17 world cup is being organized in our country.
I am sure reverberations of the spirit of football will be heard all around.
It will evince more interest in Football in every generation.
There should not be a single school-college ground in India where we will not see our youngsters at play.
Come on, the whole world is coming to play on Indian soil, let us make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, Navratras are going on.
It is a time for praying to Ma Durga.
The whole environment is filled with sacred fragrance.
My dear countrymen, Saadar Namaskar.
When on the one hand, a sense of festivity pervades the land, and on the other, news of violence comes in, from one part of the country, it is only natural of be concerned.
Ours is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the land of Sardar Patel who gave up his all for the unity of the nation.
For centuries, our forefathers have imbibed community values, nonviolence, mutual respect these are inherent to us.
We have been hearing and saying Ahimsa ParmoDharmah from our childhood.
In my address from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I had said that violence in the name of faith will not be tolerated, whether it is communal belief systems, whether it is subscribing to political ideologies, whether it is allegiance to a person or customs and traditions.
I want to assure my countrymen that people who take the law into their own handsand are on the path of violent suppression whether it is a person or a group neither this country nor any government will tolerate it.
Each and every person will have to abide by the law
Ours is arich cultural heritage, spanning thousands of years when we look at our cultural traditions, social customs, historical events, there would hardly be a day left in the year which is not connected with a festival.
You would have noticed, that all our festivals follow the almanac of nature.
There is a direct connect with nature.
Many of our festivals are linked straightaway with farmers and fishermen.
Speaking about festivals today, I would first like to wish you all michhamidukkadam.
The Jain community celebrated the SamvatsariParva yesterday.
In the month of Bhadra, ParyushanParva is celebrated by the Jain Community.
The last day of ParyushanParva is observed as Samvatsari.
This is indeed a remarkable tradition.
The festival of Samvatsari is symbolic of forgiveness, non-violence and brotherhood.
It is also known as the KshamavaniParva, and on this day, people traditionally greet each other with, michhamidukkadam.
And Mahatma Gandhi always said, that forgiveness is the quality of great men.
Shakespeare in his play, The Merchant of Venice, while explaining the importance of forgiveness, has written, Mercy is twice blest, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes, meaning, the forgiver and the forgiven both stand to receive divine blessing.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great fervor all across the country.
When we speak of Ganesh Chaturthi, it is but natural to talk about SarvajanikGaneshotsav, that is, community celebrations of the Ganesh Festival.
Ganesh Chaturthi is a ten-day festival.
This Mahaparva, mega-festival stands for unity, equality, integrity and honesty.
My heartiest greetings to all of you on the occasion of Ganeshotsav.
The festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerela.
Of the numerous colourful festivals of India, Onam is a prime festival of Kerela.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
Our festivals are now becoming great attractions for tourism.
And I would like to mention to my countrymen, that festivals like Navaratri in Gujarat, or Durga Utsav in Bengal are tremendous tourist attractions.
Other festivals of our country too, provide an opportunity to attract foreign visitors.
We should think about what more can be done in this direction.
In this series of festivals, Eid-ul-uha will be celebrated in a few days from now.
Heartiest felicitations and best wishes to all countrymen on the occasion of Eid-ul-uha.
Festivals are of course symbols of faith and belief
in the New India, we should transform them into symbols of cleanliness as well.
In individual households, festivals and cleanliness are linked together.
In fact, preparationsfor festivals always begin with cleaning.
This is nothing new for us, but it is important to convert it into a social character.
Public cleanliness must be insisted upon not just in our homes but in our villages, towns, cities, states and in our entire country Cleanliness has to be inextricably linked to our festivals.
My dear countrymen, definitions of being modern are perpetually changing.
And as a result of this I find that, the ecofriendly Ganpati, in this Ganesh Festival has turned into a huge campaign.
If you go on YouTube, you will see that children in every home are making earthen Ganesh idols and are colouring them.
Some are using vegetable colours, while some are pasting bits and pieces of paper.
All sorts of experiments are being carried out in every family.
And it is nice to see all sorts of new innovations.
The campaign for Cleanliness which was initiated three years ago will be marking its third anniversary on the 2nd of October.
And the positive results are now being seen.
Toilets have increased from 39 to almost 67 of the population
More than two lakh thirty thousand villages have declared themselves open defecation free.
Gujarat saw devastating floods recently.
Many people lost their lives. When the waters receded, there was so much filth everywhere.
That is when, in Dhanera in the Banaskantha District of Gujarat, volunteers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind cleaned twenty-two affected temples and two mosques in a phased manner.
They came together and toiled collectively.
The volunteers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hindset a fine, inspiring example of unity for cleanliness.
If this committed effort towards cleanliness become inherent to us, our country will certainly take our nation to greater heights.
My dear countrymen, I call upon you to begin a campaign, Swachchata Hi Sewa, Cleanliness is Service, at least fifteen-twenty days prior to Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October on the lines of the age-old belief, Jal SevaYahiPrabhuSeva, Service to Water is Service to God.
Lets create an environment of cleanliness in the entire country.
Whenever and wherever possible, lets look for the opportunity.
But we must all come together.
Come together on Sundaysand Holidays.
Go to settlements in your neighborhood, go to nearby villages, but do this in the form of a movement.
I urge all NGOs, schools, colleges, social, cultural and political leaders, people in the government, collectors and sarpanches, to begin creating an environment of cleanliness at least fifteen days ahead of Gandhi Jayanti on the 2nd of October so that it turns out to be the 2nd October of Gandhis dreams.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has created a section on MyGov.
in where after constructing a toilet you can register your name and the name of the beneficiary family, who you helped.
My friends from the social media can run a few creative campaigns and thus become a source of inspiration in the virtual world, to see results in the real world.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has organized, the Swachch Sankalp se Swachcha Siddhi Pratiyogita, From the resolve of Cleanliness to attaining Cleanliness Competition comprising an essay competition, a short film making competition and a painting competition.
You can write essays in various languages and there is no age limit.
You can make a short film even with your mobile phone.
You can film a two-three-minute movie that inspires cleanliness.
It can be in any language
I invite one and all Come, join the Cleanliness Campaign in this manner as well.
I would like to reiterate, lets resolve to celebrate, 2nd October Gandhi Jayanti this year as Swachch Do Aktoobar, Clean 2nd October.
Take one or another step towards cleanliness.
Make your effort to be a part of it.
You will see how the Gandhi Jayanti of this 2nd October shines.
You can imagine the inner bliss of paying homage to our revered Bapu, with fifteen days of this cleanliness campaign, Swachchata Hi Seva, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on the 2nd of October.
My dear countrymen, I want to specially express my indebtedness to you.
I want to thank you from the core of my heart, not because you have been connected with Mann Ki Baat, for such a long time I want to express my gratitude and indebtedness as millions of people from across the country come together with Mann kiBaat.
This has become a great opportunity for me to understand the hearts and minds of one and all.
Much as you wait for Mann ki Baat, I await your messages with greater eagerness.
I always look forward with anticipation, because I find so much to learn from all that you share.
I therefore express my heartfelt gratitude for your contributions and also my indebtedness to you.
Sometimes certain things become a part of our habits, that we dont even realize that we are doing something wrong.
Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Aparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about a friend of mine. She always tries to help others, but one habit of hers amazes me.
I went for shopping with her at a mall.
We spend extravagantly in high places, without a single thought, but when it comes to our hardworking brethren, we quarrel with them over small amounts.
Dont you feel that whenever a vendor comes to your door to sell something, on his rounds, when we come into contact with small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, auto rickshaw drivers - in fact any person who earns through sheer hard work we start bargaining with him, haggling with him: No not so much, make it two rupees less, five rupees less
And it is us, the same people, who go to dine at a fine restaurant, we dont even bother to check the bill, we just go ahead and pay the money, without thinking twice.
It is not a matter of two or five rupees, it hurts him deeply, when he feels that you are questioning his honesty.
Two or five rupees make no difference to your life, but have you thought how much heartache this petty habit of yours can cause him.
Madam I am grateful to you for calling me with this touching message.
I am certain that my countrymen, if they are in the habit of behaving in this way with the poor will now stop doing so.
My dear young friends, the country celebrates National Sports Day on the 29th of August.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player, hockey wizard, Major Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to hockey was unparalleled.
I am reminding you of this because I want the younger generation of our country to take part in sports.
Sports should become a part of our lives.
If we are a young nation, our youth should get manifested in the field sports as well.
Sports means, physical fitness, mental alertness and personality enhancement.
What else does one need
Sports, in a way, is a recipe that brings people together.
The young generation of our country should come forward in the world of sports and in todays computer era I would like to alert you to the fact that the playing field is far more important than the play station.
Play FIFA on the computer, but sometimes show your skills with the football out in the field.
You must be playing cricket on the computer but the pleasure of actually playing cricket in an open field under the sky is something else.
There was a time when the children in the family went out to play, the mother would first ask, When will you come back home
Now the times are such that children, when they come home, they either start watching cartoons in a corner, or are glued to mobile games. And the mother has to shout, When will you go out
How times have changed There was a time when the mother would demand to know when her son would be back.
The good news for our young friends is that the FIFA Under 17 World Cup is being organized in India, from the 6th to the 28th of October.
I speak about sports today, and just last week, a heartwarming incident took place, which I would like to share with my countrymen.
I had the opportunity to meet some young daughters, some of who, were born in the Himalayas, who had absolutely no connection with the sea.
Our six daughters riding the waves of the high seas, with courage, is the first instance of its kind in the world.
Each and every Indian would be proud of these daughters.
I salute their valour and I have asked them to share their experiences with the entire country.
I too am making a separate arrangement for their experiences on the NarendraModiApp to ensure that you can read it.
For this is a tale of heroism, a tale of personal experiences, and I would be happy to bring you the stories of these daughters. My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate 5th September as Teachers Day.
It is the birthday of our former President, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President, but all through his life, he saw himself as a teacher.
He preferred to live a teachers life.
The most important quality of a teacher, is to awaken in his students, a sense of creativity and the joy of learning.
As we celebrate Teachers Day this year can we come together and take a resolve
Get someone committed to a five-year resolve. Show him the path of attainment, which he can achieve in five years - so that he can experience the joy of success in life.
In the life of every teacher, there are incidents of simple efforts that succeeded in bringing about a transformation in somebodys life.
We will play a big role in the transformation of the nation, if we make a collective effort.
I am a resident of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of Harvard University.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, financial inclusion, had been a point of discussion amongst Financial Pundits, not just in India, but all over the world.
On the 28th of August 2014, we had launched this campaign with a dream in our hearts.
Tomorrow on the 28th of August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna will complete three years.
Thirty crore new families have been linked to this scheme, bank accounts have been opened.
And today I feel a great sense of fulfilment, that within three years, the last man on the fringes of society has become a part of the mainstream economy of the country.
There is now an air of prudence.
He is now beginning to understand that the money can be of use for his children.
The money can be used productively in the days to come.
Not just this, when a poor person sees a RuPay Card, in his pocket, he finds himself to be equal to the privileged that if they have a credit card in their pockets, I too have a RuPay Card in mind.
He feels a sense of dignity.
In the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, almost 65 thousand crore rupees have deposited in banks by our underprivileged brethren.
And those who opened their accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, have received the benefit of insurance as well.
Schemes like, Pradhan Mantri Jeewan Jyoti BimaYojna, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojna, with a small premium of one rupee or thirty rupees, are giving a new sense of confidence to the poor.
For many families, in times of adversity, or on the demise of the head of the family, through the one-rupeeinsurance,they received two lakh rupees in a matter of days.
There isnt enough time today, but I would certainly like request the bankers to upload these inspiring stories, on MyGov.
My dear countrymen, once again, I wish you michchamidukkadm.
Thank you very much.
We human beings have a natural inclination to be enchanted by the delights of the rainy season.
Animals, birds, flora nature in its entirety, is filled with the joys of the season.
But sometimes, when the rain unleashes full force of its fury, we come to realise the extent of the destructive might of water.
Mother Nature gives us life and nurtures us, but at times natural catastrophes such as floods and earthquakes wreak havoc on a massive scale.
Climate change, altered weather cycles, and transformations in the environment, are also having a big negative impact.
Recently, in certain parts of India, particularly, Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some areas of Bengal, have had to bear the brunt of natural disasters, caused by excessive rains.
Flood affected areas are being closely monitored.
The Government of India, Army personnel, Air Force personnel, NDRF personnel, Paramilitary forces everybody does his or her best in providing succour to the disaster stricken people. Life goes completely topsy-turvy as a result of the floods.
Crops, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electricity, communication links everything gets affected.
People are also voicing their difficulties.
We should also gradually make it our nature to set our work patterns according to the weather predictions, which could safeguard us against losses.
Whenever I prepare myself for Mann Ki Baat, I find that the citizens of our country prepare themselves even more.
This time around, there have been innumerable letters and phone calls in regard to GST. People are still expressing their happiness about GST, and are also eager to know more about it.
I would like you to hear one such phone call: Namaskar, Pradhan Mantri ji, this is Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard your speech on the Chartered Accountants Day and was deeply impressed.
In the same manner, Goods and Services Tax, GST, was launched on this very day last month.
Could you please elaborate whether its results after one month are matching the expectations of the Government
I would like to hear your views on this.
It has been one month since GST was implemented and its benefits can be seen already.
I feel very happy and satisfied when a poor person writes to say how because of GST prices of various items essential for him have come down, and commodities have become cheaper.
When a person from the North-East, someone living in the remote areas, in the hills or forests, writes a letter to communicate that in the beginning, he used to be apprehensive about GST wondering what it was all about, but now that he has begun to understand it, he feels that things have become much easier than before.
This indeed is a convenience, but at the same time it is also bolstering the economic progress.
The speed at which the smooth transition has taken place, along with rapid migration and new registrations, has instilled a new sense of confidence in the entire country.
And some day, the Pundits of Economics, Pundits of Management and Pundits of Technology, will certainly undertake researches and write about Indias GST experiment as a model for the world.
It will become a case study for universities across the world.
The implementation and furtherance of such a phenomenal change on such a monumental scale, with the involvement of so many tens of millions of people in such a vast country, is in itself a pinnacle of success.
All decisions have been taken unanimously by the states and the Centre together.
And as a result, one overriding priority for every government has been to ensure that there is no burden on the plate of the poor on account of GST.
And using the GST App all information is available on your mobile phone as to how much the price of an item was earlier and how much will it be now in the new situation.
I extend my heartiest felicitations to each and every ministry, every department and all employees of the Central and State governments involved with this process.
GST is a fine example of the collective strength of the people of India.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform it is a new economic order that will strengthen a new culture of honesty.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reformation.
I would like to once again express my deep gratitude to the millions of my countrymen who have contributed to the successful achievement of this great feat with such felicity.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of Revolution.
In a way, there are many events in the month of August that are closely associated with the history of our freedom movement.
This year, we are going to observe the 75th Anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But very few people know the fact that the slogan, uit India was coined by Dr.
Yusuf Meher Ali.
Our young generation must know what had happened on the 9th of August 1942.
what greater inspiration could there be
The uit India Movement was an important milestone in the Indian Freedom Movement.
It was this movement that had made the entire nation determined to attain freedom from the British Rule.
This was the time when the people of India, in every part of the country be it a village or city, the educated or illiterate, the rich or poor, everyone came together shoulder to shoulder and became a part of the uit India Movement. Peoples anger was at its peak.
Millions of Indians responded to Mahatma Gandhis clarion call and the mantra of Do or Die they flung themselves into the struggle.
Millions of the youth of the country renounced their studies, gave up their books.
Lohia, Jaiprakash Narain played a leading and pivotal role.
In the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920 and the uit India Movement of 1942, two different personas of Mahatma Gandhi can be seen.
The whole scenario of the uit India Movement was different and in 1942 things rose to such a point, there was such a heightened sense of intensity, that a Mahapurush like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of Do or Die.
The reason for this entire success was the peoples support, peoples resolve, and peoples struggle.
The entire country had come together as one to fight for the cause.
And I sometimes think that if we link the pages of history, it is seen that the First War of Independence took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle which began in 1857, continued to be manifested in one or the other corner of the country till 1942.
This long time period ignited the intense longing for freedom in the hearts of the people.
Each one became committed to do something.
The determination did not diminish with each passing generation.
New people kept coming forward each time in place of those who departed and the country kept on every moment endeavouring tirelessly to uproot the British Rule.
These five years were indeed decisive.
I would now like to connect you with its mathematical manifestation.
We became free in 1947.
This is 2017.
It has been almost 70 years.
Governments have come and gone.
Systems have been made, changed, nurtured, and expanded.
Everyone has tried to rid the country of its problems in ones own way.
There have been efforts towards increasing employment, poverty alleviation, and development.
These efforts were also driven with hard work in their different ways.
There have been successes.
Expectations have also risen.
The way, the years from 1942 to 1947 were the decisive years for attainment through resolve.
I can see that 2017 to 2022 presents itself as a new time segment of five years for attainment through resolve.
We should celebrate 15th August 2017 as the Sankalp Parva or the Day of Resolve, and in 2022 marking 75 years of Freedom, we will certainly transform that resolve into Siddhi or attainment.
The need for today is not Do or Die, instead it is to resolve, to come together, persevere, and work relentlessly with our utmost strength towards the making of a new India.
Let us live by and strive for this resolve.
Come lets launch a mega campaign Sankalp se Siddhi Attainment through Resolve, from the 9th of this August.
Every Indian, social organisations, Local Self-Government Institutions, schools, colleges, various organizations all should take one resolve or the other for a New India.
A resolve that we will positively fulfil in the next five years.
Where do we want to reach as a nation
I would particularly like to call upon the online world, since wherever we may be, we are almost always online
so I would like to invite the online community and specially my young friends to come forward and contribute innovatively for building of the New India.
They can use technology videos, posts, blogs, scripts, novel ideas to put forward all these.
Transform this campaign into a peoples movement.
A uit India uiz is also being launched for my young friends on NarendraModiApp.
This quiz is an attempt to familiarise the youth with Indias glorious history and the heroes of the freedom movement.
It is my belief that you will surely publicise and spread awareness about this quiz.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, as the nations Pradhan Sewak, I get an opportunity to communicate with the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
I am merely an instrument.
This time too, I invite you to share your thoughts either on MyGov or on NarendraModiApp.
I read these myself and shall try to express them in whatever time I have with me on 15th August.
For the previous three 15th August speeches, one consistent complaint has been that my speeches tend to be a little lengthy.
I have planned to keep my speech short this time not more than 40-45-50 minutes.
Indias economy has in itself an element of social economics.
And we should never underestimate its value.
Our festivals, our celebrations are not merely occasions of joy and merriment.
Our festivals are in themselves campaigns of social reform too.
And each of our festivals are directly linked with the financial conditions of the poorest of the poor.
Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, Ganesh Utsav, Chauth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Pooja, Diwali these will be observed one after the other.
And this is also the time when the poor get an opportunity to earn an income and of course this adds a spontaneous joy to the festivities.
As far as the economy is concerned, hundreds of families start making Rakhis in small household units, many months before the festival of Rakhi.
A variety of Rakhis are made in a whole range of materials, from khadi to silken threads. People prefer homemade Rakhis these days.
Rakhi makers and their sellers, sweets shops vendors the professions of hundreds, thousands flourish on the occasion of a festival.
it is directly connected with those poor families who make small diyas or earthen lamps.
Today as I speak about festivals and how they are linked to the economy of the poor, I want to touch upon the subject of environment as well.
And they have requested that I talk about eco-friendly Ganesha idols, well in time for people to plan for clay Ganesha idols during the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.
Firstly, I am most grateful to such conscientious citizens.
They have urged me to speak on this subject well before the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.
This time around, there is a special significance to the observance of community Ganesh festival as a public celebration.
And this time I have spoken about it well in time. I am sure that all of you will join me.
This will surely benefit our poor artisans, and artists, and provide employment to those who make idols.
The poor will be able to earn a living and feed themselves. Come, let us link our festivities with the economic welfare of the poor, let the joys of our festivals connect with the households of the underprivileged, bringing monetary happiness to the have-nots.
I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen for the various upcoming festivals and celebrations.
We as a nation take great pride in our daughters.
Recently our daughters performed brilliantly in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
This week I had the opportunity to meet our daughters, the members of our Womens Cricket team.
I felt happy talking to them, but I had a feeling that they felt burdened by the fact that they could not win the World Cup.
This stress, this tension was evident on their faces also.
So while speaking to these daughters, I put forth a different viewpoint before them.
I said, Look, this is the age of the media.
So expectations get hyped up to such an extent that if corresponding success is not achieved, these turn into despair and even resentment.
We have seen during many such events where if the Indian players fail, the anger of the country is vented towards the players.
Some people cross all limits of decency and say and write things that inflict pain and hurt.
But it happened for the first time that when our daughters did not succeed in winning the World Cup, the hundred and twenty-five million people took this defeat on their own shoulders, never letting the burden weigh down these daughters of ours.
Truly our young generation, especially the daughters of our country are doing so much to bring glory to the nation.
I once again extend my heartiest congratulations and best wishes to the young generation of our country, especially our daughters.
Every countryman should make a resolve, every countryman should prepare a 5-year roadmap to realise that resolve.
Come, lets march together as we do our bit.
My Dear Countrymen. Namaskar.
The weather is changing.
It has been extremely hot this year.
But it is good that the monsoon is moving ahead on schedule on its natural course.
The weather has become pleasant in several parts of the country with abundant showers.
As a result of the rains, the cool breeze has brought about some respite from the oppressive heat of past few days.
One has seen that no matter how hectic the life is, no matter how tense we are, whether its ones personal or public life, the arrival of the rains does lift ones spirits.
The Car festival of Lord Jagannath, the Rath Yatra, is being celebrated in several parts of the country with great piety and fervour.
This festival is now also celebrated in some parts of the world.
The underprivileged of the country are deeply connected to Lord Jagannath.
Those who have studied the life and works of Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar, would have observed that he had wholeheartedly praised the Lord Jagannath temple and its traditions, since, social justice and social equality were inherent to these.
The holy month of Ramzan is observed all across, in prayer with piety.
And now the festival of Eid is here.
On the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, my heartiest greetings to one and all.
Ramzan is a month of charity, and sharing joy.
The more you share joy, the more it multiplies.
Let us come together and take inspiration from these holy festivals and share their joyous treasures, and take the nation forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, I came across a very inspiring incident at Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brethren reside in that little village and in a way, form a majority of its population.
During this Ramzan the villagers decided to get together and construct toilets.
Now, to construct these household toilets, the government gives financial assistance, under which, they were provided a sum of 17 lakh rupees.
and that this sum of 17 lakh rupees be used for providing other facilities in the village.
I felicitate the residents of Mubarakpur, for transforming the pious occasion of Ramzan into an opportunity for the welfare of society on.
Each and everything about them is inspiring.
And the most important of it all is that they have freed Mubarakpur of the scourge of open defecation.
We know that in our country there are three states that have already been declared Open Defecation Free states, that is, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF, this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration, government and especially the people of these five states, for achieving this objective.
Only then will the habit of the body and mind will change.
Cleanliness is also similar to this.
These bad habits have become a part of our nature.
We have become accustomed to them.
To free ourselves of these habits we will have to constantly strive and persevere.
Everyones attention will have to be drawn.
We will have to repeatedly remind ourselves of good inspirational incidents.
And Im happy to see that cleanliness is no longer confined to being a government programme.
It is getting transformed into a movement by the society and the people.
And when government functionaries take this initiative forward with the participation of the masses, it becomes even stronger.
Recently I came across a wonderful incident, which I would like to share with you.
This happened in the Vizianagaram District of Andhra Pradesh.
The district administration there undertook a huge task with peoples participation.
A hundred-hour non-stop campaign.
And what was the objective
To construct 10,000 household toilets in 71 gram panchayats in those hundred hours.
And my Dear Countrymen, you will be happy to learn that the administration and the people together did construct 10,000 toilets in hundred hours successfully.
71 villages became ODF.
I congratulate the people in the government, government officials and the citizens of Vizianagaram district on this great accomplishment of achieving this feat through immense hard work and setting a very inspiring example in the process.
Prakash Tripathi jis commitment to democracy is praiseworthy.
Not only is Democracy a system, but also a sanskar- a part of our ethos.
Eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty.
One needs to be constantly alert about our Democracy, that is why we must also keep remembering the events that inflicted harm upon our democracy and at the same time move ahead, carrying forward the virtues of democracy.
1975 25th June it was a dark night that no devotee of democracy can ever forget.
No Indian can ever forget.
The country had virtually become a prison.
The voice of the opposition had been smothered.
Several prominent leaders including Jai Prakash Narayan had been jailed.
The judicial system too could not escape the sinister shadows of the Emergency.
The press was completely muffled.
The present-day students of journalism and the champions of democracy have been endeavouring towards raising awareness about that dark period, by constant reminders, and should continue to do so.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail at that time.
After one year of Emergency, Atal ji wrote a poem, in which he describes the state of mind during those turbulent times.
My dear countrymen, every Indian today, is proud and holds his head high.
21st June 2017 Yoga has permeated the entire world.
From the seashores to the mountains, people welcomed the first rays of the sun, with Yoga.
Which Indian wouldnt be proud of this
It isnt as if Yoga didnt exist before, but now the threads of Yoga have bound everyone together, and have become the means to unite the world.
Almost all the countries in the world made Yoga Day their own.
In China, Yoga was practiced on the Great Wall of China, and on the World Heritage site of Machu Picchu in Peru, at 2400 metres above sea level.
In France, yoga was performed in the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower.
In Herat, in Afghanistan, on the India Afghan Friendship Dam, Salma Dam, Yoga added a new aspect to Indias friendship.
A Yoga Session with Yoga Masters was organised at the UN headquarters.
In Ahmedabad in Gujarat, around 55 thousand people performed Yoga together and created a new world record.
I too had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga event held in Lucknow.
But I also had the good fortune to practice Yoga in the rain for the first time.
Our soldiers practiced yoga in Siachen where temperatures reach minus 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Whether it is our armed forces, or the BSF, ITBP, CRPF and CISF, each one of them, apart from their duties has made Yoga a part of their lives.
On this Yoga Day, since this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had asked you to share photos of three generations of the family doing yoga together.
Some TV channels also took this idea forward.
I received a lot of photographs out of which, selected photographs are compiled and uploaded on the NarendraModiApp.
Recently, I had the opportunity to go to one of my favorite events.
A very good programme is being run in Kerala for the past few years, by the P.
N.
Panicker Foundation, which encourages people to cultivate the habit of reading books and to enhance their awareness towards this, by organising celebrations such as Reading Day, and Reading Month.
Thus I was also reminded of what had slipped my mind.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had set this tradition of welcoming, by not giving bouquets, but books or handkerchiefs instead.
And that too, a Khadi handkerchief, so that it promotes Khadi.
Till the time I was in Gujarat, this habit had been ingrained in us, but after coming here, I had lost that habit.
When I went to Kerala, it was rekindled.
I have already begun to issue instructions in the government.
Here too we can gradually nurture this habit.
And the life span of a bouquet is very short.
You receive it in your hand for a moment and then abandon it.
But when you present a book, it becomes a part of the household, a part of the family.
I say this, thinking of the historical value of such gifts.
During my past UK visit, in London, the ueen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth had invited me to dine with her.
So many years have passed and yet, ueen Elizabeth has treasured the handkerchief gifted by Mahatma Gandhi.
And she was happy to show it to me, when I went there.
As I gazed at it, the ueen encouraged me to touch it.
A small gift by Mahatma Gandhi, has become a part of her life and a part of history.
I know that these habits do not change overnight, and when we talk about it, we invite criticism.
Despite that, one should keep talking about it, and keep making the effort.
Now, I cannot say that if I go somewhere and somebody brings a bouquet I will refuse it.
My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are numerous tasks to be handled.
I have to remain deeply absorbed in files, but for my own self, I have developed a habit of reading daily, at least a few of the letters I receive and because of that I get a chance to connect with the common man.
I get a variety of letters, written by all sorts of people.
Recently, I had the opportunity to read a letter, which I feel, I should share with you.
From the far south, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, Arulmozhi Sarvanan, a housewife, sent me a letter.
She wrote, that she thought about engaging in some economic activity keeping in mind her responsibilities such as childrens education, to lend some financial assistance to her family.
She got some money from the bank, under the Mudra Scheme and commenced working towards procuring some items from the market for sale.
Here I want to tell my countrymen, that if you get the opportunity, you should also visit, the E-G-E-M, E-GEM website on the Internet.
This is a great new system.
Whoever wants to supply any item to the government, small things such as electric bulbs, dustbins, brooms, chairs and tables, they can register themselves.
So, when people register in E-GEM, all the government departments become aware of them.
As there are no middlemen, the goods are available at very reasonable rates.
Now whatever goods Arulmozhi Madam could supply, she got all those registered on this government website.
And the best part is, what she has written in this letter is very interesting.
She has written that she got the money from the Mudra Scheme and started her business, then she registered the inventory of all her products on the E-GEM website, and then she got an order from the Prime Ministers Office.
It was news to me also, I wondered what the PMO would have ordered.
This is an opportunity for encouraging entrepreneurship.
Had Arulmozhi not written to me I wouldnt have realised that because of E-GEM, a housewife living far away and running a small business can have the items on her inventory purchased directly by the Prime Ministers Office.
This is the nations strength.
This has transparency, this has empowerment, this has entrepreneurship too.
Government E-Marketplace - GEM.
I would certainly like that whoever wishes to sell their products or business items to the government, should increasingly get connected with this website.
I believe that this is an excellent example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance, and its objective is Minimum Price and Maximum Ease, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we take pride in Yoga, on the other we can also take pride in our achievements in space science.
And this is the unique attribute of India, that whereas we have our feet firmly on the ground with Yoga, we have our dreams to soar beyond horizons to far away skies.
Recently, India has had many achievements in sports, as well as science.
Today, Indias flag is flying high not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Nano satellites with the Cartosat-2 Series Satellite.
And besides India, these satellites are of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America, nearly 14 such countries.
And with Indias Nano Satellite Mission, we will get a lot of help in the field of agriculture, farming, and dealing with natural disasters.
We are all aware that a few days ago, ISRO has successfully launched the GSAT-19.
And of all the satellites launched by India, this was the heaviest satellite.
The newspapers of our country have compared it with elephantine weights.
You can well imagine the magnitude of the achievement of our scientists in space.
On the 19th of June, our Mars Mission completed one thousand days.
You may be aware that when we had successfully created a place for the Mars Mission in orbit, this entire mission was planned for a duration of 6 months.
even after a thousand days, our Mangalyaan Mission is at work, sending images, providing information, collating scientific data, way beyond its expected duration and life expectancy.
The completion of one thousand days, is an important milestone in our scientific journey, our space odyssey.
These days we see that our youth are getting increasingly inclined to the field of sports.
Recently Indias Badminton player, Kidambi Shrikant has brought glory to the nation by winning Indonesia Open.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to him and his coach for this victory.
I had the opportunity, a few days ago to be associated with the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of the renowned athlete, P.
T.
Ushas Usha School of Athletics.
The more we promote sports, the more we see the spirit of sportsmanship.
Sports play an important role in personality development also.
There is a great significance of sports in overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in our country.
If the children in our family are interested in sports, they should be given opportunities.
They should not be forced off the playing fields to be locked in rooms with books.
They should study as well, if they can do well in studies, they should certainly do so, but if they have the potential and the inclination to do well in sports, that should be encouraged and supported by the school, college, family and all the people around them.
Each one should nurture dreams for the next Olympics.
It will perhaps be difficult for us to forget the years summer.
But, we are now awaiting the rains.
As I am talking to you today , the holy month of Ramzan has already commenced .
I convey my hearty greetings to all fellow Indians and everyone across the world, especially the Muslim brethren at the advent of this auspicious month of Ramazan.
Prayer, spirituality and charity are accorded the highest priority during Ramzan.
We, Indians, are very lucky that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India and its 1. 25 billion people can take pride in the fact that people from all communities and faith are available here.
This is a country where both theists and atheists
idolaters and those loathing idol-worship co-exist.
We have adapted ourselves to myriad kinds of ideologies, different ways of worshipping and all types of traditions and imbibed the art of co-existential living .
In the ultimate , any religion, faith, ideology or tradition- give us the message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely be helpful in further strengthening these values of peace, unity and goodwill.
I, once again convey my best wishes to all.
I am glad that many people have given me feedback.
All of them showed enthusiasm by personally speaking out their minds to me.
I could not read them all nor could listen to all the messages because there were such a large number of messages.
But whatever I could see from a cursory look that while some made efforts to learn music, some tried hands on a new musical instrument, some of them are trying to learn new things by using YouTube, some are trying to learn a new language.
Some are learning cooking, some others are learning dance and drama
Some have written that they have now started to write poems.
They are making efforts to know about nature and are learning the art of living and trying to understand the world.
I am extremely happy and want to share one of the phone-calls with you.
I am Diksha Katiyal speaking.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle , it was then I realized that how much struggle was involved in getting India freed, how much sacrifices were given and how so many freedom fighters spent years in prison.
I am particularly inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved so much at such a young age.
Therefore I request you that you tell something to the younger generation today on this topic.
I am delighted that younger generation is taking interest in knowing about our history, about our freedom fighters and about those who made sacrifices for the country.
Countless great men spent their youth in jails. Several youngsters went to the gallows .
They suffered despicable miseries and that is how we can now breathe in a free India.
We see all those great men who spent their time in jails did a great job of writing and reading. Their writings provided a great strength and inspiration to our Freedom Movement.
Many years ago, I visited Andaman Nicobar Islands.
I went to see the Cellular Jail there.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkarji.
Veer Savarkarji had written a book Majhi Jannmathep while in incarceration .
He used to write poems on the walls of his prison cell.
He was confined to a very small cell.
These seekers freedom must have gone through immense torture.
I was inspired to visit the Cellular Jail only after reading Savarkarjis book Maazi Janmthep.
A light and sound show is also shown there which is very inspiring.
There was hardly any state in India youths from which were not exiled to the dark waters of Andamans and were forced to spend their youth in this Cellular Jail during the freedom movement.
included people of every language, every state and every generation had faced tortures during this struggleToday is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkarjee.
My dear countrymen, 5th of June is the first Monday of the month.
And, who can explain this in a better way than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi often used to say, One must care about a world one will not see.
This means that it is our duty to be concerned about the world which we shall not see and to care for that.
If you return after a tiring days work, just open the windows and doors of the room and take a deep breath of fresh air this will fill you with fresh energy.
Our body is made up of five basic elements and whenever we come in contact with these elements we get fresh energy.
All of us have experienced this but we do not register this, we do not connect this in a single thread of sequence.
Now on, kindly make it a point to notice that whenever you come in contact with a natural condition , a new spirit emerges from within you.
So, the global campaign of connecting with nature on 5th June should become our individual campaign as well.
And we are reaping the benefits of the efforts made by our ancestors to save the environment.
And if we shall protect the environment, our future generations will reap the benefits.
And, Atharva Veda, written thousands of years ago, is the most authentic guiding scripture about nature and environment.
In India, it has been said Earth is the mother and I am her son.
According to Vedas, the purity within us is because of the Earth.
The Earth is our mother and we all are her children.
If we recall Lord Buddha, a fact comes to light that his birth, his enlightenment and his Mahaparinirvana, all three happened under a tree.
But we need to present this in modern language and integrate with modern arguments.
We have successfully connected the whole world through Yoga.
Like Yoga connects body, mind, heart and soul: similarly it is connecting the world now.
Because of life style, because of the mad race to achieve success and because of increasing responsibilities, leading a stress- free life has become very difficult.
It is seen, this situation is coming up even at a comparatively younger age.
At a time when People are gobbling up medicines indiscriminately and passing their days, Yoga plays a very vital role in helping people to lead a stress-free life.
Yoga is a guarantee of wellness and fitness both.
Yoga is not merely an exercise.
How to mount on the journey of life with the inter-play of body, mind, thoughts and behavior can be better realized and understood through Yoga.
Just two days back, I have written letters to all governments and all leaders of the world about the Yoga Day.
Last year, I made announcements of some Yoga competitions and some awards as well.
We shall gradually advance in that direction.
I have received one suggestion and I compliment the gentleman who has made this creative suggestion.
It is a very interesting suggestion.
He has said since this is the Third International Yoga Day I should make an appeal that on this third international Yoga Day, three generations of the family should do yoga together.
Grand parents, parents and children should together perform Yoga and also upload their photos.
It will be such pleasant blend of Yesterday, today and tomorrow that it will lend a new dimension to Yoga.
I express my gratitude for this suggestion and I feel that as our Selfie with Daughter campaign had proved to be a very inspiring experience. So will this campaign of posting pictures of three generations together performing yoga will evoke curiosity across the nation as well as across the world.
You should certainly send the pictures of three generations doing yoga together to me on Narendra ModiApp or on Mygov.
This will be the picture of yesterday, today and tomorrow and will be a guarantee of a brighter tomorrow.
I invite all of you.
We are still left with about three weeks for the International Yoga Day.
This, in a way, is a movement on preventive health care.
I invite you all to get connected to it.
Ever since you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the Pradhan Sewak- the Chief Servant of the people and when for the first time when I got a chance to address from the ramparts of Red Fort on 15th August, I had talked of cleanliness.
From then onwards, I get a chance to stay in different parts of the country. And, I have seen that people closely follow as to what Modi does, where does Modi go, what all has Modi done.
I received a very interesting phone call and I had also not visualized from this angle.
But, I am thankful to him for having seen the campaign in this way.
This phone call will also attract your attention.
Pranam Modi ji, Im Naina from Mumbai.
Modi ji I watch whether on TV or Social Media, wherever you go, one can see people in that city pay special attention to cleanliness.
Mumbai or Surat, your clarion call has led people to adopt cleanliness as a mission.
Not only the elders but children also have become aware about cleanliness.
Many a time we see them telling elders not to litter on the roads.
The cleanliness drive that you had begun from the Ghats or Banks of the Ganges in Kashi has now taken the shape of a movement inspired by you.
You are right, that wherever I go, the government machinery does the cleaning but nowadays cleanliness also turns into a social event.
Five, seven or ten days before my visit a large number of cleanliness drives are held.
Media also prominently highlights such programmes, A few days ago, I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
A big cleanliness drive was conducted there.
I also did not see a connect is in this.
But, after receiving this phone call, I also started thinking that the point made there was pertinent.
You can very well imagine how much pleasure I derive by knowing this fact and also by noticing that the country is also closely monitoring the programme.
There cannot be any bigger pleasure for me than to know that my visit has been connected with the cleanliness campaign.
Besides usual arrangements to welcome the Prime Minister, cleanliness will also be high on the agenda.
This is very pleasing and inspiring for any cleanliness loving person.
The idea is very good but I will have to think.
But, one thing is right that this movement should be encouraged and it would definitely be better if cleaning tonnes of waste are cleaned and and given as presents in place of other gifts. How many people shall we be able to save from ill health.
This will be a big service to humanity.
Once we start looking at garbage and waste as a wealth, we shall also find newer, techniques of waste management.
Young persons connected with Start-ups will also come forward with newer schemes and also come forward with new equipments.
The Central Government has along with State Governments and with the cooperation of municipal representatives of cities decided to launch a massive and important campaign of waste management.
On the occasion of World Environment Day on 5th June, there are going to be litter bins made available to collect solid waste and liquid waste in 4000 towns of the country.
Two types of waste bins will be available, one would be of green colour and the other blue.
There are two types of waste generated, is the liquid waste and the other is dry waste.
If we follow discipline, then the waste bins that are going to be placed in these 4 thousand towns will collect dry garbage in blue waste bins and liquid garbage in green waste bins.
The waste from our kitchens, be it vegetable peels, leftover food, egg shells or leaves are all part of liquid waste and are to be placed in green litter bins.
The second type of waste is like old newspapers, cardboard, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, leather, polythene, broken boxes, rubber, metals and other kind of waste are all dry waste or litter which can be recycled by machines but cannot be directly used and has to be placed in the blue waste bin.
Ive a firm belief that we will develop a culture and the new steps that we take towards achieving cleanliness will continue, only then will we achieve the dream of Gandhiji, achieve the kind of cleanliness that he dreamt of, today.
I must admit with pride that if a single individual decides it in his heart then a huge Public campaign can be launched .
Cleanliness is also one such drive.
People toiled for about 80-90 weeks, unceasingly and turned Versova beach around by extracting thousand of tonnes of waste materials and today Versova beach is clean and beautiful.
This campaign was owned by Versova Residence volunteer or VRV.
Brothers and Sisters, it is with great happiness that I wish to tell you, that I am given to understand that under the aegis of Swachch Bharat Campaign, the Riyasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become completely free of open defecation.
I wish to congratulate the people of Riyasi Block and also the public servants of Riyasi Block. Jammu Kashmir has presented an excellent example.
I congratulate one and all in the state. I have been told that this movement found maximum leadership amidst women.
The women of that area took out torch rallies to spread awareness, went from house to house, street to street and inspired the people towards this goal.
I felicitate the mothers and sisters of Riyasi from the bottom of my heart. I also congratulate the administrators there for making an excellent beginning by turning one block in the state of Jammu and Kashmir open defecation free.
My dear countrymen, an audit and assessment of the performance of the present government in the last three years is happening all over on newspapers, social media or TV for the last 15 days.
I see this entire process as a very healthy sign.
The works done during these years were tested on every touch stone .
It was analyzed by every segment of society.
I wish to congratulate those who took out time for an in depth analysis of our work, there were some praises some support and sometimes shortcomings were also pointed out, I understand the importance of all these things.
I thank those people, who provided critical and important feedback.
The mistakes and the shortcomings once highlighted can be rectified.
for an aware nation, an awakened nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I too am an ordinary citizen like you and like any ordinary citizen I too am influenced by good or bad things.
Now I feel as if Im conversing with my family while sitting at home.
And there are many families who have written to me these very feelings.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahab.
My dear countrymen, when we shall meet next time by then monsoon rains would be lashing every corner of the country, the weather would have changed, examination results would have arrived, the journey of education will begin anew and the rains would bring a hope, pleasant fragrance, a new aroma
Come let us move ahead while loving nature in such a pleasant atmosphere.
My many felicitations and best wishes to you.
My dearest countrymen namaskar.
Like a selfless seeker, these countless people are consumed by desire to contribute something to the society, on the other hand there are mounds of problems that perhaps even the government does not notice
Every time the inputs that come in response to every episode of Mann Ki Baat, are analyzed in detail by the government.
What are the kinds of suggestions, what are the kinds of complaints and what are the experiences of the people
It is an inherent human nature to advise others.
While travelling in the train or the bus if someone coughs, the next person immediately advises a cure.
To offer advice or suggest a solution, are part of our nature.
Most of those who give suggestions or try to reach to me are those who are really doing something in their lives.
They are making efforts and are engrossed as per their intellect, capacity, ability and circumstances so that something good must happen. And when these things came to my notice I felt that these suggestions are extraordinary.
Some people also give suggestions thinking that if an idea has the potential to work then more people would listen to it if it is heard on a wider platform and hence many people can benefit.
And therefore it is their natural desire that it gets a mention in Mann Ki BaatAccording to me all of these things are extremely positive steps.
First of all, I express my gratitude to the Karma yogis and those people who have offered some or the other service to the society and recommend maximum suggestions.
And not only this, when I mention something positive, such memories come to recall, it is very much a pleasant experience.
In the previous Mann Ki Baat, some people had suggested to me that food was being wasted not only had I expressed my concern but mentioned it too.
And upon my mention, there were mentions of many innovative ideas to save food from being wasted that are being put into practice employed in many corners of the country on NarendraModiApp and also on MyGov.
I had never even imagined that in our country especially the young generation has been doing this kind of work from a long time.
Some social institutions have been involved in this activity for many years was common knowledge, but the youth of my country are engaged in this task, I only came to know later.
Many have sent me the videos of their work in this field.
There are many places where Roti Banks are operating.
In the Roti Banks, the leftover rotis are deposited by people, they also deposit the leftover vegetables and the needy can obtain food from these banks.
The person who donates rotis feels a sense of satisfaction also, the recipient also does not feel humiliated.
These are examples of how work can be achieved with the help of society.
Today is the last day of month of April.
1st May is the foundation day of the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
On this occasion, many felicitations to the citizens of these two states on my behalf.
Both states have made constant strides to scale newer heights of development and have contributed toward the advancement of the country.
And both the states had a steady stream of great men whose lives and sterling contributions in every sphere of society is a source of inspiration for us. In remembrance of these great men, on the foundation day of these two states, we should take the pledge of taking our state, our country, our society, our city, and our family to glorious heights in 2022, when we celebrate 75 years of independence.
Plans should be drawn to achieve that pledge and taken forward with the cooperation of all citizens.
Nature has also changed the rules of the game.
The heat that we used to experience in months of May-June in our country is being felt in March-April this year.
So, when I was taking suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, most of the suggestions offered related to what should be done to beat the heat during summer time.
S.
Kartik and many such friends have expressed their concern about birds during the summer.
Theyve mentioned that water should be kept in trays and utensils on the balcony and on the terrace. I have seen that small children of the family do this very enthusiastically.
Once they understand why they should fill the pots with water they would go and inspect 10 times in a day to ensure there is water in the tray. And also watch if the birds came or not.
We think as if it is a game going on , but in actuality, this is a novel way of instilling empathy in the child's mind.
You can also experience for yourself that a little attachment to an animal or a bird makes you feel very happy.
Some time back, Shri Mr. Jagat Bhai from Gujarat, had sent his book, 'Save the Sparrows' in which he not only expressed concern about the continuously declining number of sparrows, but also what steps he has taken in a mission mode for the conservation of the sparrow which is very nicely described in that book.
In our country, we are traditionally imbued with a sense of symbiotic co-existence with animals, birds and nature yet it is necessary that collective efforts in this regard should be emphasized.
When I was Chief Minister of Gujarat, Syedna Sahib the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra Community had completed his hundred years.
He lived till 103 years.
As part of the celebration of his 100th year the Bohra community society had launched a huge campaign to save the sparrow under the aegis of Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to inaugurate it.
Nearly 52 thousand bird feeders were distributed in every nook and corner of the world.
This effort also found a mention in the Guinness book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, that we even forget to offer water to the newspaper boy, the milkman, the vegetable seller, the postman or anybody else who come to our house in peak summer days.
Young friends, I want to have a chat with you too.
I am sometimes worried that much of our younger generation prefer leading life in their comfort zones.
Parents also raise their children in a very protective manner.
True there are other extremes also but most are brought up in this comfort zone syndrome .
Now the examinations have ended and you must be done with your plans to enjoy the vacation.
Summer vacations feel good inspite of scorching heat.
But as a friend, I want to suggest you certain tips about of how to utilize your vacation.
I believe some people will put them to use and they will tell me about that too.
Would you like to use this time of vacation gainfully, I offer three suggestions, it will be good if you follow all of the three but then try to do atleast one of the three.
You must try new places, new experiences and new skills.
There is huge difference between to sometime to see something on television or reading about it in the book or listening about it from acquaintances and to experiencing the same thing yourself.
The experiment must be positive and a little out of your comfort zone.
We all belong to the middle class and happy comfortable families.
Try it, just experience it once, I am not asking you to try it again and again, do it once.
In the evening, take your football or your volleyball or any other sports item and go to a colony of poor and lesser privileged people.
Play with those poor kids, you will experience a new kind of joy, the kind you would have never experienced in your life before-thats the kind of joy youll experience
Have you ever thought what changes would come in the lives of those kids who live in abject poverty when get the opportunity to play with you.
And I believe that if you go there once, your heart will tell you to go back again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many volunteer organizations are engaged in this kind of work.
Sometimes there are summer camps, for development of different facets of your personality.
You can participate in these camps.
But at the same time, dont you feel that after youve attended such summer camps, you have participated in the courses for development of personality and you reach out to those people who have no such opportunity and teach them what you have learned without taking any money.
It is possible that you can teach them.
I am also worried that technology evolved to reduce the distance, technology came in to being to end the boundaries.
Everyone has become so busy with technology in his or her own way.
Today is the era of competition.
Friends, dreams of making it big in life is a good thing, it is good to have some purpose in life, and you must achieve your goals.
But also self-evaluate whether the human element within yourself is getting frustrated, are we not moving away from our human qualities.
Cant a little emphasis be given on this aspect in Skill development
Get away from technology, and try to spend some time with yourself.
Learn a musical instrument or learn a few sentences of a new language, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
This is a country full of diversity and if you look, then there can be someone who can teach us something new is just around the corner.
If you dont know how to swim, then learn swimming, try doing some drawing, even if you do not end up making the best drawing, try to practice putting hand to the paper
The empathy within you will begin to appear.
Sometimes if our heart desires to learn the trade of so called small people then let us learn it, why not
You see, all these new experiments, these skills are such that they will bring you joy and will remove you from the limitations of life to which youre tied down
Do something out of the box, my Friends.
This is the only time to make something of your life.
And if you think that after appearing in all exams, at a new threshold of your career you will learn some new skill, then you wont get a chance.
At that time you will be tangled into other things and therefore I tell you if you have a passion to learn magic then learn the card tricks
Keep showing the tricks to your friends.
Try to know about things about which you have no prior knowledge, it will definitely benefit you.
Your inner human potential will awaken and this will provide a great opportunity for development.
I can tell you from my experience of going around the world, that the amount we can learn by seeing the world is something we cannot even imagine.
New places, new cities, new towns, new villages, new areas.
Go to a destination and spend three to four days there.
Then go to the next and spend a like duration there.
You will get to learn a lot that way.
I wish you share your travel photographs with me, it will be nice.
What new did you see
Where did you travel to
Make good use of the hash tag Incredible India and share your experiences.
Friends, this time around, the government of India has provided you with a great opportunity.
The new generation is more or less freeing itself from the shackles of cash.
I know you do it, but have you ever wondered that you can earn using this very scheme
It is a scheme of the Government of India.
You must be downloading the BHIM App and using it.
Ten rupees will be credited to your account from the government.
If you involve twenty persons in a day, by evening, you wouldve earned two hundred rupees.
The traders can earn, so can students.
And this scheme is valid till the 14th of October.
It will be your contribution towards making of a digital India.
In a way it had become a symbol of the VIP culture. Experience tells us that whereas the red beacon used to be fixed atop the vehicle, atop the car, slowly steadily it permeated into the psyche and got firmly entrenched in the mindset.
The red beacon now has gone for good but nobody can say with certainty that the same in the mindset has also disappeared.
I have received a very interesting phone call.
Though the caller has expressed the same apprehension. One can discern from this phone call that common men detest these tendencies.
They feel distanced.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Shivaa Choubey calling from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
It made me feel very proud. I am glad that today, even my time is equally important.
I dont have to be caught in a traffic jam and I dont have to stop for anyone as well.
I want to thank you from the core of my heart for this decision.
The exit of the red beacon through a government decision is part of a system.
But we have to make efforts to cleanse it out of our minds.
If we collectively strive to do it with eternal vigilance , it surely can be flushed out.
Our concept of New India precisely is that in place of VIP, more priority should be accorded to EPI. And when Im saying EPI in place of VIP, the essence of my sentiment is clear every person is important.
Every person has his or her own importance, every person possesses a sagacious aura, Mahaatmya, in a unique manner.
Let us warmly accept the importance of a hundred twenty five crore countrymen, let us respectfully embrace the Mahaatmya, the divine greatness of a hundred twenty five crore Indians and well garner strength of immense magnitude.
We have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I maintain time again that we should keep re - visiting the annals of our history, traditions and culture.
That lends us energy and inspiration.
This year, we the hundred twenty five crore countrymen are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya.
For one reason or the other, we confine ourselves to celebrating and observing centenaries of events mostly.
For other countries of the world, a century may be of immense significance.
But India is such an ancient Nation that we are the proud inheritors of thousands and thousands of years of heritage, knowledge and civilized existence and have an opportunity to observe and celebrate a memorial heritage of over thousand years.
Just try and imagine it.
Even today breaking the shackles Social orthodoxy is so difficult.
How would society be a thousand years ago
Through his own conduct, he embraced those who were ostracized by society.
A thousand years ago, he launched an agitation allowing their entry into temples and succeeded in facilitating the same.
We are indeed fortunate that in every era, for eradicating social evils, noble souls, great men were born in this society itself.
Now that we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya, we should gain inspiration from him in our endeavour to foster social unity, to bolster the adage unity is strength.
In memory of Saint Ramanujacharya, the government of India is releasing a stamp tomorrow, the 1st of May.
I respectfully salute Saint Ramanujacharya and pay tributes to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, that is the 1st of May, carries one more significance.
In many parts of the world, it is observed as Labour Day.
And when Labour Day is referred to, labour is discussed, labourers are discussed, it is but natural for me to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar.
You would be aware that for the facilities and respect that workers have earned, we are grateful to Babasaheb.
One can never forget the contribution of Babasaheb towards the welfare of the working class.
Today when I refer to Babasaheb, when I talk about Ramanujacharya, Im also reminded of the great 12th century saint social reformer from Karnataka Jagat Guru Basaveshwar.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to be part of a function.
It was the occasion of dedication to the nation of his collection of Vachana Amrit, the elixir of his spoken words.
He had mentioned in Kannada Kaay Kave Kailas... it means, it is just through your perseverance that you can obtain Kailash, the abode of Shiva.
In other words, labour, hard work is Shiva.
I repeatedly mention Shrameva Jayate, and Dignity of Labour.
Today when I refer to workers, it is but natural to remember Dattopant Thengdi.
My dear countrymen, a few days from now, we shall celebrate Budha Purnima.
Followers of Lord Budha across the world celebrate the festival.
The world today is undergoing a plethora of problems such as violence, war, annihilation, the arms race et al. Amidst this atmosphere, the philosophy of Buddha comes across as extremely relevant.
And in India, Ashoks life perfectly epitomizes the transformation from war to enlightenment.
I feel fortunate that the occasion of the great festival of Budha Purnima is celebrated as Vesak day by the United Nations.
This year it will take place in Sri Lanka.
On this holy event I shall get an opportunity to pay tributes to Lord Budha in Sri Lanka.
It will be an opportune moment to re-visit his ideals.
My dear countrymen, India has always advanced on the path of progress in the spirit of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas...
And when we say Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, it is not limited to the confines of India.
There are many projects under way.
On the 5th of May, India will launch the South Asia Satellite.
The capacities of this satellite and the facilities it provides will go a long way in addressing South Asias economic and developmental priorities.
This is an appropriate example of our commitment towards South Asia.
Parents in most parts of the country must be busy with their childrens examinations.
There would be a sense of relief where the examinations are over, but where the examinations are still on, there certainly would still be some amount of pressure.
However, at a time like this I would only say that students may listen again to what I had said in my Mann Ki Baat last time.
I am sure that my suggestions there will be of substantial help while they sit for their examinations.
Today is the 26th of March.
26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
It was a historic war against injustice, which was fought under the leadership of Banga-Bandhu and led to the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh, on this significant day. And I hope that Bangladesh marches ahead on the path of progress.
I also assure the citizens of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner, and a good friend, and we will continue to work together shoulder to shoulder to contribute towards the peace, security and development of this entire region.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are a shared heritage.
The National Anthem of Bangladesh too, has been composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
There is a very interesting fact about Gurudev that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize, but Knighthood was also conferred upon him by the British.
After the Jallianwallah Massacre by the British in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the legendary figures, who raised their voices in protest.
And it was at the same time, that this event left a very deep impact on a twelve-year-old boy.
The inhuman massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh, provided a new inspiration and mission in life to that young teenager, who until then had spent his days playing merrily in his fields.
And Bhagat, that 12-year old boy in 1919, evolved to be the martyr Bhagat Singh, our dear hero and inspiration.
On the 23rd of March, Bhagat Singh Ji and his comrades, Sukhdev and Rajguru, were hanged to death by the British, and we are all aware of that.
There was a sense of fulfillment on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru for having served Mother India - - there was no fear of death.
They had sublimated all their dreams for the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes inspire us to this day.
It would be impossible to express in words the story of the supreme sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
Many years ago, when I first got the chance to go there, I could feel a certain vibration in that place. And I would certainly urge the youth of our country to go to Punjab, whenever they get the chance, and visit the samadhi of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singhs mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
That was the period when the desire for freedom, its intensity, and spread were on the rise.
On the one hand, brave hearts like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, were inspiring the youth towards an armed revolution.
And on the other hand, exactly one hundred years ago on the 10th of April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had launched the Champaran Satyagraha.
This year marks the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha.
In Indias struggle for freedom, Gandhian thought and Gandhian practice became manifest for the first time in Champaran.
This was a turning point in the entire journey of Indias freedom struggle, especially in the context of the methodology of the struggle.
This was the period when, in the Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, and the mill-workers strike in Ahmedabad, the deep impact of Mahatma Gandhis thoughts and practices was amply and clearly visible.
Gandhi returned to India in 1915, and in 1917, he went to a small village in Bihar and gave the country a new inspiration.
We cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi that we cherish in our hearts today.
Just imagine that one man, who came to India in 1915, and had been in the country for barely two years.
The country didnt know of him, he bore no influence then it was just the beginning.
We can only imagine the hardships that he must have endured, how hard he must have had to toil.
And it was the Champaran Satyagraha that brought to the fore, Mahatma Gandhis organisational skills, and his strong ability to gauge the pulse of Indian society. Mahatma Gandhi, through his demeanour and deeds, could inspire the poorest of the poor, the most illiterate, to unite and come together out into the open for the struggle against the British Rule this was a manifestation of an incredible inner strength, through which we can experience the vastness of Mahatma Gandhis great persona.
And that was the period when all the stalwarts, that we hear about today: Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Ji, and others were all sent to the villages by Gandhi Ji.
And the British were simply unable to comprehend Gandhi Jis unique style of working, which encompassed both struggle and creation together.
one being struggle and the other, creativity.
To get themselves arrested voluntarily to fill jails, on the one hand, and on the other to immerse themselves in creative work.
This desire of 125 crore countrymen for change, the effort to change, is what will lay a strong foundation of a New India.
New India is neither a government programme, nor is it the manifesto of a political party, nor is it a project.
New India is the clarion call of 125 crore countrymen.
There are many who regularly go to hospitals to serve patients. There are many who rush to donate blood, when required.
There are many who try to provide food to the hungry.
Our country is a many splendoured land.
The belief that Service to humanity is service to God, is innate to us.
If we look at it in its collectiveness, in an organised manner, it comes across as a major force.
If every citizen resolves to obey traffic rules, if every citizen resolves that he will discharge his duties honestly, if every citizen resolves that he will not use petrol or diesel one day in a week - - these are not very big things.
But these will contribute to the realisation of the dream of this country, this New India, that is being nurtured by 125 crore countrymen, and this realisation will be achieved before their eyes.
In essence, every citizen must discharge his civic duties and responsibilities.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to all of you.
Over the last few months the country has witnessed a certain atmosphere in which people in large numbers have participated in the digital payment, Digidhan movement.
There has been a surge in various modes of digital payment after demonetisation.
The BHIM-App was launched just about two to two and a half months ago, but approximately one and half crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we must take our fight against black money and corruption to the next level.
Can 125 crore countrymen resolve to undertake 2500 crores digital transactions during this year
We have made an announcement in the Budget.
Our 125 crore countrymen, if they wish to do so, they need not wait for a year
they can do it in six months.
2500 crore digital transactions - - - if we pay school fees, we shall do so not by cash but digitally, if we travel by train, travel by air, we shall pay digitally, if buy medicines, we shall pay digitally, if we run fair price shops, we will use the digital mode.
We can do this in our day to day lives.
Recently, several Digidhan-mela programmes were organised to educate the people and to increase public awareness.
The resolve was to organise 100 such programmes all over the country.
About 80-85 programmes have already been conducted.
There was also a reward scheme.
Close to 12 and half lakh people have won prizes.
Seventy thousand traders also won the prizes instituted for them.
On the completion of a hundred days, a grand closing ceremony will be held.
There is a provision of a bumper draw also in that.
I believe that in whatever time that is left before Baba Saheb Ambedkars birth anniversary, we should popularise and promote the BHIM-App.
We should contribute towards ensuring reducing the use of cash, of currency notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time, I request people for suggestions in Mann Ki Baat, numerous suggestions pour in. But I have seen that there is always an emphasis on the topic of cleanliness.
To begin with, heartiest congratulations on your victory in the elections, with a huge margin.
I wish to share the issue close to my heart with you.
I want to say that people will have to be made aware about the importance of cleanliness.
Every day I pass by a river, in which people dump a lot of garbage and pollute rivers.
The river flows under the Rispana Bridge before passing by my home.
I want to request you to kindly highlight this issue by sending a team there, or through the newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, look at the agony of this young daughter, the 11th class student.
How enraged she is by seeing the river strewn with trash.
I consider this to be a good omen.
This is exactly what I want - - that 125 crore countrymen be angered by filth.
There has been an awareness ever since the launch of the Cleanliness Movement.
Each person has become associated with it in a positive manner.
This has now truly taken the form of a movement.
There has been an increase in the disgust towards squalor.
When there is awareness and active participation in the movement, it has its own significance.
But cleanliness is more about a habit than a movement.
This movement is geared towards bringing about a change in the habit, a movement to inculcate the HABIT of cleanliness.
This movement can be accomplished collectively.
It is a difficult task, but we have to do it.
I am sure that this resolve that has arisen in the younger generation, in children, in students, in the youth, augurs well for achieving good results.
I would urge my fellow countrymen, who have heard Gayatris message in my Mann Ki Baat today, that it should be a message to all of us.
Have you ever thought about how much food we waste
Have you ever thought how many poor people can be fed if we dont thus waste our food
This is not something that needs to be taught.
As it is, in our families, mothers always tell their children to take only as much food they can eat.
There is always some effort made in this direction, but still the apathy on this issue is a crime against society.
It is an injustice to the poor.
On the other hand, if we are able to avoid wastage, the family too benefits economically.
I am not urging too much on this issue, but I would like this awareness to spread.
I do know some young persons, who are active in such campaigns.
They have created Mobile Apps.
And when people call them about there being leftover food anywhere, they collect it and put it to good use.
They work hard, and these are our own young people.
You will find such people somewhere in each and every state of India.
The lives of these people can inspire us not to waste food. We should take only as much as we can eat.
And those who are health conscious always say that, there should always be some space left both in the stomach and on the plate.
I want to tell my countrymen, that depression is not incurable.
There is a need to create a psychologically conducive environment to begin with.
The first mantra is the expression of depression instead of its suppression.
Share openly what you are going through, with your colleagues, friends, parents, brothers, and teachers.
Sometimes one is overcome by a sense of loneliness - - - students living in hostels are particularly vulnerable to it.
He doesnt come to the dining table.
Have you ever wondered why he does so
You can be sure that this the first step towards depression.
If he prefers to stay away from a group, and tends to be all by himself, do make an effort to ensure that this does not happen.
He should be given an opportunity to be amongst people with whom he speaks openly.
Try to encourage him to express himself, to reveal and bring out his insecurities and complexes while engaging him in light-hearted happy conversation.
This is a very good way of dealing with it.
Depression can be the root cause of many mental and physical ailments.
Just as diabetes can be the root cause of all sorts of diseases, depression too, destroys all our abilities to sustain, to fight, to display courage and to take a decision.
Your friends, your family, your surroundings, and environment, all these can prevent you from going into depression and if you unfortunately has gone into it, they can also pull you out of it.
There is another way.
If you are unable to express yourself to your family and friends, then do one thing, go out in society with a sense of service.
If you try to sympathise with the sufferings of others with a sense of service, a new self-confidence will be born within you.
By connecting with others, serving them and serving them selflessly, you will easily be able to shed the weight oppressing your own heart and mind.
Yoga too is a good means for mental wellbeing.
Yoga helps in relieving tension and stress, and leads one towards a happy state of mind.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga.
Collective Yoga festivals should be celebrated with the participation of millions.
If you have any ideas for the Third International Yoga Day, please do send me your suggestions and guidance through my mobile Application.
You could compose as many songs and poems on Yoga, as possible, as these can be easily understood by the masses.
Recently, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The working-class women in our country - their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and this is a welcome trend.
They also have to share the financial responsibilities of running the household, and because of that sometimes, the newborn has to bear some injustice of neglect.
The Government of India has taken a very important decision.
These working women will now be given maternity leave of 26 weeks, instead of the earlier 12 weeks, for their pregnancy and delivery.
There are now only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this matter.
India has taken a very important decision for these working women sisters of ours.
The basic aim is to ensure proper care of the newborn, the future citizen of India, from the time of birth.
That is how these children will become true assets of the country when they grow up. Mothers too will remain healthy.
And that is why, this is such a landmark decision, and this will benefit 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
May the lives of all these great luminaries inspire us, and give us the strength to resolve ourselves to the cause of New India.
My heartiest new year greetings for Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Varsh Pratipada, and Nav Samvatsar, which are two days from now.
After Vasant Ritu or the season of Spring, it is now the time for the ripening of the crops, and the time for the farmers to reap the benefits of their hard work.
The new year is celebrated in different ways in different parts of our country.
New year is Gudi Padva in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, for the Sindhi it is Cheti Chand, Navreh in Kashmir, Samvatsar Pooja in the Awadh Region, Jud-Sheetal in the Mithila region of Bihar and the festival of Satuvani in the Magadh region.
India is a country blessed with rich diversity.
My heartiest greetings and best wishes to you all on this New Year.
Many thanks.
Winter is on its way out.
Vasant, the season of spring has just started to step into our lives.
The flower heads of the summer fruit mango manifest themselves in the spring season itself.
At the same time bright yellow flowers of mustard swaying in their fields kindle hope in the hearts of the farmers.
Blossoming of bright red Jungle Flame flowers, better known as Tesu or Palash heralds the advent of Holi.
Amir Khusro has portrayed these moments of change of season in a very interesting manner.
Amir Khusro has written:Phool rahi sarson sakal banAmbwa phoote, Tesu phooleKoyal bole, daar daar,that is,Behold the mustard blooming everywhere, all aroundHere the inflorescence on the mango tree, there the Jungle Flame blossomsThe nightingale cant help but sing merrily on the branches.
When nature is at her joyous best, when the season is enchanting, we human beings too enjoy this to the fullest.
The festivals of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi, impart hues of happiness to a persons life.
In an ambience of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are about to bid adieu to the last month of Phalgun and are eagerly awaiting to welcome the arrival of the new month of Chaitra.
The Ritu of Vasant, that is, the season of spring is indeed the confluence of these two months.
At the outset, I express my gratitude to lakhs of citizens of our country for sending in a multitude of suggestions when I ask for them before Mann Ki Baat.
Shobha Ji, thank you very much for paying attention to this shining example of Indias pride.
Whether it is eradicating poverty, preventing diseases, connecting with the world, or disseminating knowledge and information, technology and science have made a mark for themselves.
15th February, 2017 is a day of immense pride for India.
Our scientists have brought laurels to the nation, witnessed by the whole world. And we know that over the last few years, ISRO has accomplished various unprecedented missions with flying colours.
After the successful mission of sending Mangalyaan to planet Mars, recently ISRO scripted a world record in the arena of space.
This is a historic achievement for not just ISRO but for all of India.
This cost effective, efficient space programme of ISRO has become a marvel for the entire world the world has admired this success of Indian scientists of India whole-heartedly.
Brother sisters, one out of these 104 satellites is extremely important. It is Cartosat 2D, which is Indias satellite and the pictures clicked through it will be of great help in mapping of resources and infrastructure, evaluating development and planning for urban development.
Particularly for my farmer brothers and sisters, our new Satellite Cartosat 2D will be immensely helpful on a whole lot of subjects such as knowing how much water is there in our existing water sources, how this should be best put to use, what things to keep in mind in this regard.
It is also a matter of exultation for us that this entire campaign was led and steered by our young scientists, our women scientists.
This tremendous participation of youth and women is a major glorious dimension in ISROs success.
On behalf of our countrymen, I heartily congratulate the scientists at ISRO.
Adhering consistently to the objective of bringing Space Science to the common man, for the service of the nation, they are creating one record after another.
One runs short of words in complimenting and congratulating our scientists, their entire team.
Indias scientists have demonstrated this prowess.
Its core strength lies in the fact that if, even from a distance of 2000 km, a missile is launched to attack India, our missile can pre-emptively destroy it in the space itself.
When we witness new technology, or a new scientific feat, we are left overwhelmed with joy.
They do not rest till they obtain an answer.
If we try to take a birds eye view of thousands of years of the onward march of human life and progress, we can easily say that this great journey has no point of culmination.
This is what begets new Science, new technology. And every technology, every new form of Science gives birth to a new era.
My dear young friends, while we refer to Science and the sheer perseverance of scientists, I have many a time said in Mann Ki Baat, that the attraction of Science for our young generation should increase.
The country needs more and more scientists.
Todays scientist becomes a potent catalyst for enduring change in the lives of our future generations.
Recently, during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, Niti Aayog and Indias Foreign Ministry had organized a unique competition.
Socially useful innovations had been invited.
There are times when a problem portrays the importance of Science for finding its solution.
In 2005, there was a very heavy downpour in Mumbai, which resulted in flooding, and even high tides in the sea, leading to terrible hardships.
Whenever a natural calamity strikes, it is the underprivileged, who are the first in bearing its brunt.
In that situation, two persons worked in right earnest and developed a dwelling structure that saves the house and its occupants, mitigates the water-logging and can prevent water borne diseases also.
Systems are getting technology driven.
In a way, technology is becoming an inseparable part of our lives.
In the recent days, one can see a lot of emphasis being laid on Digi-Dhan.
The young generation, in particular, is getting habituated to digital payments through its mobile handsets.
I believe this to be a good portent.
In recent times, Lucky Graahak Yojana and Digi-Dhan Vyapari Yojana have received overwhelming support.
For about two months now, everyday fifteen thousand people have been winning a prize of a thousand rupees each.
And through these two schemes, the process to make digital payment a mass movement has been initiated it has received a rousing welcome in the entire country.
It is a delight to learn that till now, under the Digi-Dhan Yojana, ten lakh people have been rewarded, over fifty thousand traders have won prizes and an amount of almost over a hundred fifty crores rupees has been earned as prize money by people who have promoted and carried forward this great campaign.
Under this scheme, there are more than a hundred customers who have received prizes of one lakh rupees each.
There are more than four thousand traders who have got prizes of fifty thousand rupees each.
Shriman Santosh Ji from Mysore, expressing joy, has written on the NarendraModiApp that under the Lucky Grahak Yojana, he received a reward of a thousand rupees.
But I feel I must share with you what he has written most prominently.
He says that when he received this reward, it struck him that a poor old woman had lost all her belongings because of a fire that broke out in her house.
Santosh Ji, your name and your deed both are sources of SANTOSH, satisfaction for all of us.
You have done something that is exemplary and inspiring.
A 22-year old cab driver brother Sabir from Delhi adopted the digital mode in his transactions after demonetisation and went on to win a prize of one lakh rupees under the Lucky Grahak Yojana of the Government.
One young post-graduate student Pooja Nemade from Maharashtra keeps sharing her experience with friends about how her family members are using RuPay Card and e-wallet facilities and deriving enjoyment out of it and also as to how important the prize of rupees one lakh is for her.
She has taken up this in a mission mode and is bringing others into its fold.
Take it further as it has a very major and prominent role in the fight against corruption and black money.
To me, each and every individual involved in this mission constitute a new anti-corruption cadre in the country.
In a way you are a soldier in the cause of cleanliness and purity.
There is going to be a very big draw of prizes worth crores of rupees on 14th April.
There are still about 40-45 days left for that.
Remembering him, you teach at least 125 persons about downloading the BHIM App.
Also teach them about the procedure of making transactions through this App
teach this specially to small traders in your neighbourhood.
Give special importance to Baba Saheb Ambedkars birth anniversary this time and the BHIM App.
For this, I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation laid by Dr. Baba Saheb.
We have to go from door to door associating everybody in order to place the BHIM App in 125 crore hands.
Since its beginning about two-three months ago, this movement has had a clear impact and has been a very big success in many townships, villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture makes a very major contribution to the fundamentals of our countrys economy.
Economic prowess of villages imparts momentum to the nations economic progress.
I wish to share a very happy news with you today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have toiled hard to fill our granaries.
The hard work of the farmers has resulted in a record production of food grains.
All signals indicate that our farmers have broken all previous records.
There has been such bountiful crop this time in the fields of our farmers that every day has appeared to be a celebration of Pongal and Baisakhi.
More than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country this year.
This is 8 percent more than the last record set up by our farmers.
Thus, it is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I want to specially thank the farmers of the country.
I also want to thank our farmers for keeping the poor in mind and adopting cultivation of various pulse crops also besides the traditional crops because pulses are the biggest source of protein for poor people.
I am happy that the farmers of my country heeded the needs of our poor people and cultivated various pulse crops on about 290 lakh hectare land.
This is not merely the production of pulses but a yeoman service rendered by the farmers to the poor of my country.
My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special gratitude for the way they whole-heartedly accepted my request, my prayer and put in their hard labour to get a record production of pulses.
My dear countrymen, the government, society, institutions, organizations, in fact everyone, is making some or the other effort towards greater cleanliness.
In a way, everyone is seen working towards the cause of cleanliness in a conscious manner.
The government is continuously making efforts in this regard.
Recently, an event was organised in Telengana under the leadership of the Secretary of our Ministry of Water and Sanitation of the Government of India, in which senior officers from 23 state governments participated.
And, this was not confined to having just a closed door seminar, but the importance of cleanliness was practically demonstrated at Warangal in Telangana.
Toilet pit emptying exercise was carried out in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February.
Toilet pits in six houses were emptied and cleaned and the officers personally demonstrated that the used up pits of twin pit toilet can be emptied and then re-used.
They also displayed as to how convenient these new technique toilets are and there is absolutely no inconvenience or hesitation in emptying or cleaning these toilets and even the psychological barrier does not come in the way at all.
And, we can ourselves clean these toilet pits just as we do other general cleaning.
And we consider the waste taken out from a toilet pit as sheer useless garbage but if considered from the angle of its use as a fertiliser, this, in a way, is black gold.
We can clearly see the conversion of waste to wealth. This has been proved too.
For a family of six members, the model of one standard Twin Pit Toilet gets filled in about five years.
After that the waste can easily be redirected to the other pit.
This waste deposited in the pit gets completely decomposed in six to twelve months time.
It contains nutritious elements Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium in abundance and is considered a fertiliser of very good quality in the agriculture sector.
Others must also have experimented with initiatives similar to those undertaken by the Government.
Now Doordarshan is broadcasting a special programme of Swachchhta Samachar, that is Cleanliness News.
Highlighting such things in this programme will be very beneficial.
Various government departments regularly observe Cleanliness Fortnight.
And two other ministries, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will take the Cleanliness Campaign forward during the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever an Indian achieves something notable, the whole country feels a new energy and the self-confidence gets a boost.
We all hailed the commendable performance by our Divyang Players at Rio Paralympics.
The country is really proud of these Divyang friends for their achievement.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, strongly determined, courageous and possess tremendous resolve.
We get to learn something each moment from them.
Be it the field of sports or space science, the women of our country lag behind none.
They are moving ahead shoulder to shoulder and are bringing glory to the nation with their commendable achievements. Our women players won a silver medal at the Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy recently.
My heartiest congratulations to all these players.
The whole world celebrates 8th March as Womens Day.
In India also more importance needs to be given to our daughters along with increased awareness and sensitivity towards them.
Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao movement is moving forward with rapid strides.
This is no longer just a government programme.
It has now become a campaign of societal empathy and public education.
During the last two years this programme involved the common man
it has forced people from all corners of the country to think and ponder over this burning issue
and brought about a change in peoples thinking about our traditional beliefs and customs which have been prevalent for many years.
It gives us great joy and happiness when we hear the news of festive celebration on the birth of a daughter.
In a way, a positive mindset towards our daughters is leading towards societal acceptance.
I have heard that in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, child marriage has been banned under a special campaign.
In Kathua district in Jammu Kashmir, all departments have been connected with Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana under the Convergence Model and in addition to the convening of Gram-Sabhas, all efforts are being made by the district administrations for adoption of orphan baby girls and to ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, under the Har Ghar Dastak programme a campaign is being run to go to every village and every house to encourage education of daughters.
In Rajasthan Apna Bachcha, Apna Vidyalaya campaign is being run to readmit those girls into schools, who had dropped out, in order to encourage and motivate them to start studying again.
New imagination and new concepts have been linked and connected with it.
This movement has been moulded as per local requirements.
As we get ready to celebrate Womens Day this 8th March, there is only one sentiment: -With Strength, with Vitality, the Indian woman comes to the foreRightfully deserves equality - neither less, nor more. My dear countrymen, all of you get an opportunity to express your views from time to time in Mann Ki Baat.
You also connect actively with this programme.
I am very grateful to you for your contribution.
My fellow citizens, my namaskar to all of you
26th January, our Republic Day was celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in every nook and corner of the nation by all of us.
The Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of citizens and our commitment to democracy - these in a way make Republic Day also a festival of sanskaars, which makes our future generations cognizant of democracy and their democratic responsibilities, and also imparts to them the culture, moral values and norms inherent in our democracy.
But still in our country, the duties and rights of citizens are not being debated and discussed as intensively and extensively as it should be done.
I hope that the amount of emphasis that is given to the rights at every level during most of the time, is also given to discussing duties of citizens in an emphatic manner.
All of us pay tributes to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the motherland, by observing silence for 2 minutes at 11 am on 30th January.
As a society, as a nation, the 2 minute tribute of silence on 30th January at 11 am, should become our instinctive nature.
I congratulate and felicitate the young heroes and their families who were honoured with various gallantry awards on the eve of this Republic Day.
There are various categories of these gallantry awards like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Vishisht Seva Medal and Param Vishisht Seva Medal.
I want to urge the youth especially that since you are very active on social media, you can do one thing.
Surf the Net to do some research on the valiant bravehearts, who have been bestowed with these honours, compose a few good lines about them and share these with your friends and companions.
When we get to know the in depth details of their courage, bravery, valour in detail, we are filled with astonishment and pride and we also get inspired
While we were all delighted with the tidings of enthusiasm and celebration of 26th January, at the same time, some of our army Jawans posted in Kashmir for the defense of the country, achieved martyrdom due to the avalanche.
I respectfully pay my homage to all these brave soldiers, I bow to them.
My young friends, you know very well that I regularly do my Mann Ki Baat.
January, February, March, April all these are for every family, months of most severe test
Normally it is one or two children in a home due to appear at their exams, but the entire family feels the burden of it.
This led me to believe that this is the right time for me to talk to my student friends, their guardians and their teachers, because for many years now, wherever I have gone, whomsoever I have met, examination appeared to be a great source of anxiety.
Troubled families, harassed students, tense teachers one sees a very strange psychological atmosphere prevailing in each home
When Id declared that I would talk on this topic, many teachers, guardians and students sent me their messages, questions, suggestions and also expressed their anguish and narrated their problems.
And after going through all these outpourings, some ideas came to my mind, which I want to share with you today.
I received a telephonic message from Srishti.
You too listen to what Srishti has to say: -Sir, I want to tell you that during exam time, very often in our homes, in the neighbourhood and in our society, a very terrifying and scary atmosphere pervades.
This leads to a situation, where the students instead of feeling inspired feel tremendously down.
So I just want to ask you this, cant this be transformed into a pleasant atmosphere
Well, the question has been posed by Srishti, but it is a question that must be there in the minds of all of you.
But there are very few people for whom there is pleasure in the exam
for most people exam means pressure
Now, it is up to you to decide whether you consider the exams pleasure or pressure.
Those who will consider it a pleasure, will have achievements, while those who will consider exams a pressure, will have to repent.
And therefore my opinion is that exams are like a festival and, hence, must be celebrated.
This is the inherent strength of a festival.
All the family members have to work as a team and play with zeal their respective roles to make this festival of examination a success.
You will witness for yourself the ensuing change.
Actually from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup and from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these 3-4 months have examinations galore.
It is the responsibility of each one of us that in our own ways, observing our respective traditions and in tune with our respective family surroundings, we should strive to transform every year these 3-4 months into a festival.
And therefore I shall say to you 'Smile More Score More'
If you are tense, then all the doors seem to be closed, nothing can enter from outside and nothing can come out from inside.
The thought process comes to a standstill and that in itself becomes a burden.
It is not that you do not have the knowledge, it is not that you do not have the information, and it is not that you have not worked hard
But when there is tension, your knowledge, your wisdom, your information all these buckle under and the tension rides over you.
And therefore it is necessary to remember that 'a happy mind is the secret for a good mark sheet
Sometimes it also appears that we are not able to perceive examinations in a proper perspective.
It seems to become a question of life and death.
See, the exam you are going to appear at is the exam of what you have studied during this whole year.
But it is not a test of your life.
It is not a test of what kind of life have you lived, how is the life you are living now and what is the life you aspire to live.
There must have been many occasions in your life, when, besides the examinations that you appeared at inside the classrooms with notebooks, you had to encounter and endure many tests and trials.
We all have before us the extremely inspiring example of our former President Dr.
J.
One Richa Anand Ji has sent me this question: -Today what I see as the biggest challenge facing the education is that it has come to focus solely on examinations.
Marks have become all important.
As a result, the competition has multiplied leading to a very high increase of stress in the students also.
So I would like to know your views concerning the current direction of education and its future course.
Although she herself has given the answer to her query, but Richa Ji wishes that I too must put forth my views on the matter.
Marks and mark-sheet serve a limited purpose.
If you will have faith in these things, then marks will automatically follow you and you will never have to chase marks
It is the knowledge that is going to be of use to you in life, so are skill, self-confidence and determination.
When you have to fight a big law suit and you go to a lawyer to engage his services, do you look at the mark-sheet of that lawyer
You only look at his experience, his knowledge, and the graph of his success.
And therefore this burden of hankering for marks hinders us sometimes from going in the right direction.
Richa Ji had also mentioned about PRATISPARDHA, meaning 'competition with others'.
It is a huge psychological battle.
To make myself instantly clear, I shall cite an example from the field of sports.
It is a feature in the life of most of the successful players that they compete with themselves.
Let us take the example of Mr. Sachin Tendulkar.
He kept on breaking his own records consecutively and consistently for about twenty years, everytime surpassing and outdoing himself and thus continuously forging ahead.
What a wonderful journey of life he has had, only because he followed the route of competing with himself rather than competing with others
Friends, in every field of life and when taking exams, if you were able to study peacefully for two hours earlier, then are you now able to do so for three hours
If you couldnt wake up at the decided time in the morning and were thus delayed, now can you get up early on time
You couldnt sleep earlier due to exam tension, are you able to sleep now
He further writes, My mother was not educated.
Yet, she would sit by me and ask me to solve problems in Mathematics.
I shall urge parents to lay emphasis on just three points - acceptance, mentoring and sharing time.
Expectation on the part of parents and teachers is the root cause of the problem.
You will feel much lighter.
I was present there and I saw that he did not ask a single question on the state of his health
he just sat down with no reference to the ailment or to the situation.
He started cracking jokes and lightened the atmosphere in a matter of just a few minutes.
In a way, we terrify a patient with constant references to his ailment.
I would like to convey to parents that we do exactly the same with our children.
Have you ever thought of creating an atmosphere of joy and laughter for children during exams
See it for yourself, the whole ambience will be transformed.
I have received an incredible phone call.
Namaskar, Pradhan Mantriji, I cannot divulge my name because of something that I did in my childhood.
Once, when I was young, I had made an attempt to cheat in my exams.
Moreover, when I tried to use unfair means to pass the exam, I got caught and a lot of my friends around me also had to undergo distress because of me.
These shortcut ways become the reason for using unfair means.
Time and again you must have heard advisories on staying away from unfair means.
I am reiterating the same, once again.
Look at the scourge of cheating, copying and such unfair means from any angle and in any form
If one devotes the same time and the same creativity in addressing issues pertaining to exams, one would never require any unfair means in the first place.
Now listen to this phone call, which I have received: -Namaskar, Pradhan Mantri Ji, my name is Monica and since I am a class 12th student, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions regarding the Board Exams.
My first question is, what can we do to reduce the stress that builds up during our exams and my second question is, why are exams all about work and no play.
During exam days, if I talk about sports and games, your teachers, your parents will be angry with me.
What kind of a Prime Minister is this, who is asking children to come out and play during exams, they might say
People generally nurse the notion that if students indulge in sporting activities, they become careless about their studies.
This notion is basically unfounded.
It is the root cause of this problem.
With so much to do, have you ever thought of spending a couple of moments gazing at the sky, looking with wonder at the flora around you, lightening your spirits a bit
If only for five minutes, give yourself a break.
You will feel the onset of a certain ease in your work.
I do not know if everyone likes this or not, but I am saying it out of personal experience.
And for deep breathing you do not need to confine yourself to your room.
Just be under the open sky, go to the roof top, do deep breathing for five minutes and return to your studies.
Some of you feel like studying more and more, keeping awake for late hours in the night.
No.
Ensure adequate sleep for the body that is required.
Your overall efficiency will rise by leaps and bounds.
When I address election rallies, sometimes I suffer from a sore throat or a hoarse voice.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
He asked me, How many hours do you sleep
But this does not mean that you keep sleeping all the time.
Please, do not do that, else your family members will be displeased with me.
This is a wonderful remedy for maintaining the vigour of the mind, brain and body.
Anyway, young friends, you are engrossed in preparing for your exams and here I am, engaging you in matters close to my heart.
Of course, it is quite possible that my words this morning will act as a relaxant for you.
In the same breath, I will add that do not let these remarks of mine be a burden on you.
If you cannot do it, please do not do it, else this too will weigh heavily on you.
Just as I advise your parents not to be burdensome to you, the same applies to me too.
Keeping your resolve in mind, with confidence in yourself, set out for your exams.
My best wishes to your.
In order to clear a test, treat the test as a festive occasion.
You will never feel a test, a test again.
Make headway with this Mantra.
My dear countrymen, on 1st February 2017, Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years.
On this occasion I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the officers and jawans of Coast Guard for their service to the Nation.
It is a matter of pride and honour that with its indigenously built 126 ships and 62 aircrafts, it has carved a coveted place for itself amongst the 4 biggest Coast Guards of the world.
True in letter and spirit to the motto, securing the countrys maritime borders and maritime environment, the jawans of Coast Guard are relentlessly at work night and day, braving the most adverse conditions.
Last year, personnel of Coast Guard undertook a campaign of cleaning up of our coastal areas also, over and above their routine duties.
Thousands participated in this campaign.
Along with coastal security, they displayed concern towards coastal cleanliness and deserve accolades for their act.
Not many people would be aware that in our Coast Guard, not just men, but women too are discharging their duties and responsibilities shoulder to shoulder, and most successfully.
Our Coast Guard women officers are pilots, work as Observers, and not just that, they command Hovercrafts as well.
In the backdrop of the fact that maritime security today has become an issue of global concern and the excellence displayed by Coast Guard in securing Indias coast line, I extend my heartiest felicitations to them on their 40th birthday.
1st February is the festival of Vasant Panchami.
It is considered an occasion to worship Vidya, knowledge.
And not just that, it is a celebration of inspiration for brave hearts.
Mera Rang de Basanti Chola is a perfect example of that.
I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on the pious occasion of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio too infuses myriad novel hues of creativity and imagination.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to be connected with you.
Best wishes to you.
My fellow countrymen, Namaskar, many felicitations and seasons greetings to you on the occasion of Christmas.
Today is the day to give importance in our lives to service, sacrifice and compassion.
Jesus had said - The poor do not need our favours but our acceptance with affection.
In the Gospel According to Saint Luke, it is written that Jesus not only served the poor but also praised the service done by the poor, and this is what real empowerment is.
A tale associated with this incident is also very popular.
It has been mentioned in that story that Jesus was standing near the treasury of a temple
many rich people came and donated bountifully
then a poor widow came and parted with only two copper coins.
Now just two copper coins really do not amount to much.
Thus it was natural that there was a lot of curiosity in the minds of the disciples gathered there.
Then, Jesus declared that the widow was the greatest of those donors because while the others had donated substantially, that widow had given away all she possessed.
About two days ago, I had the opportunity to launch many a developmental work in Banaras, the sacred workplace of Malviyaji.
I also laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre in BHU at Varanasi.
Today is also the birthday of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Venerable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
This country can never forget Ataljis contributions.
Under his leadership, the country proudly grew in stature in the field of nuclear power also.
Whether in the role of a party leader, Member of Parliament, a minister or the Prime Minister, Atalji always established an ideal.
I salute Atalji on his birthday and pray to God for his good health.
As a party worker I had the privilege of working with Atalji.
Many memories emerge before my eyes.
This morning when I tweeted, I shared a video, in which you can see for yourself how as a small party worker one had the fortune of having affection showered upon him by Atalji.
Today, on Christmas Day, as a gift the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes.
In a way it is the beginning of two new schemes.
Everybody wants to understand and learn from each other.
To encourage this trend, to strengthen mobile banking and to inculcate the habit of making e-payments, the Government of India is launching from today encouragement schemes for consumers as well as traders.
To encourage customers, the scheme is Lucky Grahak Yojana and to encourage traders the scheme is Digi Dhan Vyapaar Yojana.
starting today this scheme will continue for the next 100 days.
Everyday fifteen thousand people are going to receive rewards of one thousand rupees each.
In addition, there would be a grand draw once every week for such customers in which the prize money will be in lakhs of rupees and three months later on April 14th, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar, there would be a mega bumper draw where rewards would be in crores of rupees.
Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana is mainly for traders and businessmen.
Traders should adopt this scheme themselves and should encourage their customers too in order to make their business cashless.
Such traders will also be rewarded separately and there would be thousands of these rewards.
The traders will run their business activities smoothly and will also have an opportunity to win rewards.
This scheme has been designed keeping all sections of society in mind, with a special focus on the poor and the lower middle class segments.
Those who make purchases of more than three thousand rupees will not be entitled to rewards under this scheme.
Even the poor people can use USSD on simple feature or ordinary mobile phones to buy and sell goods as well as make payments and thus all of them can also become prospective beneficiaries of this reward scheme.
In rural areas too, people can buy or sell through AEPS and they can also win rewards.
These 300 million people can immediately become part of this rewards scheme.
It is as simple as sending WhatsApp messages on the mobile.
My dear countrymen, I feel delighted to learn that the awareness about how to use technology, making e-payments, making online payments is spreading very fast.
During the past few days, the cashless transactions, or cashless trading has increased by 200 to 300.
To give cashless trading a big impetus, Government of India has taken a very major decision.
The business community, our traders can well comprehend how momentous this decision is.
Those businessmen who adopt digital transactions, who develop online payment process instead of cash transactions in their trade activities will get Income Tax rebate.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Mr.
Chandrababu Naidu is the head of a committee which is considering various schemes under this.
However, I have seen that the governments also have initiated and implemented many schemes.
Ive been told that Assam Government has decided to grant a 10 discount on property tax and business license fee if payments are made through digital transaction.
The branches of Grameen, that is, Rural Banks there getting 75 of their customers to make at least two digital transactions between January and March will get 50 thousands rupees rewards from the government.
They have announced that under the Uttam Panchayat for Digi-Transaction, rewards of 5 lakh rupees will be given to villages doing 100 digital transaction till 31st March, 2017.
Assam Government has decided to reward 5 thousand rupees to the first 10 farmers as Digital Krishak Shiromani, who will buy seeds and fertilizers entirely through digital payments.
I congratulate Assam Government and also all those state governments who have taken such initiatives.
A number of organisations have also successfully carried out many experiments to promote digital transactions amongst the rural folk and poor farmers.
I have been told that GNFC or Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers Chemicals Limited, which primarily manufactures fertilizers, has installed a thousand PoS machines for sale of fertilizers for the convenience of farmers and in just a few days 35 thousand farmers were sold 5 lakh sacs of fertilizers on digital payment and this was accomplished in only two weeks
And the interesting fact is that compared to last year the fertilizer sales of GNFC have gone up by 27 percent.
Brothers and sisters, the informal sector occupies a major segment in our economy and in our pattern of life and mostly these people are paid wages for their labour and hard work in cash. They are paid their salaries in cash and we know that due to this, they are exploited also.
If they are to receive 100 rupees, they get only 80 rupees, if they are to be paid 80 rupees, they are given only 50 rupees.
In addition, they are also becoming entitled to the other benefits due to them.
Our country is blessed with the maximum number of young people.
Thus, we are favourably placed for using technology.
A country like India should be ahead of everybody else in this field.
Our youth have benefitted quite a lot from Start-Ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity for our youth.
They should impart to this as much strength as they can with their new ideas, technology and processes.
But we must also connect with the drive to rid the country of black money and corruption with all our might.
My dear countrymen, I request every month before Mann Ki Baat that you please give your suggestions, share your thoughts
and of the thousands of such suggestions received this time on MyGov, on NarendraModiApp, I can definitely say that 80 to 90 suggestions were pertaining to the war against corruption and black money, there was mention of demonetization.
After I examined all the suggestions, I can say that these can macroscopically be roughly divided into three categories.
Some have written in detail about people facing difficulties and encountering inconveniences.
The other group of correspondents have stressed that this is such a good work being carried out for the welfare of the country, such a sacred task but they have also noted that in spite of this there are many scams being committed and new avenues of dishonesty are being explored.
The third group is the one which has, while wholeheartedly supporting the action being taken, clearly stressed that this fight must be carried forward
corruption and black money must be completely destroyed and if this requires even more tough steps to be taken, those must be taken. We have many people writing this most emphatically.
I am thankful to the countrymen for helping me by writing these innumerable letters to me.
Shriman Gurumani Kewal has written on MyGov - This step of reigning in black money is praiseworthy.
We are battling corruption, black money etc on the lines of Military Forces.
Somebody spread a rumour that the spelling on the currency note was faulty, someone said salt prices had spiraled, someone proclaimed that the 2000 rupee note would also be withdrawn, even 500 and 100 rupee denominations notes were rumoured to be on their way out.
But I have seen that despite rampant rumour mongering, citizens have stood firm with their faith intact.
And not just that, many people came to the fore and through their creativity and intelligence, exposed the rumour mongers, brought out the falsity of the rumours and established the truth.
I salute this great ability of the people also from the core of my heart.
My dear countrymen, I am experiencing one thing every moment. When a hundred and twenty five crore countrymen are standing by you, nothing is impossible.
The people represent the will of the Almighty and their blessings become His blessings.
I thank the people of this country and salute them for participating in this Mahayagya against black money and corruption with utmost zeal.
It was my earnest wish that the ongoing campaign against corruption and black money, including the realm of political parties and political funding, be discussed extensively in the Parliament.
Had the House functioned properly, there would have been comprehensive deliberation.
Some people are spreading rumours that political parties enjoy all kinds of concessions.
The law applies equally to all.
Whether it is an individual, an organisation or a political party, everyone has to abide by law and one will have to.
People, who cannot endorse corruption and black money openly, resort to searching for faults of the government relentlessly.
Why are rules changed time and again
This government is for the sake of the people.
For the past 70 years, what kind of forces are involved in this murky enterprise of perfidy and corruption
When I have resolved to wage battle against them, they too come up with new tactics everyday to thwart the governments efforts.
On the other hand, many people have mentioned in their letters all kinds of wrongdoing which are going on how newer wily ways and means are being devised.
Information being received from common citizens is many times higher than that being obtained through government machinery.
And we are by and large being successful in our operations on account of the awareness and alertness that the people have displayed.
For those of you wanting to share such information, you can send it on an e-mail address set up by the government for this purpose.
I specially thank writers of such letters, since their writing exudes a certain confidence, fortified with blessings.
I sincerely assure you that this is in no way going to be a full stop.
This is just the beginning.
We have to win this battle and the question of feeling exhausted or stopping simply does not arise. Armed with the good wishes of a hundred and twenty five crore countrymen, there is no question of a retreat.
You are possibly aware of a Law about Benami Property in our country which came into being in 1988, but neither were its rules ever framed, nor was it notified.
It just lay dormant gathering dust.
We have retrieved it and turned it into an incisive law against Benami Property.
In the coming days, this law will also become operational.
For the benefit of the Nation, for the benefit of the people, whatever needs to be done will be accorded our top priority.
Indias ranking has gone up in the Doing Business Report of the World Bank.
In the Global Competitive Report of the World Economic Forum, India has made a big leap upwards by 32 ranks.
In the Global Innovation Index 2016, we have moved up 16 rungs and in the Logistics Performance Index 2016 of the World Bank, we have risen by 19 ranks.
There are many reports whose evaluation indicate that India is taking rapid strides ahead.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of Parliament became the object of ire of our countrymen.
Indignation was expressed everywhere about the activities in the Parliament.
The President and Vice President also explicitly expressed their displeasure.
But even in such a situation, sometimes good things also take place which create a sense of satisfaction in the mind.
Amid the din in Parliament, an excellent task was accomplished, which has not attracted due attention of the country.
Brothers and sisters, today with pride and joy I would like to mention that a bill in connection with my governments mission on Divyangjan, that is, differently or specially abled people was passed in Parliament.
For this, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. On behalf of millions of Divyangjan of the country I express my thanks.
Our government is committed to the welfare of Divyaangs.
Personally too, I have strived to lend momentum to this campaign.
My intention was to ensure that the Divyangjan secure their due rights and also the honour and dignity that they are entitled to.
Our efforts and our trust were fortified by our Divyaang brothers and sisters when they returned with 4 medals from the Paralympics.
With their triumph, not only did they do the Nation proud, they pleasantly surprised many people through their capabilities and prowess.
Our Divyaang brothers and sisters are an invaluable heritage, a precious endowment, just as every citizen of the country is.
Today I am immensely delighted that the passing of this Law for the welfare of the Divyaangjan will open up additional avenues of employment for them.
In government jobs, the extent of reservation for them has been enhanced to 4.
The government has passed the new law in consonance with the spirit expressed by the United Nations.
Earlier there were seven Divyaang categories
My young friends, during the last few weeks, news items coming in from the world of sports have made all of us proud.
In the cricket series against England, India has triumphed 4-0.
In this, the performance of some of the younger players deserves a special word of praise.
The young Karun Nair scored a triple century and K.
L.
Rahul played a brilliant 199 run innings.
Test captain Virat Kohli batted extremely well and also provided inspiring leadership.
Indian Cricket teams off-spin bowler R.
Ashwin has been declared Cricketer of the Year as well as Best Test Cricketer by the ICC for the year 2016.
My heartiest congratulations and many good wishes go to all of them.
After a gap of 15 years, there was good news, in fact grand news from the hockey arena too.
The Junior Hockey Team lifted the World Cup.
This festive occasion came to us after fifteen years as the Junior Hockey team won the World Cup.
Heartiest congratulations to these young players for this grand feat.
This achievement is a very good omen for the future of our Hockey team.
Last month our Women players too won laurels.
Indian Womens Hockey Team won the Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days ago in the under-18 Asia Cup, Indian Womens Hockey Team secured the Bronze Medal.
I congratulate all our Cricket and Hockey team players from the core of my heart.
My dear countrymen, may 2017 be a year full of joy and enthusiasm may all your resolves be crowned with success
may the poorest of the poor get an opportunity to lead a better and fuller life of happiness and contentment
For the year 2017, my best and brightest wishes to all my countrymen.
Many, many thanks.
Like every year, this Diwali too, I had gone to the border, to the China border, to celebrate the occasion with our soldiers, our jawans.
I celebrated Diwali with ITBP men and army jawans on the lofty heights of the Himalayas.
I do it every time, but this Diwali was an entirely different experience.
The heartening effect of the novel way in which our 1. 25 billion countrymen dedicated this Diwali to soldiers of our army, to our defence forces, was clearly evident on their faces.
Some wrote poems, some drew pictures, a few created cartoons, others made videos
it was as if every home had been transformed into an army post.
And when I saw those letters, I used to be amazed at the magnitude of creativity and emotions behind this endeavour.
And this gave rise to a thought in MyGov that out of these, selected items could be compiled to make a coffee table book.
A soldier wrote to me Mr. Prime Minister, we soldiers have all the festivals like Holi and Diwali on the borders.
It felt as if we were celebrating Diwali together with a hundred and twenty five crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, this warmth of emotion, this fervour that has been kindled in the hearts of our defence forces, our soldiers this Diwali, should this be confined to only a few occasions
I appeal to you that we should make it our nature, our characteristic as a society, as a Nation that whether it be a celebration of a festival or any joyous occasion, we should keep the soldiers, the jawans of the military of our nation in our hearts and minds.
When the entire nation stands by the armed forces, their might mutiplies a hundred and twenty five crore times.
A few days ago, all Pradhans from the villages of Jammu Kashmir had come to see me.
They were from the Jammu Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
They had come from different villages of the Kashmir valley, there were around 40-50 Pradhans.
I got an opportunity to speak to them at length.
They had come to discuss a few points on the development of their villages
they had some demands. But when the deliberations began, issues such as conditions in the valley, the law and order situation, the future of children came up in a natural manner.
In the course of the conversation, there was also a mention of schools in Kashmir that had been set afire. And I felt these Pradhans were as saddened as our other countrymen were, at that.
They too felt that it was not just schools, it was the future of the children, that had been set ablaze.
I had urged them to focus on these childrens future, on their return home.
Recently, just a few days ago, when the Board examinations were held, 95 of the sons and daughters of Kashmir, the young students appeared in the examinations.
For their resolute zeal I congratulate these students and I also felicitate their parents, their kith and kin, their teachers and all the Gram Pradhans as well from the depths of my heart.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I asked people for suggestions for Mann ki Baat, I can say that almost all the suggestions that were received echoed one theme.
Everyone wanted me to speak in more detail about the 500 1000 rupee notes.
And I had also foreseen that this would result in all of us having to face various new difficulties in our day-to-day lives.
These maladies have been afflicting us for the past 70 years and the campaign for getting rid of these can never be an easy task.
I can very well understand the problems you are going through
500 and 1000 rupee notes and such a vast country, wide proliferation of currencies, billions and trillions of bank notes and amidst that, this decision the whole world is minutely observing, every economist is analysing it, evaluating it.
The whole world is watching will hundred and twenty-five crore Indians finally attain success after facing numerous hardships
Across the country, central government, state governments, all units of the local self government institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, over one and a half lakh post offices, over a lakh Bank-Mitras are relentlessly at work, day and night, with complete dedication.
In the midst of immense and varied stress, all these individuals are working hard, maintaining a calm and composed demeanour, taking it as a Yagya of Service to the Nation, an attempt towards a great transformation.
They begin work early in the morning, not knowing when they will wind up at night.
Money was needed urgently.
Innumerable such incidents come to light everyday through television, media, newspapers and mutual conversations.
I profusely thank all such compatriots who have striven hard to perform this MAHAYAGYA, and lived up to the lofty virtue of PURUSHARTH.
The greatest validation of SHAKTI, strength, comes when the same is put to test.
I distinctly remember, when the Prime Ministers Jan Dhan Yojana was launched, bank personnel earnestly and zealously shouldered their responsibilities and showed that they could achieve what had not been accomplished during the last 70 years.
Today, once again, they have accepted the challenge and I do believe that the steely resolve of one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen, their collective demonstration of PURUSHARTH will go a long way in investing our nation with a new power and strength on its path of progress.
But vices are so widespread and deep-rooted that even today there are people whose vicious habits refuse to die.
Even now, some people think that they can re-introduce into the system, money from corruption, black money, unaccounted wealth and Benami money (money in unknown persons name), using some route or the other.
They seek illegal means to save their ill-gotten wealth.
The saddest part is that, for this too, they have chosen to misuse the poor, the underprivileged people.
By misguiding the poor, enticing them through the vices of avarice and temptation, wrongfully pumping money into their bank accounts, or getting them to undertake some wrong activities, some people are trying to save their black money.
I want to tell such people today - whether you reform or not is up to you, whether you respect and follow the law or do otherwise is again up to you
but, for Gods sake, please do not play with the lives of poor people.
The government does not wish that our countrymen should face undue hardships.
I am an ordinary citizen of Village Tiraali of Tehsil Tiraali in District Harda of Madhya Pradesh.
Your move to demonetize 1000 and 500 rupee notes is a commendable step.
I wish that in Mann Ki Baat, you quote instances of people, who, despite facing hardships, have welcomed this step for the nations progress.
I want to thank you wholeheartedly because you had said that good days will come, but nobody had ever thought that you would take such a big step.
You have taught a lesson to black money mongers and the corrupt through the demonetization of 1000 and 500 rupee notes.
For each and every citizen of India there could be no better days than these.
It gives us such a great happiness and a sense of pride to know that the common man in my country has such a wonderful capability.
So people go and eat there and make payments on their next visit after 2, 4 or 6 days.
This is the strength of my country which encompasses the spirit of service, of sacrifice and also of genuineness and honesty.
During elections, I used to have , that is discussions over tea and this got publicised around the whole world.
I learnt that on 17th November, a marriage was solemnised with Chai Par Charcha in Surat.
One daughter at Surat in Gujarat served only tea to all the guests who had come to her wedding.
I once saw in the news on TV, when I had returned late in the night, a report about a small village called Dhekiajulli () in Assam, where tea workers reside.
Now, what they did when they received a 2000 rupee note as wages
Four women from the neighborhood got together and jointly made purchases and made the payment with the 2000 Rupee note
See, how the village life is also getting transformed.
Some people are getting instant benefits from this campaign.
On asking how things were going on, I got to know about the impact in small towns.
many people were in the habit of not making tax payments such as water tax, electricity bills, etc.
, they just did not pay. Now all of us know very well that the poor people always like to clear their dues 2-3 days in advance.
It is the well-off people, who do not pay their taxes and bills as they have higher connections and know that nobody is going to ask or do anything against them. Thus there are big arrears of payments, which remain pending.
All municipalities receive hardly 50 of their tax revenues.
But, this time after the decision taken on the 8th instant, people rushed to deposit their old currency notes.
47 urban institutions had received about 3 to 3. 5 thousand crore rupees in taxes last year.
You will be surprised and also happy to know that during this one week, these institutions received 13 thousand crore rupees.
But, I especially wish to compliment the farmers of our country.
I was just gathering data of the sowing of this crop season.
Our farmers have discovered new avenues amidst the present difficulties.
The government has also taken many important decisions, wherein priority has been accorded to our farmers and villages.
Small traders and businessmen of our country provide employment opportunities besides adding to the economic activities.
In the last budget we had taken an important decision that just like the big malls, small shopkeepers in the villages will also be allowed to operate round the clock and no rule will stop them from doing so because I felt that when the big malls can function 24 hours, why the poor village-shopkeepers should not get the same facility
A number of initiatives were taken to grant them loans under Mudra Yojana.
But naturally they too had to face difficulties due to this decision.
And, I want to tell our small trader brothers and sisters that this is a ripe opportunity for them too to make their entry into the digital world.
You too download Apps of Banks on your mobile phones. You too keep a POS machine for transactions in Credit Cards.
You too learn to do cashless business.
You can see how the big malls are expanding their business with the help of latest technology. A small trader can also expand the business with the help of this user friendly technology.
There is no possibility of things going wrong, but there certainly is an opportunity to grow.
I invite you all. You can make a very big contribution in creating a cashless society.
There are technological methods which are safe, secure and instantaneous.
I want to tell my worker brothers and sisters too that you have faced heavy exploitation. Wages shown on paper are much higher than the wages actually paid to you.
But dear friends, you are my true soldiers, my true partners.
We have got a wonderful chance to serve our mother India and to take our country to new economic heights.
The older generation does not have the exposure and experience of the new world which you possess.
Possibly your elder brother and even your parents and uncles and aunts also may not know.
You know what an App is, what online banking is and how online ticket booking is done.
For you these are routine things and you also make use of them.
But, the great task that the country wants to accomplish today is the realisation of our dream of a Cashless Society.
It is true that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible.
Wallet simply means an e-purse.
Various types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families in India have Rupay Cards.
Used scarcely earlier, after 8th November the poor people have started using Rupay Cards and this usage has seen almost 300 surge.
Just as there is a prepaid card for mobile phones, prepaid cards are also available in banks to facilitate expenditure.
And, this procedure is as simple as sending messages through WhatsApp.
Even an illiterate person today knows how to send and also forward WhatsApp messages.
Not only this, with the simplification of technology, we do not require any big smart phones for this purpose.
A washerman, vegetable vendor, milk supplier, newspaper vendor, tea stall owner or a chanaa vendor, everyone can easily use this facility.
I have provided further impetus to simplifying this system even more.
All banks are engaged in this and are doing their best.
My dear young friends, despite all these things, there is an entire generation which is ignorant in these matters. And I know it very well that all of you are actively contributing in this great task.
Every technology needed for online spending will definitely be available on your mobile phone.
But not only this, you must devote half an hour, one hour or two hours daily to educate at least 10 families about what this technology is, how this technology is to be used, how to download the Apps of your banks, how to spend money from ones account, how to make payment to shopkeepers.
You have to voluntarily lend your leadership to this great campaign, this Maha Abhiyan, to create a cashless society, to eradicate corruption from our country, to abolish the scourge of black money and to help people in overcoming their difficulties and problems.
When you teach the common citizen these new techniques, he will probably become free from all his worries. And if all the young people of India join in this great endeavour, I dont think it will take much time.
We can emerge and take our place in the world as a new modern India within a period of one month.
And you can do this through your mobile phone by going to 10 houses daily and bringing 10 families daily under the ambit of this campaign.
I invite you come, do not just support this transformation but become one of its leading soldiers and ensure that we achieve the desired transformation.
We shall carry forward this struggle to free our country from the evils of corruption and black money.
There are many countries in the world where the youth have changed the nations life and it has to be accepted that it is the youth which brings about the great changes, which creates revolutions.
Kenya made a resolve and set up a mobile based system M-PESA, adopted appropriate technology which was named M-PESA and today in Kenya, in this region of Africa, total business is ready to shift to this system.
That country has brought about a big revolution.
My dear young friends, I once again earnestly appeal to you to take forward this campaign.
I invite you to work for this mission individually and collectively in every school, in every college, in every university, in NCC and in NSS.
You must have noticed, that Amitabh Ji, the most popular actor of this century, has been whole-heartedly promoting the campaign for cleanliness.
It appears as if the subject of cleanliness has become so dear to him that even on his fathers birth anniversary he remembered the Cleanliness Mission.
He has quoted one line from a poem written by Harivansh Rai Bachchan Ji wherein he said: Mitti Ka Tann, Masti Ka Mann, Kshan Bhar Jeewan, Mera Parichay.
My dear countrymen, now your views and your sentiments on Mann Ki Baat though your letters, on MyGov, on NaarendraModiApp keep me constantly connected with you.
Presently Mann Ki Baat is broadcast at 11 AM but we are going to start its broadcast in regional languages immediately after my Hindi broadcast.
Deepawali is celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm throughout our country.
In India almost on all 365 days of the year, one festival or the other is celebrated in some part of the country.
Somebody watching from a distance would genuinely feel that festivity is a synonym for the Indian way of life, and this is natural too.
Right from the vedic period to the present day, there has been a tradition of festivities in India which, of course, has matched the occasions at different periods of time.
However, we can very well discern one characteristic that this entire journey of Indian festivals, its widespread effect, its depth, its reach to each individual are all interlinked with one spirit which exhorts evolution from the self to the whole, the collective existence.
The idea is that there should be a development of individuals and their personalities, the limited scope of thinking must expand and cover not only the whole society but, in fact, the whole universe. And this is achieved through these festivals.
What crop has been harvested by the farmers and how that yield is to be made a part of the festivities, what food habits will be appropriate in a particular season from the health point of view. Our ancestors had very scientifically encompassed all these aspects in our festivals.
Today, the whole world is talking about the environment.
Destruction of nature is a matter of great concern.
Indias tradition of celebrating festivals has been one to strengthen our love for nature and to develop each individual, right from childhood, as a cultured person.
Festivals have evoked a sense of responsibility towards everything, be it trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, etc.
Nowadays we observe Sunday as a holiday but in our older generations, labourers, fishermen and others from such sections of society used to observe holidays on New Moon, that is Amavasya and Full Moon, that is Poornima.
it is also the darkness of superstition and blind-faith, darkness of ignorance, darkness of poverty and also darkness of social evils.
By lighting lamps on Diwali, we try to overcome the darkness of these social shortcomings and individual blemishes attaining freedom from this darkness is the real essence of the festival of lights Deepawali, which we celebrate by lighting an earthen lamp, a diya.
The less privileged also put in all their efforts to clean their modest earthen utensils because it is Diwali time.
Thus, Diwali also encompasses a campaign of cleanliness.
But the need of the hour is that not only individual houses but the entire premises, all the neighbourhood, the whole village be cleaned.
We have to expand and spread this habit and tradition.
Now, the festival of Deepawali is not confined to the borders of India.
In almost all countries of the world, Deepawali is celebrated in one way or the other.
Many Governments in the world, their Parliaments and also their ruling classes are joining Deepawali festivities.
You may be aware that in America, the US Postal Service has released a special postage stamp on Deepawali this time.
The Prime Minister of Canada has shared on Twitter a picture of him lighting a lamp on the occasion of Diwali.
British premier Theresa May organised a reception in London involving all communities on Deepawali in which she herself participated.
And, there would hardly be a city in UK where Diwali is not celebrated with a great pomp and show.
The Prime Minister of Singapore has posted a picture on Instagram and has shared it proudly with the whole world. And, what is that picture about
It shows 16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament standing outside the Parliament all clad in Indian Sarees and this photo has gone viral.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had recently come to India. He told me that he would have to go back soon as he had to participate in Diwali celebrations there.
What I mean to say is that the festival of lights, Deepawali is becoming a festival of inspiration for the world community also to move from darkness to light.
On Deepawali people adorn good clothes, enjoy delicious food items and along with these there is also the bursting of fire-crackers in a big way.
The children and the young people very much enjoy this bursting of crackers.
But, at times children indulge in reckless bravado and take unnecessary risks. They unwittingly invite a mishap in trying to create a big blast by joining and bursting many crackers together.
They are not even mindful of their surroundings, which might have incendiary items leading to fire accidents.
News of such mishaps, fire breakouts and even tragic casualties become a cause of big concern on Deepawali.
To add to these woes, there is a situation of even the doctors in big numbers being unavailable as they too are away celebrating Deepawali with their families.
In India, the celebration of Diwali lasts for a number of days.
Alongside the festivities of Deepawali, we also prepare to celebrate Chhathh Pooja.
This Chhathh Pooja is a very important festival in the Eastern parts of our country. It is a big occasion there which lasts for four days.
But this also has a unique significance in that it gives a very special message to society.
Chhathh Upasana is actually an occasion to pray to the Sun God who gives us so much directly and indirectly that it cannot even be measured by us.
And this Chhathh Pooja is for paying obeisance to the almighty Sun.
But the adage is that people only pray to the rising sun.
However, during the Chhathh Pooja, people worship the setting Sun as well.
There is a very profound social message behind this tradition.
The sacrifice, devotion and zeal of the Jawans of our security forces occupies my mind and heart, my emotional universe all the time. And from that emanated my feeling and resolve that this Diwali must be dedicated to our security forces.
I invited my countrymen to join the Sandesh to Soldiers campaign.
And today, in all humility, I wish to proclaim that there would not be a single soul in India who would not have unbounded love for our Jawans, a sense of deep pride in the members of our security forces.
The way these sentiments have been expressed is surely giving strength to each of our countrymen.
Your messages to the Jawans of our security forces have proved to be a great morale booster which cannot be easily imagined.
Schools, colleges, students, villages, the underprivileged, traders, shopkeepers, political leaders, sportspersons, people from the cine world have all lit a lamp for the countrys Jawans, have joined in this campaign of sending a message of greetings and salutation to our Jawans.
The media also made this festival of lights into an opportunity and an occasion to express gratitude towards our armed forces.
While we are celebrating Diwali in the comforts of our homes, some of these Jawans are deployed in the desert areas, others are guarding the towering Himalayan peaks, some are guarding our industrial establishments and some are maintaining security vigil at the airports.
I can imagine how proud our soldiers feel at this moment.
Many messages and other expression forms have been received on Sandesh to Soldiers hashtag.
As a symbol of these, I would like to read a poem which has been sent by Shriman Ashwani Kumar.
Prime Minister, I am Shivani Mohan calling.
The Sandesh to Soldiers campaign has been launched on this Deepawali and is proving to be a morale booster for our brothers.
My Father and Father-in-law both served as Army Officers also.
So we are full of soldiers on both sides of the family.
Our Soldiers and Officers who are guarding our border have been receiving these affectionate messages and all in the Army circle are getting tremendous inspiration and encouragement.
I would also like to say that along with Army Officers and soldiers their families and their wives also make sacrifices.
Hence the entire army community is receiving a wonderful message and I would also like to wish you a Happy Diwali.
Be it a calamitous natural disaster or a law and order crisis or having to deal with enemies or to display courage in motivating misguided youth to return to the mainstream of life, Our Jawans are motivated by a sense of patriotism while rendering service to the nation.
One incident has been brought to my attention and I also want to tell you that how at the core of success small things gather and become a force to reckon with.
Well, Ill tell you the reason, one of the security personnel of ITBP called Vikas Thakur is from a small village in Sirmour district of Himachal.
This village is called Badhana.
Now this ITBP Jawan of ours was in his village on holidays from his duty.
And that is how Himachal Pradesh has been empowered to become an Open Defecation Free state.
It is rarely visited by people.
It came to the attention of Engineering students from the nearby urban areas that this village was in dire need of the toilets.
NCC cadets, NSS volunteers, Engineering students all together decided that the toilets will be constructed by them.
The building material needed to construct the toilets whether it was bricks or cement, the entire construction material was carried by the young men on their shoulders, spending an entire day walking in those forests.
And they themselves worked hard to construct toilets in that village, thus achieving the goal of making a remote village in faraway forests Open Defecation Free
So that is the reason why Kerala is on the verge of being declared free from open defecation.
The Municipal Councils and Corporations in Gujarat, numbering over 150 have been declared free from open defecation.
10 districts have also been declared free of open defecation.
There is also good news coming from Haryana, Haryana is going to celebrate its Golden jubilee on 1st November and in next few months, Haryana as an entire state will be freed from the stigma of open defecation.
As of now, seven districts in Haryana have got rid of open defecation.
Work is progressing at a very rapid pace in all of these states.
I have mentioned the work being carried out in some of the places.
I convey my heartfelt thanks to all the citizens in these states who have joined in the task of eliminating from our country the darkness resulting from filth.
My fellow citizens, the government plans for the welfare of the people through many of its schemes, and usually when the second scheme follows the first one then the previous scheme is supposed to be discontinued.
But generally due attention is not paid to this.
The old schemes continue along with the newly implemented schemes and there is also a wait for the next scheme on the anvil. This keeps on happening.
Now in our country houses having a gas stove, or those having electricity in the houses do not have a requirement for Kerosene.
And so far Ive heard that Haryana has managed to make seven or eight districts absolutely Kerosene free.
And with the pace at which this job has been undertaken, I believe that the entire state will soon be completely Kerosene free.
The only people feeling uncomfortable would be the dishonest persons and the middle-men.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is our guide forever.
It is the need of the times that weve to address the aspirations that have been arisen in the poor of our nation.
We have to help them in getting freed from their troubles in a stepwise manner.
Whatever the old dogmatic thinking might have been, but the society now must be freed from discrimination between our sons and daughters.
Now our schools are having toilets for girls as well as for boys.
For our daughters this is the opportunity to experience an India free from discrimination.
In the twenty-first century, having darkness still prevailing in our villages is something that is not acceptable now.
And the rural electrification drive to free the villages of darkness, this major campaign of electrification is proceeding successfully
We are trying to provide a smoke free life to 5 crore such families and we are successfully advancing in that direction.
The small trader, the small businessman, the vegetable vendor, the milk vendor, the one running a hair cutting salon has always been entrapped in the grip of the money lender, repaying interest all his life.
The stand up scheme and Jan Dhan account scheme are aimed at freeing these people from the clutches of notorious moneylenders.
Crediting money directly into bank accounts via Aadhar aims at directly sending money to the beneficiaries.
For the common man this is an opportunity to come out of the grip of middlemen.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, the 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great son of India who vowed to unite India and made this the sole object of his life.
Sir, as you know, 31st October is Sardar Patel jis birthday.
Sardar Patel is the great personality who devoted his whole life to unite the country and, I think, he succeeded fully in this mission of his, he brought everybody together.
But we may call it the countrys misfortune that on this day itself Indira Gandhi ji was assassinated.
And, as we all know, what terrible events took place after her assassination.
Sir, I want to know how we can check such unfortunate events and incidents from taking place.
My dear countrymen, this is not the pain of an individual person.
One Sardar, as history goes, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the second great man after Chanakya who carried on the stupendous job of uniting our country.
These atrocities against Sardars on the birth anniversary of that great personality who lived for unity, that SARDAR, is a page of history, which causes pain to all of us.
But amidst all these turmoils, we have to march forward chanting the Mantra of Unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of our country.
Different languages, different castes, different attires, different food habits and despite all these, unity in diversity remains our binding strength. That is Indias great characteristic quality.
Each generation has this responsibility, the governments have this responsibility to explore possibilities of integration in each corner of the country and highlight the elements of our integration.
We should keep away from the idea of separatism or the attitude of separatism and also guard the country from any such ideology.
Sardar Saheb gave us one India, now this is our collective responsibility to develop a Great India, a Shreshtha Bharat.
The Mantra of national unity is the very foundation of a strong and great India.
Sardar Sahebs journey started with a struggle for farmers.
But, Sardar Saheb was not just a man of struggle but also a man who created great things.
I pay my respectful homage to Sardar Saheb. And on 31st October, on National Unity Day, we must remember Sardar Saheb wherever we may be and take a resolve to preserve national unity.
My dear countrymen, during Diwali festivities, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of lights called PRAKASH UTSAV.
Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings and blessings are very relevant even now and are a source of inspiration for humanity as a whole.
Service, truth and everybodys well-being was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and harmony were his principal teachings.
Every teaching of Guru Nanak Dev preached that a campaign should be carried on to abolish superstitions, social disparities and social evils from the society.
It was then an era when evils such as untouchability, casteism and the chasm between the rich and the poor were at their peak. Guru Nanak Dev picked Bhai Laalo, as his co-worker at that crucial juncture.
Let us also follow the light of knowledge bestowed upon us by Guru Nanak Dev which inspires us to end social disparities, exhorts us to do our bit to fight against the evil of disparity.
My dear countrymen, once again let us dedicate this Diwali to our Jawans. My best wishes and greetings on Diwali to all of you.
I wish that all your dreams and resolves get fulfilled in every possible way May your lives be blessed with success and happiness.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
We recently lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri Sector in Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our armed forces.
They will foil with their valour every such conspiracy, and they are the ones to reach the pinnacle of bravery so that we, their 1.
But, the forces do not speak, they take action.
I also wish today to specially talk to those living in Kashmir.
Kashmiris are now beginning to recognize well the true face of the anti-national forces.
And as they understand the truth better, they are now separating themselves from such elements and have started moving on the path of peace.
Every parent wants the schools and colleges to be functioning properly at the earliest.
Farmers also feel that their ripened crops and fruits should reach markets across the country.
Economic activities too should be back on track.
And during the last few days there has been a movement towards restoration of trading activities.
We have to scale greater heights of development for the sake of our future generations.
I am very sure that by sitting together we shall definitely find solutions to our problems, find ways to move ahead and also pave a better path for future generations in Kashmir.
Providing security to people in Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration.
The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
These days I get to learn quite a lot through social media.
I get an opportunity to know and understand views of different people from all corners of the country and this actually adds to the strength of our democracy.
Recently, Harshvardhan, a young student of Eleventh Class has put before me a different type of thought.
And I have resolved that I would devote three more hours daily towards my studies.
I shall become a capable citizen so that I can serve the country well.
Brother Harshvardhan, I am happy to know that despite this atmosphere charged with anger, you are able to think in a healthy manner at such a young age.
But, dear Harshvardhan, I shall also like to add that the anger in the hearts of our countrymen is of a very high value.
It symbolises our national consciousness.
This anger has the resolve to do something.
Everyone wanted that something must happen, must be done.
Then, Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji had very aptly tried to touch the emotional universe of the country.
He gave the mantra-Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan which inspired the common people of the country to work for the nation.
Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji showed that even amidst the deafening sounds of gunfire and bombardment, there existed an alternative way for every citizen for expressing patriotism.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartik has written on NarendraModiApp that our athletes who participated in the Paralympics have created a new history and their performance is a triumph of the human spirit.
Shri Varun Vishwanathan has also written on NarendraModiApp that our athletes did a commendable job and that I should talk about this in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only the two of you but each one of our countrymen has felt an emotional attachment with our athletes who participated at the Paralympics.
Perhaps going beyond sporting achievements, these Paralympics and the performance by our athletes have transformed our attitude towards humanity, towards specially-abled, DIVYANG people.
And, I shall never be able to forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik had to say.
When the medal was awarded to her, she said Through this medal I have actually defeated the disability itself.
There is great strength in this remark.
This time 19 athletes, including three women, took part in Paralympics from our country.
Compared to normal sporting activities, when the DIVYANG play, in addition to physical ability and sporting skills, what are needed even more are will power and resolve.
You will be pleasantly surprised to learn that our sportspersons put up their best ever performance this time and won 4 medals including two gold, one silver and one bronze.
Brother Devendra Jhajharia won the gold medal in Javelin throw and repeated his gold winning performance after 12 years.
And, he was not born a DIVYANG. He lost one of his hands due to suffering electric current shock.
Just think about the perseverance and the huge effort put in by him in repeating the feat of winning a second gold medal at 35 years of age 12 years after winning the first one at 23.
Mariyappan Thangavelu won a gold medal in High Jump.
He is not from a big city, he does not come from a middle class or rich family.
Yet despite facing all sorts of difficulties and physical challenges, at the age of 21, through his unwavering determination he won the medal for the country.
As far as Athlete Deepa Malik is concerned, she has won laurels many a times by emerging victorious repeatedly.
Varun C.
Bhati won a bronze medal in High Jump.
Only very few people might be knowing as to what stupendous feats were performed by these DIVYANG people in the Paralympics this time.
Not only this, what really surprised me was the fact that the athlete, who finished fourth in this event amongst DIVYANG persons and thus missed winning any medal, actually took less time than the gold medalist of general category in completing the race.
I once again congratulate all our Paralympic athletes and India is progressing in the direction of preparing an effective plan for developing our athletes and also the facilities for the Paralympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
Government of India had organized a Mega Camp for DIVYANG persons and a number of world records were established that day.
A visually challenged little girl child Gauri Shardul, hailing from far flung forest area in the Dang District, can recite the complete Ramayana epic as she has learnt it by heart.
She rendered certain portions before me and when I presented her performance before other persons there, everyone was amazed.
I got an opportunity to publicly release a book that day wherein success stories from the lives of some DIVYANG persons had been compiled.
This deed found a mention in Guinness Book of World Records.
Three world records in a single day by DIVYANG people is a matter of great pride for our countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we had launched Swachha Bharat Mission two years ago on 2nd October, the birth anniversary of our revered Bapu.
That day too I had said that cleanliness should become our nature, a duty for every citizen and there should be an atmosphere harbouring a sense of revulsion against filth.
Now it is going to be nearly two years on 2nd October and I can confidently say that one hundred and twenty five crore people of the country have now become more aware about cleanliness.
I had said one step towards cleanliness and today we can say that each one of us has definitely tried to take one step further.
Everyone, be it a common citizen, an administrator, in Government offices or roads, bus stops or railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, from children to old persons, rural poor, farming women- everyone is contributing something in achieving cleanliness.
Friends in the media have also played a constructive role.
I also know that we still have to go much farther.
If we talk of rural India, so far 2 crore 48 lakh or say about two and a half crore toilets have been constructed and we intend to build another one and a half crore toilets in the coming one year.
A healthy competition towards achieving liberation from the habit of defecating in open has started at the levels of states, districts and the villages.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve very soon cent percent ODF targets.
My congratulations to those who have made it possible, and best wishes to those who are trying to reach the target.
I appeal to all of my countrymen that to maintain the dignity of our mothers and sisters and for the sake of health of our children, our country needs to get rid of this scourge.
Let us forge ahead with a strong resolution.
I specially want to suggest a scheme to my young friends who are currently technology savvy.
By dialing this number 1-9-6-9 you will be able to know the progress of construction of toilets in your city and will also be able to submit an application for construction of a toilet.
especially the younger generation must utilize it optimally.
Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward in this endeavour.
They can sponsor young professionals willing to work for Swachchhata Mission.
They can also be sent to various districts as Swachchha Bharat Fellows.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the Compost made out of waste.
They should supply this to the farmers who are willing to adopt organic farming.
This should also be supplied to those farmers who care about the health of their soil and are willing to improve its quality and also to those farmers whose soil quality has deteriorated because of over use of chemical fertilizers.
And for this, Shrimaan Amitabh Bachchan Ji is making a significant contribution as a brand ambassador.
I invite youngsters to set up new start ups also in this Waste to Wealth movement to develop the means and processes, to develop the suitable technology and accomplish mass production at an affordable cost.
This is a task worth doing.
This year a special programme INDOSAN India Sanitation Conference is being organized from 25th September to 2nd October.
Ministers, Chief Ministers as also Mayors and Commissioners of metropolitan cities will participate in brainstorming sessions on the sole issue of cleanliness.
What can be achieved with technology
What can be the financial model
How to mobilize public participation
How can employment opportunities be increased in this sphere
All these topics will be discussed.
And I see clearly that the news about cleanliness keeps pouring in.
I recently read in a newspaper that students of Gujarat Technological University launched a Jagran Abhiyan (Awereness Campaign) to build toilets in 107 villages.
They themselves put in physical labour and contributed significantly in constructing around 9000 toilets.
It might have come to your notice some time ago that under the leadership of Wing Commander Param Veer Singh, a team covered a distance of 2800 kilometres by swimming in Ganga from Dev Prayag to Ganga Sagar to spread the message of cleanliness.
Government of India has also chalked out an annual calendar for its departments.
Each department is to focus exclusively on cleanliness for a period of 15 days.
In the coming October month, from 1st October to 15th October, Drinking Water and Sanitation Department, Panchayati Raj Department and Rural Development Department these three are going to work under a designated roadmap in their respective areas.
Then during last two weeks of October from 16th October to 31st October, three more departments, namely Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs are going to take up cleanliness campaigns in the concerned areas.
I request the citizens also to get involved, wherever they feel that they too can pitch in these programmes.
You might have seen that a cleanliness survey campaign is also carried out these days.
Earlier, the cleanliness status was presented before the countrymen after conducting a survey of 73 cities.
Now, this survey will be conducted in about 500 cities with a population of more than 1 lakh.
Each city will imbibe a sense of confidence that, well, we have lagged behind but we will surely perform better next time.
In this manner an atmosphere of competition for cleanliness has been created.
I expect that all of us citizens should contribute as much as we can in the cleanliness mission.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
I keep on urging everyone to buy some khadi items between Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This year also I request that each family should buy one or the other khadi item so that the poor may also be able to light an earthen lamp and celebrate Diwali.
This year 2nd October is a Sunday so can we involve ourselves in the cleanliness mission in some way
You involve yourself physically for 2 hours, 4 hours with cleaning work and I request you to share your cleanliness drive photo on NarendraModiApp.
If it is a video, then share the video.
You will see that with our joint efforts, this movement will get a fresh boost, a new dynamism.
Let us all remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and take a pledge to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, one gets a special pleasure in giving, one may not realize it, but the pleasure of giving is divine.
This in itself was a very inspirational event in Indias national life.
Now, many youngsters, small groups, people from the corporate world, schools and some NGOs are jointly going to organize Joy of Giving Week from 2nd October to 8th October.
Under this campaign, food items and clothes will be collected and supplied to the needy persons.
These toys provided great pleasure to the poor children, which was a great sight to behold.
I feel that we should encourage and help these young people who are organising Joy of Giving Week in many cities.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Ji and his birth centenary year commences from today.
Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay undertook the tremendous task of defining and elaborating upon the political ideology being followed by lakhs and lakhs of workers like me.
He was a supporter of a political ideology connected with the roots of India, he presented his own soul stirring political philosophy, the EKAATM-MAANAV DARSHAN alongside the ideology to uphold Indias great cultural heritage.
The centenary year of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay is commencing from today.
Sarvajan Hitay Sarvajan Sukhay, the principle of ANTYODAY these are his gifts to us.
Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the last man standing in the queue.
How can the poorest of the poor avail of benefits of development
Work for every hand, water to every field through only these two words he presented his entire economic agenda.
My dear countrymen, I had started Mann Ki Baat on Vijayadashmi two years ago.
On completion of two years of Mann Ki Baat this week, I wish to express my sincere gratitude from the core of my heart to all you listeners who appreciated it, who contributed to improving it and thus blessed me.
I am grateful to All India Radio also which not only broadcast my views but also put in their best efforts to transmit it in all languages.
I am also thankful to those countrymen who knocked on the doors of the government by writing letters and by sending in suggestions and highlighting shortcomings of the government and All India Radio mounted special programmes on these letters by inviting concerned government functionaries and thus provided a platform to address the problems.
Thus, Mann Ki Baat became a new opportunity of social transformation rather than just remaining a mere talk show of 15-20 minutes.
What can be more satisfying than this for any one
How to make it a festival of social bonding
And that would be the true prayer to Shakti, only then can we celebrate together the festival of victory.
Let us bow before Shakti, nurture it, march forward with the mantra of unity.
Come, let us celebrate Navratri and Durga Puja festivals with peace, unity and harmony to enable our nation to scale newer heights.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2016
My dear countrymen, Namaskar,Tomorrow, 29th August is the birth anniversary of hockey wizard Dhyan Chand.
This occasion is celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
I offer my tributes to Dhyan Chand ji and wish to remind you all about his invaluable contribution.
He played a pivotal role in helping India win Hockey Gold Medals in Olympic Games of 1928, 1932 and 1936.
All of us cricket lovers know Bradmans name very well.
Dear countrymen, as the time of Mann Ki Baat draws near, a very large number of suggestions are received on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
It shows that besides Cricket, our people have so much involvement in and awareness and knowledge about other sports and games also.
For me, even reading these messages proved to be a source of inspiration.
One Shri Sachin has written to urge that in Mann Ki Baat this time a mention may please be made about Sindhu, Saakshi and Deepa Karmakar.
Whatever medals we got have been earned by our daughters.
These Betis have once again proved that they are second to none in any respect.
One of these daughters is from North India while there is one who belongs to South India and then there is one from the Eastern part.
It seems that our daughters in the whole of India have decided to take up the responsibility of bringing glory to the nation.
Shikhar Thakur has written on MyGov that we could have performed better at the Olympics.
He has written Respected Modi Sir, first of all, congratulations on our winning two medals at Rio.
However, I want to draw your attention to the question was our performance really good
And, the answer is No.
We have to go a long way in the field of sports.
Our parents, even today, insist on focusing on studies and academics.
Sports are considered a waste of time in our society.
There is no denying the fact that we could not perform up to the expectations.
Some of our players could not even touch during these Games their own performance level which they had achieved during the domestic events in India. In the medals chart, our tally was only two medals.
However, it is also a fact that if we look closely, we shall find that despite missing medals, Indian players gave a very good account of themselves for the first time in some of the events.
See, our Abhinav Bindra very narrowly missed the medal and got fourth place in Shooting.
The pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna met almost a similar fate in Tennis.
Ushas feat, Lalita babar qualified for the finals in track and field.
Our Womens Hockey Team qualified for the Olympic Games after a space of 36 long years.
Mens Hockey Team reached knock out stage after 36 years. Our team is quite strong.
And the interesting part is that Gold Medalist Argentina lost just one match in the entire tournament and the team which defeated them was INDIA.
Many players like Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das gave a very good performance.
But my dear countrymen, we do have to go a long way. And if we stick to the same routine, we may perhaps keep facing the same disappointment.
I have announced setting up of a committee.
The Government of India will make an in depth in-house analysis and will study the practices being followed around the world.
We shall prepare a roadmap on how we can do better.
We have to prepare a far reaching plan keeping in view the Olympics in 2020, 2024, 2028.
I urge the State Governments also to set up similar committees to find out as to what we can do in sports. What can each state do
But, we must prepare ourselves fully and thoroughly. And, I am confident that we, the nation of 125 crore people comprising 65 percent youth population can reach an exalted status in the world of sports too.
We have to move ahead with this resolve.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teachers Day.
For many years, I have been spending a lot of time with students on Teachers Day and that too as a student myself.
I used to learn quite a lot from those young children.
For me, 5th September was Teachers Day as well as an Education Day.
But, this time I have to leave for G-20 Summit and so felt in my heart that I should express my feelings in this regard in Mann Ki Baat today.
In our life, a teacher holds the same place which a mother does.
We have also seen such teachers who care more for their pupils than for themselves.
They devote their lives for their disciples, their students.
These days, after Rio Olympics, Pulela Gopi Chand ji is being talked about everywhere.
He is a player first but he has set up a glorious example of what a good coach, that is, a teacher should be.
We always feel the contribution of our teachers in our lives.
5th September happens to be the birthday of Indias former President Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates this as Teachers Day.
Whatever post he held in his life, he always tried to live like a teacher, an educator.
And, about his handwriting even at the age of 90, I marvel that he writes so beautifully whereas my own handwriting is very poor.
That is why, whenever I look at somebodys good handwriting, I have a great respect for it.
If you have a photograph with your teacher or an incident connected with your teacher or an inspirational thing associated with your teacher, please do share the same on NarendraModiApp.
Looking at the contribution of teachers in the country from the point of view of students is also immensely valuable in itself.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Utsav is drawing near.
Ganesh ji removes all obstacles and let us all wish that our country, our society, our families, and each one of us may lead a life free of obstacles.
But, when we mention Ganesh Utsav, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public celebration of Ganesh Utsav is Lokmanya Tilaks gift to us.
These Ganesh festivities included holding wide-ranging discussions on the issues that touched our lives and society, and comprised such programmes which provided a new vigour and vitality to our social fabric. Also, his mantra Swaraj, that is, freedom is my birthright should have the main focus thereby strengthening the freedom movement.
Now, not in Maharashtra alone but in each corner of India, Ganesh Utsav is celebrated publicly.
They organise debates on topics of public interest, and hold essay competitions and rangoli competitions.
Tableus depict the issues of social concern in a very artistic manner.
In a way, a mass campaign of public education gets underway through these Ganesh festivities. Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us the inspirational mantra Swaraj, that is, freedom is our birthright.
Good governance, SURAAJ, should be our priority can we not recite this mantra and give a message for it in the public Ganesh festival celebrations
Come on, I invite you all.
It is true that festivals express the vitality of a society.
Festivals infuse new life into individuals as well as the society.
Life seems to be impossible without festivals but these have to be moulded according to the needs of the changing times.
I have seen that this time, many people have written to me mentioning Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja. They are worried about environment.
POP idols are not environment friendly.
He has expressed a great pain, others have also.
I request you all as to why should we not use clay in making Ganesh and Durga idols and revert to our old tradition.
This will help in environment preservation, prevent pollution of our rivers and ponds and also provide protection to small creatures living in water. This is also the service of God.
I do not know how you will take my suggestions but it is not just me but many other people saying the same thing.
I have heard about many such people including Pune based sculptor Shri Abhijit Dhondphale, Kolhapur institutions Nisarg-Mitra and Vigyan Prabodhini, Nisarg Katta in Vidarbh, Gyan Prabodhini of Pune, and Girgaoncha Raja of Mumbai.
Eco-friendly Ganeshotsav is also social service.
There is still time left before the start of Durga Pooja festivities.
I offer my best wishes to you all for Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be canonized, that is, accorded sainthood on 4th September.
Mother Teresa devoted her entire life to the service of the poor in India.
When Mother Teresa, who served the poor in India all through her life, is accorded Sainthood, it is quite natural for we Indians to feel proud.
Indian government will send an official delegation under the leadership of our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to represent 125 crore Indians at the canonization ceremony to be held on 4th September.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, a big transformation takes place.
Peoples power is, in a way, considered to be a divine incarnation.
Government of India has made a successful effort to clean the Ganga and involve the people for this project with the cooperation of five State governments.
Pradhans of villages situated on the banks of the river Ganga were invited to Allahabad on the 20th of this month.
I congratulate all the Pradhans who had assembled in Allahabad with this resolve from different States they had come from Uttrakhand, from Uttar Pradesh, from Bihar, from Jharkhand and from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all those Ministries of the Government of India and also those ministers who turned this vision into reality.
I also want to thank the Chief Ministers of these five States for taking the vital step in the direction of making Ganga clean by involving peoples power.
Some students wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi and some in Chhatisgarhi to their parents telling them that there should be toilets in their houses.
They demanded building toilets.
Some students even wrote that they would rather go without celebrating birthday but the toilet must be constructed.
Students of age between seven to seventeen took up this task.
And this had such an impact, such an emotional impact that while the students were going to school the next day, their parents handed over reply letters to them addressed to the teacher in which they promised to build toilets by a certain date positively.
My compliments to those who visualized this idea, compliments to these students and special compliments to those parents who took their childrens letters so seriously and also took a decision to construct a toilet.
In Koppal district of Karnataka, a sixteen year old girl Mallamma started a Satyagrah against her own family.
The village pradhan Mohammad Shafi came to know about this.
Now, look at the gesture of village Pradhan Mohammad Shafi, he arranged eighteen thousand rupees and got a toilet built within a week.
My dear countrymen, Swachha Bharat has become the dream of each Indian.
Some Indians have made it their resolve.
Some Indians have made it their aim and purpose.
But, each one is connected to it in one or the other way and everyone is making a contribution.
Daily we hear about the various innovative efforts in this direction.
Acting on one such idea, the Government of India has called upon the people to make short films of 2 to 3 minutes duration on Swachhta, that is, cleanliness and send these to the Government.
I request TV channels also to invite such films and hold a competition.
Creativity can give a new strength to Swachhata Abhiyan or cleanliness campaign.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried its best to have close, cordial and vibrant relations with its neighbours.
But this is no ordinary Radio Channel, it is a very big and very important step.
We have Bangladesh as our neighbour.
We know that both Bangladesh and West Bengal continue to have a common cultural heritage.
So, Akashvani Maitree on this side and Bangladesh Betaar on that side will mutually share the content and Bengali speaking people on both sides will enjoy the programmes of Akashvani, that is, All India Radio.
This people to people contact is a big contribution of Akashvani.
The President launched this radio channel.
I extend my thanks to Bangladesh also for collaborating with us in this initiative.
I congratulate the friends in All India Radio too for making their contribution in our foreign policy also.
My dear countrymen, although you have entrusted me with the responsibilities of Prime Minister but I also am a human being just like you.
At times, sensitive events touch me a little too deeply.
Such sentimental incidents generate new energy, give new inspiration and this is what motivates us Indians to do some remarkable things.
A motherly lady of about 84 years of age who is a retired teacher wrote that letter to me.
If she had not forbidden me from revealing her name, I from the core of my heart wanted to announce her name while talking to you.
She wrote in her letter that after my appeal to the people to forego their cooking gas subsidy, she had given up her subsidy and then she even forgot about it.
However, a few days ago a person on my behalf went to her and delivered a letter in which she was thanked for her giving up the subsidy.
And, she has said that a letter from the Prime Minister was no less than a Padma Shree honour for her.
Dear countrymen, you may be knowing that I have tried to send a letter, to be delivered personally through my representatives, to all those who surrendered their cooking gas subsidy on my appeal.
My effort is to send letters to more than one crore people.
Under this plan my letter had reached this mother who wrote back to me saying that I was doing a good work under the campaign of providing relief to those poor ladies who are getting freedom from the smoke of a Chulha.
I am a retired teacher and will cross the age of 90 years within a few years and I am sending you a donation of fifty thousand rupees which you can use in this mission of providing relief from the Chulha smoke to the poor women.
You may well imagine the missionary spirit of this retired teacher living on pension and donating an amount of fifty thousand rupees for the sake of provision of gas connection to the other poor mothers and sisters, in order to save them from the ill effects of Chulha smoke.
It is not a question of 50 thousand rupees but the basic question is of the empathy in this old lady and it is because of the blessings of this lady and of crores of our other mothers and sisters which strengthens my confidence in the future of the country.
And, she did not write to me this letter as a Prime Minister but she straightforwardly wrote Modi Bhaiya
In some parts of the country, there have been repetitive floods.
State governments, Union government, local self-government bodies, social organisations and the citizens did whatever best could be done.
In August 2016, about 90 political parties in the country, many of these parties in the Parliament, which were staunch opponents of each other and which do not miss the slightest opportunity against each other, all these parties got united and passed the GST Act.
The credit for this goes to all the parties. And, this is an example which shows that great tasks can be accomplished by working in unison to move ahead.
Similarly, about the incidents that took place in Kashmir and all that happened in Kashmir, all political parties in the country collectively expressed their views in one voice.
Those trying to disturb peace in Kashmir by putting small children in the front and hiding behind them will have to be answerable to these very innocent children some day.
My dear countrymen, ours is a vast nation, full of diversities.
To keep this country of manifold diversities united, we all as citizens, as society and as the government, have a responsibility to encourage things which strengthen our national unity and highlight these with full vigour, only then we can make our countrys future bright, and, of course, this will be achieved.
I have full faith in the power of my 125 crore countrymen.
Early this morning, I had an opportunity to spend some time with some young people from Delhi. And I believe, in the days to come, the spirit and fervor of sports will envelop every young person in the country.
All of us know that in a few days time, the worlds largest sports event, the biggest sports carnival will take place.
RIO is going to resound in our ears time and again.
All of us harbour a lot of hopes and expectations, but keeping the morale of our sports contingent at RIO high is also the solemn duty of us 1.
In the days to come, wherever we are, let us do our bit to encourage our sportspersons.
A sportsperson, who makes it to this stage, does so after putting in a lot of hard work.
Its a kind of severe and dedicated tapasya.
Victory and defeat are certainly important, but what is even more important is reaching this level in a game or sports discipline and, therefore, let all of us Indians join hands in wishing our RIO contingent the very best.
and today, as I speak on the Rio Olympics, I would like to mention the name of a poetry lover, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay a student of the Punjab Central University, who has sent me a poem.
Its possible that many poets would have written poems, some may be planning to write, some may even compose their verses into songs, in all languages. But here I would like to share with you the poem sent by Suraj Ji.
Ankit has reminded me of the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalamji, which was observed last week.
The country, in fact the world paid glowing tributes to him. The mere mention of Abdul Kalamjis name brings to mind vivid images of science, technology, missiles in fact the entire spectrum of strengths and capabilities of India in the days to come.
And thats why Ankit asks me...
If we have to match its strides and move ahead, research and innovation are the keys, these are its lifelines and moving spirit.
In the absence of research and innovation, technology will become a burden, just as still water stagnates and even stinks.
And if we go on just using old technology without recourse to research and innovation, we will become outdated in this rapidly changing world and age. And that is why the government too has taken steps to attract the new generation toward science and research innovation in the field of technology.
And that is why I say let us aim to innovate.
Wherever such Tinkering Labs are established in schools, those would be given 10 Lakh rupees and further 10 Lakh rupees will be provided for maintenance during the period of five years.
India is grappling with diverse challenges.
We see problems in daily life.
We shall now have to look for technological solutions for these.
Through the Atal Grand Challenges we have exhorted the young generation of the country that if they see problems, they should search for solutions taking the path of technology, doing research, applying innovations and bring those on board.
The Government of India wants to specially reward technology developed to find solutions to our problems. And I am happy that people have evinced interest in these things.
My dear countrymen, while some time ago, we were concerned about a drought like situation, these days, on the one hand, we are enjoying the rains, but on the other, reports of floods are also coming in.
Central government and State Governments are working hand in hand with their utmost efforts to provide relief and assistance to the flood-affected.
Despite causing some hardships, rains make every human heart rejoice since rains, and agriculture, are the focal point of our entire sphere of economic activities.
There are times when one has to face an illness that leaves a scar for a lifetime.
But if we are aware, alert and active, the prevention is also very easy.
You must be watching advertisements on TV but there are times when we neglect taking proactive and informed action on it.
The government, hospitals, doctors will of course do their job, but I urge that we should also be alert in ensuring that Dengue doesnt enter our homes, locality, family, for that matter, any illness connected with stagnant water.
I would like to draw the attention of my dear countrymen to another menace.
In todays fast paced, rat race of life, at times we dont have time to think about ourselves.
When we fall sick, we want to get well as soon as possible and as a result pop in just any antibiotic that we can lay our hands on.
Do not use the short cut method
I urge you to complete the entire course of medication as prescribed by the doctor.
Because if the treatment is abandoned halfway, it would benefit the bacteria. If the medicine is taken more than what is required, that too would be in the favour of the bacteria.
And that is why, it is utmost essential to take the entire course of antibiotic medicine in terms of number of tablets as well as days.
In medical parlance it is called antibiotic resistance. Hence it is indeed necessary to follow rules in the administration of antibiotics.
It is true that in the last decade there has been a decline in maternal mortality rates but even now, we are not able to save the lives of a large number of pregnant women.
Anemia during or after pregnancy, pregnancy related infections, high BP, any such complication can have devastating effect.
Keeping in view these issues, in the last few months, the Government of India has launched a new campaign Prime Minister Safe Motherhood Campaign.
Under this, on the 9th of every month, all pregnant women will get a check-up at government health centers free of cost.
I have specially asked the gynecologists whether they could offer their services free on the 9th of every month, for the sake of under privileged mothers
Cant my doctor brothers and sisters spare just 12 days in a year for this service to the under privileged
Over the last few days, many have written to me.
There are thousands of doctors who have implemented what I said.
My dear countrymen, today, the whole world is concerned deeply about climate change, global warming and the environment.
These are discussed collectively in the country and across the world.
It is proclaimed in Shukracharya Neeti that naastimulam anaushadham meaning that there is no plant that does not have medicinal values
He who donates a tree, that tree in return becomes a ladder to salvation just like children.
However, there are certain individuals in the present generation also, who live up to these ideals.
It is mentioned in Anushasan Parv in Mahabharata that a tree is like an offspring and becomes means of salvation in after life, Sonal has not only taken it upon herself to fulfill her parents wishes but societys expectations also.
Shri Khandu Maruti Mhatre, a farmer of Narayanpur village of of Junner Taluka of Pune got his granddaughter Sonal married in a very inspiring manner.
Other temples too can start the practice of distributing saplings instead of prasad during this rainy season.
It can easily grow into a peoples movement for planting trees.
I repeatedly tell my farmer brethren that instead of wasting our land in building fences around our fields, why dont we start planting timber trees there.
Today India has to spend billions and trillions of rupees to import timber wood from abroad for construction of houses and furniture.
If we plant on the boundaries of our fields timber trees that can be utilised for construction of homes and furniture and which can also be cut and sold after 15 to 20 years with the permission of the government. This way, not only can these become a new source of your income, but can also save India from importing timber.
Some days ago, a few states taking advantage of this weather have started many campaigns in this direction and the Government of India has also passed CAMPA law, under which about 40 thousand crores rupees will go to the states for planting trees.
I have been told that the Maharashtra government planted about 2 crores sapling in the entire state on 1st July and next year they have taken a pledge to plant about 3 crores trees.
The Maharashtra government has transformed this activity into a peoples movement.
Rajasthan, desert area, has celebrated Van Mahotsav in a very big way and pledged to plant 25 lakhs trees.
To plant 25 lakhs of sapling in Rajasthan is not a small matter
Those who know the soil conditions of Rajasthan would know how mammoth this task is going to be.
Andhra Pradesh, too has decided to increase its green cover by 50 by the year 2029.
Under the central governments ongoing Green India Mission, Railways too have joined in this endeavour.
Gujarat too has an illustrious tradition of observing Van Mahotsav.
This year Gujarat has undertaken many projects like Aamra Van, Ekata Van and Shaheed Van as a part of Van Mahotsav and launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I am not able to mention every state but all deserve to be appreciated.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa for the first time some time back.
During a foreign visit, diplomacy is practiced, there are trade deliberations, discussions about security and as is customary, many MoUs are concluded.
But for me the visit to South Africa was more like a pilgrimage.
When we think of South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever we hear the words non-violence, love and forgiveness, the inspiring faces of Gandhi and Mandela appear before us.
During my South Africa tour, I visited Phoenix settlement where Mahatma Gandhis home is known as Sarvodaya.
I will remember that meeting forever.
Equality and equal opportunity are the two biggest mantras for any society and government.
Equality and equal opportunity, compassion and fraternity, these are the paths leading us to a bright future.
We all want a good future for our children. Everybody has different needs and different priorities but there is one common path of development, equality, compassion and fraternity.
Come, let us be proud about these Indians who have lived their lives in South Africa embodying our highest and fundamental ideals.
She has made me aware of an incident: Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am Shilpi Varma speaking from Bengaluru.
Some days ago, I read in a news article that a lady became a victim of fraud and cheat email, lost 11 lakh rupees and committed suicide.
Being a woman, I feel an empathy with her family.
What is your opinion about such cheat and fraud emails.
She has pointed a certain incident, and you must also be aware that we get messages on our mobile phones and emails, proclaiming attractive offers that you have won a jackpot of so many rupees
People get duped by this money trap.
These are new methods of technology that are spreading in the entire world for cheating people.
You too must be getting similarly confused sometimes
I believe that we must be aware against such lure, must remain cautious and if such false communications come to our notice, then we must share them with our friends and make them aware also.
My dear countrymen these days, the Parliament Session is going on, and during the Parliament Session, I get to meet many people from across our nation.
Our MPs also bring people from their constituencies and introduce them to me they tell me many things, their difficulties also.
But recently I had a pleasant experience, real pleasant experience
Student from Aligarh had come to meet me.
They had brought a big photo album with them and their faces were lit with joy.
These were artistic painting done on the station.
If you go to Aligarh, do visit the railway station.
This is a prime example of the great transformation, which can be brought about through peoples participation.
I felicitate all such citizens involved in these kinds of activities and especially congratulate friends from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, with the onset of rainy season, there is also an onset of festival season in our country.
There would be fairs everywhere, festivities would be observed in temples and places of worship.
You too will become a participant at home and outside during the festive celebrations.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a festival of special significance.
Just like last year, cant you gift on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojna to mothers and sisters of our country.
Think about it, we should gift such a present to our sisters, which really provides her security in future.
Not only that, we may be having in our homes a lady making food for us or a lady who cleans our house, a daughter of an impoverished mother To them also, you can gift Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojna on this festival of Raksha Bandhan.
My dear countrymen there are many among us who were born after independence. And I am the first Prime Minister of this nation who was born in free India.
The 75th year of uit India and 70th year of Independence can be source of new inspiration, source of new enthusiasm and an occasion to take a pledge to do something for our nation.
Independence Day should not be a government event, it should be the celebration of the entire people.
Just like Diwali, it should be our own festival.
I hope that you too become inspired with the spirit of patriotism and do something good in that vein.
Dear countrymen, I have the good fortune to talk to the nation from ramparts of Red Fort on 15thAugust, it is a tradition.
You too must be having certain thoughts that you wish were proclaimed from Red Fort.
I invite you to write to me about your thoughts that I, as your representative, as your Pradhan Sevak should talk about from the Red Fort. Send me suggestions, your advice and new thoughts, I will try to convey your thoughts to rest of the countrymen.
I invite you once again, come, let us remember and salute our great freedom fighters, who sacrificed their lives for India and let us move ahead with the pledge to do something for our nation.
Once again I have got an opportunity to talk to you about matters close to my heart, through Mann Ki Baat.
For me, Mann Ki Baat is not a matter of ritual
I myself am very eager to talk to you.
And I am really happy that I am able to connect with you all in every corner of India, through this programme Mann Ki Baat.
I am grateful to All India Radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting Mann Ki Baat in regional languages at 8 pm.
I am also very happy that the people who listen to me, later communicate their feelings to me through letters, telephone calls, the website MyGov. in and also through the NarendraModiApp.
A lot of what you say is of great help to me in the functioning of the government.
How active should the government be in terms of public service
How much priority should be given to public welfare activities
In terms of these matters, this dialogue, this link that I have with you all, is of great use.
5th June is World Environment Day.
On this day, discussions expressing concern on the issue are held all over the world for saving the environment.
This time on the occasion of World Environment Day, the United Nations has given the theme ero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade. This topic will, of course, be discussed, but we also must talk about saving our flora and fauna, conserving water, and how to expand our forest cover.
You must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.
And so, it becomes the bounden duty of each one of us, to save forests and save water.
I had a one-on-one meeting with each state, devoting about two to two and a half hours with each one.
I carefully heard what each state had to say.
Some states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have made full use of technology.
I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also.
Peoples participation is a strong base for solving such problems.
And so water storage, water conservation and proper water irrigation are all of equal importance.
And so there is need for implementing the maxim Per Drop More Crop through Micro-Irrigation and cultivating crops that require minimal water intake.
At present, it is indeed good news that in many states, even sugarcane farmers are using micro irrigation, some are using drip irrigation and some are using sprinklers.
I also found that there were many states which had taken on very big targets, especially, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat- these three states have done massive work in the field of drip irrigation.
And they are striving to bring every year 2 to 3 lakh hectares additional land under micro- irrigation.
If this campaign gets underway in all the states, then not only will it benefit cultivation, but more water will also be conserved.
Our farmer brothers in Telangana, through Mission Bhagirathi have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of Godavari and Krishna rivers.
In Andhra Pradesh, Neeru Pragati Mission has been using technology for ground water recharging.
People are devoting hard work and contributing financially as well to the mass movement that has been started in Maharashtra,.
Jal Yukt Shivir is one such peoples movement which is really going to be of great help in saving Maharashtra from water crisis in the future- this is what I feel.
Chhattisgarh has started the Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj campaign.
In Rajasthan and Gujarat there are many ancient baodis deep tanks or masonry wells with steps going down to the water.
Jharkhand, although being a predominantly forest area, still has some parts which face water problem.
They have launched a very big campaign for building Check Dams.
This is a wonderful experience.
But if we become careless during the abundance of water and then during the lean water season land into trouble due to water scarcity, how can this be allowed
And the issue of water is not just for the farmers.
This concerns everybody the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban people, the country folk, the rich and the poor.
And for this reason, now that the rainy season is approaching, saving water should be our priority. And when we celebrate Diwali this time, then we should also revel in how much water did we save
You will see for yourselves that our joy will increase manifold.
And this is not just for the governments, not just for the politicians, it is a work to be carried out by the people at large.
My dear Countrymen, we have to build a modern India.
We have to make a transparent India.
We have to make many services uniformly available across the entire country from one corner to another.
So we will have to change some of our old habits as well.
Today I want to touch upon one topic in which if you can be of help to me, then we can together achieve progress in that direction.
But now times have changed.
The whole world is moving towards a cashless society.
Through the facility of electronic technology, we can get money and also give money
And with this there is no question of our wallets getting stolen from our pocket. We need not worry about keeping an account
the account will be maintained automatically.
In the beginning it may appear to be a bit difficult, but once we get used to it, then this arrangement will seem very easy for us.
And this possibility is there because under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana that we have started recently, nearly all the families in the country have had their bank accounts opened.
On the other hand, they have also got their Aadhar numbers. And the mobile phone has reached the hands of almost every Indian.
So Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile Jam J.
Synchronising these three, we can move ahead towards a cashless society.
You must have seen that along with the Jan Dhan account people have been given a RuPay card.
In the coming days this card is going to be useful as both- a credit and a debit card.
And now-a-days a very small instrument has come which is called point of sale- P.
O.
With the help of that, be it your Aadhar number or your RuPay card, if you have to pay money to someone, you can do it through that.
One of the initiatives in this regard taken by the Government of India is about how to make payments through Pos, how to receive money.
The second endeavour we have started is Bank on Mobile.
It will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone.
In a way we have worked towards providing the bank at your door step.
Post offices have also been geared up for banking services.
If we learn and adapt ourselves to use these services, then we will not require the currency, we will not need notes, we will not need coins.
Businesses will function automatically, resulting in a certain transparency.
Under-hand dealings will stop
the influence of black money will be reduced.
So I appeal to my countrymen, that we should at least make a beginning.
Once we start, we will move ahead with great ease.
Twenty years ago who would have thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands.
Slowly we cultivated a habit and now we cant do without those.
Maybe this cashless society assumes a similar form.
But the sooner this happens, the better it will be.
To encourage the sportspersons who are leaving for the Rio Olympics, to boost their morale, everyone should try in ones own way.
He was the Chief Ministerial candidate
but he was also the Union Minister.
Are they getting nutritious food according to their needs or not
Are the appropriate trainers for their body fitness present there
With election results being due, with the distinct possibility of a new responsibility as a Chief Minister, and yet if one of my colleagues, in the capacity of a Sports Minister, displays such concern for his work, then it gives me great joy.
This becomes a source of strength in itself, when the sportsperson feels that his 125 crore countrymen are with him, his morale gets boosted.
Last time I spoke to you about the FIFA Under 17 World Cup and recently I got to see the suggestions that have come pouring in.
And these days I have noticed that a conducive atmosphere for Football can be seen in the whole country.
Many people are taking an initiative to form their own teams.
I have received thousands of suggestions on the NarendraModi Mobile App.
Maybe many people dont play the game themselves, but hundreds of thousands of young Indians have displayed such keen interest in the sport, this by itself was a very delightful experience for me.
We all know the bond that India has with Cricket, but I saw the same passion for Football as well, and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future.
We should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat.
India should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship.
I appeal to my countrymen to contribute their bit in creating an atmosphere that boosts the spirits and enthusiasm of our athletes.
In the last week or so, results have been pouring in from all over the country... .
and I am not talking about election results... I am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year, those of 10th and 12th Class.
It is clear that our daughters are marching ahead triumphantly.
It is a matter of joy.
We should live with hope, we should move ahead with confidence.
But I have been confronted with a new type of question, about which earlier I had never given a thought.
Reading this I felt elated.
33 marks when I reached home, I was thinking that I would be congratulated by my family and friends, I would be applauded. But I was amazed when everybody in the house, friends and my teachers said the same thing, Oh Dear, if your had secured just 4 more marks, you would have made it to 90.
I dont know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.
And I feel that perhaps this pain is not just yours like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain.
Because nowadays there is a trend that instead of finding satisfaction in what we have achieved, we tend to express our dissatisfaction in not achieving unrealistic goals.
This is another form of negativity.
I would like to urge guardians, parents and people all around, to please accept, welcome and express your satisfaction over your childrens results, and motivate them to surge ahead in life.
Else, it might happen that a day will come when he brings 100 marks and you will say that, you have got 100 percent But still, had you done something more, it would have been better
There is a limit to everything and that should be accepted.
Santosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines.
He says that the people around him just dont accept the results.
They say that you should have done something better.
All that I would like to say to you is that in such a situation, dont lose your balance.
Everyone expresses their expectations
just keep listening, but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better.
But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new.
And so I would like to appeal that you should sing in celebration of the success that you have achieved.
Sometimes one is not able to score good marks in exams, but he or she surges ahead in sports, or does well in music, or excels in the fine arts, or forges ahead in business.
God has gifted each one of us with a unique talent.
Please recognize your internal strength, build upon it and you will be able to march ahead.
There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley.
But it was Pandit Shiv Kumar (Sharma) whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world.
Shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music.
It was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings.
But Ustad Bismillah Khans mastery over the Shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world
My dear countrymen, sometimes I notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare, throws their life off the track.
It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more.
Why cant we lead life in such a way that we dont ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family.
Cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease.
The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness.
And the second thing that I constantly urge you to do is Yog.
Some people also call it Yoga.
21st June is the International Day for Yog.
People are not only attracted to Yog the world over, they have implicit faith in it and the whole world has embraced it.
This is a priceless gift handed over to us by our ancestors, which we have given to the world.
To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life.
A person practicing Yog, can easily have the achievements of staying healthy, maintaining balance, being richly endowed with a strong will power, nurturing supreme self confidence and to have concentration in every task one does.
21st June, International Yog Day is not just a mere event.
These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individuals life.
I do hope that on 21st June, wherever you may be, please take the initiative
The whole culture of the office gets transformed and the environment also undergoes a positive change.
Can we make use of 21st June to bring Yog into our lives
Can we use it to bring Yog into our social life
I urge you all not to get left behind.
Your staying healthy is very important to make India healthy.
My dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly.
I had given all of you a mobile number earlier, which you could use for listening to Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call on that number.
But now we have made it a lot simpler.
By giving a missed call on this number, you will be able to listen to Mann Ki Baat at any time, wherever you are and in any language of your choice.
Namaste
Everybody makes plans for their summer holidays.
Since this is the season of mangoes, we crave for the flavour and taste of this fruit. Sometimes we feel a nap in the afternoon would be nice.
But this year the sweltering heat has spoilt the fun for everybody.
It is quite natural for the nation to feel concerned about the unrelenting heat.
On top of it, due to continuous drought over the past couple of years, the usual water storage facilities have been adversely affected.
Sometimes due to encroachment, sometimes due to silting, the inflow of water into reservoirs and other water bodies gets blocked. As a result, the reservoirs store much less water than their capacity.
Worse, because of this cycle that has been going on for years, the capacity itself of these reservoirs is gradually reduced.
I have noticed that citizens are doing commendable work to help deal with the situation.
Awareness is now seen in many villages. Only those who have faced shortage of water know the real value of water.
Hence, in such places they are very sensitive about water and are equally active in doing something to deal with the shortage of water.
I was recently told that in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the Hivrebazaar Gram Panchayat and its villagers have addressed the problem of water shortage by treating it as a major and delicate issue.
They have decided to give up cultivation of those crops that require a lot of water, like sugarcane and banana.
It sounds very simple, but in reality it is not so.
What a big collective decision this must have been
Farmers in this village have taken so many initiatives such as using sprinklers, drip irrigation techniques, water harvesting and water recharging, that today their village is strong enough to cope with the water crisis that they face.
I might be talking of a small place like Hivrebazaar, but there must be many other such villages. I extend my hearty felicitations to such villagers for their fine work.
They have already created 27 farm ponds.
Due to this there has been an increase in the ground water level.
Whenever water was required for crops, farmers had access to it.
This panchayat has given a rough estimate that their agricultural production has increased by 20 per cent.
Not only has water been saved, the quality of water has also vastly improved with the water level increasing.
There are several such schemes and programmes that are run by citizens but these doesnt get our attention.
The good work done by the government sometimes does come to our notice. If we look around us, we will see that people are making an effort to combat the menace of drought by trying to find solutions that are new and innovative.
It is human nature that no matter how many perils people face, when they hear a good news from any corner, they feel as if the entire crisis is over.
Thus ever since the day it became public knowledge that rainfall this year is expected to be between 106 and 110 it seems as if tidings of peace and happiness have come.
There is still some time for the monsoon to arrive, but the news of good rains has already brought joy.
Can we start a drive to save water in every village from now on itself
Farmers need fertile soil in their fields to grow crops.
If we were to do this, the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase.
There would be sufficient water in our water-wells.
Therefore, notwithstanding the current water scarcity and drought situation, we have an opportunity during coming one and half months to prepare to harvest rainwater.
His concern is quite natural because it has been nearly 30 years since work began in this direction.
Many governments came, plans were made to clean Ganga, and a lot of expenditure was incurred without showing results.
We get our daily bread from Ganga, we get our earnings from Ganga, and we get a new source of energy from Ganga to live our lives.
The flow of Ganga adds momentum to the economic pace of the country.
Bhagirath did bring down the river Ganga for us, but to save it, we need crores of Bhagiraths.
The project to clean Ganga cannot be successful without mass participation by the people.
There are many efforts being made by the government.
We are seeking the full cooperation of all the states through which Ganga flows.
We are also trying to get voluntary organisations to join us in this effort.
We have taken several steps for surface cleaning and to stop industrial pollution.
Every day, effluents and garbage in a large quantity flow into Ganga through drains.
At Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna trash skimmers have been deployed which clean the river while floating on it.
All local bodies have been given this facility and they have been urged to carry on with this work continuously and clean all the garbage from the river.
I have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day.
So it would be correct to say that pollutants in such a large quantity are being stopped from getting into the river.
In the coming days, we have plans to deploy such trash skimmers at other places also and the benefits of it will be felt by the people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna.
To monitor and control industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with the pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industries, and it has also been implemented to some extent.
I feel it will yield good results.
The discharge from the pulp and paper industry or the liquor industry is almost coming to an end.
All these things are a sign that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
I have seen that not just on the banks of Ganga, even in far off South if one meets a person, he is sure to ask, Sir, will Ganga be cleaned
This faith and hope of the common people is going to ensure success in the cleaning of Ganga.
People are even giving donations for this.
Thus this effort is being made quite meticulously.
My dear fellow citizens, today is the 24th of April.
This is observed as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
On this day, the Panchayati Raj system was implemented in our country.
Panchayati Raj system has gradually spread to the entire country and is functioning successfully as an important unit of our democratic system of governance.
It was my good fortune that on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, I got the opportunity to visit his birthplace Mhow and pay my respects at that sacred place.
And today, on 24th April, I am going to Jharkhand, where mostly my tribal brothers and sisters stay. In Jharkhand I am going to celebrate Panchayati Raj Divas.
At 3 in the afternoon I shall be talking to all panchayats of the country.
This campaign has worked in a major way to generate awareness.
How can the democratic institutions at the village level, in every corner of India, be strengthened
How can the villages become self-reliant
In some villages people organised food donation on this occasion.
The awareness that has come about in villages guarantees a new progress for India.
The foundation for the progress of India is the rise of its villages
so if we all keep laying stress on the progress of the villages, we shall continue to get the desired results.
Sharmila Dharpure from Mumbai has expressed her concern to me through her phone call.
I am Sharmila Dharpure speaking from Mumbai.
I have a question for you about the school and college education.
For the last so many years, a strong need for reforms has been felt in the education sector.
Either the required amount of schools and colleges are not there or else the quality in education is lacking.
It has been often found that the children complete their schooling but they still dont have knowledge about the most basic things and so they lag behind in this competitive world.
What are your views
Today in every home, the first thing that the parents dream of is to give their children good education.
To educate their children and educate them well, this concern for the children to get good education should increase further and a greater awareness should come about. I believe that when there is awareness in the family, it impacts the school and has an impact on teachers as well.
Every Government in our country has laid stress on education and every Government has made efforts for it in its own way.
But today more than expanding education what is necessary is to improve the quality of education.
We have already done a lot towards expanding education.
Now we will have to focus on quality education.
We will have to shift our priority from literacy campaign to good education.
The time has come to focus on the outcome of it.
Till now the stress has been on how many are attending school.
But now we will have to turn our attention to providing good education, worthy education to children who have made it to schools.
You must have seen the Budget of the present government. An effort is being made to provide quality education.
In the Budget, we have made 10 government universities and 10 private universities free from government control and asked them to accept the challenge to flourish on their own.
We have asked them to come up with what they would like to do to become the best universities.
We have done this with the intention of giving them a free hand.
Along with importance to education, there is importance to skill.
Since a long time people have been asking me questions on one topic.
Some have written on my web portal mygov. in, others have written to me on NarendraModiApp.
Prime Minister Namaskar, I am Mona Karnwal from Bijnore.
For the youth in todays age, along with studies, sports are also of great importance.
They should have a feeling of team spirit and the qualities of a good leader for their overall holistic development.
I want you to motivate the youth as much as you can, and I want the government to also promote NCC, NSS and the Bharat Scouts and Guides as much as possible.
You people have been sending me so many suggestions that one day I felt that first of all I must talk to these people.
I asked them if they have ever had a meeting before, and they said that since Independence, this was the first time that they were attending a meeting like this.
So first I would like to felicitate my young friends who put pressure on me, the result of which was that I held this meeting.
They are doing a lot in their own way but if work is done collectively, in an organized manner, then these various organizations of ours can bring about huge results.
Its true that I myself have been a cadet in the NCC and so I know firsthand how one acquires a fresh perspective through such organizations.
I did get the benefit of that in my childhood. I believe that we should infuse a new life, a new force into these organizations.
This time I put some issues before them.
We spoke on many issues.
Do we need to add anything new in their functioning and their programmes
If you write to me on my NarendraModiApp , I will send them to the right place. After this meeting, I feel they are going to gain a new momentum.
Now even you will wish to join one of them.
My dear fellow citizens, I now wish to talk about something that will compel us all to think.
I view it also as something that is going to shake us all.
You must have seen for yourself that the political situation in our country is such that in the previous elections political parties made promises of giving each household 9 to 12 gas cylinders.
And each political party felt that if they had to politically approach the middle class society, then gas cylinder was a major issue.
This has been everybodys experience.
No one ever thought beyond this.
Today, my dear fellow citizens, I have utmost pleasure in placing before you all my own account on this.
I have chosen the third way out and that is the path of placing trust and confidence in the people and the masses.
At times we political leaders should trust our people more than we trust ourselves.
My dear fellow citizens, this is not a small matter.
And in our country subsidy has turned into a kind of a right that people expect.
I would like to specially appeal to the entire political class to place implicit faith in the people.
That will fetch such terrific results that one could have never ever imagined.
We should move in this direction.
I have always felt this way, like when I felt why Class 3 and Class 4 employees should be made to go through interviews.
We should trust the person who has given the exams and submitted the marks.
Sometimes I feel that we should publicly announce that today on this route of the railways there will be no ticket checker.
We cannot make these into government rules but we can certainly create that kind of an atmosphere.
This atmosphere has not been created by any political leader but by one crore families of India.
Each newspaper and news channel has bad news for its every breaking news.
Is there not anything good happening around in this country populated by 125 crore people
Please change this situation.
Ravi ji has expressed his anger but I think he is not venting his anger on me but on the prevailing conditions.
You may remember that the former President of India, Dr A.
These days I have noticed that some T. V.
So it is right to say that there is an atmosphere all around of positive news.
And everybody feels that the people should get the right news and good news.
It is true that even if the most highly placed men and women relate the best possible things in the best possible words and in the best possible manner, good news has a better impact than that. Good news becomes the greatest reason and inspiration to do something good.
It is true that the more we give prominence to good things, the less space there will be for bad things.
If we light a lamp, the darkness is sure to be dispelled.
You all must be aware that the government has started a website,transforming india.
On this you get news of positive happenings, not just of the government but also of the people around.
This is a portal where even you can send news of any good thing thats happened to you.
You can contribute to the site.
Raviji you have given a good suggestion, but please dont get angry with me.
There is one great speciality of our country the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela can become the centre of tourist attraction as well.
Very few know that since a long time, crores and crores of people have gathered on the river-banks for this festival.
The peaceful atmosphere at the Kumbh Mela gives moments of tranquillity to the soul.
These festivals, from the point of view of organization, event management and peoples participation, set new and high standards.
I have been noticing for the last two days that many people have uploaded pictures of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela.
I would like the Tourism Department of the Government of India and the State Government to hold a photo competition on this occasion. People should be encouraged to take the finest photographs and upload them.
It is not that the cleanliness remains confined to that place. People should carry back the message of cleanliness with them.
I believe that even if the Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual occasion, we can turn it into a social occasion.
As always, the unshakeable bond between your inner thoughts and those of mine gives me immense pleasure.
As usual, you and I eagerly keep waiting for Mann Ki Baat.
This time too, numerous letters, comments phone calls have poured in full of stories, suggestions inspiration everybody wants to do something or the other also wanting to say it out.
Yet, once again I want to offer you your own precious thoughts, woven together on the singular thread of Mann Ki Baat.
It must be part of your recent memory that in the earlier episode, I had referred to a collection of short stories by Premchand ji, We had decided that on reading any book, some of its facets should be shared with all through the Narendra Modi App.
Some have advised me to dwell upon many other books.
But I must candidly admit here that I am not able to devote much time to reading books these days.
But I have gained a lot, in the sense that based on your correspondence here, I got opportunities to know about the themes of many kinds of books.
But the experience over the last one month makes me feel that we need to take it forward.
Why dont we create a permanent book corner on the Narendra Modi App, so that, whenever we read a book, we write about it and discuss it on this platform And you can even suggest an apt name for our book corner.
I have experienced the fact that this topic has stirred the nations heart strings collectively.
Many an informed, effective endeavour is afoot across the country.
People have shared information on traditional methods.
The media has embarked upon quite a few innovative campaigns.
Be it the Government or NGOs, something or the other is being carried out on a war footing.
The rural folk donated sweat, toiling collectively, to change the course of a mountain spring.
It was a purely indigenous, home grown method.
This has led to not only stopping soil erosion prevention of crop damage, but also facilitated effective irrigation of fields.
And you will be happy to know that the beautiful North Eastern State of Meghalaya has become the first state to have formulated its own water-policy.
I congratulate the Government of Meghalaya.
In Haryana, crops that require meagre water are being encouraged. Farmers thus are saved from suffering losses.
Many fairs are held on these occasions.
Why dont we use these fairs to spread the message of water conservation
All sections of society turn up in fairs in large numbers.
Here, we can effectively spread awareness on the need to save water through forums such as exhibitions and street plays, thus using the festive fervour to convey the message of water conservation with ease.
Actually, this month, the World Childrens Winners Games were held in Moscow.
It is a unique sports tournament meant for young cancer survivors only they who have emerged fighting cancer, can take part.
In this tournament, sports games such as shooting, chess, swimming, running, football table-tennis are organized.
All Ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament.
Out of these, some players even won more than one medal.
People from across the country, such as Sanjiv Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
Arvind Rao from Telangana, and many others have written to me on Narendra Modi App and mygov, urging me to speak on Chandrayaan II in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, in the realms of Space, 2019 has been a very fruitful year for India.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March.
After that, amidst the hectic engagements during Elections, an important development such as the A-Sat could not be a prominent part of the discourse.
Whereas the fact is, through the A-Sat, we have acquired the capability of destroying a satellite three hundred Kilometres away in a mere three minutes.
India became the fourth country in the world, possessing this capacity. And now, on the 22nd of July, the nation watched with pride Chandrayaan II taking strides into space from Sriharikota.
Visuals of Chandrayaan II lifting off filled our countrymens hearts with glory, zest and joy.
Chandrayaan II is a mission that is special on many counts.
It will lead to a better understanding of the Moon on our part.
We will be able to gather detailed information knowledge. But if you ask me what the two greatest lessons I have received from Chandrayaan II, I shall say they are Faith Fearlessness.
We should trust our talents capacities we should have faith in them.
You will be glad to know that Chandrayaan II is INDIAN to the core.
It is thoroughly Indian in heart spirit.
It is completely a swadeshi, home grown mission.
This mission has proved beyond doubt, once again, that when it comes to attempting an endeavour in new age, cutting edge areas, with innovative zeal, our scientists are second to none. They are the best...
The second important lesson is never lose hope in the face of stumbling blocks or obstacles.
The way our scientists rectified Technical issues in record time, burning the midnight oil, is in itself an exemplary, unparalleled task.
The world watched the Tapasya, the awesome perseverance of our scientists.
We should also feel proud of the fact that despite hindrances, there is no change in the arrival time...
many are amazed at that. We have to face temporary setbacks in life... but always remember- the capacity to overcome them resides within us.
I fervently hope that the Chandrayaan II mission will inspire our youth towards Science Innovation.
After all, Science is the path to progress.
We are now expectantly waiting for the month of September, when Lander Vikram Rover Pragyan will land on Lunar surface.
Through Mann Ki Baat today, I wish to share with students, my young friends, information on a very interesting competition ... I invite young boys girls to a uiz Competition.
I urge my young friends, students to participate in this competition and make it interesting and memorable through their participation.
I specially call upon schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers mentors to strive hard to ensure victory for their respective schools.
And the most thrilling part is that students scoring the highest in their respective states will be invited to visit Sriharikota, with expenses borne by the Government. There in September they will get an opportunity to witness the moment when Chandrayaan would be landing on the surface of the Moon.
For these winners, it will be a historic event of their life. But for that, you will have to participate in the uiz competition, score the highest be a winner.
My dear countrymen, you must have observed one thing.
Our chain of Mann Ki Baat has lent pace to the cleanliness campaign from time to time. Similarly, efforts towards ensuring cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
A journey that began five years ago gathered momentum with mass participation is now setting up newer benchmarks in cleanliness sanitation.
It is not that we have reached the ideal yet, but the way we have achieved success in ODF clean public spaces, it displays the collective will strength of the resolve of a hundred thirty crore countrymen. But we are not stopping at that.
This movement has now advanced from cleanliness towards beautification.
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team on the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who left his job in America and returned to serve Mother India.
Recently, he has picked up the gauntlet to not just clean up Delhi, but to beautify it.
With his team, he began with the garbage bins of Lodi Garden.
Through the medium of street art, he has decorated many localities of Delhi with aesthetically appealing paintings.
From over bridges to school walls to hutments he gave a free hand to his talent, garnering huge public support on the way, on the lines of an effective campaign.
Remember how, during the Kumbh, Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings
I came to know that Yogesh Saini his team played a stellar role in it.
Colours lines may be mute, but when they merge to form a picture, the rainbow that emanates speaks louder than a thousand words. We experience this in the beauty, the aesthetics of the Swachchata Abhiyan.
It is imperative that the culture of transforming waste to wealth develops in our society.
In a way, we have to move ahead on the path of converting garbage to gold.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting comment on My gov.
This comment came from Brother Muhammad Aslam who stays in Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
He wrote, I like listening to the programme Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy to let you know that I played a positive active role in organizing the community mobilisation programme- Back to Village in my state Jammu Kashmir.
Simultaneously, there should be a provision for online monitoring too.
According to me, this was a one of a kind programme where the public directly entered into a dialogue with the Government.
Brother Mohd Aslam ji had sent me a message upon reading which I felt curious to know more about the Back to village programme and when I got to knew it at length, I felt that the entire nation should get to know about this programme.
The people of Kashmir are eager to join the national main stream, their enthusiasm is reflected in the mechanism of this programme.
Literacy, sex ratio, health, hygiene, water conservation, electricity, water, Girl education, senior citizens concerns etc. were some of the topics that were discussed at length.
Friends, this programme was not a mere Government formality that officials roam around the village and return to base, instead of this the officials spent two days and a night at the panchayat, enabling them to spend time in the village and meet almost every denizen of the village and to reach across to every establishment in the village.
Many sports competitions for kids were organized under the aegis of Khelo India.
Sports Kits, MNREGA job cards and SCST certificates were distributed.
The people of Kashmir open heartedly became equal stakeholders in this festival.
The most heartening aspect of Back to village programme is the fact, that it was organized in such remote villages, where even officials had to traverse difficult terrain and climb mountains while walking on foot over a period of day or day and a half.
These officials also reached the panchayats on the border which live under the shadow of cross-border firing, not only this the officials reached the sensitive villages in the districts of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag, without any fear.
Some officers were so overwhelmed by the reception they received, that they decided to extend their stay upto two days in these villages.
The organizing of Gram Sabhas in these villages, wherein the people participated in large numbers and chalked out schemes for themselves is something that is an extremely pleasant experience.
It is clear that those who wish to spread hatred en route to development, pose hurdles will never succeed in their sinister plans.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatraya Ramchandra Bendre, gyanpith laureate and poet has described the significance of the month of Sawan in this manner- in his poem.
Meaning that the relationship between drizzling rain and stream of water is wondrous and earth gets bedazzled by such spectacle
In entire India, people of different cultures and languages, celebrate the onset of rainy season in their own fashion.
Whenever we look around us in this season it appears as if earth has draped itself in a sheet of greenery
There is generation of renewed energy all around us.
In this pious season many devotees perform the Kanwad Yatra and many proceed on the Amarnath pilgrimage, many observe fasts and eagerly wait for festivals like Janamasthmi and Nag Panchmi.
It is during this season that the festival of Raksha Bandhan symbolizing the bond between a brother and sister also falls.
While we are talking of the month of sawan, you will be glad to learn that the number of pilgrims in the Amarnath Yatra this year has been the greatest in the past 4 years.
A total of 3 lakh pilgrims have had the darshan of the holy Amarnath shrine from 1st July till now.
In 2015, the number of devotees who performed this pilgrimage over 60 days has been crossed over by the number of pilgrims in mere 28 days this year
I would especially like to thank the hospitality of the people of Jammu- Kashmir while referring to successful organization of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return after performing this pilgrimage become imbued with the feelings of warmth and kinship displayed by the people of the state.
These are portents of booming tourism in the future.
I have been told that within a span of a month- and- a half of the commencement of Chardham Yatra in Uttarakhand this year, more than 8 lakh devotees have had the darshan of Kedarnath Shrine.
This is a record number of pilgrims post the apocalyptic events of 2013.
I appeal to all of you to visit those tourist spots within our country whose scenic beauty is to behold during the monsoon.
There are no better ways to witness this nations beauty and peoples sentiments and no better teachers than tourism and pilgrimage.
I extend my felicitation to you all, that may this beauteous and lively month of Sawan fill all of us with new energy, new hopes and new expectations.
The month of August also brings the memories of uit India movement.
I wish that all of us celebrate 15th August with special preparations and find out new ways to observe this festival of freedom with greater participation of masses.
On television, we witness just one aspect of monsoon- floods everywhere, water logging and traffic jam The other picture of monsoon- the overjoyed farmer, chirping birds, gurgling waterfalls and earth wrapped under a green cover, to witness this you will have to step out along with your family.
Rains bring freshness and happiness with them, my heartiest wish is that the monsoon keep on bringing happiness to you and you all enjoy best of health.
My dear countrymen, where to begin Mann Ki Baat and where to end it, is a difficult task
I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.
Some of my young friends must be busy with their examinations.
I am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between India and Australia this evening.
Some days ago India won two fine matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
We need to usher revolutionary changes in sports.
We can see that happening in India. As with Cricket, theres now increasing interest in Football, Hockey, Tennis, and Kabaddi.
You must have come to know that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year.
Twenty-four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country.
On the other hand, I have been noticing that interest in Football among the youth in India has been rising be it the English Premier League, Spanish League or the Indian Super League matches.
Young Indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television.
How can we introduce an element of competitiveness in governments, educational institutes and social organisations to associate with the game
We can see all this happening in relation to cricket
we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well.
Its a golden chance to build Indias image.
My dear students, you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays.
And I have noticed that the kind of work which our Department of Tourism, our Department of Culture, State Governments and the Government of India cant do, that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of Indian tourists.
India is full of diversities.
Perhaps there isnt a district in India which I have not visited.
In this context, I would like to specially congratulate Coal India.
This is only the beginning, but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this Eco-friendly Mine-tourism site at Savaner near Nagpur.
Both tourists and local residents of these places are contributing to it.
Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done.
Can you too, being a tourist, lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations
I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task.
There are many employment opportunities created by tourism.
India lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world.
But if we, 125 crore Indians, decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector, we can attract the world.
We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side. Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India.
Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens we all have to come together to make this happen.
Come, lets make an endeavour in this direction.
My dear young friends, I dont like it when holidays are just frittered away.
If you dont know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays
If you dont know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays
Or you could tell yourself, I type with just two fingers on the keyboard, so shouldnt I learn proper way of typing
There are so many skills to develop our personality.
When you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays, and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new, they will realise that they wasted their time.
They will admire you, You are a very determined man, my friend, you have accomplished something concrete.
This will perhaps become a big thing among friends.
This time a lot of suggestions have come for Mann Ki Baat on www.
mygov. in: Sound Byte- My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
Namaste dear Prime Minister, you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water.
I did this and enjoyed it and in this way I made friends with a lot of birds.
He has reminded me of a good deed by calling me.
Last summer I had remembered it and asked you to put water in earthen bowls for the birds during summers.
Abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends.
The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds.
She wrote this in one of her poems, We shall not let you fly far way, we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water...
Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do.
I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.
Have we ever given them water to drink
Shilpa, I am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner.
Of course, it is a part of our nature in India.
But I am glad, Shilpa, that you have observed these things.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term Digital India.
Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities.
No, its not like that.
You will be happy to learn that a Kisan Suvidha App has been launched to serve your interests.
If you download this Kisan Suvidha App on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, summer is holiday time for the rest of the people, but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more.
A farmer waits for the rains.
For farmers, the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance.
We will have to give a thought to what will happen if theres no water.
Can we utilise this time to visit ponds, check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing, because of which reservoirs get depleted.
If we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds, rivers and streams, then even if the rains fail later, our losses will be reduced.
You must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs.
Under MNREGA also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation.
There must be many such villages in the country, many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work.
But we still need to do much more in this direction.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a very big Kisan Mela, Farmers Fair.
There I saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture.
But we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields.
Now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed.
We should move forward with this mantra and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods.
I hope we will do, with full concentration, whatever is necessary for water conservation. We have a couple of months till the onset of monsoon.
My dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April.
This year the theme of the World Health Day is Beat Diabetes.
It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics.
Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths.
Type 2 is due to your habits, age and obesity. The world is worried about Diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for World Health Day on 7th April.
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes.
If you are interested in Yoga, then do Yoga.
Or else, the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run.
If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my country will be healthy.
Sometimes we are reluctant to get our medical check-up done.
When the condition worsens then only does it come to our notice that it is Diabetes to blame.
This shows TB is one illness that can be detected fast.
My dear fellow citizens, there is a lot of work being done in this direction.
I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these.
So I call upon all of you today to defeat Diabetes and free ourselves from Tuberculosis.
My dear fellow citizens, a number of important occasions are coming up in April, especially on 14th of April which happens to be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country.
The five pilgrimage spots associated with him Mhow, his birthplace
London, where he was educated, Nagpur, where he had his Deeksha
I am fortunate to get the chance to visit Mhow, the birthplace of our revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 14th April this year.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens.
We can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens.
In a few days from now, the new year of Vikram Samvat will begin.
It is celebrated in different states in different forms.
You can listen to it on your own mobile handset.
All you have to do is to give a missed call.
Give a missed call on this number whenever it is convenient for you.
Even if you wish to listen to any previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, you can listen to it in the language of your choice.
I will be happy to remain connected with you.
My dear fellow citizens, my heartiest best wishes to you all.
How can we increase the interest of our youth in sports through the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup
You should robustly participate in this event.
Photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them.
If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.
They should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before.
But Western Coalfields Limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism.
When tourists visit a place, even the not-so-well-off among them spend money.
Rich tourists are bound to spend more money.
I will give you something to ponder upon.
Can you resolve to add one skill, one special attribute to your personality, during your holidays
Why not overcome some of our shortcomings
Suppose you are fond of painting and you dont know how to paint.
Just start painting and gradually you will get better at it.
You must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent, acquiring some new skill.
There can be countless areas where you could do so
Shilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue.
If you pose a question to them, they will reply to it they will explain things to you.
Why dont you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you
If you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also.
Every village should save water.
How can we save every drop of water during the coming rains
How do we begin an exercise to ensure that every drop of water in the village stays within the village
I welcome this.
Excessive use of fertilisers has made our Mother Earth unwell.
But if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments, then would one want to eat that food
The same food would taste so bad, isnt it
but now that it is curable, we have become almost careless about it.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2016 My dear fellow citizens, Namaskar.
That must be playing on your mind.
I wish to be a part of this journey along with you.
I am concerned about your childrens exams as much as you are, but I am not worried.
If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.
When I shared my inner thoughts with you during last months Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App.
It makes me immensely happy that teachers and students who have had successful careers, as also parents and social thinkers, have shared their experiences and suggestions with me.
Today, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers.
I will share some of the things that I have heard, what I have read, and what I have been told. I will add my views on some exam-related issues about which I feel strongly.
I am confident that students who will be appearing for exams will find what I have to say immensely useful to them.
My dear students, before I begin, why not let a well-known world opener make the opening comments about the things and experiences that helped him achieve heights of success in his life
That would definitely be useful for you.
I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now.
Many of you are going to be tense about them.
I have only one message for you all.
Your parents, your teachers, your family members and your friends have a lot of expectations from you.
Wherever you go, you will be asked How are the preparations going
How many marks are you likely to score
When I used to play cricket, there were a lot of expectations from me as well.
I faced a lot of difficult moments in these last 24 years and many a times there were good moments too.
But people always had high expectations from me. As time passed, their expectations kept growing.
So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this.
Thats when I decided that I would set expectations for myself and set my own targets.
My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own.
Friends, you heard what Tendulkar-ji had to say.
Dont buckle under the pressure of expectations.
It is you who have to shape your own future.
Why do we waste our time competing with others
If you were to do that, none would be able to stop you from moving ahead. When you break your own record, you will not have to depend on others for happiness and satisfaction.
There will be a sense of inner satisfaction.
Friends, dont look at exams as a game of numbers.
How much did I score, where did I score
dont get trapped in this score-keeping.
Exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not, whether we are moving at the right speed or not.
So, if our dreams are big and magnificent, exams will become a joyful experience.
So dont brood over what is going to happen in these exams this year.
Have a large perspective and a goal, and move ahead.
Once you do that, even if you achieve less than what you had expected, you will not be disappointed. Rather, it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time.
Thousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app.
In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.
I agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise ones preparation.
One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time.
This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping.
My friends complain to me often that I sleep very little.
At the time of exams, you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension.
I hope you will not do that.
I am sure you wont do anything like that.
Discipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives.
Not just that, our entire routine collapses.
So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant.
Do things the way you have planned them.
Those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked, end up having a negative impact on their results as well.
On the other hand, students who have the confidence in what they know are able to tackle whatever comes in the question paper.
Come, why dont you learn how to checkmate in exams from him
Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand.
First of all, let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams.
I will next talk a little bit about how I went to my exams and my experiences for that.
I found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life.
You need to be well rested, get a good nights sleep, you need to be on a full stomach, you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm.
It is very, very similar to a game of Chess.
When you play, you dont know, which pawn will appear, just like in a class you dont know, which question will appear in an exam.
So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment.
So stay calm.
It is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself, dont keep your expectations too high.
Just see it as a challenge do I remember what I was taught during the year, can I solve these problems.
At the last minute, just go over the most important things and the things you feel, the topics you feel, you dont remember very well. You may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students, while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter.
If you revise the questions you find difficult, you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam, you will be able to deal with them much better.
So stay calm, get a good nights sleep, dont be over-confident but dont be pessimistic either.
I have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before.
You must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments, he sits with such a healthy composure.
It is difficult to bring that inner peace within you just by someone merely asking you to do so, but one should try.
If you dont speak to your friends, walk alone, and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment, then you cannot have peace of mind.
But if the water is agitated, we can see nothing through it.
There are occasions when if I have to strain myself to concentrate, I feel an inner stress building up.
Then I realize that if I relax a bit, I will feel better.
So here is a technique I have developed for myself.
I do deep-breathing. I breathe deeply three to five times.
Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand.
This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.
Rajat Agarwal has told us something good.
He wrote on my app that we should spend half an hour every day with friends and family to feel relaxed.
And what do you do
Friends, please dont do this.
If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw. Just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents.
What Rajat ji has said is worth pondering over.
Friends, what can I tell you about peace of mind today, before you go for your exams.
A message has come for you from someone, who is essentially a teacher-turned-a-value educator.
From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world.
Our revered Murari Bapu has sent some important tips for students.
Friends I want to tell you about another thing today.
G.
One thing is for sure, whether it is your student days or any other phase of your life, Yoga is a major key to the development of your inner mind.
you must pay more attention to it.
I have a lot of faith in Yoga.
My dear young friends, you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall, you are in a rush to quickly be seated in your place.
Otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress.
In fact, it will be quite profitable as things become clearer for you and later you wont have any regrets.
I have seen that when we get the question paper, sometimes we find that it has been modelled on a new pattern.
He has emphasized the virtue of patience.
He has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students. Come,let me tell you the message of Shri Rao.
R.
Rao from Bangalore.
I fully realise that the examinations cause anxiety. That too competitive examinations.
Do not worry, do your best.
Thats what I tell all my young friends.
At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country.
Decide what you want to do in life and dont give it up. You will succeed.
Do not forget that you are a child of the universe. You have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains.
All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity.
With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours.
I wish you luck in everything you want to do.
God Bless.
See the style of talking that a scientist has
What I take half an hour to say, he says in a few minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses.
I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country.
The things that he mentioned about dedication, determination, diligence...
just keep at it my friends.
If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid.
And a golden future awaits you for doing well.
Ruchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience.
This is the way it should be. Sachin ji also talked of a positive approach, a positive frame of mind. We have to radiate a positive energy.
There are many things that inspire us, and dont think that they inspire only students.
No matter at which point of life you are at, fine examples and true stories give great inspiration, great strength, and pave a new path in times of trouble.
We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison.
But friends, have you ever thought how many years he spent on his work, how many times he met with failure, how much time had to be devoted, how much money was spent, how much disappointment he must have faced when he met with failures.
Do you know that he had no formal education in Mathematics Yet he made a significant contribution to various topics like mathematical analysis, number theory, etc.
K.
Rowling has herself said that in times of trouble she would channelize all her energies into tasks that had real significance for her.
Exams are not just for the students, they also put the students families, schools and teachers to test.
Vijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations.
Its impact is overwhelming we all want to link ourselves to science and technology.
We also want to move ahead with the speed of science.
I say all this because, friends, today is National Science Day, the festival of science in this country.
This was the discovery for which he received the Nobel Prize.
And so the nation celebrates this day as National Science Day.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Each person should have a scientific thinking, should be attracted to science. Each generation should lay stress on innovation.
And innovation is not possible without science and technology.
Today on National Science Day we should resolve that innovation should gain importance.
I humbly pay my homage to Sir C.
Friends, sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us, our way of looking at life changes completely.
You must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science.
Scientists have labored hard, generations of them have persevered, and after nearly 100 years they have gained a huge success.
This discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century, Albert Einstein, but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics.
It is going to be of use for the whole of humankind.
But being Indians, we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery, the sons of our country, our worthy Indian scientists, were also a part of it.
Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward
India will be a part of future international efforts.
My dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision.
To gain more success about this discovery, the Government of India has decided to install a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, in short it is called LIGO, here in India.
This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world.
This process is going to gain fresh momentum and strength with India joining hands with others.
India, with its reputed resources, will surely be an active participant in this superior science discovery which is for the welfare of humankind.
My dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number.
From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat.
You can even listen to it in your mother tongue.
The number to give a missed call on is 81908-81908. I repeat 81908-81908.
Friends, your exams begin from day after tomorrow. I have to take an exam tomorrow.
125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam.
My exam gets over tomorrow and yours begin the dayafter.
Let us hope we all are successful, then the country will surely succeed.
So friends lots of good wishes to you all.
Free from all tension of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind. Keep going at it.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2016
We celebrated Christmas and preparations are now on to ring in the New Year.
India is land of diversities.
We celebrate a whole lot of festivals.
At times it feels India is one such country which has a festival driven economy.
May the world be free of crises, be it from terrorism, from global warming or from natural calamities or manmade tragedies. There can be no greater happiness than the humanity having a peaceful existence.
You are aware that I use a lot of technology which provides me lots of information.
I keep a watchful eye on my portal My Gov.
People also travel to celebrate Christmas vacations.
He says most of the facilities related to tourism are catered to but special emphasis should be laid on cleanliness at all places which are tourist destinations or famed tourist places, religious destinations or stay overs.
We say, Atithi devo bhava and just imagine how we strive to keep our homes neat and clean when a guest is due to arrive.
In a similar manner, the onus is on us to maintain our tourist destinations and pilgrim tourism sites neat and clean.
Dileep Singh Malviya is an elderly artisan from Bhojpura village in Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh.
And when it came to my notice, I wanted to share this story with you.
Hailing from a small village, Dileep Singh Malviya decided that if anyone provides materials for toilet in the village, he will render his labour services free of cost.
And hats off to him, he has constructed 100 toilets in Bhojpura village so far taking it as a divine cause and providing his labour services without charging a penny.
My heartfelt congratulations to Dileep Singh Malviya for his earnest efforts.
Due to tireless efforts of many people the nation is making rapid progress.
Every Indian is proud to know how the world is accepting and getting attracted towards Yoga. When the world celebrated International Yoga Diwas and the entire world got associated with it, we became proud of our country.
Such emotions arise when we see the enormity of our nation.
The concept of cleanliness is being echoed in every household.
The participation of citizens is also increasing.
The biggest achievement of this task is that the government officials involved in this task will have immense satisfaction that they have done something which will bring about such a big change in the lives of the people and the village itself. Be it the farmers, poor, young or women, should such things reach them or not
Such news should reach them not to highlight any governments achievement, but to make them aware of their rights. They should not let go if it is their right.
We should all make efforts that right information, good information and information useful to the common man should reach as many people as possible.
This is also a kind of service.
I too have tried to do this work from my end.
I cannot do everything alone by myself. But if I am saying then I should at least do something.
You too get connected with this initiative, we have to reach 125 crore Indians.
How will I reach without your help
Come, let us collectively do such things of interest for the common man in their language and inspire them to avail things which are their rights.
My dear young friends, I had some preliminary discussions about Start-up India, Stand-up India in my speech on 15th August from the Red Fort.
After that all government departments started discussing it.
Can India become a Start-up Capital
Can our states work together for new Start-ups for youth, and encourage innovations with start-ups, be it in the manufacturing sector, service sector or agriculture.
Everything should be new, new ways and new thinking - after all the world does not move ahead without innovation.
Start-up India, Stand-up India brings in a huge opportunity for the young generation.
My dear young friends, the government will launch the entire action plan for Start-up India, Stand-up India on 16th January.
This is not true at all, we need to modify it according to the needs of India.
For example, when a poor person works somewhere as a labourer and there is a lot of physical effort involved but if a young man innovates something which can reduce the physical effort and help the labourer- I will call it as a Start-up.
And I will request the state governments to take this forward.
I will definitely interact with you on 16th January and will discuss this in detail.
Your suggestions are always welcome.
Dear young friends, 12th January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
There are thousands like me who draw inspiration from him.
Since 1995, 12th January, the birth Anniversary of Vivekananda is celebrated as the National Youth Festival.
This year it will be organized from 12-16th January in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh.
This is a theme based event and I have got the information that this time they have a very good theme and that is Indian Youth on Development Skill and Harmony.
He called me up to express his feelings: Sir, we celebrated Accessible India Campaign in our school.
Sometimes when we meet someone with different ability in the society then a lot of things come to our mind.
It is true that words have their own significance.
This year when the government of India started the Sugamya India programme. I was supposed to attend it, but could not make it, because of severe floods in Chennai and other areas of Tamil Nadu.
However, since I had to attend that program some thoughts kept coming iin my mind.
So I thought why not use the term Divyang instead of viklang in our country.
They are those people who have one or more such organs which have divinity, where divine power flows which we normal bodied people do not have.
I like this term.
My dear countrymen can we make it a habit to use the word Divyang and make it popular.
I hope that you will take this forward.
That day we started the Sugamya Bharat campaign.
Under this campaign we will improve both the physical and virtual infrastructure and make it accessible for the Divyang people.
Be it schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, railway stations, everywhere ramps, accessible parking, accessible lifts, Braille, many amenities will be made available.
People like it.
You too can join in the manner you deem fit.
My dear countrymen, the government schemes will continue exist and run, but it is necessary that these schemes always remain operational.
The schemes should be operational till the last the mile individual has benefitted from them.
They should not have a dead existence in government files.
After all, these schemes are meant for common man, the poor people. In the past few days the government has made an effort to ensure that the benefits of schemes reach out to the rightful owners.
In our country, we give subsidy for the gas cylinders.
Crores of rupees were spent on it but we did not know if it reached the right people or not. If this subsidy reached people on time or not
The Government has made some changes in the scheme.
The government undertook the largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme to provide subsidy directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries with the help of Jan Dhan Account or Aadhar Card etc.
I am happy to share with the countrymen that this scheme has earned a place in Guinness Book of World Records as the largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme which has been implemented successfully.
This scheme is known as Pehel and this experiment has been very successful.
Till November end, around 15 crore LPG customers have become its beneficiaries.
The government money is being directly transferred to the accounts of 15 crore beneficiaries.
No middlemen nor any recommendation, nor any possibility of corruption.
On one hand was the Aadhar Card Scheme, and on the other was the Jan Dhan Account. Thirdly the state and Indian government compiled the lists of beneficiaries.
This work is still in progress. Nowadays, even the MNREGA scheme, which provides employment opportunities in villages, is being connected to it.
There were lots of complaints about this scheme.
According to my rough estimate, around 35-40 schemes are now under Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is the golden moment in the life of Indian democracy.
This is a beautiful co-incidence that Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the maker of the Indian Constitution, his 125th birth anniversary will be celebrated this year.
We organized a two day special discussion on the constitution and it was a very good experience.
All the parties and all the members deliberated on the sanctity of the constitution, its importance to understand the true interpretation of the constitution. It was an excellent discussion.
We should take this thing forward. Can Republic Day be an opportunity to connect the masses with the system
Our constitution grants us several rights and there are many discussions on it and it should be so and it is equally important.
At the most, whenever there are elections, then we see advertisement all around us, they write on the walls and hoardings are put to tell that to vote is our sacred duty.
There is a lot of talk about duties during elections, but why not discuss our duties in general life too.
This year when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar then can we make 26th January a medium to organize debates, poetry, slogan competition regarding duties in our own schools, colleges, villages, cities and various organizations and societies.
If 125 crore Indians take dutiful steps one after the other, they can make history.
I want to know your views.
Send them on my portal My Gov.
I would like to know what my young generation thinks about their duties.
And I am not saying this on government lines.
We become so emotional about getting the statues of great men erected but become equally complacent when it comes to maintaining them.
On the other hand Christmas preparations must have started too.
Festivals have their own significance in social life.
Sometimes festivities help to heal wounds and sometimes they are source of renewed energy.
But sometimes when a calamity strikes during festivities then it is very painful and it feels even more.
There is continuous news of natural calamities from various parts of the world.
And sometimes the news is very bizarre, never seen or never heard of.
We are now realizing the effects of climate change very rapidly.
In our country itself, we have experienced torrential rains, that too without season and for a very long duration. Tamil Nadu has suffered heavy losses and other states suffered too.
Many people lost their lives.
My heart goes out to all those people in this hour of crisis.
The state governments have braced themselves up for rescue and relief work.
The Central government too has joined them in their efforts.
Right now, a team of the Central government officials are in Tamil Nadu.
But I have full faith in Tamil Nadus potential and know that post this crisis it will rise again and speedily move forward and will continue to deliver in its role of taking the country forward.
Now when there are talks of such crisis all around, we feel the need to bring in a lot of change.
About 15 years back natural calamity was a part of the Agricultural Ministrys realm because most of the calamities were limited to famine.
But today, its form and format has changed.
It has become important to work on our capacity building at every level.
The government, civil society, the citizens, and the small organizations will all have to work for capacity building through scientific temperament.
After the Nepal earthquake I talked to Pakistans Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. I suggested that the SAARC nations should come together for a joint exercise on disaster preparedness.
I am happy that a seminar workshop on table talk exercises and best practices was organized in Delhi.
This is a good beginning.
Today, I received a phone call from Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar, Punjab.
I am Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar, Punjab.
We do organic farming in our fields and also guide a lot of others regarding it.
I have a question how to guide people that burning of farm remains or straw not only destroys the micro organisms of the soil but also contributes to the pollution in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana.
Lakhwinder Singh ji, I am happy to hear your message.
I am happy that, you are a farmer engaged in organic farming. And not just that, you also understand the problems of the farmers really well.
Your concerns are right but this just does not happen in Punjab and Haryana alone.
It is a practice in the entire country and traditionally we follow this method of burning off the remains of the crops or the straw.
But the concern you have expressed is genuine.
So the first solution is that the brothers and sisters engaged in agriculture need to be trained. They will need to face the truth on their thinking that burning the remains of crops helps save time and effort and prepares the field for the next crop.
But this is not the truth.
Not only this, if they are chopped into small bits, they can act as a dry fruit for cattle.
Secondly because of burning this the top soil gets burnt.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, just think that if we have strong bones, strong heart, strong kidney, an overall good system but our upper skin gets burnt then what will happen
Even if the heart is strong, we will not be able to survive.
So burning the stump of crops not only burns them, it burns the skin of our motherland. The top soil of our land is burnt which pushes our fertile soil to death.
So it can be used not only to feed the animals, and save our land but also to create good fertilizer. If this is added to the soil, it will be doubly beneficial.
Any plant or any crop sown over those stumps could flourish without water. The water in the stumps kept the crops alive.
And now even their stumps are expensive.
They are now a source of income. Earlier they had to spend money on clearing those stumps, now those very stumps are a source of revenue.
Dear countrymen, the entire world will remember 3rd December as International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
27th November was celebrated as Indian Organ Donation Day.
Many famous personalities including actress Raveena Tandon became a part of it.
Organ Donation can save many valuable lives.
Organ donation can bring about immortality.
When an organ moves from one body to another it gets a new life but the person receiving it gets a new lease of life.
There can be no greater donation than this.
I would like to inform those waiting for organs and those willing to donate that a national registry for organ transplantation has been launched on 27th November.
It is my faith that awareness in this field will increase and the needful will receive the best of help in true sense. This help cannot be obtained till someone donates their organs.
Like I said earlier, 3rd December is being celebrated as International Day of People with Disability.
People with physical and mental disabilities are capable of unparalleled courage and capability.
Sometimes it hurts when they are laughed at.
Sometimes someone expresses pity and sympathy.
But if we change our outlook and our perspective towards them, then these people can inspire us to live.
They can inspire us to do a lot.
We start crying even when small misfortune befalls us.
Then we realize, our problem is so small but how does he survive
How does he live
How does he learn
And hence all of them are a source of inspiration to us.
Their will power, their struggle with life and their zeal to transform crisis into opportunity is worth lot of praise.
Today, I want to talk about Javed Ahmed. He is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, the terrorists had shot Jawed Ahmed in Kashmir.
But the bullet damaged his kidney and a part of the intestine was lost.
He suffered serious spinal injury.
He lost the ability to stand on his own feet, but Jawed Ahmed did not concede defeat.
How to improve the infrastructure for the physically challenged
How to develop systems for the disabled in government offices and public spaces
He is working on those issues.
Is his life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Jawed Ahmed, his dedication and devotion especially on every 3rd December.
I am mentioning just the case of Jawed because of lack of time but such lights of inspiration are prevalent in every corner of the country.
They are giving a new lease of life and illuminating the path for others.
Be it someone from middle class, lower middle class, dalit, exploited, victim or deprived, they have to continuously be in touch with the government or its various organizations. And as a citizen we surely have a bad experience with a government official in our lifetime.
But at the same time within this governmental system there are lakhs of people who by their sense of duty, their dedication do some amazing work which does not get recognized.
Last year we honoured them with a joint Padma Vibhushan.
They do a lot of social work in India.
They are spending their entire retirement time and whatever they have earned on working for the poor.
They are so full of praise for the ASHA workers they work with.
They talk about their dedication and hard work and their zeal to learn about new things.
In the past, the Orissa government especially facilitated an ASHA worker on Independence Day.
The ASHA worker Jamuna Manisingh decided that she will not let anyone die of malaria.
She would go to each household and would be the first one to reach if there was news of fever in any household.
There might be so many Jamuna Mani.
There might be lakhs and lakhs of people around us.
Let us show respect to such individuals.
Such individuals lend power to our nation.
They are partners to the joys and sorrows of others.
I applaud all such ASHA workers through the story of Jamuna Mani.
My dear young friends, who are especially active on the internet and the social media, I want to inform that I have kept 3 e-books on mygov.
Just dont see it, show it to others too. Read it and may be you may find something to connect with it.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
I invite you to come and become a part of nation building.
My dear countryman, the entire world is worried about climate change.
Climate change, global warming is being discussed at every nook and corner and now it has become an accepted standard for embarking on any new task.
The earths temperature should not rise anymore.
This is everyones concern and responsibility too.
And to save us from rising temperatures, the first step is energy conservation.
14th December is National Energy Conservation day.
The government is running many schemes.
D bulb usage. I had once mentioned to switch off the street lights on a full moon night and enjoy the moonlight for an hour.
One should enjoy the moonlight.
There is a woman Noor Jahan in Kanpur. Watching her on television it seemed that she did not have much of a chance to get education.
But she is doing something which no one would have thought of.
She is utilizing the Solar Energy of the Sun to illuminate the houses of the poor.
She is fighting darkness and bringing light to her own name.
She has formed a Samiti (committee) of women who manufacture lanterns that run on Solar Energy.
What kind of cooperation can we expect
Enterprises, Earning, Empowerment.
This initiative is yet to achieve the speed that I have aimed for.
But the start has been good.
Till now 66 lakh people have received 42,000 crore rupees through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am happy that out of the 66 lakh recipients 24 lakh were women. And most of the beneficiaries are from the SC, ST, OBC category who want to work hard and run their families independently.
Abhishek has himself narrated his excitement.
I too keep receiving various news.
Someone just told me that there is one Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
I had told about my cleanliness campaign that it will create new entrepreneurs. And Shailesh Bhonsle proved it.
He has purchased a tanker and I have been told that he has already returned 2 lakh rupees in such a short span of time.
She is into the business of making purses.
Our banks should become more sensitized and should help more and more people.
Actually, it is this people who run the economy.
The people engaged in small enterprises give strength to the nations economy.
We want to strengthen these people.
Whatever has happened is good, but more good needs to be done.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October on the Anniversary of Sardar Patel I had discussed about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (One India, Best India).
Conducting such events creates continuous awareness in social life.
Rashtram Jagryam Vyayam: means internal vigilance is the prize of liberty.
What should the structure of the programme be like
What should be its structure
I have been told that many suggestions have been received.
But I am expecting more suggestions.
I expect more specific schemes.
There can be many ideas.
I have complete faith that your ideas will be really useful.
But I would request you to do exercises.
I request you to utilize this good season for some kind of physical activity and exercise.
So make a good habit in this good season.
My good wishes again to all my dear countrymen.
Once again I have the opportunity of connecting with you through Mann ki Baat.
Today the fifth one day cricket match is being played between India and South Africa in Mumbai.
This series has been named as the Gandhi-Mandela series.
It is at an interesting point with both teams having won 2 matches each. So the last game is significantly important.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today I would like to congratulate the friends at the Kannur centre of Akashwani.
I started the Mann ki Baat and people started connecting with it. One of them was Shraddha Thamban from Kerala a grade 12 student.
I would like to talk about Kerala again.
The girl students from Saint Mary Upper primary School from Chittoor in Kerala have sent me a letter.
Initially I was surprised to see why they created a map of India using thumb prints.
But when I read their letter, I realized how beautifully a symbolic message was given.
Organ donation should become a habit as well as an instinct.
They have asked me in their letter to appeal to people about Organ Donation in Mann ki Baat.
The octogenarian Vasantrao Sudke Guru ji from Maharashtra has been running a movement from a long time.
He says that organ donation should be a celebrated as a festival.
These days I get a lot of messages on phone calls also.
Devesh from Delhi gas also sent me a similar message.
I feel that this topic is very important.
The country needs more than 2. 5 lakh kidneys, hearts and livers for donation per year.
However in a country with 125 crore people, only 5000 transplants could take place.
Each year about one lakh eyes are in need of a vision.
And we are able to reach upto only 25,000 people who need it .
And efforts have been made to guide the states in this direction.
By reducing the paper work, some of the states have made a good effort in speeding up the process involved in organ donation.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu today ranks first in the field of organ donation.
Many social organizations and NGOs are doing commendable job in this direction.
National Organ and Tissue transplant Organization (NOTO) has been established to encourage organ transplant.
The joy of sacrifice is beautifully described in this mantra Tain Tyakten Bhunjhita.
In the past few days we saw on television that the wife of a poor hawker in Delhi received a transplant in Delhis G.
A life was saved.
Dear countrymen, we recently celebrated the festival of Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after some days we will celebrate Diwali too.
We celebrated Eid and Ganesh Chaturthi too.
But amongst all these another big festival is being organized which all our countrymen should be proud of.
In the National Capital of Delhi an India Africa Foreign Summit is being organized from 26th to 29th October.
For the first time a program of this scale is being organized on the Indian soil.
Leaders of 54 African countries and unions have been invited.
The African nations have a population equal to that of India.
If both are combined together they make for a third of the world population.
And it is said that lakhs of years ago it was all one landmass.
Later from the Indian Ocean two parts got separated.
We are making efforts that the people should also meet.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the HRD ministry has done something really commendable.
An essay competition was organized among all the CBSE affiliated schools. A poetry competition was organized to increase their participation.
Almost 1600 schools participated in the event.
It included schools within and outside India. And thousands of children wrote on topics about strengthening the Indo Africa ties.
On the other hand, a mobile exhibition called Memories of Mahatma starting from his birth place Porbander and travelling through North is about to reach Delhi on 29th October.
Lakhs of school children enjoyed this exhibition. The villagers also had a glimpse.
People realized the importance of the role of Mahatma Gandhi in developing the ties of both India and Africa and also the effect of his personality on these nations.
Though it is an Indo Africa summit but how this too can become an opportunity to connect people is clearly evident here.
I heartily congratulate Garima, the students and more than 1600 schools who participated and HRD Ministry for this initiative.
Last time on 15th August I had proposed the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Last month a workshop was organized in Bhopal. All the pradhans, collectors, parliamentarians of villages adopted under Adarsh Gram, the representatives of Indian government and state government, all had an in-depth discussion on this program.
Many new and encouraging things came to our attention.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat from Khunti district to be adopted for Adarsh Gram.
A successful effort has been made in Parsi village to create awareness along with infrastructure and organizational development.
I would like to congratulate our Honourable parliamentarian Sri Karia Munda ji for the same.
I got similar information from Andhra too.
The MP from Andhra Sri Ashok Gajapati Raju became involved in this plan and chose Dwarapudi Gram Panchayat from Vijaynagram district for the same.
And so, nearly 550 adults were taught by these children and made literate.
Just see, no budget, no circular, no special arrangements but just will power brought about such a big change. This is amply demonstrated by the Dwarapudi Gram Panchayat.
Similarly, another respectable parliamentarian Sri C.
L Ruwala ji, he is an MP from Mizoram, our North East.
He chose Khwalahilung village for Adarsh Gram and ran a special initiative.
This village is famous for sugarcane production and a Kurtayi jaggery.
They discussed how the village could be made the centre of economic activities and how it could market for its produce.
I congratulate Ruwala ji for his efforts to make this village not only an Adarsh gram but self dependent village too.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is not possible that there be an episode of Mann ki Baat and we do not discuss cleanliness.
She has drawn attention to this issue. I want to remind you my dear countrymen that last year in our country, the media ran a special campaign and showed all the places where crackers were lying and told that it was not the right thing.
And we should express this concern on every public platform.
And today, I especially congratulate all the members of the Indian media fraternity.
This 2nd October, on Gandhi jis anniversary and also on the completion of one year of Clean India Campaign, I had the fortune of participating in the Safaigiri Campaign of the India today group.
They gave away the Clean India Awards and I could see several initiatives being carried out.
Different people were working as One Like, One Mission.
There are so many places in our country that have been kept so clean.
Since the inception of the cleanliness drive I have seen that from Andhra and Telangana, ETV, Eanadu have participated whole heartedly and specially Sri Ramoji Rao who is very aged but beats any youth in his enthusiasm.
He has been successful in bringing together around 51 lakh children from 55-56 thousand schools of Andhra and Telangana to this mission.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, parks or other places, he ran a cleanliness drive.
All these news exhibit the power to realize the dream of a Clean India.
ABP news has started a program called Ye Bharat Desh Hai Mera. In this program they have shown how people have become aware towards cleanliness and through this they are trying to train people about keeping their surroundings clean.
NDTV has started a campaign called Banega Swachh India.
The Governor of Meghalaya, Mr. Shanmuganthan, wrote me a letter and talked about a village in Meghalaya called Mavalyannong.
He has written that from last many years, this village has set out on a mission for cleanliness and more or less every generation is completely dedicated towards this cause.
He has also mentioned that a few years ago they also got the award for the cleanest village of Asia.
This is what reinforces our belief that our nation will be clean one day, for sure. This will be possible because of the efforts of the people, and by the time we celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the 125 crore people of the country should be able to proudly proclaim that we have made India clean.
My dear countrymen, I said this from the Red Fort on the 15th of August that there are few places where corruption is deep rooted.
We keep hearing things like these and this is when I had an idea, why do we need to interview people for ordinary jobs.
I have never heard of any psychologist in the world who can analyze a person completely in a 1-2 minute long interview.
With this thought I decided to do away with the tradition of interviews for small positions.
My dear young friends, I feel very proud to tell you all that the government has completed all the formalities and now there will not be any interview for the non-gazetted posts of group D, group C, and group B in the Central Government.
This will come into effect from January 1st 2016. We will not interrupt the ongoing procedures now but from January 1st, 2016, this will come into play.
So, let me congratulate all my young friends for the same.
We had, anyways, declared an important scheme in the last budget.
In our country, gold has become a part of our social life.
Gold can become our strength. It can become our financial strength.
Gold can become the financial property of the nation and every Indian must contribute to this.
Under this scheme, you can deposit your gold in a bank and the bank will give you interest, same as you deposit your money and get interest from the bank.
Earlier, we used to keep our gold in the lockers and paid for the lockers ourselves.
Now, when you keep your gold in the bank, the bank will give you money as interest.
Now, tell me countrymen, can gold become a property or not
You must avail this opportunity. Another thing is, in Sovereign Gold Bonds, you do not really get a physical gold in your hand.
You get a sheet of paper and the value of that paper is equivalent to that of the amount of gold and the day you return that paper, you will get the amount that is equivalent to the value of gold on that particular day.
I feel very glad to tell you that we are also introducing Gold Coin, a gold coin with Ashok Chakra.
It has been around 70 years of independence but we are still using a foreign gold coin only or the Gold Bullion Bars, these are also used by the foreigners.
Why should it not have the national emblem of our country
This is why we are introducing it in the market and it will be available for the citizens in the coming week, before Dhanteras - 5gm and 10gm of gold coins with Ashok Chakra are being introduced.
Along with it a 20 gm Gold Gunion will also be available for the people.
I have full faith that this new scheme will usher a new change in the financial development of the country and I will get your support in this.
My dear countrymen, 31st October is the birth anniversary of the Iron-Man of India, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
A complete layout of India unfolds in front of us when we talk about Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
This great man has contributed a lot in building the unity of India.
India is full of diversities.
Many sects, communities, languages, castes, attires, and it is this diversity that adds to its charm.
If it was not for this diversity, we wouldnt have been this proud of our country.
This is why diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, social harmony, unity, these are essential elements of a society.
Since last many years, Run for Unity programs have been organized in various parts of the country on the 31st of October.
In the true sense Ekta ki Daud is the true race for development.
Come, let us pay tribute to Sardar Sahab.
Let us take forward the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, you must all be busy in the preparations for Diwali, houses must be getting cleaned.
You must be shopping for new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in various ways all over the country.
I extend my good wishes to you on this pious festival.
Especially children suffer a lot because of fire crackers.
I will suggest all the parents to be careful along with enjoying Diwali and see to it that the kids should not get hurt or any untoward incident should not happen and we lose our child due to accidents.
My dear countrymen, I have to leave for a trip to Britain on the next day of Diwali.
The Indian government and the government of different Indian states give scholarships to such promising students who go abroad to study and who belong to the dalit community, the tribal community or any other under privileged community.
I believe that when these kids go to Britain to study, this memorial of Babasaheb will become a pilgrimage for them, it will become a source of inspiration. Whatever you learn in life, you must use it later for the nation and live for your nation, Babasaheb gave this message and even lived it himself.
This issue has been lying entangled since many years, now it has become the property of 125 crore countrymen and if the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar is attached, you can imagine how happy it makes me.
I am going to get another opportunity in London, the unveiling of the statue of Lord Vishweshwara.
Many years ago, what Lord Vishweshwara had done for democracy and empowerment of women can make for a very good subject to study in the world.
The unveiling of the statue of Lord Vishweshwara on the land of London is in itself a perfect example of the fact that the great men of India were very far-sighted.
My dear countrymen, you are connected with us through Mann ki Baat.
Government officials are called in and discussions are held.
Some people write down their grievances, there are efforts to solve their problems as well.
We should learn more than one language in a country like India.
I am fortunate enough to have learned a few languages, but still there are so many languages that I could not learn.
I am indebted to Akashvani because they broadcast this program of Mann ki Baat by 8 Oclock in every state in their regional languages.
A heartfelt congratulations to all my countrymen once again
Jai Hind.
Last year on 3rd October I had an opportunity to conduct my first ever Mann Ki Baat.
In a democracy the power of the people is of great significance.
This thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why I have immense faith in the power of the people.
But with Mann Ki Baat whatever I was taught, whatever I was explained and the experiences I had, made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking.
Our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual.
My experience of Mann Ki Baat made me realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as I have myself experienced them.
I asked for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat and yet could touch upon just 3-4 of them.
But people continued to contribute actively in lakhs.
This in itself is a great power.
Whosoever saw it realized that they will now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters.
This was a kind of a silent revolution.
I had casually mentioned to my fellow citizens, keeping in mind the tourism industry of India to send me good pictures of the destination they travel to on the lines of Incredible India so that I can also see them.
People sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of India.
Neither the Government of India nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage.
All things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny.
The people themselves took the task forward.
Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of Khadi have almost doubled.
Once I had mentioned in Mann Ki Baat about the problem of poor families, how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit.
Shouldnt they be getting gas cylinders
There is more likelihood of the government being a catalytic agent of change if it is better connected to the society.
They took up every small cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country.
Can there be a bigger satisfaction than this
This time I thought of conducting a new experiment through Mann Ki Baat.
I had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded.
I told them that I will take it up in Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy that we received more than 55,000 calls from across the country - be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup, be it Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There is no part of India from which I did not receive a phone call.
This is a pleasant experience in itself.
People of all age groups have sent messages.
I listened to some message personally and I liked them. My team is working on the others.
You must have spent just a minute or two but for me your phone calls are very important.
The entire government will work on your suggestions.
This made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people.
I am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive.
I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme Mann Ki Baat to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces.
The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies.
We have completed 50 years of our war with Pakistan in 1965.
At that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war, those tales of valour and sacrifice of our great soldiers, which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition.
Whether it is the battle of Haji Pir, Chaminda or Asal Uttar and the visuals of our victory near Haji Pir, we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers.
If you want to create history, then it is necessary to understand the nuances of the past.
History binds us to our roots.
If we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end.
Look at the power of democracy, a young kid has ordered the Prime Minister, although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry.
On the 2nd of October, I declared this cleanliness drive and I think something like this has happened for the first time after Independence because even in the parliament, cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days.
Our government is criticized as well.
I even have to listen to a lot of things people say things like Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened
I dont get offended by all this. I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.
Look at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this.
This ongoing movement of thoughts, the environment thats building against filth, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness.
This will also compel the governments to work.
We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
He once said, if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later. Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi has left a message on MyGov.
My dear fellow citizens, the lives of great men will always inspire us.
It is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men.
Everyone who lives and dies for our nation inspires us.
In the coming days, we will get to remember a lot of these great men.
25th September we shall remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhaya, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on the 2nd of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31st October and there are innumerable names, I have mentioned just a few because our country has an unending list of such gems.
You pick any date, you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history.
I would like to request you for 2nd October specially.
Its the birth anniversary of Honorable Bapu Mahatma Gandhi.
Advertisements worth crores, by the government, cannot achieve what has been achieved through your help.
This is the power of the masses and this is why I request you to come forward and help once again.
Dear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing.
His nephew Chandra Bose had organized everything.
Chandra Bose and his family members were in the process of organising this and last week I received the confirmation that around 50 members of the Bose family are coming to the Prime Ministers residence for a meeting.
You can imagine how happy I must have been on hearing this news.
Netajis family members, probably, must have been invited together to the Prime Ministers residence for the first time.
More than that, I feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that I will get in October must be a one of a kind opportunity for the Prime Ministers residence to offer its hospitality.
More than 50 family members of Subhash babus family who stay in different countries are specially coming down to attend this meeting.
It is going to be a joyous moment for me.
I want to request the Prime Minister to make the young generation aware about voters registration, which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government.
I hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voters list yet, get themselves registered and must vote too.
One of the boys, Kshitij, is a student of class 7. He studies in the Kendriya Vidyalaya of Banaras Hindu University.
He is a very smart kid with a surprising high confidence level.
At such a young age I saw that he was interested in research in the field of Physics.
She is the daughter of Sadavrat Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi.
Her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once, she has everything memorized by the evening. If she picks history, she knows everything by the evening.
He told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has. I was really very impressed.
Sometimes, kids become obsessed with celebrities, Sonam did not have any such obsessions.
I felt this girl is God-gifted.
Meeting these kids was a very special experience that I had on my Kashi visit.
Similarly, I will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids.
I noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in Mann Ki Baat.
Look what Sandeep from Haryana has to say, Sir, I want you to do Mann ki Baat a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words.
Sandeep ji, what all will you make me do
I have to struggle even to make it to the monthly program, have to make adjustments to my time-table.
For now, we will stick to the one month program only.
Mann Ki Baat in a way has completed a year.
Do you know, how much did Subhash babu use the Radio
He started his own show from Germany and he would constantly update the Indian citizens about the Independence movement through radio.
He started the Azad Hind Radio through a weekly news bulletin.
English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu, he used to run the radio in all these languages.
I have also completed a year since I started Mann Ki Baat.
Your suggestions should keep coming in.
The government gets benefited by your suggestions.
It helps to initiate improvement.
Your contribution is priceless for me.
Once again, many congratulations to all of you.
Far south, the people are engrossed in Onam festivities and yesterday the entire nation celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The government of India has launched various schemes of social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time all these schemes have been accepted in large numbers.
I had made a humble request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan we give our sisters these insurance schemes as a gift.
The preliminary information that I have, notifies me that from launch till date around 11 crore families have joined this scheme. And I have been told that almost half the beneficiaries are women, the mothers and the daughters.
I offer my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on this blessed occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today when I talk to you, I want to mention that around a year back the Jan Dhan Yojana was started at a large scale.
Banks are the mainstream of the economy and to reach this facility to the homes of the poor, the programme of Bank Mitra is being strengthened.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh Bank Mitras are serving in the country.
The youth have got employment this way.
You will be pleased to know that in this one year to connect the Banking sector, Economy and the Poor People, over 1 lakh 31 thousand Financial Literacy camps have been organized.
One just does not have to open account and get stuck.
Thousands of people under the Jan Dhan Yojana are now eligible to take an overdraft and they have availed it too.
Now the poor have this faith that they too can get money from the bank.
I would again like to congratulate all the people associated with this initiative and I would like to request the poor brethren who have opened an account to never severe this relationship.
These are your banks and now you should never leave them.
I have brought them to you, now it is your job to keep them going.
In the past few days the events in Gujarat, the violence unsettled the entire country. It is natural that if something of this sort happens in the land of Mahatma and Sardar Patel, then the nation is definitely shocked and hurt.
But in a very short span of time, the intelligent brothers and sisters of mine in Gujarat brought the entire situation under control.
They played an important role in preventing the situation form worsening further and once again Gujarat started its peaceful march.
Peace, unity and brotherhood is the right way forward. We have to walk together towards the path of development.
Development is the key to our problems.
Sometime back, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I had the opportunity to hear them speak. And truly speaking of the experience and the manner in which they presented their views sounded as if some music was being played.
Their choice of words, their way of talking, the generosity of the Sufi tradition, its sublimity, its lyricism, I could experience it all.
I felt very nice.
I think it has become imperative to present Islam in its true form to the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition which is associated with love and generosity will take this message far and wide and will thus benefit not only the humanity but also benefit Islam. And I would like to tell all that whatever faith one follows, we should definitely experience Sufism once.
I am about to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider myself fortunate to receive this invitation.
Various Buddhist scholars from across the globe are coming together at Bodh Gaya and will discuss issues relating to humanity at a global level.
I have been extended an invitation to be a part of this event and I am glad to be invited at Bodh Gaya.
Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India visited Bodh Gaya.
And now, I will be going there with these scholars, this gives me immense happiness.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, today I would again like to especially share my Mann Ki Baat with you.
I have already mentioned this in the previous sessions of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me speak in the parliament, in public forums or Mann Ki Baat about it.
I have always said that the government is open to all views and suggestions on the issue of Land Acquisition Act, on which a debate is going on.
This means that now same situation exists as it was prior to the formation of my government.
I want to reassure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not merely a slogan, it is our guiding Mantra.
The guiding mantra is the welfare of the villages and the poor farmers.
That is why I declared on 15th August that it is not just an agricultural department but an agricultural and farmer welfare department will be created.
We are steadily working on it.
Two days back we completed the 50 years of the 1965 war. And whenever we talk of the 65 war it is natural that we remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 war. I pay my tribute to the brave soldiers.
May we continue to be inspired by such incidents of our history.
Like I had the chance of meeting the Sufi scholars similarly I had another great experience.
I had the opportunity to interact for hours with the distinguished scientists of the country.
I had the opportunity to hear them and I was very happy to know that India is doing commendable research in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing some excellent work.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that it was both inspiring and educative experience for me.
And I saw how the young scientists were eager to explain their work and their eyes were full of dreams.
In the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat I had expressed the view that our students should be drawn towards science.
After this meeting I felt that there are numerous options and endless possibilities.
I would like to reiterate once again that our young friends take interest in science and our educational institutions should also encourage the students for the same.
They have written about Skill Development.
Mr. Prakash Tripathi from Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu emphasizes the need for good teachers at primary level.
They have emphasized on reforms in the educational set ups.
I especially want to make a point to my young friends.
I had mentioned from the Red Fort that why should there be interviews for the lower posts.
And when they do get the interview letter - the poor, the widowed mother start thinking who to reach for recommendation, who can help get the job, whose jack could be useful to get that job.
I do not know what all kind of words are being used
Every one rushes and that seems to be one reason for corruption at the lower levels.
I had mentioned in my speech on 15th August 2015 that this tradition of interview should at least end at some level. I am happy that in such a short span of time, it has just been 15 days but the government is moving at a very fast pace.
Information is being disseminated and soon the decision will be enforced and small jobs will be made free of interviews.
And it is true that in our country about 50,000 mothers and almost 13 lakh children die during delivery or immediately after it every year.
This is a cause of worry and these figures are scary.
Although a lot of improvement has taken place.
But we still have to work to save our mothers and our children.
We watch the advertisement on TV but do not pay attention. There are advertisements in the newspapers but it escapes our attention.
There are several ways of keeping the smallest thing in the household clean by using pure water.
Life is very precious.
A little carelessness about cleanliness and accumulated water can cause death, which I believe is not right.
In the entire country about 514 centers have facilities for testing dengue cases absolutely free of cost.
From Raksha Bandhan to Diwali there will be many festivals.
Why dont we associate each festival with cleaniness You will see how a tradition becomes your habit.
Like I said we may not get a chance to die for our nation, but we can be fortunate to live for the country.
There are two young brothers and that too from Nashik in our own state of Maharashtra. Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
See everyone is doing their bit for taking the country forward. And this it, when you hear such things the heart swells with pride.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth guided by a certain perception.
My experience regarding youth is different.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth we learn so many things.
I have met so many youth who have taken the pledge Sunday on Cycle.
Some say that I keep one day a week as Cycle-Day as it is good for my health.
It is good for the environment. And I enjoy my youth too.
Nowadays many cities in our country are witnessing cycle use and there are many people promoting its use.
But this is a good initiative both for improving health and saving the environment. And today when two youths of my country made India proud in the US, I thought of it worth mentioning.
Today I especially want to congratulate the Maharashtra government.
The new government in Maharashtra completed this task and now a grand memorial will be erected which will inspire us to work for the dalits, exploited and the marginalized.
I congratulate the Maharashtra government on the accomplishment of both these tasks.
We can take the nation forward when we work together.
I send my best wishes to you. Thank You.
This will definitely prove beneficial to our farmer brothers and sisters in sowing of kharif crops.
I am very pleased to share an immensely good news with you all.
We have always faced scarcity of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
Poor people require pulses and some amount of oil to prepare vegetables for their food.
The good news for me is that there has been an increase of approximately 50 in the production of pulses and an increase of around 33 in the production of oilseeds.
I would especially like to congratulate and compliment all my farmer brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The intensity with which the farmers are connected with their land, our soldiers too are connected with the land in the same degree.
During the Kargil war, each one of our soldier proved mightier than hundreds of soldiers of our enemies.
Kargil war was not limited to just our borders, but each of our cities, villages contributed in this war.
This war was fought by those mothers and sisters whose sons and brothers were fighting against the enemies at the border.
This war was also fought by the daughters of our country, who were newly married and their henna were still fresh on their hands. Also, by the proud fathers, who saw themselves as soldiers, seeing their sons fighting for the country, and also by that infant who had not even learnt to walk catching his fathers fingers.
It is because of these unmatchable sacrifices that our country is proudly standing on its feet in front of the entire world.
There is another reason why I consider 26th July quite important because MyGov. in was launched a few months after our government was formed.
Our pledge was to promote citizen participation in democracy and connect every citizen in the development work.
And today I am pleased to share this after one year that nearly two crore people have visited MyGov website.
We have received comments from five and a half lac people and I am extremely glad to mention that more than fifty thousand people took out time from their precious schedule to apply their mind and provide their suggestions on PMO applications as they considered this work important.
It is quite unfair that the disabled citizens have to go through the same tiring procedure and buy tickets at the railway station.
Though this is a very minor issue but the government never took note of it or thought about the same previously.
But on the suggestion of our brother Akhilesh Vajpayee, our government looked into this suggestion seriously and we have implemented this facility in our system for our disabled brothers and sisters.
We are receiving quite positive suggestions on MyGov, it is helping in getting assistance in creating logos, tag-lines and formulating policies by yourselves.
We are experiencing fresh air in the administrative system.
We are experiencing a new sense of consciousness.
I am even receiving suggestion on MyGov that what should be my speech on 15th of August.
We have received quite a few suggestions from Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai in this regard.
Look, I believe that this will be a great initiative to include peoples suggestion in framing my speech for 15th August.
I believe that you will send your good suggestions.
I would like to talk about an issue which is a matter of great concern.
I neither want to sermonize nor I am trying to find an escape route towards my responsibilities pertaining to state government, central government or units of local self-government institutions.
Two days ago a visual of an accident in Delhi caught my attention, wherein the victim on scooter was fighting for his life for ten minutes post the accident.
Be it Hoshakote Akshay from Bengaluru, Ameya Joshi from Pune or Prasanna Kakunje from Mudbidri, Karnataka - all these all people have written to me...
Due to these road accidents we are witnessing one death every four minutes in our country.
The government system will continue to work towards this but I would like to request all the parents to make their children aware of all the Safety Rules pertaining to driving a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler the families should encourage discussion of road safety at home and create an atmosphere about the same to promote road safety.
And therefore I say that the government has taken a lot of new initiatives in this regard, be it the initiative of education on Road Safety, initiative related to road engineering or of enforcement of road safety laws and the discussion on Emergency Care to be provided post accidents.
We are going to implement Road Transport and Safety Bill to adopt these safety measures in our country.
In the coming days, we are also planning to take many important measures for implementing National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
We have undertaken another project called Cashless Treatment in Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mundiya national highway and it will be further extended.
The Cashless Treatment refers to the policy for the first fifty hours post-accident one need worry if one has money or not, who will pay the bills, leaving all this worry one has to give primary importance to the road accident victim who is injured so that he is treated and provided the best hospital facilities at the earliest.
We have started a toll-free number 1033 for providing information about incidents across the country and ambulance service but all these are services are for post accidents.
One must strive to avoid accidents first but it is also important for us to see from the perspective that each and every soul, each and every life is precious.
Sometimes I say that the government employees to be Karma Yogis or selfless workers.
I recalled a few incidents in the last few days which I liked and hence would like to share with you.
Using his example, we can learn how to bring more life to our own jobs.
Vijay Biswal has shown us how we can connect our jobs with our hobbies, interests or skills.
Who knows, Vijay Biswals work may get recognised by his paintings across the nation in the near future.
I have come to know about a very inspiring work started by the entire team of government officials in Harda district, Madhya Pradesh.
These bunch of officials with their entire team have started such a work which has touched me immensely and I really liked it and the work they have started is Operation Malyuddh, and upon hearing this you will feel that this subject will go in a certain direction.
But the key focus of this operation is to give a new direction to Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan.
There exists a small village called Keshla in Rajnandgaon, Chhattisgarh.
The inhabitants of this village from last few months tried and lead a campaign for building toilets in the village.
Now, nobody from this village has to go to toilet in the open. After the completion of this campaign, the entire village celebrated this accomplishment just like a mega festival.
These finest examples coming up to me show how our society is bringing change in human values and human mind and how the citizens of this country are taking the nation forward.
Bhavesh Deka from Guwahati has written to me on the North-East related issues and problems.
I must say that North-East people are quite active.
These officials would visit the districts, villages and meet the local government officials and talk to peoples representatives and the citizens of those regions.
They will listen to their problems and direct the government in taking appropriate measures in solving those problems.
This is a great initiative to go far-off from Delhi to East, and this act is called Act East Policy.
My dear countrymen, we are extremely delighted and proud of the Mars Mission success.
We often do not remember these achievements for a long time.
I always press upon the IAS officers of our government, who have reached such heights with their vast intellect and education that they should visit the nearby schools and colleges and share their knowledge for just two to four hours in a week.
This work is difficult but it must be done.
The students of the villages should not be affected with the shortage of electricity during their exams.
There should be enough electricity for starting a small industry.
Today, the villagers have to go to other villagers for charging their mobile phones.
We will certainly achieve this.
Today, through Mann ki Baat, I felt like expressing these myriad of thoughts.
My greetings to all of you for the same.
Please do send your suggestions for 15th August. Your opinions will really help me.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
For me, it was like experiencing a kind of void.
It used to be a chat in a genial atmosphere amidst the warmth of ones own family of 130 crore countrymen we would listen, we would re-iterate
at times our expressions would turn into an inspiration for someone close to us.
You can imagine how this period must have made one feel.
Sunday, the last Sunday, at 11 oclock, even I used to be uneasy, with a nagging feeling of a kind of emptiness...
I used to miss something every moment
when I express myself through Mann Ki Baat, the one speaking is me, the words are mine, the voice is mine, but the story is yours, the Purusharth pertaining to your pursuits and goals is yours, the Parakram, the achievement is yours.
I just used my words and my voice and that is why, I was not missing the programme...
I was missing you. I was undergoing a bout of emptiness.
There came a moment when I felt the need to reach out to you immediately after the Elections concluded.
Then I thought...
The established Sunday sequence should be maintained.
But this Sunday has made one wait endlessly
In a family like atmosphere, these plain, simple reflections become the reason for change in life, in society.
Begetting a new spirit, in a way fortifying the spirit of New India, let us wish this endeavour embarks upon its onward journey.
Over the last few months, many messages have poured in, with people stating that they have been missing Mann Ki Baat.
When I read them, when I hear them, it gives me joy.
my journey from I to We.
For me, this nonvocal conversation with you was a part of my feelings during my spiritual journey.
Amidst hectic Election engagements, many people asked me a flurry of questions on why I had gone up to Kedarnath.
You have every right
I can understand your curiosity... and I too feel that my sentiments reach you.
I shall not reveal other things today, but I certainly want to tell you that perhaps in that solitary cave, I got an opportunity to fill up the vacuum caused due to the long pause that Mann Ki Baat had to go through.
The way people have expressed their wish to know about Kedar, I feel a similar effort on your part to lay emphasis on positive things, which I get to know through your expressions.
The letters which steadily pour in for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are received are entirely different from routine Government matters.
One way, a letter from you can act as a source of inspiration for me
There are times when some of your words act as a catalyst in sharpening my thought process.
People bring to the fore challenges facing the country and society
they also come out with solutions for the same.
I have seen for myself that in their letters, people go to great lengths in describing their problems
it is fascinating to see that in the same breath, they express directly or indirectly, a relevant solution or two, one suggestion or the other, or even an idea
Mann Ki Baatis like a mirror to the country our society.
My heart is filled to the brim with joy today.
When it was about to end, I had stated that we would meet once again after 3 or 4 months, people assigned a political hue to it, saying Hey, Modi ji is so full of confidence, he is certain
The confidence was not Modis.
This trust was the trust of your foundation.
You were the ones who transformed yourself into a pillar of trust.
And that is why in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, then, I effortlessly said that I would be back after a few months.
you brought me back, you positioned me here and gave me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this sentiment, come, lets take Mann Ki Baat forward.
the movement was not curtailed to the confines of prison cells.
There was an outrage in the conscience of one and all.
The collective torment on the loss of democracy was evident.
Day and night, when one gets to eat food on time, one doesnt realize what hunger pangs are.
Similarly, in day to day life, it is difficult to savour the joy of democratic rights, unless they are snatched away.
During Emergency, every citizen of the country had started getting the feeling that something that belonged to him had been snatched away.
If what was snatched had never been enjoyed by that person, ever, it had to eventually precipitate into a painful inner agony.
And it was not just on account of the fact that the constitution of India has made certain provisions that enabled Democracy to blossom.
Of course, in order to ensure smooth conduct of the social order, a constitution is required...
laws rules are necessary, rights and duties should be part of due discourse.
But, India can proudly proclaim that for us, beyond laws rules, Democracy is embedded in our sanskar
Democracy is our culture.
Democracy is our heritage
we grew up, nurturing ourselves on the fruits of that very heritage.
And precisely for that, the country sacrificed one full Election, not for her own sake, but for the sake of protecting democracy.
We have been blessed with a Democracy so invaluable, yet we take it for granted so easily.
In the 2019 Loksabha Election, India saw over 61 crore voters exercising their franchise...
We can think of this figure as one ordinary but if I place it in a global perspective, if you exclude China, the number of people who voted in India exceeds the population of any other country in the world.
The number of people who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha Election is more than the entire population of America, close to double the figure.
The total number of voters in India exceeds the entire population of Europe.
You can imagine the kind of resources and manpower that was required for such a mammoth exercise.
Lakhs of teachers, officers staff strived day night to make it possible.
In order to successfully conclude this Mahayagya, on the one hand, whereas close to three lakh paramilitary personnel discharged their duty
on the other, 20 lakh Police personnel of various states too, persevered with due diligence.
you can imagine the gargantuan task
All this was done, just to ensure that no voter was deprived of his or her voting rights.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, just for a lone woman voter, a polling station was created.
You will be amazed to know that it took a journey of two days for personnel of the Election Commission, just to reach there...
Besides this, there is another fact pertaining to these Elections, that swells our hearts with pride.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person connected with the electioneering process and salute the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you may often have heard me say No bouquet, just a book
I had urged all to choose books over flowers in welcome or felicitation ceremonies.
Since then, people have been offering books at many a place.
Just recently, someone gave me a book entitled Premchand Ki Lokapriya Kahaniyan, popular short stories by Premchand.
It was a great feeling.
Of course, I couldnt get much time, but during my travelling, I got an opportunity to read some of his short stories once again.
Images of the stark social realities that Premchand has portrayed in his stories vividly start forming in ones mind when you read them.
Each every element of his writings comes alive.
His stories embody the collective psyche, the cumulative being of the country, of the land.
While reading one of his stories Nashaa, I couldnt help but notice the scourge of economic disparity plaguing society.
I was reminded of my younger days...
how debates on this subject would carry on through entire nights
the sensitivity of a young lad, his unsullied love for his grandmother, such maturity at that early age
When 4-5 years old Hamid comes back to his grandma with a pair of tongs, indeed, it stirs human emotions to their supreme pinnacle.
In this story, the living depiction of the paradoxes in a poor farmer's life is seen.
You will be surprised to learn that this library lies in a village nestling within the dense forests of Idukki.
A Primary school teacher, P.
Muralidharan and P.
V.
Chinnathampi who runs a small tea shop, have between them worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when the books were brought here stuffed in sacks and carried on the back.
Today this library is a beacon guiding tribal children on a new path.
The Vaanche Gujarat campaign carried out in Gujarat was a successful experiment.
Participants hailing from every age group in lakhs, participated in this campaign to read books.
I will still urge you in today's digital world and in the time of Google Guru, to take some time out from your daily routine and devote it to the book.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about issues, which are posing a challenge not only at the present but also the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModi App and Mygov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the prevailing water problem.
Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the challenges related with water.
Please bless us like a mother and may your blessings continue on to be showered upon us.
Water scarcity affects many parts of the country every year.
Now the time has come to find a solution to this problem.
I believe, like the other problems on hand, we can also solve this predicament by the participation of the people, Janbhagidari and their power, Janshakti we are bound to find a solution through the strength, cooperation and resolution of one hundred and thirty crore citizens.
Therefore keeping the importance of water in mind, a new Jalashakti ministry has been created in the country.
This will allow faster decision-making on all subjects related to water.
A few days ago I tried to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs and Gram Pradhans across the country.
That in order to save water, to collect water, to save the very drops of the rainwater, they should convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha and sit and discuss the resolution to this problem with the villagers.
People in village after village resolved to accumulate every single drop of rainwater.
Today, I want to narrate the story of a sarpanch in the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme.
The people here, once again, are ready to play their active role in water conservation.
For my part I wish good luck to all the village heads and all the sarpanchs for their dynamism.
There are several Sarpanchs across the country who have taken the lead in water conservation.
In a way, entire villages have grasped this opportunity as collective responsibility.
And it seems that the denizens of the villages have become involved in the competition for raising a water temple, in their respective villages.
As Ive said, a collective effort begets massive positive results.
There cannot be a single formula for dealing with water crisis across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in diverse ways.
But the goal remains the same, and that is to save water and adopt water conservation.
The drainage lines are being fixed in Punjab.
This effort would rid of the problem of water logging.
The construction of the water-tank in Telangana's Thimmaipalli is changing the lives of the people of the village.
There has been a major change through construction of small ponds in the fields at Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
I was reading about the collective endeavour in Vellore of Tamilnadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I have also read about those women of Garhwal, who are working together on the good work of implementing rainwater harvesting.
I believe that many such attempts are being made and we can turn impossible in to possible when we are together and strive with collective resolve.
When people will join hands, water will be conserved.
Today, through the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme, I am entreating 3 requests to the fellow countrymen.
My first request is that just like cleanliness drive has been given the shape of a mass movement by the countrymen, let's also start a mass movement for water conservation.
We together should all resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that water is God's prasad to us, water is like philosopher's stone
Earlier it was said that by the touch of philosopher's stone, iron could be transmuted in to gold.
I tell you, water is philosopher's stone and its mere touch creates and regenerates life
Let us start an awareness campaign to save even a single drop of water.
We must wake up the society, unite the society and join the society in this endeavour.
I urge all of you to share these traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you gets an opportunity to go to Porbandar, the place of birth of revered Bapu, then there is a house behind the house of revered Bapu, where a 200-year old water tank still exists.
As I always say that whosoever visits Kirti Mandir, should also pay a visit to that Water Tank.
Come let us join water conservation, and involve ourselves in making a list of more and more innovative methods to motivate people to conserve water.
You can all share your content using the JanShakti4JalShakti hashtag.
My dear countrymen, I must express my gratitude to you and to the people of the world for one more thing
The Presidents, Prime Ministers, celebrities and ordinary citizens of many countries of the world showed me on the Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their respective nations.
On that day, the world appeared to be like one big happy family.
Therefore promotion of Yoga is a great example of social service.
Should we not recognize such service and bestow it with honour
In the year 2019, the announcement of Prime Minister's Awards for excellence in the promotion and development of yoga was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
These are inspirational examples in themselves.
If there is a topic related to yoga, then can Indians lag behind others
The Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya in Munger dedicated to yoga from past many decades was also honoured.
My dear countrymen, were embarking on a new journey from today armed with new emotions, new realizations, new resolve and renewed vigour. But yes
Let us keep on meeting and keep on talking.
Let me keep on listening to your thoughts, let me keep on understanding and cherish them.
Let me sometimes try to live those very emotions.
May your blessings remain there for me
You are my inspiration and you are my energy
Once again next month we will meet again for another episode of Mann Ki Baat.
I Thank all of you once again.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
As a consequence of the Pulwama terror attack and the sacrifice of the brave jawans, people across the country are agonized and enraged.
All around, there is a deluge of strong feelings of sympathy for the martyrs their family members.
The outrage that singes your being and mine on account of the terrorizing violence replicates itself in the collective inner psyche of every citizen of the country it also echoes in pro-humanity communities of the world, which sincerely believe in humanity.
I respectfully bow to all the brave sons of the country, who laid down their lives, protecting the honour of their motherland, India.
Our armed forces have consistently displayed unparalleled courage and valour.
On the one hand, they have displayed exemplary capabilities in restoring peace
on the other, they have retaliated in equal measure, in a language the attackers understand.
You must have seen how within a hundred hours of the attack, retributive action was accomplished.
The fortitude displayed by Ram Niranjan ji, father of Martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, in this moment of tribulation is truly inspiring.
He has expressed the wish of sending his second son too, to take on the enemy if need be, he himself would go and fight.
The country salutes the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of Martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
She has vowed to send her only son to join the CRPF.
When the mortal remains of Martyr Vijay Soren, draped in the tricolor reached Gumla, Jharkhand, his innocent son iterated that he too would join the armed forces.
The mettle of this innocent lad is a representative sample of the feelings of each every child of the Nation today.
Similar sentiments are coming to the fore in the households of our brave heart martyrs.
No martyr, no family is an exception to that.
Whether it be the family of Martyr Vijay Maurya of Devariya, the parents of Martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six year old son of Martyr Hemraj of Kota the story of every family of martyrs is full of inspiration.
To understand the virtues of patriotism, sacrifice and perseverance, one doesnt need to revert to historical events.
These are but living examples before your eyes...
these very examples are a source of inspiration for the future of a rising glowing India.
My dear countrymen, the rather long wait after Independence for a War Memorial is about to be over.
It is natural for our countrymen to be curious about it.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Onkar Shetty ji of Udupi, Karnataka has expressed his happiness on the completion of the National War Memorial.
a Memorial that would house the valour saga series of our brave soldiers who laid down their lives, safe guarding their nations security.
And I took a resolve that the country must have such a Memorial.
We decided to erect the National War Memorial and I am contented to see it attaining completion in so little a time.
Tomorrow, that is on the 25th of February, crores of we Indians will dedicate this National Soldiers Memorial to our Armed Forces.
On part of the nation, this will be a small step towards repaying a great debt.
This new memorial has been instituted in the heart of Delhi, in close vicinity of India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I do believe that for our countrymen a visit to the National War Memorial will be akin to a pilgrimage to a holy place.
The National Soldiers Memorial is a symbol of the nations gratitude to those men who made the supreme sacrifice after we gained Independence.
The Memorials design symbolises the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The concept of the National Soldiers Memorial is based on the notion of four concentric circles, which depicts the journey of a soldier from coming into being, culminating in his martyrdom.
The flame of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier.
Following that is the Rakshak Chakra which depicts the spirit of security.
This circle houses a row of dense trees.
These trees represent soldiers and send a reassuring message to the countrys citizens that our soldiers vigilantly guard borders round the clock and that they, the citizens are safe.
This place stands testimony to a series of sacrifices of men who laid down their lives for the sake of their country, so that we could live, so that the country could be safe secure, paving the way for development.
One falls short of words in assessing the enormous contribution of our Armed Forces, Police and Para Military Forces in the strides of progress achieved by the country.
That too echoed the same sentiment, and we believe that we should be ever grateful to those policemen police women, who relentlessly ensure our safety security.
I do hope that you will pay a visit to the National Soldiers Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you are there, do capture images and share them on social media so that others get inspired to come visit this sacred site with eagerness.
Once while I was going through your comments, I came across an interesting point by Atish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He has written that on the 3rd of March, 1900, the British arrested Birsa Munda, when he was just 25 years old.
Coincidentally, the 3rd of March is also the birth anniversary of Jamsetji Tata.
He further states that despite both personalities hailing from diverse family backgrounds, they enriched the legacy and the history of Jharkhand.
Paying tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamsetji Tata is, in a way, salutation to the glorious legacy and history of Jharkhand.
These two distinguished personalities brought glory honour not just to Jharkhand, but the entire country.
The country is indeed grateful for their contribution.
Today, if an inspiring personality is required for ably guiding our youth, it certainly is that of Bhagwan Birsa Munda.
The British tree treacherously arrested him when he was asleep, in a covert manner.
Do you know why they had to resort to such a cowardly operation
Because even the British who raised a mighty empire used to be terrified of him.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda took on the might of the guns cannons of the British, using traditional bows and arrows, to shake them apart.
The fact is, when people are blessed with exemplary leadership, the might of arms pales in comparison to the collective will power of the people.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda not only waged a struggle against the British for political freedom he also actively fought for the social economic rights of the tribal folk.
And he accomplished all this in his rather short life.
He let sunshine peep into the darkened lives of the deprived and the oppressed.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the tender age of twenty five.
Illustrious sons of Mother India, such as Birsa Munda have come into being in each every part of the country.
But its a misfortune that these tales of valour and sacrifice did not reach the new generations.
If the valourous Bhagwan Birsa Munda made us aware of our existence identity, far-sighted Jamsetji Tata created great institutions for the country.
He knew very well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry was imperative for her future.
Not just that, he also established world renowned institutions and industries such as Tata Steel.
On a voyage to America, Jamsetji Tata met Swami Vivekananda on the ship, and an important topic of their discussion was the outreach spread of Science Technology in India.
this very discussion led to the founding of the Indian Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was born on the 29th of February.
All of you know that this day comes just once in four years.
A simple, peace loving personality, Morarji bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders.
In Independent India, the record of presenting the budget the maximum number of times is held by Morarji bhai Desai.
Morarji Desai steered the course of the country through some difficult times, when the very democratic fabric of the country was under a threat.
To save democracy, Morarji Desai flung himself in the movement against imposition of Emergency.
For this, he had to pay a heavy price in his old age.
The government of that time arrested and incarcerated him.
But when the Janata Party won the general elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
This amendment, restored certain powers of Supreme Court and declared that the fundamental rights granted under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution could not be abrogated during the Emergency.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the way democracy was assassinated in 1975 by imposition of emergency, could never be repeated again in the future.
Once again I pay my homage to a great leader like him.
My beloved countrymen, this year too, there was a great buzz about the Padma award.
Today as we head towards a new India, in which we want to honour those who are doing their work at the grass-root level without any care for a reward.
They, by their diligence, are powering positive changes in the lives of others in myriad ways.
In reality they are true Karmyogis, who are selflessly engaged in public service, social service and, above all, in the service to the nation.
They are far removed from the world of glitter and glare, and are people who do not care about name or fame but simply believe in toiling at the proletarian level.
They believe in living in the manner as preached by the shloka of Srimadbhagvad Gita 'Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', or excellence in action is yoga.
I would like to tell you about some of these people.
He is doing a great job of extending this rare painting art form to the present generation.
I had gifted a Rogan painting titled 'Tree of Life' done by Abdul Gafoor, to the former President of USA, Mr. Barack Obama.
Among the recipients of the Padma award, Shabbir Sayyed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau-Mata.
The manner he has spent his entire life in the service of Gau-mata, is unique in itself.
Even at the age of 100, she is training yoga to people from all over the world and till now has trained 1500 as yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, famous nicknamed 'Lady Tarzan' in Jharkhand, most valiantly took on the Timber Mafia and Naxalites, and not only saved the 50 hectares of forest but also inspired ten thousand women to unite and protect the trees and wildlife.
It is a tribute to Jamuna ji's diligence that today, on the birth of every child, villagers plant 18 trees.
She has established a precedent in the direction of women empowerment and farming.
Rajkumari Devi added 300 women of her area to a 'Self Help Group' and motivated the entire lot become financially self-reliant.
This in itself presents the live and vibrant image of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I wish to narrate a heart rending experience with you which Ive been wanting to do past few days.
At present, whenever Im touring, it is my sincere effort to meet people beneficiaries of PMJAY scheme under Ayushman Bharats umbrella.
Brothers and Sisters, about 12 lakh impoverished families have benefitted from this scheme over a period of last five months.
I have found that it brings about a transformation in the life of the have-nots.
If you know a poor person who is unable to procure treatment due to lack of money, do inform him about this scheme.
In fact this scheme is meant for the benefit of such underprivileged people.
My dear countrymen, exam time in schools throughout the nation is soon going to dawn upon us.
In the next few weeks various education boards across the country will initiate the process for the board examinations of the tenth and twelfth standards.
My best wishes to all the students whore going to appear for their examinations, their parents and all the teachers as well.
A few weeks ago, an immense event entitled 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' was organised in Delhi in the format of a Town Hall programme.
One of the focal points of 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' was that there were lively interactions on various topics related with the entire process of examinations.
There are many such aspects which emerged out of these discussions which are definitely going to be beneficial for the students.
All the students, their teachers and parents can watch the recording of this entire event on YouTube, and I take this opportunity to wish all the best to all my exam warriors, for their upcoming examinations.
My dear countrymen, no mention of India can be complete without citing its festivals.
Our culture has a continuum spread over many millennia and it is a part of our heritage.
My dear countrymen, some days ago I went to Kashi and there I got a chance to spend time with my divyang brothers and sisters.
So I requested a demonstration and a pleasant surprise was in store for me.
He mimicked the very exact way I converse with you during Mann Ki Baat.
I was very happy to hear that people not only listen to Mann KI Baat but also remember it on many occasions.
I was really impressed with the prowess of that divyang young man.
My dear countrymen, connecting with all of you, courtesy the Mann Ki Baat program has been a really wonderful experience for me.
Through radio I connect every month with millions of families.
Many times while conversing with you, reading your letters or listening to your thoughts sent on the phone, I feel that you have adopted me as part of your family.
This has been a very sublime experience for me.
Friends, elections are the biggest celebration of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy in the hurly-burly of the general elections.
I myself will also be a candidate during this election.
In maintaining respect for healthy democratic traditions, the next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be broadcast on the last Sunday of the month of May.
This means I shall take up our thoughts and ideas accumulated over the three months of March, April entire May after the Elections, with confidence anew.
With the power of your blessings, once again I shall begin this series of conversations through Mann Ki Baat... and shall keep doing Mann Ki Baat with you for years.
Once again, I thank all of you from the core of my heart.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
ShivaKumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to Social Service.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us, Kayakave Kailas meaning discahrging ones duties with due dilligence and persevereance is akin to being in the abode of Lord Shiva ie Kailasha Dham.
He was renowned to be a masterly scholar of languages such as English, Sanskrit and Kannada.
He was a social reformer.
He dedicated his life in ensuring that food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge reached out to people.
I have had the fortunate opportunity to be blessed by Swamiji, many a time.
In the year 2007 on the occasion of the Centenary celebration of Sri Sri Sri Shivakumar Swamiji our former President Dr.
On this occasion Kalam Saheb had recited a poem dedicated to revered Swamiji.
In giving, you receive happiness Almighty will bless, all your actionsDr. Kalam Sahebs poem potrays the life of Shri Shri Shri Shivakumar Swamiji and the mission of the Siddhganga Mutt beautifully.
Once again, I pay tribute to this great man.
Our Country possesses a very important institution besides being an integral part of our democracy, it is even older than our Republic I am referring to our Election Commission.
The 25th of January was the Formation Day of the Election Commission, which is celebrated now as the National Voters Day.
The scale at which elections are held in India is a matter of great awe for the World.
Our Country leaves, no stone unturned to ensure that every citizen of India who is a registered voter, rightfully avails of the opportunity to cast his vote.
Whereas we hear of a polling station at 15,000 feet above mean sea level in Himachal Pradesh we also learn about the same being organised in remote islands of the Andaman Nicobar archipelago. And you must have heard about Gujarat .
for that one and only voter
These facts are bound to instil a sense of pride, of the commitment of the Election Commission.
Caring for that lone voter, for ensuring that he or she enjoys full opportunity to exercise the right to vote, personnel of Election Commission travel to distant remote places to make necessary arrangements for the voting. This is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for relentlessly striving to ensure the strengthening of our democracy.
I urge the young generation to register themselves as voters, if they are eligible.
Simultaneously, the sentiment that voting is our sacred duty, should grow within us naturally.
We have to realise the importance of this responsibility of ours.
This must be our leaning
this should be our disposition.
I urge eminent people of the country to come forward and jointly contribute in campaigning for spreading awareness on voter registration and casting ones vote on the day of polling.
I sincerely hope that large numbers of eligible young people will get themselves registered as voters, thus forging a partnership in the quest to further strengthen our democracy.
My Dear Countrymen,This great land, India, has given birth to innumerable great men, men whose deeds for the sake for humanity have been extraordinary, truly unforgettable.
Our country is Bahuratna vasundhara .
One among them was Netaji Subash Chandra Bose.
On the 23rd of January, the country celebrated the birth anniversary of Netaji in an uncommon, special manner.
On this occasion I was fortunate to get an opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to heroes who fought in Indias freedom struggle.
You may be aware of the fact that inside Red Fort, many chambers and structures lay locked unused for several decades after Independence.
Those very chambers have now been turned into exquisite museums. A museum dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army
Yaad-e-Jalian, reminiscences of Jalianwala Bagh and 1857 Indias first war of Independence constitute the premises of Kranti Mandir, that has been dedicated to the nation.
Every inch, every brick of these museums is redolent with the fragrance of our glorious history.
Tales of valour of the heroes of our freedom struggle emanating from every nook corner of these museums inspire us to delve deeper into our history.
Prem Sehgal, Col. Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan had to face a trial under British Rule.
On my visit to Kranti Mandir, Red Fort, as I was reflecting on memories of Netaji, his family members gifted me a special cap.
There was a time when Netaji used to wear it.
I dedicated that cap to the museum itself, for visitors to see and be inspired with the spirit of patriotism.
The fact is, stories of the valour and patriotism of our heroes should be told and re-told to our newer generations in ways more than one.
Just a month ago, on the 30th of December, I had gone to Andaman Nicobar islands.
At an event, our tricolour was unfurled at the very site where Netaji Subhash Bose had unfurled it exactly 75 years ago.
In a similar manner, when the tricolour was hoisted at the Red Fort in October 2018, it surprised everyone, since conventionally, this is done on the 15th of August.
The occasion was the completion of 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and adept organiser
a valiant fighter who played a significant role in our Freedom Struggle.
Through his clarion calls Dilli Chalo, Tum mujhe Khoon do, main tumhe azadi doonga, Netaji secured a special place in every Indians heart.
That files associated with Netaji be declassified has been a long standing demand for years. And I am happy that we could manage to do the same.
I remember the day when Netajis family paid a visit to the Prime Ministers residence.
We dwelt at length on myriad facets of Netaji Subhash Bose, offering him tributes.
It gladdens me to see many places associated with illustrious sons of India being developed in Delhi.
Be it 26, Alipur Road, associated with Babasaheb Ambedkar, or the Sardar Patel museum or the Kranti Mandir
Whenever you come to Delhi, you must pay a visit to these places.
My dear countrymen, today as we refer to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, that too in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with you an incident from Netajis life.
I have always considered Radio as an effective means of connecting with people. Similarly, Netaji shared a deep bond with the medium of Radio and he chose this very medium to converse with countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu established Azad Hind Radio and through it he used to communicate with soldiers of the Indian National Army and other countrymen.
Subhash Babu had a distinct style of opening a broadcast.
. These words instantly stirred up listeners with a rush of a new energy, a new fervour.
I am told this radio station also used to broadcast weekly news bulletins in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto Urdu languages.
In managing the affairs of this radio station, a resident of Gujarat M.
Vyas ji played a vital role.
Programmes broadcast over Azad Hind Radio were very popular amongst the populace. Their programmes were a major source of inspiration strength to our freedom fighters.
In this very Kranti Mandir, a visual arts museum has been established.
Indias art culture has been portrayed here in a very attractive way.
The museum has 4 historical exhibitions which display more than 450 paintings and artworks which are of three centuries vintage.
Exquisite works of great artists such as Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy, Sailoz Mukherjee have been exhibited.
And I also specially request you to visit the place and see for yourself the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji.
Now you must be thinking that we are discussing art and here Im talking about seeing Gurudev Tagore's excellent works of art.
You have probably known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore till date as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He had painted upon many themes.
He did paintings of many animals and birds, he also painted many landscapes, and not only that he also tried to depict many human characters by etching them on canvas.
And the most unique aspect was that Gurudev Tagore did not ascribe any name to most of his works.
He believed that the person seeing his painting should comprehend the painting in totality, from his own perspective, understand the message imparted by him in the particularpainting.
His paintings have been on display in European countries, in Russia and in America.
I hope you will go and see his paintings in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is a land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and deeds.
Sant Ravidas used to convey a profound message through the few lines of his couplet or doha.
He had said- , , Which would translate something like this that if you were to peel the stem of the banana tree, there appear leaves underneath which form the psuedostem, one can go peeling the leaves forming the stem till there isnt any tree left at all Similarly man has been divided into castes and the human in him has disappeared.
Sant Ravidas proposed that if God was present in every human being, then it was not fair to categorize him on the basis of caste, creed and other sociological demarcations.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy city of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and the worker throughout his life via his messages.
It would not be wrong to say that he has illustrated to the entire world the real meaning of dignity of labour.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov that I should highlight the aspects of India's space program and its future.
He also wants me to request the students to take interest in the space programs and to think out of the box and inspire them to go beyond the frontiers of the sky- Kiran ji, I appreciate your thoughts and especially the message being imparted to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, where I got the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai has had an important role in India's space program.
Our space program has been possible due to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We take pride in the fact that the satellites developed by our students and Sounding Rockets have reached space.
On 24th January 'KALAM SAT' fashioned by our students had been launched.
The Sounding Rockets made by Odisha university students have also created many records.
The number of successful space missions attempted since the country's independence till 2014 have been equal to those successfully completed in the past four years.
We have also created a world record for launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft.
We will soon register Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign.
Our country is also using Space Technology in devices employed in saving assets and life.
Whether it is cyclone, or rail and road safety, all of these safety measures are being augmented by Space Technology.
Among our fishermen, NAVIC devices are being distributed, which contribute in their economic development as well as ensure their safety.
We are using Space Technology to improve delivery and accountability of government services.
"Housing for all" or the "House for everyone" scheme involves geo-tagging of about 40 lakh homes spread over 23 states.
Along with this scheme, about thirty and a half million properties under MNREGA have also been tagged.
Today our satellites are a symbol of the country's growing might.
It has contributed a great deal in fostering better relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has also gifted hues of development to our neighbouring Allies.
Through its highly competitive launch services, India today not only propels satellites of developing countries but also those of developed nations.
The sky and stars have always enthralled children.
Our Space Program provides an impetus to the children to think big and reach across those boundaries, which were considered impossible till today.
It is a vision to inspire the children to discover new stars, while gazing at them
My dear countrymen, I always say, those who play, also bloom and this time, many young players making their debut have bloomed in Khelo-India.
In January about 6,000 players participated in 18 disciplines in the Khelo India Youth Games held in Pune.
When the player performs his best at the local level,only then, he also shines globally.
This time in 'Khelo India', participants from every state have performed well at their individual level.
The life of many a medal winner is also immensely inspiring.
They live in a parking shed with their family.
The captain of Maharashtra Under-21 Women's Kabaddi team, Sonali Helvi is from Satara. She lost her father at a very young age, and her brother and mother encouraged the talent and skills of Sonali.
It is often seen that girls are not encouraged much to participate in sports such as Kabaddi.
In spite of the hurdles, Sonali not only chose Kabaddi but excelled in this discipline.
10-year-old Abhinav Shaw hailing from Asansol is the youngest gold medallist in the Khelo India Games.
A farmer's daughter, Akshaya Basavani Kamat, from Karnataka won a gold medal in weightlifting.
She credited her victory to her father, a farmer in Belgaum.
When we talk about the creation of a New India, then determination exhibited by our youth is the veritable example of what is New India
These inspiring stories from the annals of Khelo India, are ample proof , that the building of New India does not only involve contribution from the denizens of big cities but also from the youth, children, young sports talents, hailing from small cities, towns and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many a prestigious beauty contest.
The name of this unique contest is "Clean beautiful Toilet".
People are making their toilets clean and colourful, by having them painted and other rennovations, you will find lots of photos of such toilets participating in the "Clean beautiful Toilet" contest spread from Kanya Kumari to Kutchh till Kamrup on social media.
I appeal to all the Sarpanchs and village heads to take a lead in this campaign in their respective Panchayats.
And do share your "clean beautiful toilet" photos with me on MylzzatGhar on social media.
Friends together, on October 2, 2014, we had embarked on a memorable journey together to clean our country and to get rid of open defecation.
Due to the unequivocal support from the people of India, today India is moving towards liberation from defecation in the open much prior to October 2, 2019, so that we may pay our homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
Anshul Sharma, resident of Himachal Pradesh has written on MyGov that I should talk about examinations and Exam Warriors.
Anshul ji, I thank you for raising this issue.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is Exam Season.
Students, their parents and teachers, all are engaged in tasks related to examinations.
I wish all the students, their parents and teachers all the best.
I would have liked to discuss this topic at length in Mann Ki Baat of today, but you will be happy to know that just after a gap of two days ,on January 29, at 11 am, in the 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' program, I am going to interact with students from all over the country, and this time, along with the students, their parents and teachers are also going to be part of this program.
And this time, students from other countries will also participate.
Some of these ideas and suggestions I will definitely put in front of you during the Town Hall program.
and through social media and Namo App, you can also see its live telecast.
My dear countrymen 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11am the whole country pays homage to the martyrs.
Wherever we are, we must pay two minutes tribute to our martyrs.
Many many felicitations and thanks to all of you.
The year 2018 is about to conclude.
Only then can the gains of experience be availed of, only then can ones self-confidence renew further.
What exactly should we do in order to ensure a change in our lives, simultaneously contributing our bit in taking our country society forward
Many good wishes to all of you for the year 2019.
You must have wondered how to keep 2018 etched in your memory
It is important to bear in mind HOW India as a country, as a collective entity powered by the might of a hundred thirty crore people remembers the year 2018
something that swells our hearts with pride.
The year 2018 saw the launching of the worlds biggest health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat.
Electricity reached each every village of the country this year.
Noted world institutions have accepted that the country has taken strides in the area of poverty alleviation at a record pace.
On account of the unwavering resolve of our countrymen, swachchata, sanitation coverage is rapidly advancing towards crossing the 95 mark.
After Independence, for the first time ever, the tricolor was hoisted at Red Fort on the 75th anniversary of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
In honour of SardarVallabhbhai Patel who bonded the entire country around a common thread of unity, India witnessed the coming up of the tallest statue in the world, Statue of Unity.
The country secured a place of pride glory in the entire world.
The highest United Nations Environment Award Champions of the Earth was conferred upon India.
The world duly took notice of Indias efforts in the areas of Solar Energy Climate Change.
The first General Assembly of the International Solar Alliance was held in India.
It is due to our collective efforts that our country has seen unprecedented improvement in the Ease of doing business rankings.
The countrys self defence mechanism got further reinforced.
It was during this very year that our country has successfully accomplished the Nuclear Triad, which means we are now armed with nuclear capabilities-in water, on land and in the sky as well.
Daughters of the country have done her proud by circumnavigating the globe through the NavikaSagarParikrama.
Indias first inland waterway was launched in Varanasi.
This has laid the foundation of a new revolution in the waterways sector.
The longest rail-road bridge, Bogibeel Bridge was dedicated to the Nation- Sikkims first Indias hundredth airport, Pakyong commenced operations.
India scripted a thumping win in the under- 19 Cricket World Cup and the Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India clinched a large number of medals in the Asian Games.
India also performed very well in the Para Asian Games too.
By the way, if I continue enumerating examples of the Purusharth, the character the mettle of Indians, or those of our collective endeavour, this episode of Mann Ki Baat will go on and on, perhaps to the point when 2019 makes an entry
And all this has been possible due to the relentless efforts of a 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, this December we had to bear the loss of some extraordinary, exemplary countrymen.
On the 19th of December, Dr. Jayachandran passed away in Chennai.
Jayachandran was known for his efforts of making the most economical treatment possible available to the poor.
People tell us that he would be ever ready eager, when it came to treatment of patients.
com website, I have read about many of his endeavours that serve as an inspiration to society.
On similar lines, on the 25th of December, I learnt of the loss of SulagittiNarsamma in Karnataka.
In the beginning of this year, she was honoured with a Padma Shri.
Jaya Chandran and SulagittiNarsamma, who dedicated their lives to the welfare of all in society.
Since we are referring to healthcare, I would like to mention the social endeavour of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, I was told by some of our party workers that a few young doctors in the town set up camps offering free treatment for the underprivileged.
Every month, the Heart Lungs Critical Centre there organizes such camps, where free diagnosis and treatment for a host of ailments is done.
Every month, hundreds of poor patients are benefitting from these camps.
The dedication of these doctor friends engaged in selfless service is truly worthy of praise.
Today, Im saying it with pride that it was collective efforts that made the Swachch Bharat Mission a successful campaign.
I was told that a few days ago, in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, over three lakh people came together to work for the sanitation campaign.
I just referred to the betterindia.
I do believe that by doing so more and more people will get to know about our heroes who brought a change in society.
Spreading negativity is fairly easy.
But some really good work is being done around us, in our society.
And all this has been possible through the collective efforts of a 130 crore countrymen.
Sports has its own significance in every society.
When a game is being played, the spectators too experience a rush of energy in their beings.
We observe name, fame and laurels when it comes to sportspersons.
But, at times, in the background, there exist many things that are much higher, much greater than the world of sports.
Let me tell you about one of our daughters from Kashmir who won a gold medal in a Karate Championship in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag, Kashmir.
Hanaya trained hard in Karate with perseverance fervor, studied its nuances and proved herself.
On behalf of all countrymen, I wish her a bright future.
Best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, the media discussed extensively about the 16 year old Rajani.
According to Rajani, her father has sacrificed a lot, undergone hardships to help her reach where she is.
Early every morning, Jasmer Singh used to leave for work before Rajani and her siblings woke up.
When Rajani approached her father, expressing her wish to learn boxing, he encouraged her, arranging for whatever possible resources that he could.
Rajani had to start her training in boxing with old gloves, since those days, the family was not too well, financially.
Despite so many hurdles, Rajani did not lose heart went ahead with her training in boxing.
She has won a medal in Serbia too.
My best wishes and blessings to Rajani. I also congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha Rani Ji for supporting encouraging Rajani.
This very month, 20 year old Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune became the fastest Asian to traverse the globe riding a bicycle.
She rode for 159 days, covering around 300 kilometres every day.
Just imagine... 300 kms of cycling every day
Her passion for cycling is indeed commendable.
Dont news of such achievements, such accomplishments inspire us
Especially my young friends, when we hear about such feats, we derive inspiration to touch heights despite obstacles.
If your resolve is strong, if your fervor, your enthusiasm is without bounds, all your hurdles halt in their tracks.
Hardships can never turn into obstacles.
When we come to know of such examples, we too feel inspired every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, the month of January ushers in many festivals filled with hope joy- such as Lohri, Pongal, MakrSankranti, Uttarayan, MaghBihu, Maaghi
with the verve of traditional dances at places, the embers of Lohri symbolizing the joy of a bountiful harvest at others.
It is during this period that days begin to lengthen and the winter harvesting of our crops begins.
Best wishes to our food providers, the farming brothers and sisters.
Our festivals are replete with fragrance of the essence of Unity in Diversity and the spirit of One India Great India.
We can witness how closely our festivals are interlinked with nature.
In Indian culture society and nature are indistinguishable, in our culture the person and his environment are considered in totality.
A great example of the interconnection between us and Nature is the calendar based on our festivals.
It comprises festivals all around the year as well as the movements of the celestial bodies.
This traditional calendar depicts our bonding with natural and astronomical events.
The lunar and solar Calendars based on the movement of earth with respect to moon and sun decide the occurrence and dates of our festivals.
It is also dependant on the fact which calendar you follow.
In many regions the position of the planetary constellations determines the occurrence and celebration of festivals.
GudiPadva, Chettichand, Ugadi and others are all celebrated according to the lunar Calendar, whereas Tamil PutanduVishnu, Baisakh, Baisakhi, PoilaBoisakh, Bihu are all celebrated in accordance with solar calendar.
The sagacity of conserving rivers and water is inherently reflected in many of our festivals.
Chhath festival is associated with the worship of the sun, rivers and ponds.
Millions of people take a dip in the holy rivers on theoccasion of MakarSankranti.
Our festivals, impart to us many social values.
On the one hand, where they have mythological significance, on the other, every festival quite easily in itself teaches the important lesson of life - the value of staying together, imbued with a feeling of brotherhood.
I wish all of you a great year 2019 and do hope that you all to enjoy the oncoming festive season.
My dear countrymen, there is an abundance of events in our culture, of which we can be proud and display them in the entire world with pride - and one of them is the Kumbh Mela.
People from all over the country and around the world come and participate in the Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, there is a tidal upsurge of faith and reverence.
Millions and millions of people from India and around the world congregate at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has bloomed and flourished as part of our great cultural heritage.
This time the world famous Kumbh Mela is going to be held in Prayagraj from January 15, and many of you might be waiting eagerly for it to take place.
The process of Sant- Mahatmas converging at the Kumbh Mela has already started.
It is a measure of its global importance that last year UNESCO has marked Kumbh Mela in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago the Ambassadors of many countries witnessed for themselves the preparations for Kumbh.
The national flags of many countries were together hoisted at the Kumbh.
The festival of Kumbh, to be organized in Prayagraj, is expected to have footfalls from more than 150 countries
the divinity emanating from Kumbhwill spread the colours of India's splendour throughout the world.
Kumbh Mela is also a huge medium of self discovery, where every visitor experiences a unique feeling and learns to look at the worldly things from a spiritual perspective.
This can be a huge learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago and saw that the preparations for the Kumbh were progressing on a war footing.
People of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about the Kumbh.
This time much emphasis is being laid on cleanliness during Kumbh.
If during the course of this event sanitation prevails along with reverence, then it will lead to a positive message reaching far and wide.
This time every devotee will be able to have a darshan of the pious Akshayavat after the holy dip in the confluence.
This great symbol of peoples faith was locked up in the fort for hundreds of years, due to which the devotees despite a deep seated desire could not get a glimpse of.
Now the entrance gate of Akshayavat have been opened for everyone.
I urge all of you to share different aspects of Kumbh and photos on social media when you go to Kumbh so that more and more people feel inspired to go to Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of Spirituality become Mahakumbh of Indian Philosophy.
May this Kumbh of aesthetics also become the Mahakumbh of creativity.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of curiosity regardingthe celebration of RepublicDay on 26th January, when we remember those great men who gave us our Constitution.
Our revered Bapu and South Africa shared an unbreakable bond.
It was South Africa, where Mohan transformed into the 'Mahatma'.
It was in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi had started his first Satyagraha and stood rock steady in protest of apartheid.
He also founded the Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, from where the demand for peace and justice echoed to the whole world.
The year2018 is also being celebrated as Birth centenary of Nelson Mandela,also known as 'Madiba'.
We all know that Nelson Mandela was the role model of struggle against racism all over the world and who was the inspiration for Mandela
He derivedinspiration and endurancefor spending many years in jail from Bapu himself.
"Mandela used to consider Bapu as his role model.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only sources of inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals have always encouraged us to create a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP conference was held at Kevdia on the banks of Narbada in Gujarat, where the world's highest statue 'Statue of Unity' is situated, there I had a meaningful discussion with the top policemen of the country.
What kind of steps should be taken to strengthen the security of the country and that of the countrymen, was discussed in detail.
At the same conference, I also announced the awarding of 'Sardar Patel Award' for National Integration to be given to those who have contributed for national unity in any form.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life for the unity of the country.
He always remained engaged in keeping India's integrity intact.
SardarSaheb believed that the power of India lay in the diversity of the land.
It is our way of paying homage to Sardar Patel's aspirations through this award for National Integration.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the date ofthe sacred festival observed in honour of Guru Gobind Singh jis birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna. For most of his life, his work was centred in North India and he sacrificed his life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
His birthplace was Patna, Karmabhoomi was north India and the last moments were spent in Nanded.
In a way, entire India received his blessings.
A glimpse of his life span reflects a glimpse of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of his father Shri Guru TeghBahadurji, Guru Gobind Singh Ji attained the hallowed position of the Guru at a tender ageof nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had inherited courage to fight for justice from the legacy of Sikh Gurus.
He was bestowed with a quiet and simple personality, but whenever, an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, or injustice was done to them, then Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice firmly for the poor and the weak and therefore it is said -"I can make one fight against one hundred and fifteen thousands,I can make the sparrow fight against the hawkThat be the reason that Gobindsingh be my name.
He used to preach that strength cannot be demonstrated by fighting against the weaker sections.
Shri Gobind Singh Ji believed that the biggest service is to alleviate human suffering.
He was an archer, and a pundit of Gurmukhi, BrajBhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu and many other languages.
I once again bow paying my obeisance to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are many good events happening in the country, which are not widely discussed.
I viz Food Safety and Standard Authority of India.
is engaged in promoting good eating or Safe and Healthy Diet habits.
A clean and healthy India will spell a prosperous India also.
Nutritious food is most essential for good health.
In this context, I extend hearty greetings to F.
I for this initiative.
I urge you to the utmost, let's join this initiative.
You should participate in this initiative and especially I urge you to make you children witness these campaigns.
The education regarding importance of food is essential right from childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the last episode of the year 2018, we will meet again in 2019, and will engage in another episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Whether it is the life of a person, life of a nation, or the lifespan of a society, inspiration, is the basis of progress.
Come, imbued with renewed inspiration, renewed zeal, renewed resolution, new accomplishments, loftier goals lets move on, keep moving, change oneself and change the country too.
On the 3rd of October, 2014, the pious occasion of Vijayadashmi, we embarked upon a journey together through the medium of Mann Ki Baat.
there was only one person who would make serve tea.
He was not even adequately clad
it was a standalone kiosk on the edge of the road.
Indeed, that exactly was the topic of discussion on the radio.
From remote villages to Metro cities, from farmers to young professionals ...
Recently, All India Radio got a survey done on Mann Ki Baat.
I came across some feedback that is very interesting.
Out of the designated sample in the survey, 70 of respondents on an average happen to be listeners who regularly tune in to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people believe that the greatest contribution of Mann Ki Baat has been the enhancement of a feeling of positivity in our society.
This is an exemplary glimpse of the feeling of positivity, innate to our countrymen.
People have shared their experiences, conveying the rise of selfless volunteerism as a consequence of Mann Ki Baat.
It is a change where people are increasingly willing to contribute for the sake of service to society.
I am overjoyed on account of the fact that through Mann Ki Baat, radio is rising as a popular medium, more than ever before.
But its not about just radio...
Thank you very much for your phone call.
Your apprehension is not misplaced.
The fact is, if a leader gets hold of a microphone with assured listeners to the tune of millions, what else does he need
whether there were some words that were oft-repeated
One of their findings was that, this programme has remained apolitical. When Mann Ki Baat commenced, I had firmly decided that it would carry nothing political, or any praise for the Government, nor Modi for that matter anywhere.
The greatest bulwark in ensuring adherence to my resolve in fact my highest inspiration, have been YOU.
As a run up to each episode of Mann Ki Baat, the expectations aspirations of listeners through their letters, online comments phone calls are crystal clear.
Modi may come and go, but this country will never let go of its UNITY permanence, our culture will always be immortal.
These minute stories encompassing a 130 crore countrymen will always stay alive.
Sometimes people who write in from different corners of the country say, We should not haggle beyond limits with marginal shopkeepers, auto drivers, vegetable sellers et al.
Who would have imagined that a small campaign selfie with daughter starting from a small village in Haryana would spread not only throughout the country but also across other countries as well.
Mann Ki Baat is not about the Government it is about the society.
Mann Ki Baat addresses an aspirational India, an ambitious India.
If I reply to the question asked by you straightaway then I will say that I do not make any preparation.
Actually, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple task for me.
Every time before Mann Ki Baat, letters are received from people
and by calling on this number, people record messages in their own voice.
My effort is that I read the maximum number of these letters and comments myself before Mann Ki Baat.
My countrymen stay in my heart every moment and that is how the writers situation and ideas expressed in the letter become part of my thought process.
That letter does not remain a mere a piece of paper for me.
Honestly speaking, Mann Ki Baat carries my voice but the examples, emotions and spirit represent my countrymen, I thank every person contributing to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of persons whose names I have not been able to include in Mann Ki Baat but without any disappointment, they continue to send in their letters and comments.
An effort is also made that the concerned department should pay attention to such letters and comments which, somehow, could not be included in Mann Ki Baat.
It is due to their hard work that Mann Ki Baat reaches maximum number of people.
The team from All India Radio prepares each episode for broadcast in a number of regional languages.
Some of them very aptly narrate in a voice and style resembling that of Modis.
In this way for those 30 minutes they become Narendra Modi.
I congratulate and thank those persons for their talent and skills.
I would request all of you also to kindly listen to this programme in your regional language as well.
But many issues raised in Mann Ki Baat have been adopted by the media.
Issues such as cleanliness, Road safety, drugs free India, selfie with daughter have been taken up by the media and turn into campaigns. TV channels made it the most watched radio programme I sincerely thank and congratulate the media.
Without your contribution and cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Sometimes our inhibitions or prejudices become a big hurdle in communication.
I prefer to understand the other mans point of view rather than going through the process of acceptance, rejection and reaction.
People generally talk of a communication gap between the elders and teenagers in the family.
In fact, the scope of discussion with teenagers is quite limited in most of the families.
Most of the time these talks remain limited to studies, habits or life style and the dos and donts.
I try to learn from whatever they are doing or whatever they are thinking. They are storehouse of ideas.
after all, this is the New India.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to accomplish a many things at a time.
I say what is wrong in it.
Those youth who have dared to ask questions and have had the courage to dream big.
My dear countrymen, Vineeta ji from Gurugram- has posted on MyGov that in Mann Ki Baat I should talk about the Constitution Day which falls on the 26th November.
She says that this day is special because we are going to enter into the 70th year of our Constitution adoption.
Just imagine, these luminaries gave us such a comprehensive and detailed Constitution within a period of just less than 3 years.
The extraordinary pace at which they drafted the Constitution is an example of Time Management and productivity to emulate even today.
The unique point in our Constitution is that the rights and duties have been very comprehensively detailed.
A balance between these two in the lives of our citizens will take our nation forward.
If we respect the rights of others, our rights will automatically get protected and similarly if we fulfill our duties, then also our rights will get automatically protected.
I still remember that in 2010 when 60 years of the adoption of the Constitution were being celebrated, we had taken out a procession by placing our Constitution atop an elephant.
This has been a memorable incident to increase awareness about our Constitution among the youth and to connect them to the various aspects of the Constitution.
Let us all take forward the values enshrined in our Constitution and ensure Peace, Progress and Prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, the contribution of that great man cannot be forgotten who played a pivotal role in the Constituent Assembly.
This great man was none other than our revered Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His death anniversary or mahaparirvan divas falls on 6th December.
What is a republic and what is a parliamentary system- are nothing new to India.
He had made a very moving appeal in the Constituent Assembly that we have to safeguard our hard fought democracy till the last drop of our blood.
India First was the basic doctrine of Dr.
My dear countrymen, two days back on 23rd November, we all celebrated Shri Guru Nanak Dev Jayanti and next year in 2019 we shall be celebrating his 550th Prakash Parv.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji always envisaged the welfare of entire humanity.
He always showed the path of truth, work, service, kindness and amity to the society.
All states and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate the occasion in a grand manner.
Guru Nanak Dev Jis 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated in a similar manner in all the countries of the world as well.
Recently, while holding a meeting in this regard I remembered about of Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
This Gurudwara suffered severe damage due to the devastating earth quake of 2001 in Gujarat.
But, the manner in which the local people joined hands with the state Government in renovating it, is an example even today.
The Government of India has taken a significant decision of building Kartarpur corridor so that our countrymen could easily visit Kartarpur in Pakistan to pay homage to Guru Nanak Dev Ji at that holy sight.
But our journey shall continue.
The more you connect with us, our journey will gain greater depth, providing, satisfaction to one and all.
At times a question arises in the minds of peoples as to what I achieved through Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
The 31st of October is the birth anniversary of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. This year too, the youth of the country is all set, to take part in the Run for Unity.
I urge you to participate in the largest possible numbers in this run for unity.
Six months or so before Independence, on the 27th of January, 1947, the world famous international Magazine Time had a photograph of Sardar Patel on the cover page of that edition.
It was the map of an India that was divided into myriad fragments.
There existed over 550 princely states.
The English had lost interest in India they wanted to leave India fragmented into pieces.
Time Magazine had opined that hovering over India then were the dangers of problems like partition, violence, food scarcity, price rise and power-politics.
The magazine further observed that amidst that plethora of problems, if there was anyone who possessed the capability to unite the country and heal wounds, it was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
The story also brings to the fore other aspects of the life of the Iron Man of India...
the manner in which he had managed relief operations during the Ahmedabad floods in the 1920s the way he steered the Bardoli Satyagrah.
He ensured the merger of all princely states with the Dominion of India.
Whether Junagadh, Hyderabad, Travancore, or for that matter the princely states of Rajasthan, if we are able to see a United India now, it was entirely on account of the sagacity strategic wisdom of Sardar Patel.
It is but natural for us to solemnly remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as we exalt the spirit of unity that binds our Nation, our Mother India.
The 31st of October this year will be special on one more account- on this day, we shall dedicate the statue of unity of the nation as a true tribute to Sardar Patel.
Erected on the banks of river Narmada in Gujarat, the structure is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty.
This is the worlds tallest scyscraping statue.
Every Indian will now be proud to see the worlds tallest statue here on Indian soil.
Sardar Patel, a true son of the soil will adorn our skies too.
My dear brothers sisters, we celebrated Infantry Day yesterday.
This is the very day when Indian Forces landed in Kashmir and saved the valley from the clutches of aggression.
This incident too is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview with the celebrated Army officer sam Manekshaw.
In that interview, field Marshal Sam Manekshaw was reminiscing on times when he was a Colonel.
The 31st of October also is the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
Our respectful tributes to Indira ji too.
My dear countrymen, who doesnt love sports
Elements like spirit, strength, skill, stamina are extremely important in the world of sports.
If the youth of a country possess these qualities, that country will progress not only in areas such as Economy and Science Technology but also bring laurels home in the field of sports.
First, I got an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held at Jakarta.
These athletes bagged a tally of 72 medals, creating a new, unprecedented record, bringing glory to the nation.
I was fortunate to get an opportunity to meet all these talented athletes personally. I congratulated them.
Similarly, I was blessed with a chance to meet our winners of the Summer youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
You will be pleased to know that in the Summer Youth Olympics 2018, the performance of our youth was the best ever.
At this event we won 13 medals besides 3 in mixed events.
You may recall that even, in the recent Asian Games, Indias performance was par excellence.
Have you observed the way I have frequently used terms such as the best ever or new, unprecedented record
This is the real story of Indian Sports which are witnessing an upswing with each passing day.
India is setting new records not just in the field of sports but also in hitherto uncharted areas.
To give you an example, I would like to mention about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur, who won a gold medal for the country in the 2018 Para Asian Games.
He is a Divyang by birth.
When he turned eight he lost his father.
Then he spent another eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he eked out a living cleaning DTC buses and working as waiter at roadside eateries.
The same Narayan is winning medals for India at International events.
Not just that, just observe the rapidly enhancing levels of excellence in Indian sports Hitherto, India had never won a medal in a Judo event, at the junior or senior level.
But Tabaabi Devi created history by bagging the silver medal at the youth Olympics.
16 year old player Tabaabi Devi hails from a village in Manipur.
Her father is a labourer and mother a fish-seller.
There were times when the family had no money to buy food.
Even such hardships were not able to cow down her zest devotion.
And she has created history by winning a medal for the country.
Stories like these are innumerable.
Every life, every being is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportspersons passion dedication is the hallmark of New India.
My dear countrymen, you may recall that we had successfully organized FIFA Under- 17 World Cup in the year 2017.
The whole world acclaimed this as a very successful tournament.
FIFA Under -17 World Cup had created a record in terms of the number of viewers on the ground.
More than 12 lakh enthusiasts enjoyed the romance of Football matches in various stadia across the country and boosted the morale of the young players.
This year also, we have been fortunate to be the hosts of the Mens Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneshwar.
The Hockey World Cup will commence on the 28th November to be concluded on the 16th December.
Each Indian who plays any game or has interest in any game has a definite interest in Hockey.
India has a golden history in Hockey.
India has won gold medals in various tournaments and has been the World Champion once.
India has produced many great hockey players.
Whenever there will be reference to Hockey,the story will remain incomplete without a mention of these legends.
Hockey maestro Major Dhyan Chand is a renowned name all over the world.
Then, from Balbeer Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhan Raj Pillai, Indian Hockey has had a very long journey.
Even today, players of Team India are encouraging the younger generation through their hard work and focused attention.
It is a good chance for the sport lovers to witness closely contested matches.
Go to Bhubaneshwar and cheer up the Indian team and also encourage each team there.
They can visit the world famous holy places like the Sun Temple of Konark, Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri and Chilka Lake along with enjoying the games there.
I convey my best wishes to our Mens Hockey Team for this tournament and assure them that 125 crore Indians are supporting them.
I also convey my wishes to all the teams from around the world coming to participate in the tournament.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward and volunteering for social works is really inspirational and encouraging for all our countrymen.
But, in this new era, the new generation is coming forward in a new way with a fresh vigour and spirit to fulfill their new dream.
Recently, I attended a programme where a portal was launched, its name is Self 4 Society, MyGov and the IT and Electronics industry of the country have launched this portal with a view to motivating their employees for social activities and providing them with opportunities to perform in this field.
Their dedication and vigour can make each Indian feel proud.
A fresh and pleasant air of IT to society, We-not I, a transformation from the individual to the community is imbibed in this.
someone is involved in the campaign of cleanliness whereas someone is helping out the farmers. And there is no vested interest behind all these activities but a pure feeling of dedication and resolve is the driving force.
One young person learned to play wheelchair basket ball in order to be able to help the wheelchair basket ball team of differently abled, divyang players.
This spirit, this dedication is a mission mode activity.
Will this not make every Indian feel proud.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I was going through your suggestion for Mann Ki Baat this time, I found a very interesting comment from Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pudducherry.
He wrote on Mygov- Please take up the topic in Mann Ki Baat as to how the tribes and their traditions and rituals are the best examples of coexistence with the nature.
How do we need to adopt their traditions in our lives for achieving sustainable development and learn from those traditions
Manishji, I appreciate you for bringing this subject among the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is one subject that inspires us to look into our dignified past and our ancient traditions, Today, the whole world and specially the western countries are discussing about environment protection and are trying to find new ways to adopt a balanced life style.
Our country is also facing this problem. But, for its solution we only have to look inwards, to look into our glorious past and our rich traditions and have especially to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
To live in consonance and closed coordination with the nature has been an integral part of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brethren worship trees and plants and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The Bhil tribes of Central India and specially those in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship Peepal and Arjun trees religiously.
The Bishnoi community in the desert land of Rajasthan has shown us a way of environment protection.
Specially, in the context of serving trees, they prefer laying down their lives but cannot tolerate any harm to a single tree.
Mishmi tribes of Arunachal Pradesh claim their relationship with tigers.
They even treat them like their brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland as well, tigers are seen as the forest guardians.
People of Warli Community in Maharashtra consider tigers as their guests and for them the presence of tigers is a good omen indicating prosperity.
There is a belief among the Kol community in Central India that their fortune is directly connected with the tigers and they firmly believe that if the tigers do not get food, the villagers will have to face hunger .
The Gond tribes in Central Indai stop fishing in some parts of Kaithan river during the breeding season.
In the isolated regions of the Nilgiri plateau in South India, a small wanderer community Toda make their settlements using locally available material only.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a fact that the tribal community believes in very peaceful and harmonious co-existence but, if somebody tries to harm and cause damage to their natural resources, they do not shy away from fighting for their rights.
There is no wonder that our foremost freedom fighters were the brave people from our tribal communities.
Who can forget Bhagwan Birsa Munda who struggled hard against the British Empire to save their own forest land.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those persons and institutions who make extra-ordinary contribution for the society.
These works may seem small but have a very deep impact in changing our thinking and in giving a new direction to the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about a farmer brother Gurbachan Singh from Punjab.
The son of this hard working farmer Gurbachan Singh ji was to be married.
Gurbachan Singh ji had told the brides parents that the marriage would be performed in a solemn manner.
There is absolutely no need to spend much on wedding reception or any other item.
We have to keep it a very very simple event.
But then he suddenly said that he had one condition.
And, when a condition is put these days, generally it is thought that the other side is going to make a big demand which will be really difficult for the brides family to fulfill.
But, you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurbachan Singh was a simple farmer and what he told the brides father and the condition he placed reflects the true strength of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji asked him to promise that they will not burn parali or stubble in their fields.
You can well imagine the social strength this statement had.
This point made by Gurbachan Singh ji appears quite ordinary but this reveals how tall and strong his personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society who connect their individual matters with the benefit of the society as a whole.
Shriman Gurbachan Singh jis family has presented one such example before us.
I have also read about a village Kallar Majra which is near Nabha in Punjab.
Kallar Majra came into lime light as the farmers there mix the stubble with the sand by ploughing their fields rather than burning the stubble and adopt the necessary technology for the process.
Congratulations to bhai Gurbachan Singh ji
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and of all those places who are making their best efforts to keep the environment clean and pollution free.
All of you are carrying forward the Indian tradition of a healthy life style as a true successor.
Just as a sea is formed by collection of tiny drops, similarly,a small constructive step, plays a vital role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it has been told in our epics:- : , , : : : It means- O, Lord, peace should prevail all around in all three Lokas,in water, in air, in space, in fire, in wind, in medicines, in vegetation, in gardens, in sub conscious, in the whole creation.
Grant peace to each soul, each heart, in me, in you, in every particle and everywhere in the Universe.
Om Shanti: Shanti: Shanti:. Wherever there will be a talk of world peace, Indias name and contribution will be written in golden letters.
For India, 11th of November this year has a special significance because on 11th November a hundred years back the World War I had ended.
Ending of that war is completing one hundred years meaning thereby that a century of ending of the vast devastation and human loss would also get completed.
For India, World War I was an important event.
Rightly speaking we had no direct connection with that war.
Despite this, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed it to the world that they are second to none if it comes to war.
Our soldiers have displayed great valour in difficult areas and adverse conditions.
There has just been a single objective behind it- Restoration of peace.
The world witnessed a dance of death and devastation during the World War I
According to estimates, around one crore soldiers and almost the same number of civilians lost their lives.
This made the whole world realize and understand the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
Today, peace does not only mean no war.
There is a need to work unitedly to address issues such as terrorism, climate change, economic development to social justice through universal cooperation and co-ordination.
Development of the poorest of the poor is the real indicator of peace.
