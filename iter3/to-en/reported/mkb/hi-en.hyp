My dear countrymen, Namaskar
My best wishes to you all on Diwali
We have been told - Shubham Karoti Kalyan Health Wealth Wealth
In this verse, how excellent message it is said that light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destroys the opposite intellect, shows good intelligence.
I bow down to such a divine light
To remember this Deepawali, what better idea can be that we expand the light, spread positivity and pray to destroy the feeling of hostility
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world
The special thing is that it not only includes the Indian community but now the governments of many countries, its citizens, its social organizations celebrate Diwali with full joy.
In a way , India stands there
Friends, Festival tourism has its own attraction in the world
Our India, which is the country of festivals, has immense possibilities of festival tourism as well.
Our effort should be to spread festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu and also to include people from other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals.
Every state, every region has so many festivals of its own. People from other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in increasing the festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided that we will do something different on this Diwali.
I had said that let us celebrate the women power and achievements of India on this Deepawali i. e.
And immediately after that, there was a lot of inspiring stories on social media.
Kodipaka Ramesh of Darangal wrote on NamoApp that my mother is my power.
My mother is God for me
Everything is there for me and it is India ' s Lakshmi in the true sense .
Ramesh Ji, I salute your mother
Geetika Swamy, who is active on Twitter, says that Major Khushboo Kanwar is Lakshmi of India who is the daughter of Bus Conductor and led the All-Commen detachment of Assam Riles.
For poetry Tiwari ji, India's Lakshmi, her daughter, who is also her strength
They are proud that their daughter paints the best
He has also obtained a very good Rank in the ATE exam
At the same time Megha Jain ji has written that an elderly 92 year old woman of Ninety Two Years provides free water to passengers at Gwalior railway station for years.
Megha ji, inspired by the humility and compassion of Lakshmi of this India.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
You must read, take inspiration and share the same with yourself. And I respectfully bow down to all these Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the renowned poetess of the 17th century Sanchi Honamma, he wrote a poem in the 17th century, in Kannada, in the Kannada language, that word, that word, every Laxmi of India, this is what we are talking about.
It seems as if its foundation was created in the 17th century itself.
How excellent words, how good expressions and how excellent ideas are there in this poem of Kannada language
Pannida Parmegondanu Himavantanu, Pennida Bhrigu Parchidanupennida Janakarayanu Jasuvalendanu (Penninda Permegondanu himavantanu. Penninda broohu PerchidanuPenninda janakarayanu jasuvalendanu) i.e. due to her daughter Parvati, Rishi Bhrigu got fame due to her daughter Lakshmi and King Janaka got her daughter Sita
Our daughters are our pride and we have a strong identity and a bright future of these daughters.
My dear countrymen, November 12, 2019 is the day when 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
Guru Nanak Devji ' s influence is not only in India but in the whole world .
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters are settled who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I can never forget my visits to the gurudwaras in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji that I can share with you, but for this, many episodes of Mann Ki Baat will take place.
He always kept the service paramount
Guru Nanak Devji believed that there can be no cost of selfless service .
They stood firm against social evil like untouchables
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji conveyed his message to the world, far and wide
He was one of the most travellers in his time
He went to many places and wherever he went, he won the hearts of everyone, his simplicity, humility.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji undertook several important religious journeys, which are called sadness
With the message of goodwill and equality, they visited the north, the south, the east or the west, and met the saints and sages everywhere.
It is believed that the famous saint Shankardev of Assam was also inspired by him .
He visits the holy land of Haridwar
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi. It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji had stayed there
He went to religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism .
Visit to Guru Nanak Dev Ji, Sri Lanka in the South
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the problem of water there.
In Bidar, there is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb which reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, it is dedicated to him.
During an indifference, Guru Nanak ji visited Kashmir and its surrounding areas in the north.
It established a strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir .
Guru Nanak Dev ji also went to Tibet, where the people, considered him, Guru
They are also revered in Uzbekistan, where they had traveled.
During one of his sadness, he also visited Islamic countries on a large scale, including Saudi Arab, Iran.
Just a few days ago, Ambassador of the High Level Countries of 85 countries visited Amritsar from Delhi.
There he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this was due to the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji .
All these ambassadors not only visited the Golden Temple but also got an opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
Thereafter, many Ambassadors shared pictures of social media with great pride and good experiences.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember the date of October 31.
Sardar Patel also looked at numerous things in depth and examined them in depth.
In fact, they were Man of Detail
At the same time he was skilled in organisational skills
He had mastered plans and strategy formulation
When they read and listen to Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, it is clear how powerful his planning was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country were going to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in Nineteen Twenty One.
Sardar Patel was responsible for the entire system of the session
He used this opportunity to improve the network of water supply in the city
He contacted the farmers and urged them to make Khadi bags
Farmers made bags and sold to delegates
Putting shoes in these bags, keeping them with you ended the tension of shoes stolen from the delegates' mind.
On the other hand , Khadi sales also increased considerably .
Our country, Sardar Patel, will always be grateful for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly
He did an important job of ensuring fundamental rights so that there was no scope for any discrimination based on caste and sect.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did a great job of uniting the princely states.
Actually, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role is discussed in certain provinces in the integration of the country.
He also played an important role in a small place like Lakshadweep .
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947 , our neighbour looked at Lakshadweep and sent the ship with his flag .
As soon as Sardar Patel came to know about this, without losing time, without delay, he immediately started to take tough action.
Soon after their command , the tricolor was hoisted there , and destroyed the Lakshadweep by their neighbour ' s plans .
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked Mudaliar Brothers to personally ensure that Lakshadweep gets every necessary help for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly to Indias progress.
It ' s also an attractive tourist destination
I hope you all will visit its beautiful islands and beaches
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the day when the Statue of Unity was dedicated to the nation and the world in the memory of Sardar Saheb.
This is the tallest statue in the world
The US - based Statue of Liberty is also double in height
The tallest statue of the world fills every Indian with pride
Every Indian ' s head rises higher than pride .
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists, Statue of Unity in a year.
This means that on an average, eight and a half thousand people showed the magnificence of Statue of Unity every day.
He expressed his faith in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, his reverence in his heart and now several centres of attraction like Hactus Garden, Butterly Garden, Jungle Saari, Hildren Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery are continuously developing and this is also encouraging the local economy and providing new employment opportunities to the people.
And keeping in mind the convenience of the tourists coming, several villagers are providing homes and homes to provide them with a facility of ome stairs.
Professional training is also being provided to people providing Come Stay Acquisitions.
The people there have also started cultivating ragon rut and I am sure it will soon become the main source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study.
We all are witness to the fact that within a year, a place develops as a world famous tourism destination.
People from all over the world come there
A lot of arrangements are going on developing automatically after each other's transport, lodging, guides, eco-friendly systems.
There is a huge economy developing and people are creating facilities as per the requirement of passengers.
The government is also playing its role
Friends, As you know, the National Unity Day is celebrated on 31st October every year since 2014.
This day gives us the message of protecting our country at all costs of unity, integrity and security.
On 31st October, every time Run for Unity is also being organized.
It will include people from every section of society, every section of the society.
Run for Unity is a symbol of the fact that this country is one in one direction and wants to achieve one goal.
One Target - Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat II
It has been observed in the last five years - not only in Delhi but also in hundreds of cities of India, in the Union Territories, in the capitals, in the district centres, in small tier-to-tier-three cities, there are a large number of men, women, people of the city, people of the villages, children, youth, people with disabilities and people with disabilities.
Anyway, nowadays, people are getting a passion and passion for marathon.
Run for Unity is also such a unique provision.
Running mind-brain and body is beneficial for everyone .
There is also a racing ITI here.
At the same time, we are also connected to this purpose of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'.
And that is why not just the body, but also the mind and culture to take India to new heights for India's unity.
And so in whatever city you live in, you can find out about Run for Unity around you.
In this portal, information has been given about places across the country where Run for Unity is to be organized.
I hope that all of you will run on October 31 - for the unity of India and for the fitness of yourself.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has built the country in the formula of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every turn, at every juncture.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious to empower the unity and harmony of the country.
If we look around you, we will find many examples that have been working continuously to enhance mutual harmony, but sometimes it happens that the efforts of the society, its contribution, its contribution gets disappearance from the memory panel very soon.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court passed its verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi
Interest Groups were playing games to take advantage of those situations in their own way.
What kind of language was spoken to create warmth in the atmosphere
But all these things continued for five days, seven days, ten days, but as the decision came, the country felt a pleasant, surprising change.
On one hand, everything had happened for two weeks. However, when the decision on Ram Janmabhoomi came, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all communities, saints and saints gave a very balanced and restrained statement.
Whenever I remember that day , I am happy .
Honoured the dignity of the judiciary very gloriously and did not allow the atmosphere of heat, stress anywhere.
These things should always be remembered , they give us a lot of strength .
That day, that moment, is a duty for all of us
This is an example of how the voice of unity gives strength to the country.
I pay homage to them today
My dear countrymen, today, if a story of every household is heard far and wide, every village has a story - from north to south, from east to west, from every corner of India, then it is a story of cleanliness.
But there ' s also a pleasant experience and interesting experience
I heard, I think, I'll tell you, too.
Just imagine, the world's highest battlefield, where temperature goes minus 50-60 degrees minus
Hoygen in the air is also just a name
In such adverse situations, living in the midst of such challenges is not less than any heroism.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country by sewing the ceiling but also running the Swachh Siachen campaign there.
I compliment the countrymen for this wonderful commitment of the Indian Army .
thank you .
There ' s so cold that it ' s hard to decompose anything
In such a situation, separation and management of waste is a very important task in itself.
In such a scenario, removing 130 tons of garbage from the glacier and its surrounding areas and how big a service is between the ragile eco-system here.
We all know that this Siachen is a glacier which is a source of rivers and clean water, so running a cleanliness drive here means ensuring clean water for those who live in the lower areas.
Also use the waters of rivers like Nubra and Shyok
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival that brings a new consciousness into our lives.
And in Diwali, specially buying something new, bringing something from the market is only a small amount in every family.
I once said we should try - - buy local things
We don ' t have to go to tehsil if we get what we need from our village .
If found in Tehsil then there is no need to go to the district
As much as we will try to buy our local items, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I was urging that we should buy something or the other from the hand of our weavers, our Khadi people.
In this Diwali too, you must have purchased a lot before Diwali but many people also think that if they go after Diwali then they will get a little cheaper.
So there ' s a lot of people who ' ll still have the rest of the purchase
So along with the best wishes of Deepawali, I will urge you to come forward to buy local products.
See, we can also play an important role in realizing the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all on the auspicious occasion of Deepawali.
We use a variety of firecrackers in Diwali
But, sometimes there is a fire in carelessness
Somewhere it becomes injury.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great fanfare .
My best wishes
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Will he be able to control his own life and destiny
Revered Bapu ' s Jantar can be remembered
Can we imagine while shopping that what I am buying will benefit the citizens of my country
Today the whole country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion
Rakshabandhan ' s festival is considered as a symbol of love and faith between sister and brother .
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many stories in the history of the country in which a defence formula had linked the people of two different states or religions with the bond of faith.
Just a few days later , the festival of Janmashtami is also going to come .
The entire atmosphere is going to echo with the glory of elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanhaiyalal and Govinda.
The joy of swinging in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Apart from Rakshabandhan , Sanskrit day is also celebrated on Shravan Purnima .
I congratulate all those who are engaged in tolerating, riding and delivering this great heritage to the common man.
Every language has its own importance, India takes pride in the fact that Tamil is the oldest language in the world and we all Indians are also proud that from the Vedic times to the present, the Sanskrit language has also played a major role in spreading knowledge.
Sanskrit language and its literature are the repository of knowledge related to every field of life .
Whether it is science or technology, agriculture or health, astronomy or architecture, maths or management, economics or environment, the mantras of dealing with the challenges of global warming are mentioned in detail in our Vedas.
You will be happy to know that residents of Mattur village in Shivamoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for talks.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which infinite words are made possible.
Sometimes they use lions and poetry but those who are familiar with the good wishes of Sanskrit, they know that in very few words this accurate statement is made from Sanskrit greetings.
As has been asked to explain the importance of the guru in life - Akshramastu, Guru: disciple Prabodhyat
We all celebrate the upcoming Teachers Day with this feeling
The whole country celebrates his birth anniversary as Teachers Day
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day. I also congratulate you for your dedication towards science, education and students.
Burning trees and plants from the heat give relief to the dry reservoirs, but sometimes it also brings excessive rain and devastating floods.
There is such a situation of nature that in some places there has been more rain than others .
Heavy floods in Kerala have severely affected public life
Today, in these difficult situations, the whole country stands with Kerala
Our condolences are with those families who have lost their loved ones, the loss of their lives cannot be compensated. But I want to assure the bereaved families that 1. 25 billion Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of grief.
My prayer is that those who have been injured in this natural calamity will go healthy as soon as possible.
I am sure that the people of Kerala will be resurrected with the strength and indomitable courage of the people of the state.
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something or the other at their own level so that wherever there is an objection, be it Kerala or other districts of India or be it areas or be it areas, peoples lives can become normal again.
All age groups and people associated with every field of work are contributing.
Everyone is trying to ensure that the suffering of the people of Kerala can be at least possible, we will share their grief.
We all know that the Armed Forces personnel are the heroes of the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala
They left no stone unturned to save the people trapped in the flood
I also want to specifically mention the hard work of NRC janitors
He has done a very good job in this moment of crisis .
Their competence of NHRC has become a new centre of faith for every Indian by making rapid decisions and making rapid decisions.
Tomorrow was the festival of Onam, we will pray that the festival of Onam gives strength to the country and especially to Kerala so that they can recover from this calamity at the earliest and the development journey of Kerala gets a boost.
Once again, I would like to assure all the citizens of Kerala and other parts of the country that the entire country is with them in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions that came to mind
The topic on which people from all over the country wrote the most is the subject of all of us, Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, many innumerable people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov urging me to talk about various aspects of Atal ji's life.
On 16th August, as soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's death, everyone was drowned in mourning
A nation leader who quit the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago
In a way , for the past 10 years , he had gone far from active politics .
News did not appear anywhere, publicly did not see
Over the past several days, the best aspects of Atal ji have come to the fore.
People remember him as the best MP, sensitive writer, best speaker, popular Prime Minister
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act two thousand and three.
This change made two important changes in Indias politics
Firstly, the size of the Cabinet in the States was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats
Secondly, the limit fixed under anti-defection law was increased from one-third to two-thirds
Clear guidelines for disqualification of defectioners were also prescribed.
For many years, the political culture of forming a huge cabinet in India was not only designed to divide the big cabinet but also to please the politicians.
Atal ji changed it
Their move saved money and resources
With this, efficiency also increased
It was a long vision like Atal ji who changed the situation and healthy traditions flourished in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot
During his tenure there was a change in the time of presenting the budget .
Earlier , according to the tradition of the British , the budget was presented at 5 p . m . , because at that time the time of parliament was started in London .
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 a.m.
Several such rules have been made in this code, which made it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places.
This gave more and more Indians the opportunity to hoist their national flag .
So he brought our beloved Tricolor closer to the people .
Similarly, nowadays you are seeing that the discussions about holding the elections of the Centre and the States together in the country are progressing.
People are keeping their points in both the sides of this subject and the opposition
This is good and auspicious sign for democracy
I must say that it will be a great tribute to Atal ji to develop good traditions for a healthy democracy, to strive for strengthening democracy, to carry forward discussions with an open mind.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfil his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I pay tribute to Atal ji on behalf of all of us.
Just a few days back the monsoon session of Parliament has ended .
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha is 118 and the Rajya Sabha has 74.
Emerging above the party, all MPs tried to make the monsoon session more useful and consequently, the Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and the Rajya Sabha passed 14 bills
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of youth
Several important Bills that benefit the youth and backward communities were passed in this session
You all know that for decades, there was a way to create a BCC Commission like the SC  ST Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, this time the country has fulfilled its resolve to form a BCC and gave it a constitutional right.
This step will prove to be advancing the objective of social justice .
Amendment Bill to safeguard the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was also passed in this session
This law will further safeguard the interests of the S and ST communities
At the same time, it will prevent criminals from torturing and believe in Dalit communities
No civilized society can tolerate any injustice against the women power of the country .
The guilty of rape are not ready to tolerate the country, so Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and made the provision of harshest punishment.
The culprits of misbehavior will be punished for at least 10 years, he will be punished for raping girls under the age of 12 years.
A few days ago you must have read in the newspapers a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, after just two months of hearing, two convicts of rape have been sentenced to death by a minor.
Prior to this , a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh punished the culprits for hanging after just five days of hearing .
Rajasthan has also made similar quick decisions by the courts there .
This law will play an effective role in preventing crime cases against women and girls .
Economic progress is incomplete without social change
However , this session of the Rajya Sabha has not been possible . I assure Muslim women that the whole country stands with full force to bring them justice .
When we move ahead in the country, changes can be brought about in the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
This time in the monsoon session, everyone has presented an ideal.
These days the attention of millions of countrymen is on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every morning people first look at newspapers, television, news, social media and see which Indian player has won medals.
Asian Games are still running
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country
My best wishes to those sportspersons who are yet to compete.
Indias players are performing well especially in Shooting and Restalling but our players are also bringing medals in the games in which our performance has not been so good before, such as sports like Lushu and Rowing - these are not just medals - proof of the courage and dreams of Indian sportspersons
Increased number of medal winners for the country include our daughters and this is a very positive sign - even the young players who win medals are our youth of the age group of 15-16 years
It is also a very good sign that most of the players who have won medals are from small towns and villages and they have achieved this success with hard work.
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day. On this occasion, I extend my best wishes to all sports enthusiasts as well as pay my tributes to the magician of Hockey Shri Dhyan Chand ji.
I urge all the citizens of the country to play and take care of their fitness as a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India
Once again I congratulate the medal winners at the Asian Games and wish the rest of the players a good performance.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day
Namaste Spirit, I respect your spirit
We all have seen houses and buildings built with bricks and stones, but can you imagine that about twelve-and-a-half years ago, a huge mountain that was just a single stone mountain was given the shape of an excellent, huge and wonderful temple - perhaps it was difficult to imagine, but that was the temple - Kailashnath temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra
If someone tells you that a pillar of more than 60 metres of granite was built about a thousand years ago and a rock weight of 80 tons of granite was placed on its summit then would you believe
But, the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this incredible mail of architecture and engineering can be seen
Everybody is surprised to see the eleventh century queen ' s atmosphere in Patan of Gujarat .
India has a Land Engineering Laboratory
There were many engineers in India who made unimaginable and presented examples of miracles in the engineering world.
We also got a gem in our legacy of great engineers whose work is still amazing people and he was Bharat Ratna Dr. M.
He is revered in that part of the country and the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and intimacy.
In their memory , September 15 is created as Engineers Day
Following their footprints , our country ' s engineers have made their own distinct identity all over the world .
When I talk about the miracles of the engineering world, I am reminded of an incident in 2001 when a terrible earthquake struck Kutch.
When I used to work there as a volunteer, I got the opportunity to go to a village and I got the opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years of age and she was ridiculing us by looking at me. And she was saying, Look, this is my house in Kutch.
But you didn ' t see any damage anywhere .
These houses were constructed by our ancestors in accordance with the nature and the environment here and they were saying this thing so proudly. So I was convinced that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had done what kind of compositions they had done in accordance with the local circumstances due to which the common man was safe.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Should workshops at the location
What new things have we to learn in the changed era
World is battling natural calamities
So what is the new form of structural engineering
What are their courses
What to teach students
How did Hero waste make this our priority
When many such things are celebrated by engineers, we must think.
There is an atmosphere of festivals and along with this preparations for Diwali also begin .
We will continue to meet in the mindset, we will continue to talk about the mindset and we will continue to move forward with our hearts.
With this feeling, my best wishes to you all
Thank you
Will meet again
There are reports of good rainfall in many places these days .
Somewhere there is news of anxiety due to excessive rains and people are still waiting for rains at some places.
India's vastness, diversity and sometimes rain shows the form of preference and dislike, but what do we blame the rain, man is the one who has chosen the path of struggle with nature and consequently nature becomes rooted in us
And that is why it becomes the responsibility of all of us to become a lover of nature, a protector of nature, a promoter of nature, a balance between the things given by nature remains intact.
A similar incident of natural calamity attracted the attention of the whole world in the past, shocked the human mind
You must have seen on TV, 12 young football players in Thailand went to the cave to roam their coach.
It usually takes a few hours to go into the cave and get out of it.
But on that day , fortune was different .
When they went deep inside the cave , a sudden heavy rain caused a lot of water to accumulate near the cave door .
You can imagine how the moment will be when death appears in adolescence and you have to spend moments.
On the one hand, he was struggling with a crisis, on the other hand, humanity was united across the world to express the humanitarian qualities of God.
People all over the world were praying to get these kids out safely
Whether it is the government, the parents of these children, their families, media or citizens of the country, everyone has shown a wonderful conduct of peace and patience.
Everyone was engaged in their mission as a team.
In this entire operation, a Thai Navy naval personnel lost their lives.
The whole world is astonished that he did not give up his hope with such bravery and patience in a dark cave full of water in spite of such difficult circumstances .
It shows that when humanity comes together, there are wonderful things.
We just need to focus on our goal with a calm and stable mind, keep working for it.
In the past, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji left us.
Neeraj ji had a special feature - hope, trust, determination, self confidence
However , the months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth .
Because that ' s the time when collages have a peak season
Millions of youngsters like Satyam leave school and go to colleges
If February and March go to Deams, Papers, Hanswers then in April and May, along with enjoying holidays, results, deciding further directions in life, career choice is spent in this.
July is the month when youngsters step in a new phase of their lives when they move away from occupancy to cut-offs.
Students' attention goes from home to hotel
Students come under the shadow of prossors from the shadow of parents.
I am sure that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of life.
Going out of the house for the first time, going out of the village, getting out of a protective environment has to become its own chariot.
So many youngsters leave their homes for the first time and come out to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students must have joined their own colleges so far, some will be joiners.
I would like to tell you people that be calm, enjoy life, enjoy the spirit of life.
There is no fodder without books, no study has to be done, but there should be a tendency to find new things.
Old friends have their own value .
Childhood friends are valuable, but choosing, making and maintaining new friends is a very wise thing in itself.
Learn something new, like new skills, new languages.
Young people who have left their homes and have gone out to some other place should discover those places, know about them, people of that place, language, culture and tourist places of that place - go there, know about them.
My best wishes to all the youngsters, starting a new innings
His father raises garbage and raises his family
I congratulate them for their success .
There are many students from a poor family and they have done something by their hard work and perseverance that inspires us all.
Bitiya Afreen Shaikh of Ahmedabad, whose father runs auto Rickshaw, the daughter of Nagpur is happy, whose father is also a driver in the school bus or Kartik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand whose father works in brick kiln.
Ramesh himself used to sell toys at the fair or Anushka Panda, the divyang daughter of Gurgaon, who has been suffering from a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy, has achieved such a success in the world by crossing every barrier with determination and courage.
If we look around , we will find many such examples
Neeraj ji has said that the song is to recite the sky to the earth. I have to call every darkness in the light. I have to smell the sword with the smell of flowers. And to wake up the mountains of Ga-ga. My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my sight went on a news, had written - Two youths did the dream of Modi
The incident was that once the San Jose City of America, known as the Technology Lub, I was discussing with the Indian youth.
I had appealed to them to think about how they can use their talent for India and do something after taking time out.
I appealed to convert Brain-rain into Brain-Gain
Using their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly prepared a SmartGaon App.
This App is not only connecting the people of the village to the whole world but now they can get any information and information on their own mobile phones.
Residents of Taudakpur village in Rae Bareli, village head, district magistrate, all people made people aware about the use of this app.
If you look at this incident closely then one thing will come to mind that the youngsters are living in America, their lifestyle, thinking and thinking. He must have left India several years ago but he still knows the nuances of his village, understands the challenges and is emotionally connected to the village.
That's why, perhaps, he could make something in line with what the village wants.
Every Indian naturally has a sense of attachment to his village, his roots and of doing something for the country.
But sometimes because of time, sometimes because of distances, sometimes because of ecological conditions, a slight ash gets accumulated on it, but if a small spark gets touched then all the things emerge again and they pull towards their past days.
We should also check that even in our case it has not happened, the situation, the situation, the distances have not separated us, the ashes have not been frozen.
Santosh Ji thank you very much for your Phone Hall.
Actually Pandharpur Wari is a unique journey in itself .
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which was on 23rd July, is also celebrated as a grand culmination of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15 - 20 days before Ashadi Ekadashi , the pilgrimages along with the palanquins leave for Pandharpur on foot .
This journey, which is called Vari, includes millions of warkari
Great saints like Saint Dnyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram walk towards Pandharpur instead of singing, dancing and dancing in the palanquin.
Pilgrims reach there for their viewing Lord Vitthal , who is also called Vitthova or Pandurang .
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived, the victims
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, there is immense reverence, devotion
Going to Vithova Temple in Pandharpur and its glory, beauty, spiritual joy has its own unique experience.
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandharpur Wari once you get the opportunity.
Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram - countless saints are still educating the common man in Maharashtra.
They have been giving strength to fight against superstition and in every corner of India this saint tradition has been inspiring.
We receive important messages of harmony, love and brotherhood from them whether they are burdened or disobedient.
It gets the mantra of fighting the society with reverence against superstition
These were the people who from time to time stopped the society, showed a token and a mirror and ensured that the old evils were eliminated from our society and people had rites of compassion, equality and purity.
This is our Indo-Bhumi Bahuratna Vasundhara, like a great tradition of saints in our country, in the same way the great men who have dedicated their lives to the powerful mother India have dedicated their lives to this land.
One such great man is Lokmanya Tilak who has left a deep impression on many Indians .
We remember Tilak jis birth anniversary on July 23 and his death anniversary on August 01.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence
They had the power and wisdom to show the British rulers the mirror of their mistakes .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he tried to treason him three times in 20 years, and this is not a small thing.
I want to put an interesting event in front of the countrymen today associated with one of his statues in Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
In October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, more than 40,000 people welcomed him in Ahmedabad almost a hundred years ago and during this visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with him and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was very impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on 1st August 1920, he had decided that he would build his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipality and immediately he chose Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak and it was named Victoria Garden, the ueen of Britain.
Ultimately the statue was built and Sardar Saheb inaugurated it not only from anyone but from 28 February 1929 to Mahatma Gandhi. And most funny is that at that inaugural function, revered Bapu said that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipality has not only got one person but also got the courage that has made the statue of Tilak ji possible.
And my dear countrymen, the uniqueness of this statue is that it is a rare statue of Tilak in which he is sitting on a chair, in which he has written just below Tilak. Swaraj is our birthright and I am listening to this period of the British.
The tradition of public Ganesh Utsav started with the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji
Public Ganesh Utsav became an effective medium for furthering the spirit of traditional reverence and festivities as well as societal awakening, collectivity, harmony and equality among the people.
At a time when it was necessary that the country should be united to fight against the British, these festivals did the work of uniting all by breaking the barriers of caste and creed.
Over time, the populism of these events has increased.
This shows that even today, our younger generation has a career with our heroes of our ancient heritage and history.
Today, in many cities it happens that you get to see Ganesh-Pandal in almost every street.
This is also an excellent opportunity for our youth, where they can learn qualities like leadership and organisation, they can develop within themselves.
I had requested last time too and when I remember Lokmanya Tilak Ji then I would urge you once again to celebrate Ganesh festival, celebrate it with great fanfare, but urge you to celebrate Ganesh festival with great enthusiasm.
From the idol of Ganesh ji to the decoration, everything should be eco-friendly. And I would like that there should be different competitions of eco-friendly Ganesh festival in every city, they should be rewarded. And I would like that things should be kept eco-friendly on MyGov as well as on Narendra Modi App for wide publicity.
I will surely convey your message to the people .
Lokmanya Tilak awakened self-confidence among the countrymen, he had shouted, Swaraj is our birthright and we will carry it.
Today is the time to say that Swaraj is our birthright and we will take it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and development results
I ' m talking about Chandrasekhar Azad
Who will be the youth in India who will not be inspired to listen to these lines Sarafroshi's desire is now in our hearts, it is in our hearts to see how strong the power is in the hands of Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, these lines inspired many youngsters
Chandrashekhar Azads passion for bravery and freedom has inspired many youth
Azad put his life on the claim, but he never bowed before foreign rule
I was fortunate to have got the privilege of going to Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad also got the opportunity to pay homage to him and Chandrashekhar Azad ji was a brave man who did not want to die by the bullets of foreigners - if he lives, he will fight for freedom and die even then he will continue to die for freedom.
Once again I respectfully bow down to two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days back, Indias brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das has made history by winning the Gold Medal in the 400m race in the ongoing Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Inland.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, in response to my letter, emailed me from Indonesia and is currently preparing for the Asian Games.
Integration in Mail writes, The most important moment in the life of any athlete is that when he catches the tricolor and I am proud that I did that.
Unity is also proud of you.
You have illuminated the name of the country
Unity has won Gold and Bronze medals in World Para Athletics Grand Prince 2018 in Tunisia.
His achievement is special because he made his challenge the medium of his success .
In 2003, due to road accident, half of her body failed, but this daughter did not lose courage and gained this position by strengthening herself.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji, he has won a gold medal in discus throw in Para Athletics Grand Priy in Berlin, along with Sunder Singh Gurjar has won a gold medal in javelin.
My dear countrymen, in the month of August, many events of history are full of festivals but sometimes illness also enters the house due to weather.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for the inspiration of patriotism, for the month of August and for the centuries-long celebrations.
Again , indeed , we shall meet for a matter of mind .
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, once again I am fortunate to be with you all in this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
Just a few days ago a historic cricket match was held in Bangalore .
You must have understood very well that I am talking about the Test match between India and Afghanistan.
This was Afghanistan ' s first international match and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India .
In this match, both the teams performed well and Rashid Khan, a baller from Afghanistan, has done well this year.
I remember that the President of Afghanistan Mr. Ashraf Ghani tagged me on his twitter and wrote that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan .
I am also grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan .
He is the asset of the world of cricket and at the same time he didn't even write in a slightly funny manner. We're not going to give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us
Well , this was the first match , so it ' s very natural to remember , but I ' ll remember this match for a particular reason .
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world
What can a winning team do while taking the trophy What did they do
- While taking the trophy, the Indian team from Afghanistan, which was playing international match for the first time, invited the Afghanistan team and both teams took photos together
What is sportsman spirit, what is sportsmanship - we can experience from this one incident.
Sports is an unprecedented way of uniting society and discovering the talent of our youth.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, there was a different view on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world was united
Whether it is the European Parliament in Bresil or the headquarters of the United Nations in New York or the Japanese Navy fighter ships, people have seen Yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic Yoga programme and I was told that many postures were demonstrated by women.
Soldiers of India and China jointly practice Yoga on the high snowy peaks of Ladakh
Yoga works to break all boundaries, add
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have made this occasion a great festival by going beyond all forms of caste, religion, region, colour or gender.
If people from all over the world were enthusiastic and participating in Yoga Day programmes then why would not the enthusiasm in India be multiplied
Our Air Force warriors stunned everyone by performing Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth in the middle of the sky.
The sight was that they did float in the air, not in the airplane.
Whether it is schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or playgrounds, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
Yoga has worked beyond caste, creed and geography to unite people all over the world. We have lived for centuries the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.
Our sages, sages, saints who always insist on, Yoga has proved it in the true sense.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives
On MyGov and NarendraModiApp, many people have written to me that I will talk about the Coctors Day on 1st July - the right thing is
We are the people who naturally worship mother as God, believe in equality with God because mother gives us life, mother gives us birth, so many times the doctor gives us rebirth.
The role of a doctor is not confined to treating only diseases .
Today, the doctor does not have medical expertise but he also has a deep experience of the generic life style trends and its impact on our health.
Indian doctors have made their mark all over the world with their capabilities and skills
Eminent in medical profession, along with hardworking, our doctors are known for solving complex medical problems.
We are fortunate people who have been born in this land of India
India has a rich history, when there is no such month, there is no such day in which no historical event has happened.
Look , everywhere in India has its own legacy
There is a saint, a great man, a famous person, everyone has his own contribution, his own greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and anyway when I was in Gujarat, you are well aware of the Kabir Wad of Gujarat.
When I used to work there, I had also organized a national convention of people belonging to the tradition of Saint Kabir.
You people know why Kabirdas ji had gone to Maghar
At that time there was an impression that one who dies in Maghar does not go to heaven
On the contrary, the body that leaves in Kashi goes to heaven
Maghar was considered unholy but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in it .
They broke the evils and superstitions of their time , and so they forgot , and they took the samadhi .
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his credentials and duo.
That was their ideal
This is the ideal we see in his writings , and in today ' s era he is equally inspiring .
The true Peer Saint is the one who knows and understands the pain of others who do not know the sorrow of another , they are ruthless .
Kabirdas ji laid special emphasis on social harmony
They thought far ahead of their time .
Put it on yourself, pity all coy
In another couplet, Kabir writes - where mercy is the religion, where greed and sin
He said: - Do not ask the caste sadhu, ask the knowledge
This is the greatness of the guru and such a guru, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev
Those who showed the way to millions and millions, keep inspiring for centuries
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God
wherever he went , he took several initiatives for the betterment of society .
The arrangement of a kitchen free from social discrimination where a person of every caste, creed, religion or sect could come and eat food, Guru Nanak Dev started this anchor system
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji to be celebrated in 2019
I want all of us to join it with enthusiasm and excitement
I urge you all to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in the entire society and around the world, to inspire all of us in this light festival with great pride.
My dear countrymen
India's freedom struggle is very long, very broad, deep and full of countless martyrdom
There is another history related to Punjab .
100 years of the horrific event of Jallianwala Bagh in 2019, which had shamed the entire humanity.
We can all recall how the 100 years of this event are going to be completed. But we must always remember the immortal message that this incident gave us. These violence and cruelty can never solve any problem.
Victory is always of peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice
Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that on July 6, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's birthday and he wants to talk to the countrymen about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this program.
Raman ji first thank you very much
It was very good to see your interest in the history of India
You know, yesterday was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23
Very few people would be aware that at the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 1937, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation at the University of Kolkata in Bengali.
This was the first time that the British Sultanate had addressed the Convocation in Bengali at the University of Kolkata.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industry Minister of India and in a sense, he had laid a strong foundation stone for Indias industrial development, had prepared a strong base, had prepared a strong platform.
Dr. Mukherjee's dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every field
He wanted India to develop big industries as well as pay full attention to MSMEs, handlooms, textiles and cottage industries.
He was quite passionate about the development of West Bengal.
As a result of their understanding, discretion and activism, a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India
For Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India and for this he lost his life at the young age of 52.
We must always remember the message of unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, with the spirit of harmony and brotherhood, and with a sense of vigour for Indias progress.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
I got the opportunity to know directly about the changes that are taking place in the lives of people going beyond the files.
People spoke of their resolve, their happiness and sorrow, their achievements
I believe that this was not just a government programme for me, but it was a different learning experience and what could be the moment of satisfaction in anybody's life due to the happiness faced by the people during this period
When he heard the stories of a common man, his naive words touched his heart.
In far-flung villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to passports for the elderly people of villages through Common Service Centre.
When a sister of Chhattisgarh collects Sitafal and does business by creating an ice-cream
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of youngsters of the country are running medicine centres as well as providing affordable medicines by visiting nearby villages.
At the same time, a young man from West Bengal is looking for a job two-three years ago and now he is only doing his successful business
Not only this, he is also giving jobs to ten to fifteen people.
Students from schools in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school tinkering lab at a young age.
There were so many stories that there would not be any corner of the country where people should not talk about their success.
In such an environment, when ordinary human beings come up with new hope, new zeal and events in their lives, they are not credited with the government.
The incident of a small girl from a remote village also becomes an inspiration for 1. 25 billion Indians.
With the help of technology for me, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very pleasant, inspiring and it not only gives me satisfaction to work but also gets the enthusiasm to do more work.
Another new joy, another new zeal, another new zeal and inspiration to live for the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen
40-40, 50-50 lakh people were involved in this video bridge program and you have given me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you
I always feel that if we look around us somewhere or the other is good.
There are people who do good
We can also experience the aroma of goodness
One thing I noticed in the past and this is a very unique combination
On the one hand, where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand, our farmer brothers and sisters associated with farming and farming.
Come along with TED engineers, they have formed a simple prosperity trust and they have activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
They joined the farmers, made plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Farmers producing grains are also associated with it .
On the one hand, farmers have a key role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing and on the other hand efforts are being made to ensure that farmers' participation in profits is ensured.
Separate seed-banks have been made so that the crop is good, there are good breed seeds for it.
Women see the functioning of this seed bank women have also been added
I congratulate these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am glad that these youngsters from the world of professionals, technocrats and engineering have come out of their scope to join the farmers, connect with the villages, connect with the fields and barns.
Once again, I would like to congratulate the young generation of my country for their innovative experiments, whatever I might have to go, whatever I might have to go, some might not have known, some might not have known.
GST is going to be completed one year. It was the dream of the people of the country of One Nation, One Tax.
I would like to give credit to the states if I want to give credit to anyone for this.
GST Cooperative Federalism is a great example where all the states together took a decision in the interest of the country and then such a big tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can take pride in the fact that people of different political ideologies sit there, people from different states sit there, people from different states are different priorities but despite this, all the decisions taken so far in the GST Council have been done with all the consensus.
Before GST, there used to be 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country.
GST is the victory of honesty and is also a celebration of honesty .
In the past , there used to be complaints of Inspector Raj in the case of tax for a long time in the country .
Everything from return to reund is done through online information technology.
With the introduction of GST, the check post was over and the movement of goods got faster, which not only saved time but also benefited a lot in the logistics sector.
GST maybe the world ' s largest tax reform
Such a big tax reform was successful in India because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST was ensured only through manpower.
It is generally believed that such a big reform, such a large country, such a large population takes 5-7 years to stabilize it completely. However, the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the celebration of the honesty of the country is the result of the participation of the people of the country.
Through Mann Ki Baat, once again you have got the opportunity to be the most compassionate.
You will remember very well that six women commanders of the Navy, one team has been on a sea trip for the past several months.
Navika Sagar Parikramaji - I want to talk about them
These 6 daughters of India, their team has taken the lead in the development of the sea for more than 250 days through the medium of sea.
NSC returns to India on 21st May after touring the whole world in Tarini and the whole country warmly welcomes him
He travelled in different oceans and many seas and covered a distance of about twenty thousand nautical miles
This was the first incident in the world itself .
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet all these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again I congratulate these daughters for enhancing their adventure, for enhancing the dignity of Navy, for enhancing the dignity of India and especially the world that the daughters of India are not less.
Sense of adventure who doesn't know
If we look at the development journey of mankind then progress has been made in the koch of some or the other adventure.
Development takes birth in the lap of adventure.
I can do something about passing some taxes, doing away with some leaks, doing some extra ordinary things - these feelings may be less, but for ages, a lot of people get inspiration.
On 16th May, 5 tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra took Tribal Students Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam. A team of our tribal children climbed the highest peak in the world.
These Ashram-School students started training in August 2017 Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh, Ladakh - they were trained.
These youths were selected under Mission Shaurya and they have made the country proud by winning the verest in accordance with their names.
I congratulate the people of Chandrapur, my young friends and heartiest congratulations to the people of Chandrapur.
Recently 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to conquer verest on behalf of Nepal
Many congratulations to daughter Shivangi
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Dia became the first pair of Indian father-daughter to climb the verest
Not only that young people are climbing the verest
Sangeeta Bahl climbed the verest on 19th May and Sangeeta Behl is more than 50 years old
This work is not only commendable but also reflects their commitment towards cleanliness and environment.
For years people have been climbing the verest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I congratulate all these brave heroes, especially daughters from the bottom of my heart.
People from every area in such a large number will come forward in its support
When I talk about Fit India, I believe that the more we play, the more the country will play.
On social media, people are sharing the videos of Fitness Challenge, tagging each other in them and challing them.
In the matter of mind, many times you have heard from me about sports, sportspersons, and the last time our heroes of Commonwealth Games, talk of their minds, were telling us through this programme - Namaskar sir
Image Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that the sports that were once part of the lives of every child, the streets and the streets are getting reduced today.
These games were specially part of the summer holidays .
Yes, it may be that they were known by different names at different places, just as Pittu is now known by many names.
No one knows how many names are Lagori, Satolia, Seven Stones, Decori, Satodia, of the same game
Traditional games have both kinds of games
There are out doors, even indoors.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games .
The same game is known by different names at different places
I am from Gujarat, I know that there is a game in Gujarat called Chomal Isto
It ' s played with whips or tamarind seeds or dice and with 88 square boards
This game was played in almost every state
We used to play these games
Who will be of us, who didn't play gills in childhood
Gilli-Danda is a game played from village to city .
It is known by different names in different parts of the country .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karabilla .
In Orissa it is called Gulibadi , in Maharashtra it is called Financial .
Some games have their own season
You must have seen many children, who are shy, but are very delicate while playing.
When everyone from children to grandparents, grandparents and grandparents play then what they say is not generation gap, it also becomes untouchable.
At the same time, we also know our culture and traditions.
Many sports also make us aware about society, environment etc.
By crowd sourcing we can make a huge archive of our traditional games
Videos of these games can be created, in which rules of sports can be shown about how to play
On June 5, India will officially host World Environment Day.
This is a very important achievement for India and is a reflection of Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change .
This time there is Beat Plastic Pollution
I appeal to all of you, understanding the spirit of this theme and its importance, let us ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on wildlife and on our health.
Go to World Environment Day website wed-india 2018 and there are many suggestions given in a very interesting manner - see, know and try to bring them into your everyday life.
In the last few weeks, we have seen that in different parts of the country there has been dust-half, strong winds and heavy rains, which is unseasonal.
There was also loss of life, goods and losses
We have to live in harmony with nature and live together with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this every step throughout his life
When India played a key role in the Op21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the whole world through the International Solar Alliance, it was at the core of this dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this Environment Day, let us all think about what we can do to make our planet clean and green.
How can you move forward in this direction
Can you innovate
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends
You always remember on 21st June, not only you, the whole world remembers on 21st June.
21st June is observed as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparing months ago
News is being received these days, preparations are being made to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21 all over the world.
The straightforward meaning of what has been said centuries ago is that some good qualities become like relatives and friends on regular practice of Yoga.
Yoga leads to courage which always protects us like a father .
A feeling of forgiveness arises as mother ' s own children and mental peace becomes our lasting friend .
Bharatrihari has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our child, mercy, our sister, self restraint, our brother, the earth itself, our bed and knowledge becomes our hunger-free.
When so many qualities become a partner , the Yogi triumphs over all kinds of fears .
Once again I appeal to all the countrymen to pursue their legacy of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is 27th May, the death anniversary of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji, the first Prime Minister of India
I salute Panditji
The memory of this month is also related to another thing and that is Veer Savarkar
This was the month of May in 1857 when Indians showed their strength to the British
Our soldiers and farmers in many parts of the country stood up against injustice while showing their bravery.
Sadly , for a very long time , the events of 1857 were only called revolt or military revolt .
In fact , the incident was not only undermined but it was also an attempt to push our self - respect .
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the month in which the first freedom struggle began.
Savarkar ji's personality was full of characteristics
A wonderful description of Savarkar ji has been made by our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji
How exactly did Atal ji depict
Savarkar went with both poetry and revolution
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a bold revolutionary
I was watching a story on television about our poor daughters from the raw settlements of Sikar in Rajasthan.
Our daughters, who were once forced to take garbage from house to house, today they are sewing clothes to cover the poor by learning the work of sewing.
The daughters here, apart from their own and their family clothing, are stitching from normal to good clothes
They are also courseing skill development along with it.
Our daughters have become self-reliant today. They are living their lives with respect and have become a force for their families.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters, full of hope and confidence, for their bright future.
They have shown that if you are determined to do something then success can be achieved even in the midst of all the difficulties. And this is not just about Sikar.
If you look around in the neighborhood then it will be remembered how people lose their problems.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some of the people along with us.
These discussions are political, social, motion pictures, sports and sportspersons, and also on the problems of the country - the solution to these problems should be such - but often these things are confined to discussions but some people who move forward in the direction of bringing about change with their hard work and passion, they make it a reality.
Similar stories of others' dream-making and self-sufficiency to fulfil their dreams, Dr. Prakash Rao, a resident of slums in Cuttack City of Orissa
Yesterday I got the privilege of meeting D. Prakash Rao
Shri D Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the past five decades
They make full arrangements for education, health and food to all children coming to school
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work and passion and for giving a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
They have abolished the darkness of their life .
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the entire nation.
Let ' s move forward positively .
In the month of June , there is so much heat that people wait for rain and see the clouds glittering in the sky .
A few days from now people will also wait for the moon
The moon appears means that the Eid can be celebrated .
During Ramzan , after one month ' s fast , the festival of Eid symbolizes the beginning of celebration .
I am sure that everyone will celebrate Eid with full zeal. Children will get specially good Idi on this occasion.
I hope the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society .
Best wishes to everyone
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
And then we ' ll meet next month in mind .
Talk of mind, April 2018

Link it to India, let it lead India and I am glad that people are joining it with great enthusiasm. Many people have written to me showing their support for it, have sent letters, have shared their fitness mantra on social media, it is India stories. A gentleman Mr. Shikant Bhosle has written sharing a picture of swimming pool - My weapon is my body, my element is water, My world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath writes, "From the morning walk, I feel myself happy and healthy and she further says - for me fitness comes with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy."
Make these holidays an opportunity to learn for a new experience My dear countrymen
When we hear that in the future there will be wars about water in the world , everyone speaks of it , but do we have any responsibility
Do we not think that water conservation should be social responsibility
I don't know the Bengali language, but when I was younger, I was used to getting up very early - since childhood and in Eastern India the radio starts very soon, when it starts late in western India then I have a very fat idea in the morning.
Rabindra Sangeet started at 30 o'clock, I didn't know the language on the radio and I didn't know the language. I got used to listening to Rabindra music on the radio early in the morning. And when Anandaloke and Aguner, Poroshmoni got the opportunity to hear these poems, the mind got a lot of consciousness. You too, Rabindra Sangeet and his poems would have influenced me.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian. We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showed the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people all over the world. This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the responsibility of all of us to strive and walk on the path of Lord Buddha while remembering Lord Buddha.
Ambedkar insists that Lord Buddha has been a great inspiration in his social philosophy. He had said that My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
Today is the holy festival of Ramnavmi
My best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Ram Navami
We have seen the power of Ram in the life of revered Bapu every moment in his life .
On 26th January, when all the dignitaries from ASEAN countries were present here, they had come here with their ultural troop and it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting the Ramayana in front of us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are producing equal inspiration and influence not only in India but also in ASEAN countries in this part of the world.
I once again convey my best wishes to all of you on Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, like every time I have received all your letters, emails, phone calls and comments in large quantities.
Soft Thakkar ji read about MyGov what you wrote about starting on-line courses of Sanskrit.
Besides being a TV professional, it was a pleasure to see your love for Sanskrit.
I have asked the concerned department to reach out to you about the efforts being made on this side .
The listeners of Mann Ki Baat who work on Sanskrit, I would also request them to consider how to carry forward the suggestions of Komal ji.
Shri Ghanshyam Kumar Ji, Village Barakar, District Nalanda, Bihar read comments on your NarendraModiApp
The concern that you have expressed on the decreasing water level in the ground is definitely very important.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal ji, I have conveyed your feelings to all the listeners.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresh ji, he says that this time I will talk to the youth about their health.
They think our youngsters are physically weak if they compare them to the Asian Countries
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time I will talk to everyone about health in detail.
In the past, the President of France visited Kashi. His Excellency Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of that visit were touching the mind and it was going to create an impact.
And, he had urged that all the photographs, all the videos, social media should be promoted.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had shared those photos on the same day on social media and Narendra ModiApp.
Angah, Jayesh, I want to inform all of you that your letters make me feel tired all day long.
So many letters, so many phone calls, comments, whatever I have read, I have heard and many of these things have touched my mind - even if I talk about them only then perhaps for months I will have to go on saying something or the other continuously.
This time most of the letters are children who have written about eam
Holidays have their plans, shares.
Worried about the water of animals and birds in the summer
Farmers brothers and sisters have received letters about the activities related to farmers and farming across the country.
Some active citizens of Water Conservation have sent suggestions.
Our festivals, our culture, our traditions are discussed in the festival season.
That is, the things of mind change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the things of our minds change the weather in somebody's life.
And why not change
It has the power to change the weather all over the country .
13 years ago, the sister of Saidul Laskar, ab-driver from Kolkata, died due to lack of timely treatment, decided to build a hospital so that no poor person dies due to lack of treatment.
In his mission, Saidul sold home ornaments and collected money through donations.
In this way, after 12 years of collection of money, the Bhagirath effort made by Sadul Laskar brought it color and today due to his hard work and determination, he is ready to become a hospital with a capacity of about 30 beds in Punri village near Kolkata.
Many such inspirations introduce my country.
Today, in the country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, in every section, this belief has emerged that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward
A positive atmosphere of self-confidence filled with hope and hope
This self-confidence, this positivity, our resolution of a New India will be realised, it will prove to be a dream.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
Be it Mahatma Gandhi or Shastri ji or Lohia ji or Chaudhary Charan Singh ji or Chaudhary Devi Lal ji all considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and common man's lives.
This expression reflects in this line when he had said - "To orget how to dig the earth and tend to tend the soil, is to forget ourselves. Yes, if we forget to take care of the earth and soil, then it is a matter of forgetting ourselves"
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji often stressed on the need for conservation of trees, plants and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of mass awareness for better income for our farmers, better irrigation facilities and ensuring them and enhancing food and milk production
This low-sector state has done a great job
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced record production during 2015-16 compared to last five years.
They have shown that when the goal is set, the courage is high and there is a resolve in the mind then it can be proved and shown by doing it.
In the letters I received, I was seeing that a lot of farmers had written about MSP and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, A major decision has been taken in this year's budget to provide fair price to the farmers.
It has been decided that MSP for notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times of their cost.
Attempts are being made to connect the local mandis of the village, the Cholesale Market and the Global Market.
Farmers do not have to go far to sell their produce - for this, 22 thousand rural haats of the country will be integrated with APM and e-NAM platform while upgrading the necessary infrastructure.
In a way, connectivity is being made with any market in the country from the fields.
My dear countrymen, this year will mark the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How can the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is not only our resolve but also how can 1. 25 billion Indians pay the best tributes to Gandhi Ji by joining hands and shoulders
I urge you all to share your thoughts on this with everyone through MyGov.
What is the logo of Gandhi 150
What is slogan or mantra or proclamation
Please give your suggestions about this
Together we must pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and take inspiration from him to take our country to new heights.
Tell us something about how they are mobilizing the institutions. Thank you very much. Thank you very much and I believe that Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat are complementary to each other.
Today, the country has moved ahead of the conventional approach in the field of health.
Every work related to health in the country where the responsibility of the Health Ministry was only there, now all the departments and ministries, be it the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Hemispheres, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development, are working together for a healthy India and the emphasis is being laid on affordable health along with the preventive health.
Preventive Health Care is the cheapest and the easiest.
And the more we become aware of the preventive healthcare, the more the individual, the family and the society will benefit.
Life is the first requirement for being healthy - sanitation
As a preventive healthcare, Yoga has made its mark in the world in a new way.
Yoga guarantees both fitness and wellness
This is the result of our commitment that today Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
The International Day of Yoga is less than 100 days left between 21st June
On the last three International Yoga Days, people participated in it with great enthusiasm everywhere in the country and around the world.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends, all, for Yoga right now.
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga Teacher
I will share this video with all of you so that we can practice asana, pranayama together.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level to make healthcare accessible and affordable for the common man.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are being made available at affordable prices.
More new centers are being opened
My appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat is to provide information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras to the needy - they will reduce the cost of medicines
They will have a great service .
Price of heart stent has been reduced to 85 for heart patients
Under Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore households i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in the existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts
The goal of making the country TB free by 2025
It ' s a big job
You need help in awakening the masses
We all have to make collective efforts to get rid of TB
My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar had spoken of industrialization of India.
For them, the industry was an effective medium in which employment could be provided to the poorest of the poor.
Today, India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the world's largest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has emerged as a bright spot.
The whole world is looking at India as the FB for investment innovation and development
This was the idea that the development of industries would be possible only in the cities due to which Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar trusted India's urbanization and urbanization.
Moving ahead of his vision, smart cities missions and urban missions were launched in the country so that every kind of facility in the big cities and small towns of the country - be it good roads, water supply, health facilities, education or digital connectivity can be provided.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance.
They didn ' t want a person to always live in poverty .
At the same time , he believed that nothing could be done away with the distribution of the poor .
India, Stand up India initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators, young entrepreneurs.
In the 1930s and 1940s, when there was talk of roads and railways only in India, Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke about ports and waterways.
It was Dr. Baba Saheb who saw water power as a nation-power
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on different sea shores of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
During the 40s, most of the discussions were about 2nd World War, Emerging Wold-ar and Partition. At that time, Dr.
He had laid the foundation of India's spirit
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism and stressed on working closely with the Centre and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and cooperative federalism in every aspect of governance and the most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people like me associated with the backward classes.
He has shown us that it is not necessary to be born in a big or a rich family, but those born in poor families in India can also dream of, strive to fulfil those dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it happened when many people made fun of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
India belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the backward.
Gram-Swaraj Abhiyan being organised from 14th April to 5th May to mark the birth anniversary of Dr.
Under this, there will be separate programmes on Gram-Development, Poor-Welfare and Social Justice across India.
I urge you all to take part in this campaign in a big way.
My dear countrymen, in the next few days, several festivals are going to be held in Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi
The day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavira is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance
The life of the messenger of non-violence Lord Mahavir Ji, the philosophy will inspire all of us
Best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti
As soon as the discussion of Easter comes, the inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus Christ are remembered, who have always given the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion to humanity.
In April, the festival of Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India. In the same days, the twins and satuvines in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and Poila Vaisakh in West Bengal will have a joy and joy.
All these festivals are somehow connected with our fields, shops and granaries. Through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts we receive in the form of yield.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
In the beginning today, the talk of mind starts with a phone call.
We have seen that the sea looks blue but we know from our daily life experiences that there is no colour of water .
Have we ever imagined that the river, the sea, why the water becomes colorful
The same question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India .
When we talk of science then the name of India-Ratna Sir C. V.
One of their dinners is known as Raman Heekt
We celebrate National Science Day on 28th February every year because it is said that on this day he had hosted the event of light scattering for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science
On the one hand there has been a tradition of great mathematicians Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta while on the other hand Sushruta and Charak are our pride in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are the pride of India
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, Hamous Particle Boson was also named.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles happening in the field of science.
Nowadays machines make their own intelligence more smart with self learning.
Can farmers help with crop production
In the past, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had got the opportunity to visit Gujarat, Ahmedabad for the inauguration of the IEF Reate.
Science and Technology are value neutral
They don't have values, themselves
Any machine will do the same thing as we want .
But, it depends on us what we want to do with the machine
Thomas Alva Dison , who invented Light Bulb , failed several times in his experiments
Once he was asked about this, he replied that I have discovered ten thousand ways of not making Light Bulb, that is, Dison has made its failures its own strength.
Incidentally, I am in Auroville, the land of work of Maharshi Arabic today.
As a revolutionary, he challenged British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
Answer searched and guided humanity
The spirit of asking questions repeatedly to know the truth is important
This is the real inspiration behind the scientific dinner
Should not sit comfortably until questions like why, what and how can not be answered
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, During the Crisis time, a lot of messages come to me on these topics of safety and disaster, people keep writing to me something or the other.
From Pune, Shri Rabindra Singh has spoken on the occupational safety in his comment on NarendraModi Mobile App.
He has written that safety standards are not so good on factories and construction sites in our country.
If India has National Safety Day on 4th March, then Prime Minister should talk about safety in his Mann Ki Baat program so that awareness about safety is increased among the people.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, we are unable to achieve it then it becomes difficult to achieve it during disasters.
All of us read the board written on the paths of vigilance and malfunction has come down. Forget a loss, smiles and smiles, do not leave the world so quickly, do not associate yourself with security. No fun, otherwise life will be cheaper.
We can safeguard our lives if we remain cautious, if we follow the requisite rules, but we can also save the society from major accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that a lot of threads are written about safety on the work place but when we look at it, we don't see its observance.
As far as disasters are concerned, India is a country full of diversity in terms of geographical and climate.
This country has suffered many natural and man-made disasters, such as chemical and industrial accidents.
Initiatives like Disaster Friends have also been taken for training of volunteers in floods and cyclone-related districts.
Training and awareness have a very important role
Two-three years ago thousands of people lost their lives every year from Lou Heat Wave.
Subsequently, NMA organised workshops for management of Heat Wave, campaign to create awareness among people.
Everyone's participation showed a good result
Number of deaths due to Lu in 2017 decreased unexpectedly to about 220
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can get security.
I would like to compliment all those who work in such a way that there are innumerable people, social organizations, aware citizens who are engaged in relief and rescue operations within minutes of disaster.
And the number of such anonymous heroes is no less
We have to become a risk conscience society
In our culture, we often talk about values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of values of safety.
We have to make it a part of our life
I mean , what was the arrangement for providing information
Why
Because we are not naturally conscious and therefore we hear after sitting in our ears and aeroplanes but none of us thinks that this information is for me.
We have the same experience in every sphere of life
Let us not imagine that safety is for someone else, if we all become aware of our safety then the spirit of safety also implies.
My dear countrymen, this time the budget emphasized on making villages waste to wealth and waste to energy through biogas under Swachh Bharat.
Initiatives were initiated for this and it was named GBAR-Chan - Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources
The objective of this GBAR-Chan scheme is to clean the villages and generate wealth and energy from them by converting solid waste from animal dung and farm waste into MPST and BI-GAS.
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other organic waste to produce energy , but in India its full potential was not being utilized .
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, we are now moving in this direction
The target is to use cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste and biogas based energy.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to look at dung and waste not just as waste but as a source of income.
Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit rural areas to keep the village clean
Animal health will be better and productivity will increase
Biogas will increase self-sufficiency in energy for cooking and lighting
Farmers and Animal Husbandry will help in increasing income
New job opportunities will be available for waste collection, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
A online trading platform will also be created for smooth provision of Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect the farmers with the buyers so that the farmers get the right price for dung and agriculture waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially my sisters living in rural India, to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating self help groups and cooperative societies.
I invite you to become partners in this movement of Clean Energy and Green jobs in your village to change waste to wealth and make dung-dhan with cow dung.
My dear countrymen, till date we have been listening to several kinds of festivals such as music festivals, food festivals, film festivals etc.
But in a unique effort in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the state's first waste festival was organized.
The objective behind this festival organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about cleanliness and creating awareness about various ways of re-use of garbage.
During this festival there was a variety of activity in which everyone from students to adults joined.
Different types of artifacts were made using waste .
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of Waste Management
Inspired by Raipur, different kinds of garbage festivals were also held in other districts.
Everyone initiated their own initiatives and shared their innovative ideas, discussions and poetry about cleanliness.
Cleanliness has created a festive atmosphere
Especially the way schoolchildren took part in it, it was amazing
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which the importance of waste management and sanitation was displayed in this festival.
International Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March every year
There are many programmes in the country and the world
Women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the past are also felicitated with the Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country on this day.
On this occasion, I recall the words of Swami Vivekananda
He had said that the idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence - this idea of Swami ji a hundred and fifty years ago expresses the thought of women power in Indian culture.
It is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life. It is our responsibility.
We are part of that tradition where men were identified by women, Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-son, this was the identity of a son.
He has not only advanced himself but has also carried forward the country and society and has taken it to a new level.
In the past , a very good suggestion was given to me by a giant
He had suggested that on 8th March, there are similar programmes to celebrate Women's Day. Do every village and city that has completed 100 years
Can a programme of respect for such mothers and sisters be organized and a long life can be talked about in it
These women have set a new paradigm by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days under the campaign which began on 26th January, 2018.
It includes about 1 lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water bodies, 10 thousand women swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women raj Mistry
You can imagine how big the event is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has such a power that will effectively transform the cleanliness drive in normal life and the rituals of sanitation into the habit of the common man.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in the news that electricity has reached the three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence.
You all know very well, Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai.
I was surprised to know that despite being a huge tourist destination in Mumbai, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years of independence.
For 70 years, three villages of Elephanta Island, Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sentbandar, the dark shadow that was there in the lives of the people, are now dark and their lives have become illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there
I am glad that now Elephanta village and Elephanta caves will be lighted by electricity
This is not just electricity, but a new beginning in the era of development.
What can be the moment of satisfaction and happiness if the lives of the countrymen are illuminated, happiness in their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, We just celebrated the Shivratri festival.
Now the month of March is the farm decorated with flammable crops, golden balls of wheat and adornment of mangoes that entice the mind - this is the specialty of this month.
But this month is also very dear to all of us for the festival of Holi .
On March 2, the entire country will celebrate Holi with joy
The importance of Holi is as important as Holika combustion , because this day is the day of burning evils in fire and destroying them .
Holi is an auspicious occasion to be a participant in each others happiness and happiness by forgetting all the differences and differences. And love gives a message of unity and brotherhood
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the auspicious occasion of Holi.
This festival is full of colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen - this is the best wishes
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
My dear countrymen, today, Shri Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter on NarendraModiApp and has urged me to touch the topics written in his letter.
He has written, the date of the virtue of Kalpana Chawla, which is going to space on February 1.
She left us in the Columbia spacecraft accident , but inspired millions of young people all over the world .
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji that he has started the farewell of Kalpana Chawla in his long letter.
It is a sad fact that we lost Kalpana Chawla ji at such a young age but he gave a message to thousands of girls from all over the world, especially India, that there is no limit to women power.
It is impossible if there is desire and determination, if there is a responsibility to do something
It is heartening to see that today women in India are moving fast in every field and taking pride in the country.
Since ancient times, the respect of women in our country, their place in the society and their contribution has been astounding to the whole world.
Indian scientists have a long tradition
Many of Indias scholars have contributed to the building of the Vedas
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi do not know many names
This represents the importance of women in our society .
And then, in our society, women have been given the status of power
This woman power binds the entire nation, the entire society, the family, the unity of the country.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given several further examples
He has written that our brave defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman's fighter aircraft will fly in Sukhoi 30, inspire them
Three brave women have been trained at Sant Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avni Chaturvedi Higher Pilots.
Abilities Vajpayee-led All Women Rue, from Delhi to America, San Francisco and back to Delhi, Air India.
India Boeing flew to Jet - and all the women
Honble President of India initiated a new initiative in the past
President of India meets a group of exceptional women who have done the first thing in their respective fields
These women achievers of the country, First Lady Emale Merchant Navy Aptain, First Lady Train River, First Lady Vir Vir Virender, First Lady Bus River, first lady to reach Antarctica, First lady to reach Everest. In this way, First Ladies and Gentlemen in every field have achieved extraordinary achievements by breaking the conservatives of the society.
He showed that a new path can be created by crossing all obstacles and obstacles through hard work, passion and determination.
A book has also been prepared on these women achievers, First Ladies so that the entire country can take inspiration from their lives and their work.
This is also available on NarendraModi website as e-book.
Today, the women power of the country plays an important role in the positive transformation in the country and society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment, you must be wondering what is the connection between this.
Mumbai ' s Matunga station is the first such station in India where all women employees are there .
All the departments include women sta - be it Commercial Department, Railway Police, Ticket Hecking, Announcing, Point Person, more than 40 women have a stature.
This time many people wrote on Twitter after watching the Republic Day Parade and on the other social media that one of the key points of the parade was the BSF Biker Contingent in which all women were participating.
He was using courageous experiments and this scene was also surprised by the guests coming from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance
Today, our women power is leading
Being self-reliant
When the tribal women are remembered, a definite picture emerges in the minds of all the women who are carrying the burden of wood on them with forests and footprints.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women power has created a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected region
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols - Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere of this
Tribal women in such dangerous areas are becoming self-reliant by running - Rickshaw
In a very short span of time many women have joined it .
I also appreciate the district administration here, from providing grants to training, the district administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
Leave the time-bound, accept the correction of what is necessary
Any life-society is identified by its self-reacting mechanism.
Over the centuries against social evils and evils, our country has been continuously striving at individual and social levels.
Just a few days ago Bihar took an interesting initiative
Human Chain, the worlds longest human chain of more than 13,000 kilometers, was created to eradicate social evils in the state.
This campaign made people aware about evils like child marriage and dowry
The entire state resolved to fight against evils like dowry and child marriage
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and enthusiastic youngsters, mothers and sisters were all involved in this war.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, the human chain went unbreakable to the borders of the State
Our society must be free from these evils so that all the people of the society can truly benefit from development.
Let us collectively take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and take a new dimension.
Make India a strong and capable India
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the State, the administration there and every person involved in the human chain that he has taken such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan from MyGov, Mysore, Karnataka has written on MyGov that the cost of medicines used to be Rs.
He did not know about the first Pradhan Mantri Janaushadhi Pariyojana
But now when they got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they purchased medicines from there, their cost of medicines decreased by 75 percent.
He has expressed his desire to talk about it in a programme of mind so that more and more people can know about it and take advantage of it.
For the past few years, many people used to write and tell me about this.
Get a deep satisfaction
And I was also pleased to know that Shriman Darshan ji came to know that he had got the idea that he would meet others too.
The objective behind this scheme is to make Health Care affordable and encourage Case of Living
Medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50-90 with branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps the common man, particularly the senior citizens who take medicines every day, a lot of savings.
The generic medicines purchased are based on the standards set for World Health Organisation .
That ' s why good quality medicines get cheaper
More than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country today
This is not only providing affordable medicines but also generating new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Amrit stores of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Hospitals
The only purpose behind all this is to provide quality and affordable health services to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh from Maharashtra shared a Photo on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That Photo was such that my attention was drawn to that Photo
The photo was such that a grandson was participating in the Clean Morna River Cleanliness Campaign with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised a cleanliness drive to clean the Morana river under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Morana river flows for the first twelve months but now it's seasonal
The second pain is that the river was completely filled with wild grass, hydrocarbon
A lot of waste was being thrown at the river and its edge
A action plan was prepared and on 13th January a day before Makar Sankranti, under the first phase of Mission Lean Morna, two edges of Morana river were cleaned at fourteen places in the area of four kilometers.
In this noble work of Mission Lean Morna, more than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, colleges, students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters, everyone participated in it.
The Swachhta Abhiyan was continued in the same way on 20th January, 2018 and I have been told that this campaign will run every Saturday morning till the Morana river is completely cleaned.
This shows that nothing is impossible if a person decides to do something .
Major changes can be brought about through Jan Andolan
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and municipal administration for making this work a mass movement and I congratulate all the citizens and your efforts and your efforts will also inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot about Padma Awards these days.
Even in newspapers, this topic attracts attention to TV.
Every year there has been a tradition of awarding Padma Awards but in the last three years its entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone
Transparency has come due to the entire process being online.
In a way, the selection process of these awards has been fully transformed.
Padma Awards have been given to such people who are not usually seen in big cities, newspapers, TVs or festivals.
Now the importance of his work is increasing, not the identity of the person for the award
You must have heard that Mr. Arvind Gupta ji will be happy to know about it.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent his entire life in making toys for children.
They have been making toys from waste for four decades to increase the curiosity of science in children .
They are trying to inspire children from useless things to scientific experiments, so they are motivating children by showing films made in 18 languages in three thousand schools across the country.
What a wonderful life, what a wonderful dedication
Similar story is the story of Karnataka's Sitava Joddi (SCI).
They have not been called the goddess of women-empowerment.
For the last three decades , in Belagavi , he has contributed greatly in changing the lives of countless women .
He had dedicated himself as Devdasi at the age of seven but then spent his entire life for the welfare of Devadasis .
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family and tribal family.
He used to do normal jobs for livelihood but he was fond of making traditional tribal paintings.
Today, due to this hobby, they are respected not only in India but in the whole world.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji who illuminated Indias name abroad was recognized and awarded the Padma Shri award
You will be pleasantly surprised to hear the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutty
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in the tribal area between dense forests.
He created five hundred herbal medicines on his memory
They have expertise in manufacturing medicines to be used after snake bite .
Lakshmi Ji is continuously serving the society with her knowledge of herbal medicines.
He was awarded the Padma Shri for his contribution to society by recognizing this anonymous personality .
I would like to mention another name today . The 75 - year - old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal was also selected for the award .
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils, vegetables in others' homes to build a hospital
When she was 23 , her husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor .
Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in their hard worked hospital.
I am sure that there are many such males and females in our Bahuratna-Vasundhara whom no one knows, no one knows or knows.
The Padma Puraskar is a medium but I would also like to tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who have been living around us for the society, who have been living around us for the society, who have some specialty and have been working throughout their lives. Sometimes they should be brought into the middle of the society.
They do not work for dignity but their work inspires us.
Sometimes people in schools, colleges should call and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the award, there should be some effort in society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas
This is the 9th of January, when revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from ST ARIA
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between India and Indians living around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we had organized a programme where all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin residing around the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that in that programme Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Diji, Tania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America, wherever our mayor is there, Indians, where MPs are original Indians, all of them participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are not only serving those countries, but also maintaining strong relations with India. This time the European Union, the European Union has sent me a calendar in which they have shown their contributions in various fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Somebody is dedicated to Ayurveda, somebody brings in the minds of the society through his music and somebody is dedicated to his poems.
Someone is doing research on climate change. Someone is working on Indian texts. Someone has set up a gurudwara by driving a truck and someone has built a mosque.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for recognising the people of Indian origin and for providing information to people around the world through them.
On 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu who has shown us a new path.
On that day we celebrate martyrdom day, we pay tributes at 11 o'clock to the great martyrs who laid down their lives in the defense of the country.
The path of peace and non-violence, this is the path of Bapu
Whether it is India or the world, be it individuals or be it family or be it the ideals with which Bapu Ji lived, the words that Bapu had told us are still extremely relevant.
They weren ' t just blank principles
At present, we see on Dagar-Dagar how right Bapu's things were
If we resolve to follow the path of Bapu - as much as we can, what can be a big tribute to him
My dear countrymen, I conclude by congratulating you all for 2018.
Where the youth of the age group of 18-25 years should churn on a New India by working together, find ways and plans
How can we prove our resolutions before 2022
How can we build an India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
B.
a.
I talked to them, there was no mention of disappointment, there was excitement, enthusiasm, energy, dreams and resolutions. The time I spent with those daughters, I also got inspiration and these are the strengths of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country, not only of our country but whenever there is talk of the famous religious places of the world then it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple in Kerala.
And especially at the place which is situated between hills and forests, how can this problem be transformed into rituals, how can we find a way out of the problem and what is the strength in public participation - this is an example of Sabarimala temple.
Who will make such rules
Perhaps, there will be a citizen of India who does not respect them, who does not respect them.
At that age we are bigger than all of us, and at different stages of the country, they are witnesses.
She is getting 90 on September 28
Before my departure abroad, I had the privilege of talking to Didi on the phone.
These conversations were similar, like, in a very long way, younger brother, he talks to his elder sister.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam
I am speaking Narendra Modi
Modi ji: So before I thought, Hilata ji: Hamodi ji: My best wishes to you on birthday, let me congratulate you on advance
Lata ji: There are many people bigger than the age but it is a big thing to get the blessings of something bigger than your work.
Lata ji: Yes, I think my parents have blessings, and the blessings of those who listen.
I'm nothing
Modi ji: Yes, this is your humility, this is a great education for all of us, it is an inspiration for us that you have always given priority to the values and humility of your parents even after you have done so much in your life.
Lata ji: ji
Modi ji: And whenever I come to you ji: Ji Modi ji: You have fed me some or the other Gujarati
Lata ji: You do not know yourself what you are
I know that your visit is changing the picture of India and that is what makes me happy.
That sounds nice
Modi ji: Just continue to be your blessings, your blessings will remain on the whole country. And you have always inspired me to continue doing something or the other.
I also get your letter and I get some of your gifts and gifts. I have a special pleasure in your adoption.
Lata ji: Yes,
No, I don't want to hurt you too much, because, I'm seeing, I know how busy you are and how much work you do.
What do you have to think
When you visited your mother to touch her feet, I also sent someone to seek their blessings and blessings.
Modi ji: Yes
My mother remembered and she was telling me
Lata ji: And she blessed me on the telephone, so I was very happy Modi ji: Our mother was very happy because of your love.
And once again I convey my best wishes to you on your birthday.
Modi ji: When Mumbai came this time, he used to think that Rubru would come to Julata ji: Yes, yes
Lata ji: Yes, surely, surely
This is my fortune .
Modi ji: Pranam, Didi
Lata ji: Pranam
Modi ji: My best wishes to you ji: Very greetings
Modi ji: Pranam ji
Further, for several weeks, across the country, festivals will be thrilling
My best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
In festivals, all family members will come together
Perhaps, these sayings aren't just words, we have an order, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Just imagine, on the one hand, some houses shine with light, on the other hand, in front of them, in the houses of some people around them, there is darkness.
In some houses, sweets are getting worse, so in some houses, children crave sweets.
The real pleasure of these festivals is only when the darkness is sixth, the darkness is low - light spread
We, there too, share happiness, where there is lack, and this is also our nature.
Think about a moment, a delivery out in our homes, of sweets, of clothing, of gits, when delivery is in.
At least in our homes, which is in excess, which we don't work now, we must deliver out such things.
In many cities, start-ups of several NGOs and young colleagues do this thing.
They collect clothes, sweets, food, everything from the houses of the people, search for the needy, reach them and perform an anonymous activity.
Can this time, in this season of festivals, with full awareness and determination, eradicate darkness under this lamp
Your smiles on the faces of many poor families will double your happiness, your face, your face will shine, your light will become bright and your Diwali will become brighter.
My dear brothers and sisters, in Deepawali, in the form of good fortune and prosperity, Lakshmi's house comes home.
In our culture, daughters have been considered as Lakshmi because daughter brings good fortune and prosperity
Can we do this programme of honoring this Lakshmi of India on this Diwali
There will be many daughters around us, many of them who will be doing extraordinary work.
If someone is working for the education of poor children, someone will be involved in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health then someone will be serving the society as a doctor, engineer.
By becoming a lawyer, he will try to bring justice to someone.
Our society should identify such daughters, respect them and take pride in them.
Their respect programmes should be held across the country
Can do one more thing, about the achievements of these daughters, share as much in social media, and use bharatkilami (Lakshmi of India)
Just like we had run a grand campaign together, Selfie with Daughter and it had spread all over the world.
Similarly, this time, let us run the campaign, Lakshmi of India
Promotion of India's Lakshmi means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen
My dear countrymen, I had said Mann Ki Baat earlier too. It is a great advantage that I get the good fortune of communicating directly and indirectly with many unknown people.
In the past, a student from far flung areas of Arunachal has sent me a big interesting letter to Alina Tayang.
And it has been written, I read the letter before you. Hon'ble Prime Minister, my name is Alina Tyang
I'm from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh
This time when my exam's results came, some people asked me if you read the Fam Warriors book
I told you, I haven't read this book
But, going back, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times
After that my experience was very good .
I thought, if I had read this book before Leam, I would have benefited a lot.
I liked many aspects from this book, but I also saw that there are many mantras for students but there is nothing more in this book for parents and teachers.
My little student friend, first, thank you for writing the letter.
Fam Warriors read 2-3 times, thank you
What you have said that if I get out during the new edition then I will definitely try to write some things for the parents and teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to tell me your experiences, suggest your suggestions and suggestions on the aspects related to stress free exams.
I ' m going to study it .
I will think about it and I will try to write whatever I feel right out of it in my own words, in my own way, and maybe if your suggestions come more then my new ideas will also be confirmed.
So I ' m going to wait for your ideas
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend, student Alina Tayang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you are also aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of India through newspapers and TV.
But, you know, I'm a common man like you.
Had someone else on this occasion, he would have been sad and disappointed, but, not his face, but he, with his words, smiled on everyone's faces.
In his humility, simplicity and trough sense, everybody was convinced that the form of sportsman spirit was observed in letter and spirit.
The audience there warmly welcomed his words
Even after the defeat in a tough fight , he praised his rival Nadal and gave the living evidence of the sportsman spirit .
On the other hand, however, Champion Nadal also highly appreciated the game of Wanifil.
The passion of the loser in the same match and the humility of the winner was both worth seeing .
The thinking of our ancestors is truly vital .
Mani Kanchan coincidence: Janjati Loksya Lochan Anandamayani, when a person involves qualifications and humility together, then who can not win his heart
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of people around the world
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, what I am going to talk about, I am doing it straightforward for your good.
it ' s very hard to stop afterwards .
But, if we initially wake up and stop him, a lot can be saved
With this feeling, I feel like, today, especially with my youth, I must talk about something.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health, and it becomes very difficult to quit addiction.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure increases to people who consume tobacco.
Everyone says so .
Tobacco intoxication is due to nicotine present in it .
By its consumption in adolescence development of brain is also affected .
But, today, I want to talk to you, on a new topic
You would be aware that recently there has been a ban on e-cigarette in India.
E-cigarette is a kind of electronic device different from the normal cigarette.
While we understand the dangers of common cigarettes very well, a misconception about e-cigarette has been created.
There is no threat to e-cigarettes.
Their effort is that no member of the family should smoke or smoke.
They know that smoking, tobacco causes heavy damage to the body.
The drinker also knows and the seer also knows .
But the case of e-cigarette is very different.
There is not so much awareness among the people about e-cigarettes.
They are also totally unaware of its danger and for this reason sometimes e-cigarette secretly enters the house in curiosity.
Our youth walks on the path of waste unknowingly
In fact, many harmful chemicals are mixed in e-cigarettes, which have a bad effect on health.
You know, when someone smokes around us, we know it from the smell.
In such a scenario, many adolescents and youngsters are very proud to be wandering in the midst of their books, in their offices, in their pockets, in their own hands and sometimes they become victims of it.
The younger generation is the future of the country
e-cigarette has been banned so that this new method of intoxication does not destroy our young country.
Do not trample the dreams of every family, the lives of children will not be wasted
Do not accumulate these diseases, these habits in the society
I urge you all to abandon the addiction of tobacco and do not make any misunderstandings regarding e-cigarette.
Let us together build a healthy India
You have an IT ID.
Remember India then
India means a little here that if we go to gym for two hours in the morning and evening then it will happen.
This is our Mother India, this is our country, a multi-storey Vasundhara
Many human gems have emerged from this earth
India has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, has been a land of action.
And these are the people who have spent their lives for themselves, not for themselves, for others.
Similarly, a great Vibhuti is being honored in Vatican City on October 13
It is a matter of pride for every Indian, that Pope Francis will declare Mary Thresia as a saint on October 13
The work done by Sister Mary Thresia for the betterment of humanity in the short life of 50 years is an example for the whole world.
He had a wonderful attachment to social service and education.
He built several schools, hostels and orphanages, and lived in this mission for life.
I once again pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters, for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world. Today, when we celebrate Gandhi 150, along with it, 130 crore countrymen have pledged to be free from Single Sea plastic.
Today, the vision of all the countries is towards India by looking at the kind of lead India has taken in the direction of environmental protection.
I am confident that all of you will be going to be part of the campaign to liberate Single Sea Plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing in this campaign in their own way.
But, a young man from our own country has launched a very unique campaign.
When I noticed his work, I talked to him on the phone and tried to understand his new experiment.
Perhaps these things could help the people of the country.
Mr. Rippudman Belvi ji is making a unique effort they plogging
When I first heard the word plogging, it was new to me too.
In foreign countries , perhaps , these words have been used in some quantities .
But, in India, Ripudman Belvi ji has propagated this thing very much.
Let ' s talk to them
Friends, This time, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports has also taken up the issue of ITI.
On 2nd October, these programmes will be organized across the country for 2 kilometres of plogging.
We have heard from the experience of Ripudman ji that how this programme should be done, what happens in the programme.
With this , We shall not only take care of ourselves , but also protect our mother ' s health .
This campaign is creating awareness among the people about cleanliness as well as cleanliness.
I am confident that if 130 crore countrymen take one step in this direction then India will move 130 crore steps forward towards becoming free of single use plastic.
Ripudman ji, once again, thank you very much
And I congratulate you, your team, and for this new imagination.
Want to move forward to transform your life into a nation
One thing you want to remember in advance
However, in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will surely say it in detail but today I am asking you in advance so that you get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
So you start preparing right now .
I will definitely talk about it in detail but now it is time, some people can start practise and some can plan.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 you will go to 15 places in India.
Make a night, two-night stay programme at least 15 places and that too.
You see, understand, experience India
How many diversities do we have
And when they come on holidays in the festival of Diwali, people go there and therefore I would urge you to visit any 15 such places in India.
Today our rank is thirty-four and five years ago our rank was at the 65th position i. e.
If we try more then by the time we will complete 75 years of independence, we will make our place in the world's premier places of tourism.
You must also see that in the days of Diwali firecrackers and firecrackers, there will be no loss of any person.
Whatever objection should be taken for this, you must take precautions
Let's go
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Can you imagine how hard he had worked for the constitution of his country full of diversity
The Konkan coastline, where the ocean played an important role, under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj, many forts like Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Golden Fort etc. were either situated on the beaches or were surrounded by the sea. The Maratha Navy was responsible for the safety of these forts. The combination of large ships and small boats in Maratha Navy was extremely efficient in attacking and protecting any enemies.
Thinking that there will be no soil, neither trees nor plants will grow, where will human life be possible
Where will the organism be possible
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific methods that Earth and Mother cause serious damage to the use of more urea than required. The farmer is the son of the earth, how can a farmer see the mother Earth sick
The need of the hour is whether our farmers, the sons of our soil can make a solemn pledge to revive the relationship of this mother-son once again whether they will stop using the amount of urea they use today in their fields by 2022 when it will be 75 years of independence.
North-Indians will not know what is in South-India
The person of West-India will not know what is in East-India
Our country is full of diversities. Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, if you look at him then it is a matter of fact that when he misled India, he got a new inspiration to see and die for him. All these great men travelled to India, they tried to know and understand India at the beginning of their work. Did we try to live in ourselves, to understand India, to different states of our country, to different societies, to different communities, to their customs, to their traditions, their custodians, their food habits and their beliefs as a student
Can you keep Incredible India (hash tag incredibleindia) on
You see, if all the people of a state will say this thing then I will ask the government to scrutinize it and prepare the publicity collaboration on the seven things that have come from every state. In a way, how should the tourist destination be promoted with the intentions of the people
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand when news of violence comes from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to worry.
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the country of Sardar Patel who gave his life for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have accepted public life, values, non-violence and respect.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: We have been listening since childhood, have said
I want to assure the countrymen that those who take the law, those who suppress the path of violence, be it individuals or groups, neither these countries will tolerate nor will any government tolerate it.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living and dressing.
We see diversity in every behaviour of life
Even our festivals are full of diversity and we can see cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events because of our cultural heritage thousands of years old.
Now you must have seen that all our festivals go according to the leaflet during nature.
There is a direct relation with nature .
Many of our festivals are directly linked to the farmers and are associated with the fishermen.
Today I am talking about festivals . First of all , I would like to call you all ugly ducks .
Celebration of Sanvatsari was celebrated in Jain society yesterday
In Jain society , festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra .
On the last day of the festival festival , the festival is celebrated .
It ' s really a wonderful tradition in itself .
The festival of Samvatsari symbolizes forgiveness, non-violence and friendship
In a way it is also called the festival of forgiveness and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other a miracle dukkadam.
Anyway , in our scriptures , forgiveness is a blessing of the heroes .
Forgiving is a hero
And Mahatma Gandhi always used to say that forgiveness is the characteristic of a powerful person.
Shakespeare wrote in his drama The Merchant of Fenice the significance of forgiveness, Mercy is two blessed, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes the meaning of forgiveness and who has been forgiven both get the blessings of God
My dear countrymen, these days Ganesh Chaturthi is spread in every corner of India and when it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi then it is natural to talk about the public Ganesh Festival.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and he had become a symbol of freedom movement before 125 years of independence.
And after independence, they have become symbols of social education, social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasts for 10 days
This great festival is called the symbol of unity, equality and purity.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Ganeshotsav
Currently the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala
One of Indias colourful festivals, Onam is a major festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala
This festival gives a message of love and harmony in the society as well as a new zeal, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people.
And now our festivals are also becoming a cause of attraction for tourism.
And I would like to tell my countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or the festival of Durga in Bengal, in a way, has become an attraction for tourism.
Our festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
What can we do in that direction, we should think
A few days later, the festival of Eid-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country in the series of these festivals.
Many congratulations and best wishes to all the countrymen on Eid-ul-uha.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and belief for us but we also have to make festivals a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
Festivals and sanitation are associated with family life
Preparation of the festival means cleanliness
This is not something new for us , but it is also necessary to create a social nature .
The urge for public sanitation should not only be at home but should also become an integral part of cleanliness in our entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of being modern are changing.
These days, a new dimension, a new parameter, how ritualistic you are, how modern you are, how modern your thought-processing is, a scale has started to work in knowing all this and how conscious you are towards environment.
In your own activities, eco-friendly, environment-friendly behaviour is against that.
In society , if it is against it , it is considered bad today .
And today I see the result of this thing that in this festival of Ganeshotsav, eco-friendly Ganapati, as if a big campaign has been started.
If you go to YouTube and see that in every household the children are making Ganesh ji, they are making Ganesh ji by bringing the soil.
Likewise, every family is being used
See how big a change has taken place and this is a pleasant change
And as I said, our country is full of crores of stunning minds.
Three years ago when Swachhata campaign was launched, it will take three years on 2nd October.
And, her positive results are visible
Coverage of toilets has reached about 67 from 39.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation.
In the past, there was a severe flood in Gujarat
A lot of people lost their lives but when the water was reduced after the flood, so much dirt was lost everywhere.
At such a time, the workers of Jamiat UlemayHind, at Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat, cleaned 22 flood affected temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
Shed the sweat of herself, all went out
Excellent example of unity for cleanliness, such an example that inspires everyone, was given by all workers of Jamiat UlemayiHind.
Efforts made with dedication towards cleanliness, if this becomes our permanent nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I call upon all of you that once again 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, just like Swachhta Hi Seva had said, let us run a campaign for 'Swachhta Hi Seva'.
Create an atmosphere for cleanliness across the country
As we get the opportunity, wherever we get the opportunity, we find opportunities.
But let ' s all join
Assume this as the preparation of Diwali, assume it is the preparation of Navratri, assume the preparation of Durga Puja
My friends of social media can run some constructive campaigns and can inspire Virtual World to work on the ground.
Swachh Sankalp Se Swachh Siddhi Contest, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation organises this campaign in which you are contesting essay, short film making competition, painting competition
You can write essays in different languages and there is no age limit in it, no age limit.
You can make short films, make it from your mobile
Can make a 2-3-minute film that inspires cleanliness
She can be in any language, she can be silent.
You see how this 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti will shine
You can imagine how a sacred joy would be within us to pay homage to revered Bapu when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October after this 15-day cleanliness drive.
My dear countrymen, I want to accept the loan of all of you in a special way today.
I want to express my gratitude to you from the depths of my heart and not because you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for so long, I want to express my gratitude because millions of people are associated with this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
The number of listeners is in crores but millions of people sometimes write to me, sometimes give me me message, sometimes the message comes on the phone, I have a huge treasure.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I ' m more waiting for your message than you ' re waiting for .
I ' m tempted because everything of you gets me to learn
You might also think yes, man, you've ever made such a mistake
Sometimes some things become a part of our habit that we don't think we're wrong.
Prime Minister, I am speaking Aparna from Poona
I want to tell you about one of my friends
She always tries to help people , but I ' m surprised to see one of her habits
I once went to the shopping mall with him
He spent two thousand rupees in a sari comfortably and Rs. 450 on pizza, while the auto that he had taken to go to the mall was bargaining for five rupees from that auto driver for a long time.
Buy vegetables on the way back and save 4-5 rupees by bargaining on every vegetable
I feel very bad
You must tell your mind about this .
Now after listening to these phone calls, I am sure you would have been shocked, alerted and maybe you would have decided not to make such a mistake in the future.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell a luggage around our house, a ferry person comes to us, we come in contact with a small shopkeeper or seller of vegetables, sometimes we come in contact with an auto rickshaw driver. Whenever we come in contact with a hardworking person, we start negotiating with him, we start negotiating with him.
And if we go to a big restaurant to eat food then we don't even see what is written in the bill.
Not only this, they should buy saris in the showroom, they dont make any purchases but if they come to their kinship with a poor person then they dont live without bargaining.
Have you ever thought of what would happen to the poor mind
Two rupees five doesn't make any difference in your life, but what kind of a small habit of yours will make her feel deeply shocked
Madam, I am grateful to you for giving me a message by calling this heart-touching phone.
I am sure that even my countrymen will be treated like this to the poor , so they will surely give up .
My dear young friends, on 29th August the entire nation celebrates as National Sports Day
This is the birthday of the great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to Hockey was incomparable .
I am reminded that I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports.
Games become part of our lives
If we are young countries of the world , we should also look at this young playground .
Sports i.e. physical fitness, mental alertness, personality enhancement I understand what more is required
In a way sports is a very big herb of heart beat .
The younger generation of our country came forward in the field of sports and today in the era of computer, I would like to warn that playing field is more important than play-station.
Play A , but even in the field outside , sometimes perform a trick with Hootball .
Cricket plays on the computer but the joy of playing cricket under the sky in the open ground is something else.
There was a time when the kids of the family went out and the mother asked first when you would come back .
Today the condition is that as soon as the children come home they either get to see the cartoon ilm or get stuck on the mobile game and then they scream at the mother and tell her when you will go out.
It is a matter of great pleasure for our youth that IAF Under 17 World Cup is going to be held in India from 6th to 28th October.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home
Let us welcome our young guests coming from all over the world with the festival of sports, enjoy sports and create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I want to share a very touching incident with the countrymen last week.
I had the opportunity to meet some young daughters and some of them were born in the Himalayas .
Will ever spend 40-40 days together in water
Sometimes 30-30 days will be spent in water
With courage among the waves of the sea, these six daughters and this is the first incident in the world.
Who will be Hindustani who does not like our daughters
I salute these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the whole country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the NarendraModi App so that you must read it because in a way this is a story of courage, a story of self-confidence and I will be glad to bring these daughters to you.
My best wishes to these daughters and blessings.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
Birthday of former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji
He was the President , but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life .
He always liked to live as a teacher
I salute them, the great scientist, Albert Einstein, said.
It is the Supreme Court of the Teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge. It is the most important quality of a teacher to enjoy creative emotions and knowledge in your students.
This time , when we celebrate Teachers ' Day , can we all make a resolve together
Can you run a campaign in a mission mode
If we make collective efforts then we will play a major role in the transformation of the nation.
Lets teach to transform with this mantra
Prime Minister of India
My name is Doctor Ananya Awasthi
I am a resident of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of Howard University.
My dear countrymen, the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana financial inclusion has been a matter of discussion not only in India but also in the entire world about the pundits of the economic world.
On August 28, 2014, this campaign was launched with a dream in mind.
The campaign for this Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is taking three years tomorrow on 28th August
30 crore new families have been linked with it, bank accounts have been opened.
This is more than the population of many countries in the world .
Today, I have a very big solution that within three years my poor brothers and sisters sitting at that end of the society have become a part of the country's economy, their habits have changed, they have started coming and going to the bank, they have started saving money, they are feeling the security of the money.
Sometimes money is in hand, they live in a pocket, they live in a house, then they want to spend a lot of money.
If you want to do a good job in the coming days, money will work.
About 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in banks through our poor under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
In a way, this is a poor saving, this is his strength in the days to come.
And with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the accounts of which have been opened have also benefitted from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, a small premium of Rs.
In many families, because of the insurance of one rupee, when a crisis arose on the poor man, the head of the family ended and within a few days he got Rs. 2 lakhs.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Dalits, tribals, women, educated youth, youth who want to do something by standing on their feet, millions of youngsters have got guaranteed money from the banks without any guarantee.
Today is not so much time but I would certainly like to tell the people of Bank that they should upload it on MyGov. in. People will get inspiration from this thing that how a scheme brings transformation in the lives of a person, how it fills new energy, how it fills new faith and how hundreds of examples of this thing have come to me.
I will make every effort to reach you and there is such a motivation that people of Media can take full advantage of it.
They can also inspire new generations by interviewing such people.
The mind of man is such that the rainy season is a very charming period for the mind.
Animals, birds, plants and nature are enjoyed by the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a formidable form, it shows how powerful it is to destroy the water.
Nature gives us life, keeps us alive, but sometimes natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, their terrible nature destroys us.
The changes that are taking place in the changing weather cycle and environment are also being negatively impacted.
Over the last few days, some parts of India, especially Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and parts of Bengal, have faced a natural calamity due to excessive rainfall.
Flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Relief work is being done at a broad level.
My colleagues from the Council of Ministers are also reaching wherever possible.
State governments are also making every effort to help the flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and civil servants are also making every effort to help the people in such a situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, be it the soldiers of the army, the people of the Air Force, the people of NCR or the Paramilitary Forces, everybody gets connected to the service of the disaster victims at such a time.
And 247 Control from helpline number 1078 is continuously working to tackle the flood situation.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government machinery was prepared by mock drill at maximum places before the rainy season.
NDRF teams were installed.
Gradually we also made the nature that if we can create our activities according to the weather forecast, then we can avoid losses.
Whenever I am preparing for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time there have been so many letters about GST, so many phone calls have come up and people still express happiness and curiosity about GST.
I also recite to you a phone call: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard the speech of your Chartered Accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax-GST started in our country on the same date last month.
Can you tell me if the results are coming after a month just as the government had expressed it or not
I'd like to hear your thoughts about it, thank you.
GST has been implemented for nearly a month and its benefits have started to appear.
And I am very happy that when someone poor writes to me a letter and tells me how the prices of things have come down due to GST, how things have become cheaper due to the needs of a poor person.
If a person living in north-east, far-flung mountains and forests writes that initially he was afraid of what he did not know, but now when I started learning and understanding it then I feel that it has become easier than ever before.
Trade became easier.
And the biggest thing is that customers' trust in the trader has started to grow.
I was just watching how GST was implified on transport and logistics sector.
How the movement of trucks has increased now
How the time is decreasing to distance
Highways clutter free.
The pace of trucks has also reduced the pollution.
The luggage is also reaching very soon.
This is not only the facility but also the economic momentum.
Earlier, due to different tax structures, the maximum resources of transport and logistics sector were required to be maintained and they had to create new warehouses within every state.
GST, which I call Good and Simple Tax, has actually created a very positive impact on our economy in a very short time.
The speed at which the smooth transition has taken place, the speed at which the migration has taken place, new registrations have taken place, it has created a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes the pundits of the economy, the pundits of the management and the pundits of technology will definitely write the use of GST in the form of a model before the world.
There will be a case study for many universities of the world.
Because it is a huge height of success in itself to implement it and successfully move forward in such a vast country with such a huge challenge and involvement of crores of people.
The world will definitely study it.
And GST has been implemented, all the states have participation in it and all the states have the responsibility.
All the decisions have been made by the states and the Center together with the consensus.
And as a result of that there was only one priority for every government that there was no burden on the poor plate due to GST.
I heartily congratulate all the Ministries engaged in this work, all the departments, all the central and state governments.
GST is a great example of the success of India's collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but an economy that strengthens the culture of a new integrity.
In a way, there is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again, I salute all my fellow countrymen for making such a massive effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
Instinctively, we have been listening to this since childhood and the reason for this is the beginning of the Non-Cooperation Movement on August 1, 1920.
The uit India Movement commenced on 9th August, 1942, which is known as the August Revolution and the country became independent on 15th August, 1947.
In a way, several incidents in the month of August are particularly associated with the freedom struggle.
But very few people know that this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of the country who were associated with the freedom struggle, struggled and endured. The pages of history are our inspiration for building a grand India.
Our freedom fighters have sacrificed their lives, penance and sacrificed their lives.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for the Indian freedom movement.
This movement had determined the entire country for the freedom from the British.
This was the time when the Indian public opinion against British power had become a part of the uit India Movement in every corner of India, village, city, educated, poor, rich and shoulder-to-shoulder movement.
People's anger was at its peak.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were staging their lives in conflict with the mantra of Do or Die.
Millions of youth in the country had left their studies, had left the books.
Non-cooperation movement and uit India Movement 1920 and 1942 show two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
The form of non-cooperation movement was different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity increased so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of Do or Die.
There was public support, peoples strength, peoples resolve and peoples struggle behind all these successes.
The whole country was fighting together.
And I sometimes think that if we look at the pages of history by adding a little, then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1857.
Starting from 1857, the freedom struggle continued in some corner of the country till 1942.
This long period created the feeling of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was committed to doing something or the other.
Generations changed, but there was no shortage of resolution.
People used to come, join, go, go, come, join and join new ones and the country continued to strive every moment to uproot the British Empire.
With this hard work from 1857 to 1942, this movement created a situation that reached its peak in 1942 and it was such a buzz of quit India that within 5 years the British had to go in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, he reached out to the masses.
And from 1942 to 1947, five years, it became such a peoples mind. With the success of five decisive years of Sankalp se Siddhi, it became the reason for giving freedom to the country.
These were five years of crucial year.
Now I want to connect you with this mathematics.
In 1947 we became free.
Today is 2017.
It's been 70 years.
Governments came and went.
Arrangements were made, changed, flourished, increased.
Everyone has tried their best to make the country free from problems.
Successes also got
Expectations also awakened
Like 1942 to 1947, there was a decisive five years of perfection from resolution.
I see that from 2017 to 2022, a five-year-old segment of accomplishment has emerged before us.
We celebrate 15th August of 2017 as a festival of resolutions and when 75th year of independence in 2022, we will continue to transform that resolution into a reality.
Crores of resolutions.
Attempts should be made to fulfil crores of resolutions.
So, just like 1942 to 1947, five years have become the decisive destiny for the country's independence, these five years can be decisive and decisive for the future of India from 2017 to 2022.
Five years later, the country will celebrate 75 years of independence.
Then all of us have to take a firm resolve today.
2017 is the year of our resolution.
This is the August Mass Resolution that we have to associate with and we have to resolve.
Come, from August 9 this month, run a great campaign of siddhi with resolution.
A resolution that we will prove in the next 5 years.
Young organizations, student organizations, NGOs etc. can organize collective discussions.
You can expose new ideas.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
As a person, what can I contribute to it
Let us join the festival of this resolution.
Using technology, videos, posts, blogs, articles, new ideas have come up with all these things.
Convert this campaign into a mass movement.
This ui is an effort to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must spread and propagate it.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Servant of the country, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort.
I am only a person who doesn't speak there.
The voice of 1. 25 billion Indians from the Red Fort resonates.
I am glad that every corner of the country has suggested that what should I say on August 15, which issues should be taken for the last 3 years.
This time also I invite you to send me your thoughts on MyGov either NarendraModiApp.
I myself read it and I will try to reveal it in whatever time I have on August 15.
In my speeches on August 15 last 3, I have received a complaint that my speech becomes a bit longer.
I have tried to make rules for me in 40-45-50 minutes.
I don't know if I can do it or not.
But I intend to try this time to minimize my speech .
See whether success is achieved or not.
I would like to say another thing today, my countrymen.
There is a social economics in India's economy.
And we should never underestimate that.
Our festivals, our festivals, these are not just occasions of joy and prosperity.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign of social reform.
And a natural joy is also added to these festivals.
Festivals bring sweetness in relationships, affection in family, brotherhood in society.
Individuals and society connect.
A simple journey from person to person runs.
There is an opportunity to go from ego to vaim.
As far as the economy is concerned, hundreds of families start making Rakhia in small domestic industries from several months before Rakhi.
From khadi to silk threads, nobody knows how many rakhis and nowadays people like homemade ashes.
The business of Rakhi makers, Rakhiya sellers, sweets, thousands and hundreds of businessmen gets connected with a festival.
Our poor brothers and sisters, this is what our families do.
We light a lamp in Deepawali, it is not just a light festival, it is just a festival, it is not so.
His direct and direct relationship is with those poor families who make small earthen lamps.
But today when I talk about the poor economy associated with festivals and festivals, I would also like to talk about the environment.
I have seen that sometimes I think the countrymen are more conscious than me, they are more active.
For the last one month, citizens conscious of the environment have written me letters.
And he has urged you to tell Ganesh about eco-friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi before time so that people can plan on the choice of soil.
First of all, I am grateful to such conscious citizens.
He has urged me to say this topic before time.
This time public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
25 billion countrymen Lokmanya Tilak ji had started a public Ganeshotsav with the basic spirit of unity and awareness of the society and the values of collectiveness.
Once again, in this year of Ganeshotsav, we should compete essays, discuss meetings and remember the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak.
And this time I said very quickly .
I am sure that all of you will join me and the benefit will be that the poor artisans, the poor artists, those who make sculptures will get employment and the poor will be filled up.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that our daughters are illuminating the name of the country be it education sector, economic sector, social sector or sports.
We are proud of our daughters.
In the past, our daughters performed well in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players daughters this week.
I liked to talk to them but I was feeling that the World Cup could not win, it was a big burden on them.
He had pressure on his face too, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave me a different evaluation.
I said, nowadays, the period of media is such that expectations are increased so much, they are increased so much and when success is not achieved then it also turns into anger.
We have seen many such games that if the players of India fail, then the anger of the country breaks on those players.
Some people break the limits and talk about such things, write such things, there is a lot of pain.
But it was for the first time that when our daughters did not succeed in the World Cup, then 1. 25 billion Indians took that defeat on their shoulders.
Not only this, these daughters praised and glorified what they did.
I see it as a pleasant change and I told these daughters that you people have got such a good fortune that you have not succeeded.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won the hundred and fifty million people.
My dear countrymen, once again I recall the August Revolution, once again on 9th August, and once again on 15th August, I recall the year 2022, 75 years of independence.
Every countryman should make a solemn pledge, every countryman should prepare a 5-year roadmap to fulfil his resolve.
We all have to take the country to new heights, to reach and to reach.
Come, let us go together, let us do something or the other.
The fate of the country will be better and the future will be better with this belief.
Changing weather
This time the heat is also very much
But it ' s good that the rain is moving on your map in time
In many parts of the country , the weather has become pleasant due to Jhajjham rain .
After the rain , cold winds have been experiencing relief from the heat of the past .
And all of us have seen that no matter how difficult it is in life, no matter how tense it is, no matter how hard it is individual life, public life, the advent of rain changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath ji is celebrated with great devotion and joy in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world the festival of Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated .
And the poor of the country is connected with Lord Jagannath ji
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor
And very few people would know that a word in English is juggernaut and that means a grand chariot that no one can stop.
And in the Dictionary Meaning of this juggernaut, it is also found that this word has originated from the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the auspicious occasion of Lord Jagannath ji, I extend my greetings to all my fellow citizens and also bow down to Lord Jagannath ji in his hymns.
Indias diversity is its specialty, its diversity is also the strength of India.
The Holy Month of Ramadan celebrates all away in prayer with purity
Now is the festival of Eid
On this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr, I extend my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is the month of virtue, the month of distributing happiness and the happiness that they share, the happiness increases.
Let us collectively take inspiration from these holy festivals and share the treasures of the joyful people, let us move ahead with the country.
In this holy month of Ramadan , an inspiring incident came to me in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh .
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters reside there in that small village. In a way, a large number of people belong to our Muslim family brothers and sisters.
Inside this Ramzan the villagers decided to build toilets together
And within this individual toilet aid is provided by the government , and the assistance is given to them about Rs 17 lakhs .
Spend 17 lakhs for other facilities in the village
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for turning this holy occasion of Ramzan into a betterment for the society.
We know that there are three such states in our country Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala, which have already been declared Open Defecation Free
This week Uttarakhand and Haryana were also declared .
I express my special gratitude to the administration, governance and people-to-people of these five states for fulfilling this task.
We know very well that if we want to do something good in the life of a person, in the life of a society then we have to work hard.
If our handwriting is bad, if it is to be corrected then efforts have to be made to remain very conscious for a long time.
Then goes the body, the habit of mind changes
The subject of sanitation is similar
Such bad habits have become part of our nature .
Everyone will have to draw attention
Good motivational events have to be remembered again and again
And I am glad that today cleanliness has not been a government programme
It is becoming a movement of the masses and the masses.
And when the people sitting in the government take this task forward with their participation then how much is the strength
In the past, a very good event came to my mind, which I would like to say to you.
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh
The administration there took up a big job in public participation
100 hour non-stop campaign
And what was the goal
Construction of ten thousand household toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in one hundred hours
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the government have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of those villages of Vijayanagaram district that you have set an inspiring example in the culmination of hard work.
Narendra Modi visits App, MyGov. in, come from letters, come on All India Radio.
Shri Prakash Tripathi, while recalling the Emergency, has written that on 25th June he has presented as a black age in the history of democracy.
Prakash Tripathi ji's awareness about democracy is commendable and democracy is not only a system but it is also a ritual.
Awareness of democracy is essential and therefore democracy has to be reminded of the traumatic things and it has to move forward towards the good things of democracy.
June 25, 1975 - it was such a black night that no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted into a prison.
Anti-vowels were dubbed.
Distinguished leaders of the country including Jayaprakash Narayan were imprisoned in prisons.
The judicial system too could not escape the shadow of the terrible form of emergency.
Newspapers were completely wasted.
The lovers of democracy fought a big battle and a country like India, such a vast country, whenever they got the opportunity, they demonstrated that strength through the elections, how democracy exists in the rage of the people of India.
We have to further strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling the pride of doing business in the world today.
21st June, 2017 - The whole world has become Yoga.
People from water to mountains welcomed the rays of the sun in the morning through Yoga.
Who will be Hindustani, who will not be proud of this.
Its not that yoga was not the case before, but today when Yoga is tied to the thread, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Nearly all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
When people practiced Yoga on the Great Fall of China in China, people performed Yoga on World Heritage Site Machu Pichu in Peru at a height of 2400 meters above sea level.
People performed Yoga in the shadow of Eiffel Tower in France.
Programmes were organised at 70 locations in small locations like Singapore and they have launched a week long campaign.
NCC has brought out 10 stamps on International Day of Yoga.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organised at NCC headquarter.
NCC stadium, Diplomats of the world, everyone has participated in it.
Once again Yoga has done the work of world records
Nearly 55 thousand people have made a new world record by doing Yoga in Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time I had the privilege of doing Yoga in the rain
Our soldiers also performed yoga in Siachen where there is minus 20, 25, 40 degrees temperature.
Whether it is TBP, RPI or ISO, everyone has made Yoga their part along with their duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of the family should share their photos while doing Yoga together.
Some TV channels also carried this forward.
Sir, one of my questions is that we had heard you in recently Kerala that we should replace the kind of good boxes we give on the different-divert place as a memento
You had started this thing during your tenure in Gujarat, sir, but now we cannot see this much.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a tradition in the government that we will not give a bouquet, we will give a book or handkerchief.
And the handkerchief of Khadi so that Khadi can be promoted.
As long as I was in Gujarat, we all had become habituated, but after coming here I had lost that habit.
But when he went to Kerala, he once again became aware
And I have just started giving the following information in the government .
We can also gradually create a temperament
And the age of bouquet is very low .
Once taken in hand, then left
But if you give a book, then in a way it becomes a part of the house, it becomes a part of the family.
And when I am saying this thing, how historic is the value of such things
When I went to K last year, Britain's Fueen, Cueen Liabeth invited me to dinner in London.
There was a native atmosphere
He also did a meal with great love, but later he showed me a handkerchief woven with a small khadi and thread in an emotional tone with great respect and shine in his eyes, he said that when I got married, then this handkerchief was sent to me by Mahatma Gandhi as a best wish for marriage.
How many years have passed, but this handkerchief given by Mahatma Gandhi has been kept in mind.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became part of his history.
I believe that these habits do not change overnight and whenever they talk like this, they also have to be victims of criticism.
But in spite of that, we should continue to do such things, we should continue to strive
Now I cannot say that if I go anywhere and if someone comes with a bouquet then I will refuse it and I will not be able to do so.
But still there will be criticism, but continue to talk, then gradually there will be improvement.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister, many kinds of work are being done.
They are immersed in files, but I have developed a habit for me that I read a few letters daily from the letters that come to me and that gives me an opportunity to join the common man.
Various types of letters come, different types of people write letters.
I got the opportunity to read such a letter these days, I think I must tell you.
In a remote south, in Tamil Nadu, a housingvie Arulmozhi Servant of Madurai - he sent me a letter.
And what was the letter, he wrote that if I thought of doing some economic activity in my family, keeping in mind the education of children etc, then the family would get some financial help.
So I started some work in the direction of supplying money from the bank and by bringing some goods from the market.
In such a scenario, I came to know that the Government of India has created a system called Government of India Marketplace.
So I have registrated myself in it. I want to tell the countrymen, if you get the opportunity, then you will get the opportunity.
is a new kind of system .
And then it has to order
So, all the departments of the government are watching the people who registrate within GM.
Because there are no middlemen , things are very cheap .
Now this Arulmozhi Madam has given all the registry of the goods that he can offer on this website of the government.
And the interesting thing is that the letter they have written to me is very interesting.
This is Empowerment
This is the opportunity to promote enterpriseship.
Perhaps Arulmozhi ji had not written to me, I would not have noticed that a housewife is doing a small job far away from the system of GM, its goods can be purchased to the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country
There is a transparency in it, there is an empowerment in it, there is also an enterprise shift in it.
I would like to say that those who want to sell their goods to the government will be more connected to it.
I believe that Minimum Government and Maimum Governance is a great example of this and its goal is Minimum Price and Maimum Ease, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we take pride in Yoga and on the other we can also take pride in our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the Yoga related ground then our dreams are to cross those horizons of far-flung heavens.
In the past, India has shown a lot in sports as well as in science.
Today, India is waving its best not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISR launched 30 Nano satellites with Cartosat-2 Series Satellite.
And these satellites include France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom and nearly 14 such countries.
And this non-satellite campaign of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the field of farming, in the field of natural calamities.
And this is the most weighing heavily satellite of the satellite launched by India so far.
And the newspapers of our country had compared it with the weight of an elephant, so you can imagine how much great work our scientists have done in the field of space.
On June 19 , a thousand days of the Mars Mission were completed .
You would be aware that when we had successfully made a place in Forbit for the Mars Mission, this entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
Having completed a thousand days is an important milestone in our scientific journey, in our space journey.
These days even in sports, we are seeing that the trend of our youth is increasing.
Now it has become clear that along with studies, our younger generations have started showing their future in sports as well. And because of our players, their talents, their achievements, the country's name is also illuminated.
Recently Indian badminton player Kidambi Srikanth won the Indonesia Open and enhanced the value of the country
I heartily congratulate him and his coach for this achievement .
A few days ago, I had got the opportunity to attend the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of Athletics, athlete P. T.
We also bring sports, sportsman spirit as much as we promote sports.
Sports also plays a very important role in the development of personality
The overall personality development has a lot of importance in the game.
There is no shortage of talent in the country
If children are interested in sports even in our family, then they should be given opportunities.
Everyone should dream for the next lympic
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season, the atmosphere of continuous festivals, in a way this period feels new.
I will once again convey my best wishes to all of you at the time of the next Mann Ki Baat.
We will hardly forget the heat of this year.
But the rain is awaiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has begun.
On the advent of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and around the world, especially to the Muslim community, on this holy month.
This is a country that believes in God and those who deny God, those who worship idols and those who oppose idol worship, every kind of ideology, every kind of worship system, every kind of tradition, we have assimilated the art of living together.
And finally, this message gives us the message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramadan will certainly help in furthering this path of peace, unity and goodwill.
I once again convey my best wishes to you all.
I am glad that a lot of people gave me a feedback.
Personally showed me the enthusiasm to tell me myself.
I have not been able to read everything, I have not been able to hear anyone's message, there have been so many things.
However, whatever I have seen from the point of view of Sarasari, someone has tried to learn music, someone is trying to hand over a new instrument, some people are trying to learn new things by using you tube and trying to learn a new language.
Some people are learning cooking, some are learning dance, some are learning drama, some have written that we have started writing poems now.
Knowing nature, living, understanding is trying in that direction.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle India had to struggle for independence, how much sacrifice it had to sacrifice, how many freedom fighters spent years in prisons.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who had achieved a lot at a very young age, so I request you to give some messages to today's generation on this subject.
I am glad that the younger generation is keen to know about our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
I went to Andaman and Nicobar many years ago.
Cellular went to see the jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a maji-born book in jail.
They used to write poems, write on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
What kind of tortures the freedom fighters would have suffered
When I read a book on Savarkar ji's birth, I was inspired to see Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show, it is a big motivation.
There was no such state in India, no one would be speaking the language of India, who would not have lost his youth in the Andaman jail, in this cellular jail due to the punishment of black water for freedom.
Today, the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji is the birth anniversary of every language speaker, every region and every generation.
I would certainly like to tell the country's younger generation that what kind of torture and hardships were faced by the people of the country for the freedom we have got, if we go to the Cellular Jail and see why it was called black water.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connecting with nature means nurturing the better planet.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times that the world that we will not see, it is our duty to worry about it, we should also care about it.
You must be very tired, open the room windows, open the doors, breathe fresh air - a new consciousness comes.
When the Panch Mahabharata is connected to those five great personalities then a new consciousness is manifested in our body and a new energy is manifested.
We all have experienced this thing but we do not register it, we do not add it to a formula.
After that you must see that whenever you come in contact with the natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge in you and therefore, a global campaign to connect with the nature of 5th June should also be our own campaign.
Our ancestors have protected the environment, we are getting some benefit from it.
If we protect, then our future generations will benefit.
In the Vedas, the earth and the environment are considered to be the root of power.
And Atharvaveda is completely, in a way, the biggest guiding text of the environment and it has been written thousands of years ago.
We have been told that Mata Bhoomi: Sono ego isolation:
It has been said in the Vedas that the purity in us is due to our Earth.
Earth is our mother and we are their sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha then one thing is certainly revealed that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his attainment of knowledge and his great Parinirvana was under three trees.
These days I keep getting news from the states.
A massive plantation drive is going on in almost all the states as soon as it rains.
Plants are planted in crores.
Children of schools are also linked, socio-service organizations are associated, NGOs are associated, the government itself takes initiatives.
Let us also promote and contribute to this work of plantation in this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has now become a day to celebrate 21st June for the world.
The whole world celebrates it as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this World Yoga Day on 21st June has failed in every corner and is connecting people.
On the one hand, many forces of scattering are showing their distorted faces in the world, at such a time, India has a huge contribution to the world.
We have added the world to a formula through yoga.
As yoga connects body, mind, intellect and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, it is becoming difficult to lead a stress-free life because of the lifestyle, because of the increasing responsibilities, because of the stress-free life.
And even at a young age, this situation has reached.
The role of yoga is crucial in taking medicines and passing the day, to lead a stress-free life in such a clock.
Yoga is a guarantee of both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through Yoga to experience an interval of health from body, mind, mind, thought, ethics.
Just two days back, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world about Yoga Day.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to yoga and announced some prizes.
Gradually the work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and you have asked me to appeal that this time on the third International Yoga Day, three generations of the same family will do yoga together.
Whether it is grandparents or grandparents, parents or sons or daughters, all the three generations should do yoga together and should upload their pictures.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow, there will be an elegant coincidence that Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that just as we had launched the campaign of selfie with daughter and had a very interesting experience.
The picture of these three generations will definitely awaken the country and the world.
You must send a picture to me at the NarendraModiApp, at the place where three generations perform Yoga on MyGov.
This will be a picture of tomorrow, today and tomorrow, which will be a guarantee tomorrow.
I invite you all.
We have about three weeks to celebrate International Day of Yoga.
You should also spread the subject of Yoga for three weeks continuously, spread it and connect people.
In a way, this is the movement of preventive health care.
I invite all of you to join it.
This phone call will also help you: Pranam Modi ji, I am from Naina Mumbai.
Today, I always see that wherever you go, the people of Modi ji pay special attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your call.
Big and big, children also have awareness about cleanliness.
Many times they have seen the elders spreading dirt on the road, pushing them.
The government machinery does the work of cleaning, but these days there is a celebration of cleanliness in the society too.
Five days before my departure, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are a lot of cleaning programmes.
Media also gives him great priority and just a few days ago I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
Very big cleaning campaign run there.
I didn't even see it by adding it.
But when this phone call came, I started thinking and I saw that this thing is correct.
You can imagine, knowing how pleasant I am and the country is also notifying these things in a very good manner.
I am glad that cleanliness has also been linked to my visit.
The rest of the preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister will be a habit, but cleanliness will be the main thing.
It is enjoyable and inspiring for any hygiene in itself.
I congratulate all those who have emphasized the work of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
Well that's a funny suggestion.
I don't know if I can do this or not.
Modi ji, while deciding your stay, ask whatever migration you ask for, "Brother, if I want to invite you, how will the level of cleanliness be
On the basis of how many tons of waste you will offer me, I will decide my stay.
Dea is very good but I have to think.
How big a humanity will work.
One thing I would certainly like to say that we do not consider this waste as waste, it is wealth, it is a resource.
Do not look at it just as garbage.
Once we start accepting this waste as wealth then several new methods of waste management will come up for us.
With the help of State Governments, the Government of India has decided to launch a massive campaign of waste management with the help of representatives of cities.
Solid waste and liquid waste are going to be available in about 4,000 cities of the country on the occasion of World Environment Day on 5th June.
Two types of dustbins will be available, one of the green colours and the other of the blue color.
Like the waste of kitchen, vegetable peels, balanced meals, peels of eggs, leaves of trees and plants, all these are wet wastes and put them in the green dustbin.
All these things are such that they work in the fields and if you remember the color of the fields then you will remember what to do in the green dustbin.
Today, I have to proudly mention one thing - if a person decides then how big a mass movement can be created.
This is the work of cleanliness.
And the way in which he connected the people of the entire region and transformed them into a mass movement, this is an inspirational example in itself.
In the context of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Reasi Block of Jammu and Kashmir was told that the Reasi Block was open defecation free.
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I was told that the entire movement has been flooded the most - the women of that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He himself took out torch trips to spread awareness and inspired people from homes, streets and streets.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days and months, there has been a continuous accounting of three years of the present government, be it newspapers, TV channels or social media.
I see this process as a very healthy sign.
This 3-year term has been done on every criterion.
The people of every section of the society have analyzed it.
And there is a great process in democracy.
And I clearly believe that governments should be accountable in democracy, people should give account of their work.
I thank all those who took time to discuss our work in depth, appreciate it somewhere, somewhere support came, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere the drawbacks were made, I understand the importance of all these things.
Be it good or less good, be it bad or be it bad, we have to learn from it and we have to move forward with the help of that.
Constructive Criticism strengthens democracy.
This churning is very important for a conscious nation, for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and as a common citizen, the impact of good and bad things on me is the same as on the mind of a common citizen.
Mann Ki Baat sees him as a one-sided dialogue, some people criticise him politically but after such a long experience I feel that whenever I started talking about Mann Ki Baat, I didn't even think about it.
It seems as if I sit in the middle of the family and talk about the house.
And there are hundreds of such families who have sent me by writing these things.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President, the Speaker Madam that he has given this importance to the people sitting in such a senior position by taking time out.
In a way, gave a new dimension to the matter of mind in itself.
When some of our friends were working on this mind book, they had ever discussed with me.
Akbar Saheb had proposed from the front that the topics discussed in Mann Ki Baat would like to prepare a sketch of it through his art and without taking a single rupee, Akbar Saheb gave the form of art to express his love.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, by the time we meet next time, there will have been rains in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have come, the start of a new life will start.
Come, let us all go ahead in love with nature in this environment.
My best wishes to all of you.
Talk of mind, April 2017
s.
What can be a little emphasis on this aspect in the skill development
You can drive the cycle but have you ever tried to run a cycle with a three-wheeler carrying people
Most of the families in every corner of the country will be engaged in the exam of their children.
Those whose exams have ended, there will be some relief mobilization and where the exams will continue, there will still be a little preservation in those families.
But at such a time, I would like to say that the last time I have talked about the things that I have talked to the students, please listen to them again. You will certainly be able to do those things during the examination.
Today is 26th March
March 26 is Bangladesh's Independence Day
A historic battle against injustice, an unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Banga-Bandhu
And I wish that Bangladesh should move forward, develop and I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region by joining hands and shoulders.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories, have a shared heritage.
National Anthem of Bangladesh is also the composition of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913, he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize but also the title of Knighthood by the British.
And when the British slaughtered at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the great men who raised their voices.
The brutal assassination of Jallianwala Bagh gave a new inspiration to that boy laughing and smiling in the field in adolescence.
And in 1919, the 12 year old child Bhagat is our beloved, inspired by all of us - Shaheed Bhagat Singh
Three days before today, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh ji and his companions Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British. And we all know that the incident of 23rd March - the satisfaction of serving Mother India on the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru was not afraid of death.
All the dreams of life had been incorporated for the freedom of mother India.
And these three heroes are still inspired by us
We will not be able to decorate the saga of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
and the entire British kingdom was afraid of these three young men .
The prisoners were locked in jail, the hanging was fixed, but the British were worried about how to move forward with them.
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23
Was stolen, which is not usually done
And later the British had burnt his body quietly by bringing him to today's Punjab.
Several years ago when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I used to feel a kind of vibration in that land.
And I would certainly say to the youth of the country - whenever there is a chance, whenever you go to Punjab, you must go to the place of the mausoleum of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singhs mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the period when the glory of freedom, its intensity, its expansion continued to grow.
On one hand heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for the Armed Revolution.
So just a hundred years ago - April 10, 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi did Champaran Satyagraha
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha
In India's freedom movement, the Gandhian thought and Gandhian style, its manifestation was first seen in Champaran.
This was a turning point in the journey of the entire freedom movement, especially in the way of struggle.
This was the period when the Satyagraha of Champaran, Kheda Satyagraha, the strike of mill-labourers in Ahmedabad and the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's ideas and style of functioning was visible.
Gandhi came back from abroad in 1915 and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country .
Today, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha based on the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Imagine a person who came back to India in 1915, just two years.
Neither the country knew them nor their influence. It was just the beginning.
We can imagine how much hardship they would have suffered at that time.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that Mahatma Gandhi's organisational skills, Mahatma Gandhi's power to know the pulse of Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi's behaviour in front of the British Sultanate shows this wonderful power.
And so the way we feel the vastness of Mahatma Gandhi
But if we think of Gandhiji a hundred years ago, then the Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who started his public life.
We can learn from them how to start public life, how hard we have to work ourselves and how Gandhi had done it.
And that was the time when we hear the names of the big leaders, Gandhi had sent everyone to the villages be it Rajendra Babu or Acharya Kripalani ji.
On the one hand, filling the prison, on the other hand, consuming yourself in constructive work.
A wonderful balance was in Gandhi's work style.
What is the word satyagraha, what can be disagreement, what is non-cooperation in front of such a great sultanate - a whole new Vibhavana Gandhi had established through a successful experiment, not through words.
Today, when we are living in the 21st century, then who will be the Indian who does not want to change India, who will be the Indian who does not want to be a partner for change in the country
India is neither a government programme nor a manifestation of a political party nor a project.
India is the call of 1. 25 billion Indians.
This is the feeling that 1. 25 billion Indians want to make a grand India together.
There are many people who go to hospital everyday, help patients
There are many people, they run for blood donation as soon as they know
There are many people who are hungry and worry about their food.
Our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara
Public service is the service of God, it is in our veins
Once we look at it as a collectivity, organisedly, then how powerful it is
It is very natural to criticize, discuss and look at India from a different perspective. This is essential in democracy.
But it is true that if 1. 25 billion Indians make a solemn pledge, if they make a solemn pledge then the dream of a New India can be proved before our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all these things are done by the budget, by the government project, by the government money.
If every citizen resolves to follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen resolves that I will fulfill my responsibilities with full sincerity, if every citizen resolves that one day in a week I will not use the petrol-disease in my life.
You see, the 125 crore countrymen who are dreaming of a New India will be able to see this country realizing their own eyes.
What is meant to say is that every citizen should obey his citizen's religion, follow his duty
Why shouldn't we engage with Swaraj in this journey of Suraj by disciplining and determining our lives
Let me invite you
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you today.
In the last few months, such an environment has been created in our country and a large number of people have joined the Digital Payments Digital Movement.
Without cash transactions, its curiosity has also increased, the poorest of the poor are also trying to learn and gradually people are moving towards it without cash transactions.
Digital payments have seen a substantial increase since demonetisation ban on bondage.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
25 billion Indians can resolve to do the work of 2. 5 billion digital transactions in this one year
We have announced in the budget
We can do this in everyday life .
You don't imagine, but you can do a great service to the country and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
In the past, several programmes have been organized for public education and for public awareness.
There is a resolve to do 100 programs across the country
80-85 programs have been done
There was also a reward scheme
Nearly 12. 5 lakh people have received this reward from consumers
April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
And as it was decided a long time ago, on 14th April this Digital Mela will be concluded on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
A grand event is going to be held after 100 days .
There is a provision for a very large draw.
Let us contribute to how less cash, how less behaviour of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time, whenever I ask people for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions.
But I have seen that there is always an insistence on cleanliness.
A bitia named Gayatri from Dehradun, who is a 11th student, has sent a message by phone: - Respectable Principal, Prime Minister, my greetings to you
First of all congratulations to you that you have won this election with a lot of votes
I want to talk to you about my mind
I want people to explain how hygiene is essential .
Every day I pass through that river in which people put a lot of waste and contaminate the rivers.
That river comes through the Rispana bridge and also comes to my house .
We went to the towns for this river and took out a rally and talked to the people but it did not benefit.
I want to tell you that this should be highlighted by sending one of your teams or through a newspaper, thank you
Brothers and sisters, What is the pain of a daughter of class 11
How angry he is seeing the garbage in that river
I think it ' s a good sign .
That is why I want to create anger against dirt in the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Once there will be anger, annoyance will arise, there will be anger against him, we will start doing something against dirt.
And it is a good thing that Gayatri himself is expressing his anger, he is giving me suggestions, but at the same time he himself is saying that he made a lot of efforts but failed.
He has also taken the form of a movement
Hate towards dirt is also increasing .
Whether it is awareness, active participation or movement, it has its own importance.
But the sanitation movement is more accustomed to
The work is difficult, but it has to be done.
I believe that the feelings that have emerged in the new generation of the country, in the boys, in the students, in the youth, indicate a good outcome in itself.
Anyone who is listening to Gayatri in my mind today, I will tell all the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should become a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I am talking about Mann Ki Baat programme, I have been receiving several suggestions on one thing from the very beginning and most of the people have expressed concern about food wasteage.
Half of the plastics they fill in their belly and then leave and leave.
You have ever imagined how much waste we are doing due to the flaws we leave behind.
Have you ever thought that if you don't leave the lips then how many poor people can fill their stomachs
This is not the subject that has to be explained.
However, when the mother serves the little children in our family, she says, "Son, take as much food as you can.
Attempts are being made to do something or the other but still apathy on this subject is a social treachery.
There is injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if there is savings then the family also has economic benefits.
Think about it for the society, it is a good thing, but this is such a thing that the family also benefits.
I am not urging you too much on this subject but I would like this awareness to increase.
In every state of India, you will find such people somewhere.
His life too can inspire us not to make a mistake.
We should take as much food as we have.
See, these are the ways to change.
And those who are aware of health always say - keep your stomach a little empty, keep the plate a little empty.
And when it comes to health, it is World Health Day on 7th April.
The United Nations has set a target for Universal Health Coverage by 2030.
We are also familiar with the word expression, but if there is a literal meaning then some people also call it depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are suffering from depression mentally.
The trouble is that we cannot understand this thing in our neighbourhood and maybe we are hesitant to talk openly about it.
He who himself feels expression doesn't even speak because he feels a little embarrassed.
I would like to tell the countrymen that the expression is not such that it cannot get rid of it.
A psychological environment has to be created and it starts.
The first mantra is that instead of suppression of expression, it requires expression.
And among your colleagues, among friends, among parents, among brothers, with a teacher, openly tell me what is happening to you.
Sometimes loneliness especially children living in hostels suffer more.
Everyone in the house is going out somewhere, he says - No, I don't want to come today - I like to stay alone.
Have you ever noticed why it does so
You must assume that it is the first step in the direction of expression.
If he doesn't like to live in a group of people, he is going alone in a corner then try not to let this happen.
Give him an opportunity to interact with people who openly talk to him.
Let us motivate him to express his joy and gladness while talking about what kind of frustration is there inside him.
This is the best remedy
and expression causes mental and physical illness
Like Diabetes becomes a host of all kinds of diseases, the expression also destroys all our capabilities in fighting, taking courage, deciding and deciding.
Your friends, your family, your campus, your environment - can stop you from going to the expression and can bring you out.
There is one more way.
Help yourself, share their happiness and sorrow, you will see that the pain within you will go away.
If you try to understand their sorrows, you will do it with service, you will have a new confidence.
By joining others, by serving someone, and by selflessly serving, you can easily reduce the burden of your mind.
Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Yoga helps a lot to get rid of stress, to get rid of pressure, to move towards a happy mind.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
This will be the third year.
If there is any suggestion regarding the 3rd International Day of Yoga in your mind then you must send your suggestions to me and guide me through my mobile application.
Whatever songs and poetic compositions you can prepare, you should do that so that people can easily understand it.
I would also like to talk to my mothers and sisters today because today the talk of health has come out a lot.
So in the past, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The working class women in our country, our women in the working class and their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and they are welcome but at the same time, women also have special responsibilities.
The Government of India has taken a major decision.
These working class women will be given maternity leave at the time of delivery, at the time of pregnancy, at the time of delivery, at the time of maternity leave which was earlier 12 weeks, now it will be given 26 weeks.
Perhaps there are only two or three countries in the world which are ahead of us.
India has made a very important decision for our sisters.
And its original purpose is to take care of that newborn baby, the future citizen of India, its proper care at the beginning of birth, and if the mother gets a lot of love then these children will grow up and become the treasures of the country.
The health of mothers will also be good and therefore this is a very important decision.
And because of this, nearly 18 lakh women working in the formal sector will get the benefit of this scheme.
My dear countrymen, on 5th April is the holy festival of Ram Navami, on 9th April is the birth anniversary of Mahavir Jayanti, on 14th April is the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
May the lives of all these great men continue to inspire us and give us the strength to resolve for a New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, New Samvatsar, I convey my best wishes to you all for this New Year.
This is the time to start cooking crops after spring and farmers get the result of their hard work.
This New Year is celebrated in different parts of our country in different forms.
Gudi-Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi as New Year in Andhra-Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Samvatsar Puja in the region of Awadh, Twin-Sheel in Mithila in Bihar and Satuvani festival in Magadha is celebrated on New Year.
Innumerable, India is a country full of such diversities.
The winter season is going to go now .
Spring season has knocked us all in life .
After decaying , new leaves appear in trees .
Flowers bloom
Gardens become green
The color of the birds begins to feel like the mind .
Not only flowers, fruits also appear shining in the sunshine on tree branches
Fruits of summer are seen in the spring of mango .
At the same time, yellow mustard flowers in the fields bind the hopes of the farmers
The swollen flowers of tesu or palash indicate the appearance of holi .
Wealthy Khusro has made a funny description of the moments of this change of weather .
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals paint happiness in human life.
We are going to depart for Phalgun in the last month in an environment full of love, brotherhood, humanity and are ready to welcome the new month Chaitra.
Indeed , it is the coincidence of these two months .
First of all, I express my gratitude to the millions and millions of citizens of the country for the fact that whenever I ask for suggestions, there are many suggestions.
On NarendraModiApp, on Twitter, on Facebook, by post, I am grateful to everyone for this.
And so they ' ve said I ' ll give you some information about the launch and interceptor missiles of 104 satellites
Shobha ji, thank you very much that you remembered the example of India's pride.
Whether it is to deal with poverty, to avoid diseases, to connect with the world, to reach out to knowledge, to reach out to the world, technology, science has entered its place.
February 15, 2017 is a glorious day in the life of India
Our scientists have proudly elevated India to the world
SRL has successfully launched 104 satellites in space through mega missions in various countries including USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and India.
India became the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together in space.
And it is also heartening that this is a successful launch of the 38th PSLV
This is a historic achievement for SRI but for the whole of India.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is very important - artosat 2 - this is the satellite of India and it will be of great help to manage the photographs, resources, infrastructure, development assessment and planning of Urban Development.
Particularly my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water sources are there in the country, how much it can be used, what should be taken care of, this new satellite artosat 2 will help us a lot on all these topics.
Our satellite has sent a few pictures as soon as we leave.
He's started his work
It is also a matter of happiness for us that all these campaigns have been led by our young scientists, our women scientists.
Such a tremendous participation of youth and women is a very glorious aspect of the success of ISR
I congratulate the scientists of ISRC on behalf of the countrymen.
They have always maintained their objectives for the service of the common man, for the service of the nation and for bringing in space science and they are also creating new records.
The less we give congratulations to these scientists, their entire team.
Shobha ji has asked another question and that is in relation to the security of India
India has achieved a great achievement.
There is not much talk of this yet, but Shobha ji's attention has been paid to this important thing.
This mission of interception technology has achieved success by stacking enemy missiles at an altitude of nearly 100 kilometers from the ground during its trail.
This is a very important achievement in the area of security .
And you will be happy to know that there are barely four or five countries in the world that have this mastery.
When we look at new technology, there is a new scientific achievement then we are happy.
And curiosity has played a very important role in the development journey of human life
And those who possess talent, do not let curiosity remain in the form of curiosity. They also raise questions within it, search for new curiosity and create new curiosity.
And that curiosity becomes the reason for new discovery.
They do not sit comfortably until they get the answer
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years of human life then we can say that this development journey of human life is not complete.
Full stop is impossible
Efforts are made to know the universe, the rules of creation, the mind of the human being.
New science, new technology is generated from it.
And every technology, every new form of science, gives birth to a new era.
My dear young friends, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, sometimes I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should have an attraction for science.
The country needs a lot of scientists
Today ' s scientist becomes the cause of a permanent change in the life of generations to come in the years to come .
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a major unity type of competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Socially useful innovation was invited
Sometimes the problem also shows the importance of science to solve .
What I mean to say is that in the society, in the country, people of this kind of role are very much involved.
And our society is also becoming technology driven.
Arrangements are becoming technology driven
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
A big force is visible on digi-money in the past
Gradually people are moving from cash to digital currency.
Digital transactions in India are growing at a rapid pace
In our country, the Lucky Client Scheme, Digi-Dhan Business Scheme, has received huge support in the past.
It's been almost two months, 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And it is a matter of happiness that under the Digi-Dhan Yojana so far 10 lakh people have been rewarded, more than fifty thousand traders have been rewarded and more than 1.
Under this scheme, there are more than a hundred subscribers who have received a reward of one lakh rupees.
More than four thousand traders are those who have received rewards worth fifty-fifty thousand rupees.
Whether it is farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, domestic women, students, everyone is taking part in it and they are getting the benefits.
When I asked him about his analysis, "Look, only youngsters come to see that older people also come here, I am glad that there are 15 year olds among those who receive the reward, then there are also sixty-seven years old people.
Shri Santosh ji from Mysore expressed his happiness and wrote on NarendraModiApp that he got a reward of Rs. 1,000 under Lucky Client Scheme.
Now they drive the car but in a way they have become the ambassadors of this scheme.
All passengers are given the knowledge of digital all the time.
They keep saying things with so much enthusiasm and encourage others.
I would urge the countrymen, especially the youth of the country, and the Lucky Client Scheme, either the Digi-Dhan Business Scheme, the rewards they have received, to become an Ambassador of this kind.
Please lead this movement.
You should take this forward and in a way the fight against corruption and black money has a very important role in it.
Everyone associated with this work, in my view, there is a new anti-corruption cadre in the country.
In a way, you are a soldier of purity.
You know that Lucky Customer Plan - 100 days when completed.
14th April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
On 14th April, a draw of crores of rupees is going to take place.
There are about forty-five days left.
Can you do one thing while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
The 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar has just been celebrated.
This time the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and the CBI.
I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation of Dr. Baba Saheb.
We have to reach BHIM App by connecting everybody from house to house to 125 crore rupees.
The impact of the movement that has been going on for the last two-three months is that several townships, several villages and cities have achieved great success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village gives strength to the economic pace of the country.
I want to tell you about a lot of happiness today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and filled up their food stores.
With the hard work of the farmers in our country this year, the production of record foodgrains has been done.
All the indications are saying that our farmers have broken the old records.
This time crops have started flowing in the fields like Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is 8 more than the last record of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of my country have heard the voices of the poor and cultivated different pulses on nearly two hundred and ninety lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service of the poor of my country by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters are very grateful for the way my request, the farmers of my country have worked hard on their heads and eyes and have produced records of pulses.
My dear countrymen, this has been going on in our country by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organisations, by everyone, in this direction of cleanliness.
In a way, everyone is seen behaving consciously with regard to cleanliness in some form or the other.
The government has been making constant efforts.
In the past, a programme of senior officials of 23 State Governments led by our Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India, was held in Telangana.
And it is not just a seminar in the closed room in Warangal in the state of Telangana, but it is important to use the work of direct sanitation.
On 17-18 February, I had organised a Toilet Pit Exemption Exercise in Hyderabad.
Six household toilet pits were evacuated and officials themselves showed that pits used by twin pit toilets can be evacuated and reused.
He also showed how comfortable the toilets of the new technicians are and there is no inconvenience in sanitation, there is no hesitation, which is a psychological barrier, it is also not a hindrance.
And we can clean the pit of a toilet just like that.
And as a result of this effort, the media of the country has propagated this thing very much, it has given importance to it and it is natural that when an ICD is being promoted.
If the ASH officer cleans the pit of the toilet himself then it is very natural to take care of the country.
And this is the cleaning of toilet pit and those whom you consider to be garbage but if you look at it from the point of view of manure then this is black gold in a way.
We can see what happens from waste to wealth.
And that ' s proved
A standard Twin Pit Toilet for a six-member family - this model is filled in about five years.
After this, the waste can be easily removed and redirected in another pit.
In six-twelve months, the waste stored in the pit gets completely decomposed.
This decomposed waste is very safe in handle and is very important compost NPK in terms of manure .
Farmers are well acquainted with NPK.
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium - It is full of nutrients. It is considered to be a very good manure in the agriculture sector.
The way in which the government has taken these initiatives, others too have made such initiatives.
And now Doordarshan has a special programme of Swachhta News
The more such things will be exposed, the more it will be beneficial.
Even in the government, different departments celebrate Swachhta Pakhwada regulatory.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with them Tribal Affairs Ministry, are going to strengthen the cleanliness drive.
And in the second fortnight of March and two Ministries - Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - these Ministries are also going to carry forward the Swachhta Abhiyan in the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever a citizen of our country does something good, the whole country experiences a new energy, it increases self-confidence.
We all welcomed the performance performed by our Divyang Players at Rio Paralympics.
In the final of the Blind T20 World Cup held this month, India defeated Pakistan and enhanced the country's pride by becoming a world champion for the second consecutive time.
I once again congratulate all the team players
The country is proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends
I always believe that the Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, determined, bold and determined.
Every moment we can get to learn something from them
Whether it is sports or space science - women of our country are not behind anyone
They are step by step and illuminating the country with their achievements .
In the last few days, our women sportspersons won the silver medal in Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy
Congratulations to all those players
March 8 celebrates World Women's Day
In India too, giving importance to daughters, increased awareness about them in family and society, increased sensitivity
Beti Bachao Beti Teach this movement is progressing at a fast pace
Today it ' s not just a government program
This has become a campaign of social sensitivity, public education.
During the last two years, this programme has added public opinion, has forced people to think about this burning issue in every corner of the country and has changed the thinking of people towards the old customs that have been going on for years.
When we get the news that a festival was celebrated on the birth of a daughter, so much joy comes.
In a way, positive thinking towards daughters is causing social acceptance.
I have heard that the Luddalore district of Tamil Nadu state has banned child marriage under a special campaign.
More than 175 child marriages have been stopped so far
District Administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand daughters under Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu Kashmir, all the departments have been included in the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana and efforts are being made to ensure that the orphans are adopted and educated by the district administration along with orphans.
A campaign to educate rural household daughters is being launched in Madhya Pradesh under the programme of Each Ghar Grahak.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to re-school the girls who had been drop-out by running their own school campaign and to motivate them to re-school.
What I mean to say is that the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement has also taken several forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement
New imaginations are associated with him
It has been diverted as per local requirements
You also keep connecting with activism
I get a lot to know from you
What is happening on the earth, what is happening in the minds of the village and the poor, it reaches me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution
Yesterday, Shri Krishna Janma Mahotsav was celebrated across India
Someone can imagine that what kind of personality it will be, that even after thousands of years, every festival comes with renewed inspiration, it comes with new energy and thousands of years old life is such that one can still provide an example to solve problems, inspire, everyone can find solutions to the problems of the present in the life of Shri Krishna.
Sometimes the work of lifting the rocks, sometimes picking up the food leaf i. e.
One Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, the other Charkhadhari Mohan
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, who was born on the banks of the Yamuna, moved to the coast of Gujarat, settled in the city of Dwarka and breathed his last in life, except on the banks of the Yamuna.
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan had utilised his duties, his ability, his thoughts in the circumstances of that time, thousands of years ago, to avoid war, to avoid conflict, to avoid conflict, to fulfil his duties and to fulfil his thoughts. The Charkhadhar Mohan also chose such a path for freedom, to save human values, to empower the fundamental elements of personality - for this the war of freedom gave such a turning point that is strange for the entire world, even today it is strange.
Be it the importance of selfless service or be it the importance of knowledge or be it the importance of smiling in the midst of all the ups and downs in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna and therefore Shri Krishna, Jagatguru has also been known as Krishna Vande Jagadgurum
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is preparing for another big festival and it is discussed not only in India but also in the whole world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served those farmers with whom Champaran was being discriminated and served those mill workers who were not being given proper wages, who considered the service of the poor, the destitute, the weak and the hungry, the ultimate duty of their lives.
Whoever, whenever needed, was always present for the service of Mahatma Gandhi
He not only emphasized on service but also on self-confidence associated with it.
The meaning of the word ' service ' is in the sense that it should be done with joy - service , Paramo Dharma .
But, at the same time, the feeling of excellent joy, selflessness is also inherent in service.
We can understand this from Bapu's life very well.
For Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and society, humanity, all this was the same.
Whether it is Phoeni farm in Africa or be it Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Vardha, he has always been focused on social development community mobilisation.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to bow down to several important places related to revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi used to insist on organising with a sense of service.
Social-Service and Social-Promotion Community Service and Community Mobilisation This spirit that we have to bring into our practical life
In true sense, this is a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, it is a true function.
No countrymen
And collectivity has its own strength
There should be collectiveness and service in the programmes of Gandhi 150.
Our ladies are clubs
The ladies clubs of the modern era will continue to do the same. However, all the ladies clubs will work together.
can do a lot
Collect books, distribute books to the poor, disseminate knowledge and I believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen have 130 crore ideas and 130 crore enterprises.
There is no limit to those who come to mind - just goodwill, goodwill, goodwill, goodwill and devotional service, and that too for the realization of a unique joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha Dandi is a very important turning point in the freedom movement.
In Dandi, I had inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
Your emotions from within your mind will be stronger than any great literature creation and it may be that in today's times, in your eyes, in the form of a Gandhi written by your pen, perhaps even more relevant.
A lot of programmes, competitions, exhibitions have also been planned in the coming days.
But one thing in this context is very interesting that I want to share with you
In this Haripura Panels were particularly interesting .
You will remember that the congress was held in Haripura, Gujarat where the event of Subhash Chandra Bose's Presidential election was recorded in history.
These art panels have a very beautiful past
Before the Haripura session of Congress in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal Nand Lal Bose of Shanti Niketan Kala Bhawan.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and perform this work during the session.
This is the same Nand Lal Bose whose heart work enhances the beauty of our Constitution.
gives a new identity to the constitution .
And his art practice has made Nand Lal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nand Lal Bose visited the village around Haripura and finally made some art canvas showing the lives of rural India.
This precious artwork had a great deal of discussion.
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, with good wishes, I expect some solemn pledge from every Indian.
Something should be done for the country, for the society, for someone else.
This will be a good, true, authentic function to Bapu
Sons of Mother India, you will remember that in the last few years, we have been running Swachhta Hi Seva campaigns across the country for nearly two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it starts on September 11 .
During this time, we will leave our homes and work for Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdaan
Housing or streets, square-square or nalia, school, college and all public places have to undertake a massive cleanliness drive.
Similarly, we have to work together to eliminate the use of Single House plastic.
This will save money and contribute to protecting the environment
This time on 2nd October, when we commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will not only dedicate him to Open Defecation Free India but will also lay the foundation of a new mass movement against plastic across the country.
Celebrate 2nd October as Special Day
I also appeal to the corporate sector to come forward for proper disposal when all these plastic wastes are accumulated.
It can be recycled
It can be made fuel .
Thus, by this Diwali, we can also complete the safe disposal of this plastic waste.
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit is in a way a gem of knowledge.
We can get what we want in life .
These days , my contact has diminished greatly , but I had a lot of contact before .
Stupid people call stone gems
Our culture has glorified a lot of food
Until We converted the knowledge of food into science .
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborns, because this is the foundation of the future of our society.
Under POSHAN Abhiyaan, nutrition is being made a mass movement across the country through modern scientific methods.
People are fighting malnutrition in new and interesting ways
Sometimes one thing was brought to my mind
A handful of paddy has become a big movement within the narrow .
It collects a handful of grains from the Anganwadi workers in the days of harvesting .
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women
The donor becomes an aware citizen social worker in a way .
After that he himself is dedicated to this goal and he becomes a soldier of that movement .
All of us have heard of food prashanas in every corner of India in our families.
This is done when the child starts feeding solid food for the first time .
Solid food not fucked
In 2010, Gujarat thought that children should be given a complimentary fodder so that people can be made aware about it.
This is a very glorious initiative that can be adopted everywhere
In many states people run date meal campaigns
If there is a birthday in the family, if there is a birthday or a memorial day, then the family members go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food and tasty food and go to schools and the family members serve and feed themselves.
They also share their joy and reflect in happiness .
A wonderful union of service and joy is seen .
Friends, There are so many small things that our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, in the absence of awareness, poor and prosperous families are affected by malnutrition.
Month of September to be celebrated as POSHAN Abhiyaan across the country
You must join it, get information, add something new. You should also contribute.
If you bring somebody out of malnutrition , we bring the country out of malnutrition .
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there will be a lot of questions about this topic and that too. And in the last few weeks, wherever I have visited the people, there is also a mention of Man vs.
With this episode, I have not only joined the youth of India but also the youth of the world. I had never imagined that this kind of place would become my place in the young hearts.
I had never imagined how diverse things our country and the youth of the world pay attention to .
I never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the hearts of young people around the world .
And what happens
Just last week I went to Bhutan
I have seen that since I got the opportunity to visit wherever I got the opportunity to visit as the Prime Minister, and due to International Yoga Day, the situation has become such that if I go to anybody in the world then some or the other five-seven minutes I only ask questions about Yoga.
There will hardly be a big leader in the world who has not talked to me about Yoga and I have experienced it all over the world.
But these days there ' s a new experience
Whatever one gets, wherever he gets a chance to talk, he discusses about Wildlife and discusses about environment.
Tiger, ion, bio-creation and I'm surprised how people are interested.
Discovery has planned to broadcast this programme in their language in 165 countries.
I hope that in such a scenario, this episode of Discovery Channel will help the world in introducing the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity towards nature in the Sanskrit Yatra of India. It has become my firm belief and now people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in India.
But another interesting thing is that even with hesitation some people ask me one thing. Tell me, Modi ji, if you are speaking Hindi and you don't know Bear Grylls Hindi then how could it be so fast
What's this edited later
It's been shouting so frequently What's wrong
ask with great curiosity
Look, there's no secret in it.
Reality is that technology has been used a lot in conversation with Bear Grylls.
So I used to speak Hindi but it used to be heard in English and because of that the dialogue used to become very easy and this is the wonderful thing about technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett, National Park.
You must also visit places related to nature and organisms like nature and will life.
I have said before, I must say that you must go to North-East in your life.
Your inside will expand
A country full of diversities will fill you with diversity as a teacher, as well as with diversity.
Last month I had the privilege of releasing Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
Tiger population in India is 2967
A few years ago , half of it was hard
Tiger summit took place in 2010 in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
It took a resolution expressing concern over the decreasing number of tigers in the world.
This was the resolve to double the number of tigers in the world by Twenty Two 2022.
We doubled our number of tigers in 2019 itself .
Not only the number of tigers in India but the number of protected areas and community resources has also increased.
When I was releasing the data of tigers, I also remembered the lion of Gir in Gujarat.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister, the habitat of the lions was shrinking in the forests of Gir.
their numbers were decreasing
We took several steps one after the other in Gir
Decided to deploy lady guards in 2007
Improved infrastructure to boost tourism
Whenever we talk of nature and wildlife then we talk of conservation only .
But, now we have to move beyond conservation and think about compassion.
In our scriptures , there has been a very good guidance in this regard .
Therefore, we need to not only conserve our forests, flora and fauna, but also create an environment that will facilitate them to flourish properly.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekanand Ji on 11th September, 1893 Highteen Ninety Three
This young sanyasi of India, who shaken the human race all over the world, left a stunning identity of India in the world.
The words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda on 11th September, 1893 forced the world to change its vision towards India.
Come, Swami Vivekananda ji had seen the form of an India that Swami Vivekananda ji had to know about the strength of India
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that 29th August is celebrated as National Sports Day.
For everyone, this will be a big interesting campaign for the children, the elderly, the youth, the women and this will be your own.
But I ' m not going to tell her nuances today
I want to make you aware of fitness and also set some goals for the country for the Fit India.
My dear countrymen, I will be waiting for you on 29th August at It India.
Let us move forward with a new zeal, a new resolve, a new strength
My dear countrymen, today we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
I'll wait for your point of view, your suggestions.
Let us all come together to realize Gandhi's dreams of making India the dream of freedom fighters:
Let the inner joy be expressed in service .
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
On 26th January, our Republic Day was celebrated in every corner of the country with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, in a way, is also a festival of rituals that makes the future generations aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities.
But in our country, the debate on the duties of the citizens and the rights of the citizens, the depth of debate, the widespread discussion that should be held, is not taking place yet.
I hope that the strength at every level, the strength at every time, the power at every level, the same strength at every time, should be given on duties.
Only on two tracks of rights and duties, India's democracy can move forward at a fast pace.
Tomorrow is 30th January, the death anniversary of our revered Bapu.
On January 30, we pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by keeping silence for 11 o'clock in the morning, 2 minutes.
As a society, as a country, 2 minute homage at 30 January 11 o'clock, this should become an instinct.
Why not be 2 minutes, but it also expresses collectiveness, determination and reverence for the martyrs.
In our country, there is an easier sense of respect for the army, the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families for the various gallantry awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal and several categories.
We are surprised, proud and inspired when we know deeply about their courage, bravery and valour.
On one hand, we were all happy with the news of the enthusiasm and zeal of 26th January, at the same time our soldiers in Kashmir who were in defence of the country were brave due to avalanches.
I respectfully pay homage to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I continue to talk about mind.
January, February, March, April - All these months are the months of criterion in every family.
Half of the children in the household are exams but the entire family is buried under the burden of exams.
So I felt that this is the right time that I should talk to the student friends, talk to their advocates, talk to their teachers because for many years, wherever I went, the examination was a major problem.
The family is disturbed, the student is disturbed, the teacher is disturbed, a very strange psychological environment is visible in every household.
And I have always felt that we should come out of it and that is why today I want to talk to my young friends in detail.
I got a telephone message of creation.
So I want to ask you so much that this atmosphere can't be pleasant
Well, the question has been asked by the creation, but this question will be in your mind.
The examination should be an opportunity of self-joy.
It has worked hard throughout the year, now there has been an opportunity to tell, this should be a festival of enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
There are very few people for whom there is a pleasure in the exam, for most people there is a pressure.
You have to decide that you will consider it as a pressure.
The person who believes in the pleasure will find that the person who accepts the pressure will regret it.
And therefore, I believe that the examination is a festival, take the exam as if it is a festival.
And when there is a festival, when there is a festival then the best thing that happens within us comes out.
The power of society is also felt at the time of the festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
There should be an atmosphere of festivities in the entire family, among friends, among the neighbours.
You see, this will be converted into a pressure, pleasure.
The festive atmosphere will make the burden free.
And I urge the parents to create an environment for these three-four months.
The right thing is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these examinations are conducted only for three-four months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to change these three-four months every year in our own way by taking our traditions and by taking the environment of our families into the festival.
And you must have seen that when you are happy and smiling, you find relaxation in yourself, you easily relax and when you relax, you can easily recall your years old things.
A year ago, what the teacher said in the classroom, the entire scene is remembered.
And you must know that the power of recalling the memory is the highest in relaxation.
If you're in tension, then all the doors are closed, don't go out, don't come out.
There is a stagnation in the thought process, it becomes a burden in itself.
You were the ones who didn't tell anyone.
But whoever was inside came out immediately and came out because you got relaxed.
And that is why if any medicine is the biggest recall of memory then it is relaxation.
And I can say this thing with my own experience that if there is a pressure then we forget our things and if we are relaxed then we can never imagine. Suddenly such things are remembered, they are very useful.
But when tension takes place then your knowledge, your knowledge and your information gets suppressed and your tension gets rid of it.
And that is why it is necessary that A happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet. Sometimes it seems that we are unable to see the examination in the super specialty.
It seems that it is a question of life and death.
The exam that you are going to give is the exam of your studies throughout the year.
This is not the criterion of your life.
What kind of life you have lived, what kind of life you are leading, what kind of life you want to lead, what kind of life you people dont have an exam.
Apart from the examination given in your life, in the classroom, in the notebook, there must have been opportunities to pass through several criteria.
And therefore, the examination has something to do with the success and failure of life, get rid of such burden.
They went to the Air Force and became airborne.
Suppose if he was disappointed because of that failure, he would lose his life, would India get such a big scientist, would he not get such a big president
The points have become the most important.
Because of this, competition has increased a lot, along with the tension in the students has also increased greatly.
I would like to be aware of your thoughts on this current direction of education and its future.
By the way, he himself has given the answer, but Chaji wants me to keep something in it.
Marks and marks-sheets have a limited use.
Nothing happens in life.
Life goes on how much knowledge you have acquired.
Life goes on to know what you have tried to live.
Is it life that you have got a sense of mission and that which is your sense of familiarity, is there any coordination between your mission and ambition
If you believe in these things then you will come after you asking the marks and you will never need to run behind the marks.
Knowledge is going to work in your life, skill is going to work, self-confidence is going to work, will power is going to work.
You tell me, there will be a doctor in your family and all the family members will go to him, they will have a family doctor.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger case, do you see the marks-sheet of that lawyer
You see his experience, his knowledge and his journey of success.
And that is why the burden of this number sometimes stops us from going in the right direction.
But this does not mean that I should say that it is not just reading.
You must use it for your criterion.
I was yesterday, where I am today, it is necessary to know.
But if you focus on the marks, if you focus on the marks then you shrink yourself gradually and limit yourself to a certain area and get the marks only.
It may be that despite being a promising exam, sometimes it fails in life.
Cha ji, one thing has been said by the competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
One of the characteristics of the life of most successful players is that they compete.
If we take the example of Shri Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Twenty years of continuous breakdown of its own record, defeating itself every time and moving forward.
He has a wonderful life journey, because he adopted the path of more competition than competition.
Friends in every sphere of life and when you are going to give an exam then if you were able to read it for two hours then can you do it for three hours peacefully
That energy is produced automatically from within itself.
If you are better, you will be careless, you will be filled with utmost confidence.
If you make a mistake against him, you will be distressed and disappointed, you will be filled with jealousy. The jealousy that will feed you, yourself, and if you are equal, you will never feel the need for improvement.
Just concentrate on what I have done before, how I will do it before, how I will do it better.
You see, you will feel a lot of change.
S Sundar ji has expressed his feelings about the role of parents.
They say that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
He further wrote that my mother was not read-written, yet she used to sit with me and asked me to solve the question of mathematics.
Once you learn to accept, the maximum problem will end there.
Acceptance opens the way for solving problems.
Expectations make the path difficult.
Accepting the state gives an opportunity to open new paths and therefore accept whatever is there.
You will also be burdened.
One of our familiar personalities was in hospital due to heart attack, so the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha of India, Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, his son Purushottam Mavalankar, he was also a MP, he came to see his health.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not come and ask a single question about his health.
As soon as he sat there, he started listening to the situation, the disease is there, there is no talk, jokes and in the first two-four minutes he lightened such an environment.
In a way, going to a sick person as we scare the disease.
I would like to say to the parents, sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have you ever thought of giving an atmosphere of joy to the children in the days of exam
You see, the environment will change.
I have come to Phone Call for a great deal.
They do not want to give their name to the gentleman.
On hearing the phone, you will know why they don't want to mention their name.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I cannot tell my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
Once in my childhood I tried to imitate, I started preparing a lot for it and tried to find ways to imitate it, due to which a lot of time was wasted.
I could bring the same number by reading in that time as much as I spent in my brains to imitate.
And when I tried to pass by copying, I was caught in it and because of me many friends around me had a lot of trouble.
Your point is correct.
These shortcut routes become the reason for imitating them.
So the duplicate never makes sense.
Copy makes you bad, so don't copy.
You must have heard many times and again that don't copy, don't copy.
I'm telling you the same thing again.
And once the habit of imitation has been developed, there will never be any desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach
If you give the same creativity on the issues of your exam then perhaps there is no need for imitation.
The results that will be achieved by the hard work of yourself, the confidence that will increase will be amazing.
This fundamental notion is wrong, it is the root cause of the problem.
If there is a holistic development then there is a life outside the books and it is huge.
This is the time for him to learn to live.
Someone should say that I will complete all the examinations first, I will play later and then I will do this, then it is impossible.
Have you ever imagined that when all this is happening in the front then you should go out for two moments and look at the sky, look at the trees and plants, lighten your hearts, you will see, you will again come in your room with a lot of freshness.
Whatever you are doing, take a break, get up and go out, go to the kitchen, find something of your choice, if you get a biscuit of your choice, then eat, take a little joke.
Even if you don't have five minutes, but give me a break.
You will feel that your work is getting easier.
I don't know if everyone likes it or not, but I have experience.
There is no need to stay in a room to breathe deeply.
You see, the body will be relaxed and the relaxation of your body will not only relax but it will also relax the brain organs.
When I hold meetings in the elections, sometimes my voice sat down.
So I came to meet a folk singer.
They came and asked me - how many hours do you sleep
I said - Why are you a doctor
No, no, say - The voice that gets spoiled by lectures during the election is related to it.
You will get a complete sleep only then your vocal cord will get a complete rest.
Now I had never thought of sleeping and my speech and my voice, they gave me a herb.
So we really understand the significance of these things, you see, you will benefit.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping, but some will say that the Prime Minister has said that now there is no need to wake up, sleeping.
So do not do this, otherwise the people of your family will be angry with me.
And if your marks-sheet comes on the day you will not show them, I will show them.
So don't do that.
And that is why I would say that the PDF for Prepared and PDF for Play, the Person who plays, the Shines, this is a very big medicine for keeping mind, intelligence and body alert.
Well, young friends, you're preparing for the exam and I'm holding you in mind.
Perhaps these things will not only relax for you but will also work for you.
If you can, do it, if you cant, do not do it, otherwise it will become a burden.
So, as I advise the parents of your family not to be burdened, they apply to me as well.
Make the criterion festival to cross every criterion.
Never again will the criterion, the criterion remain.
Let us move ahead with this mantra.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has established its place among the world's 4 largest Coast Guards with all its 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in the country.
While fulfilling this motto, the youngsters of Coast Guard are eager to work day and night in adverse conditions to safeguard the maritime boundaries and maritime environment of the country.
And very few people will know that there are not only men in the Coast Guard in our country, women are also equally responsible and successfully performing their responsibilities by joining shoulders.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard, be it Pilot or be it the work of bservers or be it the work of overcraft.
It is considered an opportunity to worship Vidya.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My color gives Basanti Chola - this is the same inspiration.
My best wishes to my countrymen on this auspicious festival of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio always fills new colors with its imagination.
Since last month, he has started talking about the mind in regional languages immediately after the completion of my mind.
It has got extensive approval.
People from far and wide are writing letters.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to join you.
My best wishes.
Talk of mind, December 2016
But, you must have seen in the newspapers, new people are getting caught every day, notes are being caught, raids are being carried out, good people are being caught. How is this possible

Last month we were all enjoying Diwali
Like every year on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border along the Chinese border to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I go every time, but the experience of this Diwali was different.
25 billion countrymen, in a unique way, dedicated this Diwali to the soldiers, dedicated it to the security forces, its impact was expressed on the faces of every soldier.
They looked full of emotions and not only this, the good wishes and messages that the countrymen sent, they included the security forces of the country in their happiness, there was a wonderful response.
And people just sent messengers, not so, they were connected to their minds.
Someone wrote a poem, someone made a picture, someone made a cartoon, someone made a video, that is, every house had become a chawki like fighters.
The work is going on, with your contributions, the feelings of the soldiers of the country will be compiled in this book with your imagination and your feelings towards the security forces of the country.
A soldier from the army wrote to me - Prime Minister, for the soldiers, every festival of Holi and Diwali is on the outskirts of the country.
Yeah, still remembers home during festivals
But to be honest, this time it didn't seem
It's not like the festival and I'm not home.
It felt as if we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians
My dear countrymen, the feeling that this Diwali, the feeling that has awakened among the security forces of our country, should it be confined to just a few occasions
I appeal to you that as a society, as a nation, as a nation, we must remember the soldiers of our country in some form or the other, be it any festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it an atmosphere of happiness.
When the whole nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases 125 million times
Just a while ago, all the heads of the village from Jammu and Kashmir had come to meet me.
I had the opportunity to talk to them for a long time
He had come here with some things about the development of his village, he had come here with some demands. But when the talk was going on, it was natural that the situation in the valley, the law and order, the future of the children, all these things were natural.
And so lovingly, with such openness, these village heads spoke, everything was going to touch my heart.
I urged them to go and focus their attention on the future of these children
Today, I am glad that all these Prime Ministers from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promises made to me.
Going to the village awakened all the distant people
Just a few days ago, when the board had an exam, the sons and daughters of Kashmir took part in the board exams.
Inclusion of students in such large numbers in board examinations indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education and for a bright future.
I congratulate the students for their enthusiasm but I heartily congratulate their parents, their families, their teachers and all the village heads.
Dear brothers and sisters, This time when I asked for suggestions from people for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that all suggestions came together.
Everyone used to say that talk more in detail on 500- and 1000-notes
While addressing the nation at 8 pm on 8th November, I had discussed the commencement of a grand campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is to implement that decision.
And I also realized that we will have to face many new difficulties in our normal life
And yet I had said that the decision is so big that it will take 50 days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards the normal state.
The campaign to get rid of the diseases that we have been suffering for 70 years cannot be easy
I can understand your difficulties very well
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation.
Despite all the efforts being made to mislead you, sometimes you have understood this path of truth and you have accepted it very well for the country.
Five hundred thousand notes, such a large country, such a huge currency, billions and billions of notes and these decisions - the entire world is looking at them very closely, every economist is doing analysis and evaluating them.
The entire world is watching the fact that India's 125 crore countrymen will be able to achieve success by facing difficulties.
There may be question marks in the mind of the world
India has faith in 1. 25 billion Indians, it is faith that 1. 25 billion Indians will be able to fulfil their resolve.
And our country will emerge as a citizen of this country in every way by doing penance like gold and it is because of this thing that you people are the reason for this thing that this path of success has also been possible due to you.
All the units of central government, state government, local Swaraj institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends and friends are engaged in this work day and night.
In the midst of various tensions, all these people are working very quietly, as a sacrifice for the service of the nation and as an effort for a great transformation.
Start in the morning, when the night is over, I don't know, but all are
And that is why India will succeed in it. This is clearly visible.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank, post office are working in the midst of such difficulties.
And when it comes to the issue of humanity, they appear two steps ahead.
Someone told me that an elderly person in Khandwa was admitted.
Suddenly money was needed
I was glad to know that he provided money to the elderly and his own house so that he could help in the treatment.
Innumerable such stories emerge every day in TV, in the media, in newspapers, in conversation.
He was introduced to his strength
Today, once again, he has taken up that challenge and I believe that the resolve of 1. 25 billion Indians, collective strength of everyone, will empower this nation by making it a new force.
But the evils have spread so much that even today some people don ' t get used to evils .
Some people still feel that this money of corruption, this money of black money, this unaccounted money, this anonymous money, I will find some way and bring it back to the system.
They're looking for unlawful ways to save their money.
Sadly , they also preferred to choose a way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money in their accounts or doing some work with them.
But, by kindness, do not play with the lives of the poor.
Do not do anything that the name of the poor should come to the record and afterwards when it is checked, my beloved poor will get into trouble because of your sin.
And an anonymous law of property has been enacted which is being implemented, how difficult it will be
And the government does not want our countrymen to face any difficulty
Any Mr. Ashish from Madhya Pradesh has telephoned me and appreciated the fight against corruption and black money through this five hundred thousand: - Sar Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare
I am a common citizen of Village Tirali, Tehsil Tirli, District Harda, Madhya Pradesh.
It is very commendable that the currency that you have closed the notes of thousands and five hundred rupees.
Similarly, a phone call has come from Mr. Yelappa Velankar ji of Karnataka: -Modi ji Namaste, I am talking to Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal District of Karnataka.
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart because you said that good days will come, but no one thought that you would take such a big step.
Five hundred and a thousand notes, seeing all this, taught a lesson to black money and corrupt people
Every citizen of India will never have a good day
That ' s why I want to thank you heartily .
Some things get to know through media, through people, through government sources, the enthusiasm of working is also greatly increased.
It is so enjoyable, so proud that what the common man has in my country
And people go there, eat food and after 2-4-6 days when they pass through there then they return the money again.
This is the strength of my country, which has a sense of service, sacrifice and authenticity.
But I don't know that in tea discussions, marriage also takes place.
I came to know that on 17th November in Surat, there was a marriage that took place with a discussion on tea.
In Gujarat, in Surat, a daughter who came to her wedding, she fed tea and no water, no food programme, nothing - because there was some difficulty due to the ban on bondage.
Baramatis also considered him so respectful
Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar of Surat - Whatever contribution they have made in their struggle against corruption, against black money and against these wars is an inspiration in themselves.
I also bless Navparineet Bharat and Daksha and congratulate you all for turning the occasion of marriage into a new occasion by converting it into a great sacrifice.
Tea-worker lives and Tea-worker gets money weekly.
Now a note of Rs 2000 was found, then what did they do
Four neighbouring women gathered and four went together and paid a note of Rs. 2000 so they didn't need a small currency because the four together bought and decided that they would meet in the next week.
People are searching for their own ways
See, how the life of the village is also changing.
Some people of this campaign have got immediate benefits
The country will get benefits in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefits.
Every municipality is hardly 50 of tax .
But this time , on the 8th of this decision , everyone ran to deposit their old notes .
Last year 47 urban units had received tax of about Rs. 3,500 crore.
You will be surprised to know that in this week, he has deposited Rs. 13,000 crore.
Said three-and-a-half thousand and said 13 thousand
And that too from the front
Now that money has come up four times in those municipalities then it is natural that there will be provision of gutters in the poor settlements, there will be provision of water and Anganwadi facility.
Several such examples are being found in which its direct benefits are also being seen .
Brothers and sisters, Our village, our farmers are a strong pivot of our country's economy.
On the one hand, because of this new change in the economy, in the midst of difficulties, every citizen is adjusting himself.
But I want to especially congratulate the farmers of my country today.
Now I was taking the figures of sowing this crop .
I am glad that be it wheat or pulses or oilseeds, I have accounted till the 20th of November. Sowing has increased substantially compared to last year.
Even in the midst of difficulties, the farmer has found ways
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority
There are difficulties even after that, but I believe that the farmer who is facing all our difficulties, natural obstacles, he always stands firm and stands firm even today.
Small traders of our country, they provide employment and also increase economic activity.
Millions and millions of rupees were given to such small people by the money scheme because these small businesses, millions and millions of people do it and they speed up the business of billions and billions of rupees.
But because of this decision , it was natural for them to have difficulty .
But I have seen that now even our small traders are serving the customers in their own way through technology, through mobile app, through mobile bank, through credit card and on the basis of trust.
And I want to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is a chance, you should also enter the digital world.
You also download the bank ' s app on your mobile phone .
You also have PSLV machines for credit cards
I invite you that you can contribute a lot in making cashless society, you can create a complete banking system in increasing your business, on mobile phones and today there are many ways other than the notes that we can run the business.
There are technological paths, safe, secure and quick.
I would like you to just help in making this campaign a success. Not only this, you should also lead the change and I am sure you can lead the change.
I want to tell Labour Brothers and sisters that you have been exploited very much.
Paper has a salary and when given in hand, then there is another
Sometimes when the salary is met, someone stands outside, he has to cut and labour force makes this exploitation a part of his life.
With this new system we want you to have an account in your bank, your salary will be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages are followed.
And once money has come to your bank account, you too dont need a big smart phone on a small mobile phone. Nowadays your mobile phone also works as an e-book. You can also pay the money from the same mobile phone.
Therefore, I urge the labourers to become a partner in this scheme because after all, I have taken such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the farmers, for the labourers, for the deprived, for the victims and they should get their benefit.
Today I want to talk especially to young friends
We say in the world that India is a country with a population of 65, below 35 years of age
You are the young women of my country, I know, my decision has come to you.
I also know that you support this decision
I also know that you contribute a lot to advancing this positively
But friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true companion
We have had a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India. There has been an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
My young men, can you help me
You'll give me a hand, it's not going to be so much
The older generation doesn't have the experience of today's world.
Perhaps the elder brother in your family will not even know and parents, uncles, maternal uncles, maternal uncles may not even know.
You know what happens, you know what happens, you know what happens online banking, you know how online ticket booking is happening.
Things are very common to you and you use them .
But today the country wants to do the great work and our dream is cashless society.
It is true that 100 percent cashless society is not possible.
And I need your personal help, I need your time, I need your own pledge and you will never disappoint me, I am sure, because we are all those who want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know, today there are so many opportunities for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking.
Every bank offers online facility
Wallet means e-butwa
There are many types of cards available
The ordinary featured phone can also cause cash transfers.
Whether it is a washerman, a seller of vegetables, a seller of milk, a seller of newspapers, a seller of tea, a seller of grams, everyone can comfortably use it.
And I have also stressed on making this system easier
All the banks are engaged on it, doing it
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation who is unfamiliar with it.
And all of you, I know very well, are active in this great task.
The kind of creative messages you give on WhatsApp - slogans, poems, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter and jokes - I see everything. And the creative power of our younger generation in the midst of the challenges, it looks like the land of India that the Gita was born in the battlefield of a time, similarly today we are passing through such a period of change, then the original creativity is being manifested in you.
But my dear young friends, I once again say, I need your help in this work.
G-G, I repeat, I need your help and you, I believe that millions of youth of my country will do this work.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business
You can voluntarily bring out this cashless society, this grand campaign of bringing the country out of the vicinity of these notes, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to get rid of black money and the campaign to free people from difficulties and problems - you have to lead it.
Once you will teach people how to use Rupay cards, then the poor will bless you.
If you teach the ordinary citizen these facilities then he will perhaps get rid of all these concerns. And if all the youth of India take this task then I dont believe it will take longer.
Within a month, we can stand in the world as a new modern India and you can do this thing through your mobile phones, you can do it everyday in 10 houses, you can do it by adding 10 houses to it.
This country has made a big revolution
My young men, I once again urge you to take this campaign forward with great urgency.
You must have seen that Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, is carrying forward the cleanliness drive.
It seems that the topic of cleanliness has spread in their veins and that is why they remembered the work of cleanliness even on the birth anniversary of their father.
He has written that Harivansh Rai ji has a poem and one of his lines has written, "My body of soil, mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction"
Harivansh Rai Ji used to introduce himself through this.
My introduction to soil stem, mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction to him, his son Amitabh Ji, in whose veins the mission of cleanliness is running, he has written to me by writing to me using the poem of Harivansh Rai - Swachh Tan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, My introduction
I respectfully bow down to Harivansh Rai Ji.
I also thank Mr. Amitabh ji for this kind of involvement in Mann Ki Baat and for taking forward the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat your thoughts, your feelings keep me attached to you through your letters, on MyGov and NarendraModiApp continuously.
Now it is a matter of mind at 11 o'clock, but they are going to start immediately after completing it in regional languages.
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to you all for Deepawali.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is such a country that for 365 days there is a festival in every corner of the country.
The person who sees from a distance will feel that like the Indian public life, this is the second name of the festival and it is also natural.
The festivals that have been observed in India since the Vedas till date have been time-bound celebrations, we have seen the courage to abolish the tradition of external festivals and the changes in festivals have also been easily accepted as per the demands of time and society.
But one of these things can be seen very well that the entire journey of India's festivals, its expansion, its depth, its penetration among the masses, its original mantra is connected to the entire world.
Efforts should be made to expand the individual and personality, to expand the scope of our limited thinking, to the universe and to do this through festivals.
All these things, our ancestors have embraced the festival in a scientific manner.
Today the whole world discusses about the environment.
Nature-Destruction has become a matter of concern.
The festival of India has been a tradition that has made nature-loving strong, it has been ritualizing every person from childhood.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody's responsibilities are being celebrated.
Nowadays we celebrate holidays on Sunday but the older generation, the labourers, the fishermen, you must have seen that for centuries our tradition was to celebrate Purnima and Amavasya.
This means that even our holidays had developed a tradition of connecting with the universe and science.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I said, every festival of ours is an educational festival, it comes with the sense of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message to Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamya - from darkness to light.
Deepawali's lamp burns, the darkness that is darkened in the society, the darkness of the individual, the liberation from the darkness that is darkened, and the same is the festival of lighting the lamps of Diwali.
One thing we all know very well, let us go to any corner of India, let us go to the house of the richest of the poor, let us go to the hut of the poorest of the poor, we can see the cleanliness drive in every family in the festival of Diwali.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
The poor will have their own pottery, so the earthen pots are also cleaned in such a way that it has just come to Diwali.
Diwali is also a cleanliness campaign.
But, the need of the hour is not just cleanliness in the house, cleaning the entire complex, cleaning the entire neighborhood, cleaning the entire village, we have to expand this habit and tradition.
The festival of Deepawali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
In all the countries of the world, the festival of Deepawali is celebrated in some form or the other.
Many governments of the world, parliament and rulers of that place are also becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
And they have shared that picture with the world and have done it with great pride.
And what is the picture
16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament wearing Indian saris and this photo viral has happened.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had just come here, he told me that I have to go back so soon that I have to attend the Diwali celebrations there.
I mean to say that Deepawali, this festival of light is also becoming an inspiration for bringing the world community from darkness to light.
Many firecrackers gather and invite a very big accident in an attempt to make a big voice.
Sometimes it does not even notice what are the things around it, there will be no fire.
In the days of Deepawali, news of accident, news of fire, news of dysfunction, causes great concern.
And a problem also arises that in the days of Diwali, if doctors have gone with their families to celebrate Diwali then there is a crisis in the crisis.
It is not just one day.
Say Govardhan Puja, say Bhai Dooj, say Benefit Panchami, and take it to the light festival of Kartik Purnima, in a way a long period goes on.
Along with this, we also celebrate the festival of Deepawali and also prepare for Chhath-Puja.
The festival of Chhath Puja in the eastern part of India is a big festival.
In a way, there is a great festival, it lasts for four days but it has a special feature - it gives a very deep message to the society.
But the saying is that in the world, people worship the rising sun.
Chhath-Puja is a festival in which the sun is also worshiped.
There is a great social message in it .
I would like to mention the festival of Deepawali, the festival of Chhath Puja - this is the time to convey my best wishes to all of you but at the same time there is more time for me, especially to thank the countrymen and to express my gratitude.
Over the last few months, the events that are taking shape, our army personnel are looting everything for our happiness.
My emotions and feelings are filled with the shadow of the soldiers of the army, the security forces, these sacrifices, penance, hard work and my heart.
And one of those things was done in the mind that it was dedicated to the name of Diwali security forces.
I invited the countrymen for an expedition to Sandesh to Soldiers.
But today I want to bow down my head and say that there will not be any human being in India, in whose heart there is an unprecedented love for the soldiers of the country, there is pride in the army and pride in the security forces.
The way it has been expressed, it is going to give strength to every countryman.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the security forces, we cannot imagine such a courageous person, your message has emerged as a force.
Whether it is a school, a college, a student, a village, a poor, a trader, a shopkeeper, a politician, a player, a cinematographer, there is hardly any one left behind who has not delivered the message to the soldiers of the country.
The media also reversed the occasion to express gratitude to the army and why not, whether it is BSF or CRPF or ICAI.
Whether it is Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Water Services, Army, Navy, Coast Guard, I cannot speak the names of all, countless.
When we are in the mood of the festival, remember it at the same time, a new strength comes in that memory too.
In a message, the strength increases and the country has shown taxes.
I really express my gratitude to the countrymen.
Many, who had art, did it through art.
Sandesh to Soldiers, all these things have come upon this washtag in a symbolic manner.
I have sent a poem to Mr. Ashwini Kumar Chauhan and I would like to read it.
Ashwini ji has written - I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, I am smiling, because all this is because I tell you today, the cause of my freedom is you, the cause of my happiness, I sleep peacefully, because I sleep peacefully because you are stationed on the outskirts, because you are on the outskirts of Mount Ambar and the Chaman of India bowing heads to you, the Mount Ambar and the Chaman of India bowing heads to you, the army of India are mine.
My dear countrymen, whose maternal uncle is also full of army personnel and whose in-laws are also full of army personnel, such a sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Let us hear what the army family says: - Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
The Sandesh to Soldiers campaign that has been launched on this Deepawali is giving a lot of encouragement to our army brothers.
I'm from an Army family.
My husband is also Army Officer.
Both my father and father-in-law have been Army Officers.
So, we are full of family soldiers and we have several such officers on the border who are receiving such good messages and incentives are being given to everyone in the Army Fire.
And I would like to say that along with Army Officers and Soldiers, their families and their wives also make a lot of sacrifices.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the army personnel are found standing not only on the border but on every front of their lives.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was Open Defecation Free and Open Defecation Free.
Earlier Sikkim was the province, now Himachal too is going to be the state of Kerala on 1st November.
TBP youth, Shri Vikas Thakur, originally from a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
So at that time he was going to have a village assembly in the village, he reached there and was discussing in the meeting of the village, constructing toilets and it was found that some families were not able to construct toilets due to lack of money.
This development Thakur is an integral part of our patriotism.
And only then came the power to free Himachal Pradesh Open Defecation.
Similarly, in Kerala, I really want to express my gratitude to the youth.
In my view, it was difficult to reach that village in the remote forests of Kerala, where there is no road, after walking on foot throughout the day, such a tribal panchayat Idmalakudi is also difficult to reach.
People never go
Near it, in the urban areas, the students of engineering came to know that toilets were to be constructed in this village.
NCC cadets, NSS people, students of engineering together decided that we will construct toilets.
All the things that were required to be taken for the construction of toilets, bricks, cement, all the things were lifted on their shoulders and they went to those forests on foot throughout the day.
Work is going on at a rapid pace in all the states.
I have mentioned something.
The way they have taken up this task, the entire state, I am sure that the carrosene will be free soon.
What a big change will be brought about, theft will also be stopped, the environment will also benefit, our foreign exchange will also be saved and the convenience of the people will also increase.
Yeah, if it hurts, the middlemen will be, the dishonest.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Everything should be said to the country even today, it sets the standards for how to go.
Decide on this standard.
The need of the hour is that we will have to address the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We will have to take one step after another to get rid of the problems.
Our old thinking may not be anything, but society must be freed from the distinction of son and daughter.
Now there are toilets for girls in schools and also toilets for children.
This is an opportunity for our daughters to experience discrimination-free India.
The government does not have vaccination, but even then lakhs of children are left out of vaccination and become victims of diseases.
Mission Indradhanush is a campaign of immunization that has also been launched to eradicate the deprived children, which empowers children to get rid of serious diseases.
After so many years of independence, after cooking food on a wooden stove, the poor mother should carry 400 cigarettes of smoke in her body, what will happen to her health
Trying to provide a life free of smoke to 5 crore families, we are moving forward towards success.
Small traders, small traders, sellers, sellers of vegetables, sellers of milk, runners of barber shops, moneylenders used to be trapped in the interest of the moneylenders.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana and Jan Dhan Yojana are a successful campaign to liberate the interest-employed.
The beneficiary will receive money directly from the banks through Aadhaar.
This is an opportunity to get rid of middlemen in the lives of common man.
There is a campaign in which there is no improvement and change, the path from problem to liberation is to be ensured and it is happening.
My dear countrymen, yesterday 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the great personality of this country, who had made the mantra of India, who had demonstrated the life of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
But the phone of a gentleman from Punjab, his pain, touched me too: - Prime Minister, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking Jasdeep from Punjab.
Sir, as you know, Sardar Patel's birthday is on 31st.
And as we all know how events have taken place in the country after their assassination.
Sir, I wanted to say that how can we stop such unfortunate events or events
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of one person.
One Sardar, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, history is a witness to the fact that after Chanakya, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel did the work of uniting the country.
Successful attempts to bring the freedom of India under a flag, bow down to that great man who did such a great job.
But it is also painful that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, because of his priorities of unity struggled for unity, he was also a victim of anger, but never left the path of unity.
On the birthday of that great man who lives for the sake of unity and on the birthday of Sardar, a page of oppression, history, pains us all.
But, in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of this country.
We should also avoid scattered thinking, scattered tendencies and save the country.
Sardar Saheb gave us an India, it is the responsibility of all of us to make the Best India.
The basic mantra of unity is the strong foundation of the best India.
The journey of Sardar Saheb's life began with the struggle of the farmers.
The farmer's son was.
Sardar Saheb had a very important role in bringing the freedom movement to the farmers.
Sardar Saheb's successful effort to make the freedom movement a force in the village was the result of his organisation, power and skills.
But Sardar Saheb was just a person of struggle, not so, he was also a person of structure.
Today sometimes we hear the name of Amul.
Today people are familiar with every product of Amul and even outside India.
But very few people would know that Sardar Saheb had a vision that he had imagined the unity of co-operative milk producers.
My dear countrymen, in the series of Diwali, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of light festivals.
Guru Nanak Dev, his initiation of education is a guide for the entire human race, not only for India but also for the entire human race.
Service, truth and goodwill, this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and goodwill were the only mantras.
Be it discrimination, be it superstitions or be it evils, the campaign to liberate the society was in every aspect of Guru Nanak Dev.
Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his associate when we had at the peak of the untouchables, caste system, high and low levels of its deformity.
Come, let us also, Guru Nanak Dev, who has given us the light of knowledge, who inspires us to quit discrimination, who orders us to do something against discrimination, who can be better guide than Guru Nanak Dev by taking this mantra of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas
I also salute Guru Nanak Dev Ji, this light festival is coming and I salute him from the inner world.
My dear countrymen, once again, my best wishes to the soldiers of the country on this Diwali.
Your dreams, your resolutions are successful in every way.
I convey my best wishes to you all for your life of happiness and happiness.
Thanks a lot.
In the past, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
And that is why I would like to tell the countrymen this thing today and I would like to repeat what I had said on that day that the guilty will be punished only after getting the punishment.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our army.
I would like to especially talk to the citizens of Kashmir today.
The citizens of Kashmir have started to understand the anti-national forces very well.
And as the truths have started to be understood, they have moved on the path of peace by separating themselves from such elements.
Every parent wants to work fully at the earliest as soon as possible.
The farmers are also feeling that the crops, fruits etc. are ready to reach the market across the country.
Economic business also goes well.
And in the last few days, business has started running smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the only way to solve our problems and our progress is also the path of our development.
For our future generations, we have to scale new heights of development.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem by meeting, find ways and also paves the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir, it is the responsibility of the government.
The government has to take some steps to make laws and orders.
Occasionally people who think differently from what we think are new ideas.
These days I get the opportunity to know a lot in social media.
Every corner of India gets an opportunity to know and understand the feelings of every kind of people and it promotes the strength of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harsh Vardhan of the 11th grade kept a different view before me.
He wrote that I was very distraught after the Uri terrorist attack.
But there was no way to do it and what can a small student like me do
So I came to my mind that how should I work for the country's interest.
And I resolved that I will study 3 hours a day.
I can work for the country, I will become such a worthy citizen.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, it is a matter of happiness for me that at such a young age you can imagine healthyly in this atmosphere of anger.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would also like to say that the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country has a huge value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had tried his best to touch this world of emotions in a very good manner.
And he inspired the common man of the country by giving a mantra of Jai Jawan - Jai Kisan Mantra.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had presented this thing that there is a way for every citizen to express patriotism in the midst of the sound of bombs.
Even Mahatma Gandhi, when the freedom movement was intensified and there was a need for a stoppage in the movement, he used to make very successful experiments to motivate the intensity of the movement towards constructive work within the society.
All of us, the army should take responsibility, the people sitting in the government should perform their duties and if we the countrymen, every citizen, with the strength of this patriotism, if we also make a constructive contribution then the country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T. S. Karthik wrote to me on the NarendraModiApp that the athletes who had gone to Paralympics had created history and their performance was the victory of human spirit.
Varun Viswanathan also wrote on the NarendraModiApp that our athletes have done a very good job and you should remember it in Mann Ki Baat.
You two, every individual of the country has got an emotional attachment towards our players in the Paralympics.
Perhaps more than sports, the performance of these Paralympics and our sportspersons has completely changed the attitude of humanity, the attitude of looking at the person with disabilities.
And I will never forget this thing of our winner sister Deepa Malik.
When he received the medal, he said that with this medal I have defeated the disability.
There is a lot of power in this sentence.
This time 19 athletes, including three women from our country, participated in the Paralympics.
In comparison to other sports, when Divyang plays, physical capabilities, sports skills are the biggest thing - will power, will power.
You will be pleasantly surprised to know that our sportspersons have won 4 medals in the best performance so far - 2 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze medal.
Bhai Devendra Jhajriya, who received the Gold Medal, brought him back to the Gold Medal and brought him back after 12 years.
And they were not Divya from birth.
They had to lose their hands because of the electricity current.
Just imagine, the person who attains the first gold medal at the age of 23 and at the age of 35, attains the second gold medal, has done a great job in his life.
Mariyappan won the Gold Medal at Thangavelu High Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right foot at the age of 5.
Poverty also did not come against their resolve.
Neither are they from the big city nor from the middle class rich family.
Despite leading a difficult life at the age of 21, despite physical difficulties, the country was given medals with the power of determination.
In the name of Athlete Deepa Malik, it has been associated with her name to hoist several kinds of Vijayapatakas.
Varun C. Bhati got a bronze medal in a high jump.
In our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, in our divyang brothers and sisters, these medals have done a great job to look at them.
Our sentiments have awakened, but the attitude of looking at these disabled persons has also changed.
Very few people would be aware of the kind of valour that these disabled persons have performed in the Paralympics this time.
Just a few days ago, there was an Olympics competition at the same place.
Someone can imagine that the people with disabilities also broke the record of General Olympics.
This time it has happened.
In the 1500 meter race, the kind of record that the gold medal winner had made in the lympics competition, the Algeria's Abdellati Baka made a new record in the race of 1500 meters in less than 1. 7 seconds.
Not only this, I was surprised to know that the number of persons with disabilities, who got the fourth number, who did not get any medal as a runner, had run in less time than the person who got the gold medal in general runners.
Once again, I congratulate all of our sportspersons and in the days to come, India is moving forward in the direction of formulating a smooth plan for Paralympics as well as for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari in Gujarat.
He also told me a few portions, and I presented it to the people, people were surprised.
On that day, I had the opportunity to dedicate a book and collected successful stories of the lives of some Divyangjans.
There were big motivational events.
The Government of India has recorded the world on the soil of Navsari, which I believe is important.
Within eight hours, six or six persons with disabilities, who could not hear, were successfully using machines to feed them.
He got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for us to have a 3-3 world record by the Divyangs in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on that day also I had said that cleanliness should become a habit, it should become a duty of every citizen, it should become an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt.
Now, on 2nd October, when two years are taking place, I can say with confidence that awareness of cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today we all can say that everyone has tried to move forward one step.
It means that the country has moved forward towards cleanliness.
It has also been ensured that the direction is correct, the results are so good, what is happening with some effort has also been seen and that is why everybody, be it ordinary citizens, be it government offices or roads or be it railways or be it schools or colleges or be it religious places or be it hospitals or be it children or be it the poorest of the poor or the poor, the farmers, all are contributing to cleanliness.
Media's friends have also played a positive role.
But the beginning has been good, the efforts have been immense, and we will succeed, this belief has also been created.
If we talk about rural India then so far, about two and a half million toilets have been constructed and 1. 5 crore more toilets have been constructed in the coming year.
When I had just gone to Gujarat, I was told by the officials that Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will prove the goal of Porbandar on 2nd October.
Congratulations to those who have done this work, best wishes to those who are trying to do this thing and I urge the countrymen that we have to free the country from this problem for respecting mothers and sisters and for the health of small children.
Especially I want to present a scheme for young friends who are using technology nowadays.
Everyone has the right to know about the cleanliness mission in your city and the Government of India has given a telephone number for it - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
These 1969 numbers - You will not only be able to know the condition of construction of toilets in your city by phone but also apply for the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has also appealed to the Corporate World to come forward.
Those who want to work for cleanliness should sponsor such young professionals.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Hellows.
This cleanliness drive is not just a matter of being confined to rituals.
Cleanliness becomes a habit, it is not enough.
In today's era, along with sanitation, revenue model is also essential.
Waste to Health should also be a part of it. Therefore, we have to move forward towards Waste to Compost along with Swachhta Mission.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the compost that is produced from the waste.
Provide these facilities to the farmers who want to go to organic farming.
Those who want to improve the health of their soil, those who care for the health of the soil, those who have suffered a lot due to chemical fertilizers, they should be provided with such fertilizers in certain quantities.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing a lot in this work as Brand Ambassador.
It's like doing this.
Ministers from all over the country, Chief Ministers, Mayors of metropolitan cities, Commissioners - all of them are going to contemplate only and only sanitation.
What can happen in technology
How can employment opportunities be increased in this
All topics are going to be discussed.
And I can see that there are fresh reports for cleanliness.
One day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started a Jagaran campaign to construct toilets.
He himself worked hard and contributed to the construction of nearly 9,000 toilets.
In the past, you must have seen that under the leadership of Hong Kong Commander Param Vir Singh, a team led by Devprayag from Ganga to Ganga Sagar swimmed 2800 kilometers and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made its own departments a calendar for a year.
Every department occuses 15 days especially on cleanliness.
In the coming October, from 1st to 15th October, all three of them will work together to create a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And the last two weeks of October, from October 16th to October 31st, three more departments of agriculture and farmers welfare departments of Food Processing Industries.
My citizens are also requested to associate yourself with the work that is being done by these departments.
You must have seen that a survey campaign of cleanliness is also going on these days.
Earlier, what was the situation of cleanliness by surveilling 73 cities was presented to the people of the country.
Now there is a turning point in the 500 cities with population above 1 lakh and because of this there is a belief in every city that we are left behind, now we will do something good next time.
There is an atmosphere of hygiene competition.
I hope that all of us citizens should contribute as much as possible in this campaign.
The next 2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is taking two years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali, I have been urging you to buy something or the other of Khadi.
This time too, I urge that every family should have some or the other Khadi so that the poor can get the water given by Diwali in the house.
On October 2, while Sundays, as a citizen, can we join ourselves somewhere in cleanliness
You should associate yourself with the work of cleanliness for 2 hours, 4 hours and 4 hours and I would like to tell you that you share a photo of the cleanliness drive that you are involved in.
If you are video, share video.
Look, once again this movement will get a new strength and a new pace with the efforts of our people across the country.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we pledge to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of joy in giving it to oneself, whether it is recognised or not.
It is his campaign to collect food items, clothes and all these things to the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the streets and they used to donate the old toys with the families and the toys that used to come in, they used to offer gifts in the Anganwadi of the poor settlement.
This is a kind of charity festival.
I convey my best wishes to the youth who are engaged in this work.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji is being celebrated today and the centenary year of his birth is being started from today.
The principle of Sarvajan Hitay-Sabjan Sukhay Antyodaya - this is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also used to talk about the welfare of the last person.
How can a poor person get the fruit of development
He had presented the entire financial agenda to every farm in two words.
The country celebrates their birth centenary year as a poor welfare year.
The focus should be on the benefits of society, governments, everyone's attention, development should be on the poor and only then can we get rid of poverty.
It is a symbolic form of the poor welfare year of the same century.
I salute Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji, the inspirational man of all of us, the wealthy devotee of our ideological heritage.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Vijayadashmi, I had started talking about Mann Ki Baat two years ago.
It was my authentic endeavor that Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to praise government works.
How the common man of this country keeps inspiring me.
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the manner in which you have expressed your appreciation for Mann Ki Baat, the way you have blessed me for two years this week.
I am also grateful to All India Radio that they not only broadcast these things to me but also made every effort to reach it in all languages.
I am also grateful to those countrymen who by writing letters after Mann Ki Baat, by suggesting, knocking the doors of the government, highlighting the shortcomings of the government. And All India Radio has provided platforms for solving problems by organizing special programmes on such letters.
So the matter of mind was not just a 15-20-minute dialogue, it became a new opportunity for societal transformation.
I express my gratitude and gratitude to everyone associated with making it a success.
My dear countrymen, the next week is the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja, the festival of Vijayadashmi, the preparations for Deepawali, in a way a different environment takes place across the country.
This is the festival of Shakti-Upasana, the unity of the society is the strength of the country.
Whether it is Navratri or Durga Puja, how can it be a festival of worship of Shakti, of worship of unity of society
How did the festival of connecting people become
And that is the sadhana of true power and only then can we celebrate the victory of tax together.
Come, let us practice Shakti, let us take the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on 29th August, the magician of Hockey Dhyan Chand ji is the birth date.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
I pay homage to Dhyan Chand ji and on this occasion I would like to remind all of you of his contribution.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, he played an important role in giving India the gold medal of Hockey Hockey in the Clympic Games.
We all know the name of cricket lover Bradman.
He had asked Dhyan Chand ji - We Scores goals like runs, Dhyanchand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, an opposition player killed meditation on the head of Chand ji.
There was only 10 minutes left to complete the match at that time.
And Dhyan Chand ji made three rounds in those 10 minutes and said that I gave the revenge of the injury to the round.
My dear countrymen, whenever the time comes for Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
It is a very positive thing for the common citizen to have such an attachment to the Rio Elympics, such awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to say something about it.
Outside cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports, so much awareness and so much information.
Reading this message for me, it also became a cause of great inspiration in itself.
Please speak about the education of daughters in Mann Ki Baat and their participation in sports as they have made the country proud by winning medals in Rio Olympics.
Some Mr. Sachin writes that you are requested to mention the Indus, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in the matter of this time's mind.
The medals we received, the daughters gave us.
Our daughters once again proved that they are not less than anyone in any way.
It seems as if the daughters of the entire India have taken the initiative to illuminate the country.
On MyGov, Shikhar Thakur has written that we could do even better in lympics.
He has written: Honorable Modi sir, congratulations for the first two medals we won in Rio.
But I want to draw your attention to whether our performance was really good
And the answer is, no.
We need to travel a long way in sports.
Our parents still insist on focusing on studies and academics.
Sports is still considered a waste of time in society.
We need to change this thinking.
Society needs motivation.
And no one can do this work well with you.
Someone like this has written on NarendraModiApp that there is a need to focus on extra-curricular activities especially children and youth by taking up sports.
In a way thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
It can not be ruled out that we can not perform as per our hopes.
In some cases, it also happened that our sportspersons who used to perform in India, those who used to perform in sports here could not even reach there and only two medals were found in the medal table.
But it is also true that even if you look at medals, for the first time in many subjects, Indian players have shown a very good performance.
Now look, within the shooting, our innovative Bindra ji was in fourth place and he missed the medal by a very small margin.
In Gymnastic, Deepa Karmakar also did wonder - she was in fourth place, she missed medal due to very small differences.
But how can we forget this thing that she is the first Indian daughter to be qualifying for lympics and for lympic finals
Something similar happened in Tennis with the pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
We performed well this time in the athletics.
After P. T. Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar quoted Track Field Finals.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, the women's hockey team reached the lympics.
Vikas Krishna Yadav in Boating reached Curter-inal but could not find Bronze.
Many players, for example - Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das are many names, whose performances are good.
But my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we continue to do the same thing, then perhaps we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a commitment.
The government of India will go into its depths and will study what kind of practices are happening in the world.
We will create a roadmap for what we can do well.
2020, 2024, 2028 - We have to plan with a far-reaching thinking.
I also urge the state governments to make such committees and what can we do within the world of sports, what can each of our states do
And I urge every citizen of India to send suggestions on NarendraModiApp to those who are interested in it.
Write to the government, discuss the association and give your memorandum to the government.
State governments should send their suggestions by discussing.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teachers Day.
I also learned a lot from these small children.
For me, there was also 5th September Teachers Day and for me there was also Education Day.
But this time I have to go for the G-20 Summit so I felt that today I can express this feeling in my mind.
The place of mother in life is as much as the teacher's place.
And we have seen teachers who are more concerned about themselves than themselves.
They spend their lives for their disciples, for their students.
These days, after Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichand ji is discussed all around.
They are players, but they have presented an example of what a good teacher is.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher from a sportsperson.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji, his penance, his dedication towards sports and his way of enjoying the success of my students.
Teacher's contribution in our lives is always felt.
5th September is the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, former President of India and the country celebrates it as Teachers Day.
He reached any place in life, but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Sometimes I think, I remember so many stories of my teachers because they used to be our ero in our small villages.
But today I can say with joy that one of my teachers - now she is 90 years old - I receive her letter every month.
And Im surprised that even at the age of 90, he writes with such beautiful letters and my own letters are very bad. Because of this, whenever I see somebody's good letters, I get a lot of respect in my mind.
You must share something inspiring about NarendraModiApp, your teacher, your teacher, your teacher.
Look, it is also very valuable to see the contribution of the teacher in the country from the point of view of the students.
My dear countrymen, the Ganesh festival is going to come in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a disturber and we all want our country, our society, our family, our every person and his life to remain uninterrupted.
But when Ganesh talks about the festival, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh Utsav - this is the responsibility of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Through the public Ganesh Utsav, he made this religious occasion a festival of national awakening and made it a festival of social rituals.
And through the public Ganesh Utsav, there is a wide range of discussions on issues that touch socio-economic life and programmes should be created so that the society gets a new energy and a new momentum.
Even today, public Ganesh festivities have started in every corner of India, not just Maharashtra.
All the youngsters make a lot of preparations to do this, there is a lot of enthusiasm.
And some people have still made a lot of effort to follow the spirit that Lokmanya Tilak ji had kept.
They hold discussions on public subjects, essay competitions, colorful competitions.
They also highlight the issues that touch the society in a very artistic manner.
In a way, a big campaign of public education runs through the public Ganesh festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspirational mantra that Swaraj is our birth right.
Suraj should be our priority. Can we not send messages from the public Ganesh Utsav on this mantra
Let me invite you.
It is true that the festival is the power of the society.
The festival fills a new life in the life of the individual and society.
Life is impossible without celebration, but it has to be molded as per the demand of time.
This time I have seen that many people have written a lot about Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
And they are worried about the environment.
Someone has done the compassionate work of Shankar Narayana, he has urged people not to use the idols of Ganesh ji made from the Plaster of Paris.
Why not use the village pond made of soil Ganesh ji
The statues made of POP are not favorable to the environment.
They have expressed a lot of pain, others have also done it.
I also pray to all of you, why not come back to that old tradition of ours by using the soil and the idols of Ganesh and Durga.
It is the service of God that protects the environment, protects our rivers and ponds and protects the small creatures of this water from pollution.
Ganesh ji is a disorder.
So we should not make such a Ganesh ji who creates disruption.
I don't know how you'll take these things.
Many such institutions and individuals work very hard for the soil.
Co-friendly Ganeshotsav - this is also a social service.
There is still time between Durga Puja.
Now we should decide that the idols that our old families used to build will also get employment and if they will be made from the soil of the pond or river then they will get it again and it will also protect the environment.
My best wishes to you all for Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa will be conferred the title of Saint on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had put her whole life in India to serve the poor.
When Mother Teresa gets the title of Saint, it is natural for all Indians to be proud.
An official delegation led by our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will also be sent there on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
We have to learn something from saints, sages, sages, saints and great men every moment.
We will continue to find something or the other, we will continue to learn and do something good.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then how big a change comes.
Manpower is considered to be the form of God.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments in the past, made a successful effort to connect people to clean Ganga, to clean Ganga.
On 20th of this month, those people were invited to Allahabad who were the heads of the villages living on the banks of the Ganges.
There were also men, women were also.
They came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of Ganga coast took oath in the testimony of Ma Ganga that they would immediately stop the tradition of open defecation in their villages of the Ganges coast, run a campaign to build toilets and the village will contribute completely in the cleaning of the Ganga. That the village will not allow the Ganges to be dirty.
I congratulate these Prime Ministers for coming to Allahabad for this resolution, someone from Uttarakhand, someone from Uttar Pradesh, someone from Bihar, someone from Jharkhand, someone from West Bengal, someone from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India and the Ministers who have fulfilled this vision.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the 5 states that they took an important step in cleaning the Ganga by adding manpower.
My dear countrymen, sometimes some things touch me a lot and I have a special respect for those people who imagine it.
On July 15, more than a million students of more than seventeen-hundred schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote a letter to their parents.
Someone wrote in English, someone wrote in Hindi, someone wrote in Chhattisgarhi, he wrote a letter to his parents and said that there should be toilet in our house.
These children from seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
And it had such an impact that it was so emotional that after receiving the letter, when the school came to power the next day, the parents handed him a letter to the Teacher and the parents had promised that he would make a toilet by the date of completion.
Congratulations to those who have made this imagination, those students who have made this effort and special congratulations to those parents who have decided to make their child's letter seriously and to make a toilet.
That's what inspires us.
Mallamma, a daughter of sixteen years of age in Koppal district of Karnataka, in this district, made a satyagraha against her family.
They say that they had left their food and that too not to ask for anything for themselves, not to bring good clothes, not to eat sweets, but daughter Mallamma's insistence that there should be toilet in our house.
Now there was no financial condition of the family, the daughter was stuck on Jid, she was not ready to leave her satyagraha.
When Mohammed Shafi, the head of the village, came to know that Mallamma had done Satyagraha for toilet, then see the specialty of Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village, that he had waited for eighteen thousand rupees and made a toilet within a week.
Look at the strength of this daughter Mallamma's insistence and look at the head of the village like Mohammad Shafi.
How the paths are opened to solve the problems, this is the manpower.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become determined.
Some Indians have made it their target.
But everyone is associated with it in some form or the other, everyone is contributing.
His competition will be held and those who will be victorious on 2nd October Gandhi Jayanti will be rewarded.
Hey, nowadays, you can also make a film with your Mobile Phone Camera.
Come, go ahead, you are my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried that our relations with our neighbours should be deep, our relations should be smooth and our relations should be alive.
A very important thing happened in the past, our President Pranab Mukherjee launched a new program in Kolkata, the All India Radio Friendship Channel.
Now many people will feel that the President should also inaugurate the Channel of a Radio
But this is not the channel of ordinary Radio, it is a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
So here, All India Radio Friendship and Bangladesh wireless, they will share content among themselves and on both sides Bengali-speaking people will enjoy All India Radio.
All India Radio has contributed immensely to People to People Contact.
The President launched it.
I also thank Bangladesh for joining us for this work.
I also congratulate the friends of All India Radio that they are also contributing in foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the job of a good Prime Minister but finally I am a person like you.
And sometimes emotional events touch me a bit more.
Such emotional events also give new energy, new inspiration and this is what inspires the people of India to do something or the other.
In the past, I got such a letter, touched my mind.
A mother, about 84, who is a retired teacher, wrote this letter to me.
Had he not forbidden me to declare my name in his letter, I would have liked to talk to you by giving him a name and he wrote a letter that when you had appealed to leave the gas subsidy then I had left the gas subsidy and later I had forgotten it.
For me, the letter of the Prime Minister of India is not less than a Padma Shri.
Friends, you would be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those people who have left the gas subsidy and some of my representatives should go to Rubberu and give them a letter.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
Under the same scheme, my letter came to this mother and she wrote to me that you are doing a good job.
Your campaign to free the poor mothers from stove smoke and that is why I am a retired teacher and within a few years my age will be 90 years. I am sending you a donation of Rs. 50,000 so that you can work to free such poor mothers from the smoke of stove.
You can imagine that as an ordinary teacher, a mother who passes on retired pension gives 50 thousand rupees to free mothers and sisters from stove smoke and gas connection.
The question is not about 50 thousand rupees, the question is of the feeling of that mother and such mothers and sisters are their blessings so that my country becomes confident and empowered for its future.
And he did not even write to me as the Prime Minister, he wrote a simple letter - Modi Bhaiya.
I salute that mother and I salute all those daughters of India who have been suffering themselves and always do something for the benefit of somebody.
My dear countrymen, we were troubled last year due to famine but this month of August was filled with the difficulties of floods.
There were frequent floods in some parts of the country.
The state governments, the central government, the local Swaraj organisations, the social institutions and the citizens have made every effort to do whatever they can.
But even among the news of these floods, there were reports that needed to be remembered more.
What is the strength of unity, what can be the result if we move together
This will be remembered in August this year.
In August 2016, a large number of political parties, non-avoidable parties against each other and nearly 90 parties across the country, a large number of parties and all the parties have passed the GST Act together.
Its credit goes to all parties.
And this is an example of the great work that happens when all the teams work together in one direction.
Similarly, in relation to the situation in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together talked about Kashmir with one voice.
He also conveyed the message to the world, also conveyed the message to the separatist elements and expressed our condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
And we all believe that everybody from the head of the village to the Prime Minister is of the opinion that if anyone knows about Kashmir, whether it is of a young man or a security worker, it is ours, it is ours, it belongs to ourselves, it belongs to our country.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by moving forward these small children, sometimes they will have to answer these innocent children too.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big, it is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, we all have the responsibility of giving more strength to unity, expose more and then make the country a bright future.
I have faith in the power of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Thank you very much today.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, this morning, I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi. And I believe that in the days to come, the color of sports will paint every young man with enthusiasm.
We all know that within a few days, the world's largest sports event is going to be the Mahakumbh.
Rio is going to resonate in our ears.
Our hopes and expectations are very much, but the people of the 125 crore countrymen have the task of encouraging those players and those who have been engaged in sports in Rio.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India organized a big event in Run for Rio, Khelo and Jio, Khelo and Khilo.
In the coming days, wherever we may be, we should do something to encourage our sportspersons.
No matter how much hobby of eating, everything has to be left.
I am ready to do this work on your behalf.
The Prime Minister of India is ready to become a postman to deliver your message to these players.
If there is no research and innovation then just as the stagnant water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a burden.
And if we continue to live without research and innovation in the old technology, then we will be out of time in the changing era. And that is why the government has also taken several steps for this thing.
And that is why I say - Let us aim to innovate and when I say Let us aim to innovate, then my AIDS will be innovative.
If we want to prepare the next generation innovators then our children will have to be associated with it and that is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
10 lakh will be given to those schools where there will be such tinkering absentablishments and Rs. 10 lakh will be given to them for maintenance in five years.
If we have a strong and prosperous Incubation Centre then a system is available for innovation, for start-ups, for experimenting and bringing it to a position.
In the same way, India is facing many problems.
We have problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find technological solutions.
We have called upon an Atal Grand Challenges to the younger generation of the country to find solutions to the problems, find ways of technology, research and innovation.
The Government of India wants to promote the technology discovered to solve our problems by giving special awards.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were worrying about famine and these days it is also enjoying rain and the news of floods is also coming up.
The State Government and the Central Government are working together to assist the flood victims.
Because of the rains, every heart, every human mind gets overwhelmed due to some difficulties because our entire economic activity has rains and cultivation.
Sometimes there is a disease that we regret for life.
Engue can be avoided.
Keep in mind a little bit of hygiene, be a little cautious and try to stay safe, pay special attention to the children. And this is not the idea that such a disease occurs in a poor settlement.
Engue comes first in a comfortable and prosperous area and therefore we understand it.
You must have seen advertising on TV but sometimes we remain indifferent to awareness on it.
The government, the hospital, the doctors, they will certainly do their job but we should not enter the engagement in our house, in our locality, in our family and be cautious about the diseases caused by water.
I want to draw your attention towards another trouble, my dear countrymen.
Life has become so embarrassing, it has become so raceless that sometimes we dont have time to think for ourselves.
When he becomes ill, he feels like healing quickly and hence someone takes antibiotics and puts them in his body.
Immediately one gets rid of the disease but my dear countrymen, these pathways can create a grave crisis in the habit of taking antibiotics.
You may be relieved for a few moments, but without the advice of the doctors, we stop taking antibiotics.
I urge you to complete the course of the day the doctor has asked you to take.
The bacteria that spread TB and malaria are bringing about such changes in themselves at a rapid pace that medicines have no effect.
In medical terms it is called antibiotic resistance and therefore it is equally important to follow the rules of antibiotics.
When it comes to health, I want to add one more thing.
Sometimes there is a lot of anxiety about the lives of those mothers who are pregnant in our country.
About 30 million women in our country undergo pregnancy every year, but some mothers die at the time of delivery, sometimes mother dies, sometimes the child dies, sometimes both the child and the mother die.
It is true that in the last decade, the rate of untimely death of mother has come down, but even today, a large number of pregnant mothers are not able to save their lives.
During or after pregnancy, blood deficiency, childbirth infection, high BP - When does not know which problem destroy her life
Keeping these in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Under this campaign, on the 9th of every month, all pregnant women will be checked free of cost in government health centers.
The lives of both mothers and children can be saved. And I specially congratulate the Gynecologyists that you cannot serve the poor mothers for free on 9th of the month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not spend twelve days in a year for the poor
I am sure you will join.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is discussed collectively in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
Even in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna talks about the tree, worrying about the tree in the battlefield also means that we can guess how much its importance will be.
In the Gita, Lord Krishna says - Ashwatha: I am Peepal in all the trees.
Venus has been stated in the policy - Nasti original Anushadhan - There is no plant in which there is no medicinal properties.
He gives a wire to the tree, like a tree, in the world as well.
Therefore, parents who wish for their welfare plant good trees and follow their children.
Whether it is our scriptures or lyrics or thanksgivings or the discipline of the Mahabharata - there are some people in today's generation who live up to these ideals.
A few days ago, an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, came to my mind.
In the Discipline Festival of the Mahabharata, it is said that the tree also fulfills the responsibilities of the child in the world and Sonal has taken the lead not only in fulfilling the wishes of his parents but also in fulfilling the wishes of the society.
Khandu Maruti Mahatre, a farmer of Narayanpur village in Junnar taluka of Pune in Maharashtra, married his granddaughter Sonal in a big motivational way.
Such a scene that touched the mind was in that picture.
This idea came to him and presented mango plants at the wedding. See how beautiful the love of nature has emerged.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became an immortal saga of love and I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Mr. Mahatre for this innovative endeavour.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there used to be a large number of pedestrians visiting the temple of Ambaji in the month of Bhadra. Once a social worker organization decided that those who would come to the temple, they would plant the prasad in the temple and would ask them that look, this is the prasad of mother Ji, this plant will be made big by visiting their village and mother will continue to bless you.
I repeatedly tell the farmer brothers that we waste our land by putting fences on the edge of our fields, why dont we cultivate timber instead of that fence.
Today, India has to bring billions of trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions from abroad to build a home.
If we plant such trees at the edge of our farm, which will be used at the edge of our farm, then after fifteen-twenty years we can sell them by cutting them off from the government's permission.
In the past, several states have launched a lot of campaigns using this season, the Government of India has also passed an AMPLA law, due to which more than forty thousand crore states are going to go for plantation.
I have been told that the Maharashtra government has planted nearly two and a half million saplings in the entire state on 1st July and next year they have pledged to plant three crore saplings.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Desert Festival - this is a big festival and we have resolved to plant twenty five lakh saplings.
Twenty-five lakh plants in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they know that how much great work has been done.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover city percent till Twenty Two-Nine (2029).
There is also a very bright tradition of Van Mahotsav in Gujarat.
This year, Gujarat has taken up a number of projects like Amra Forest, Ekta Forest, Shaheed Forest - as a Van Mahotsav and has launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I am unable to mention all the states, but are eligible for congratulations.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa in the past.
This was my first visit and when it is on a foreign trip then it is diplomacy, trade and security issues are discussed, there are several Moses - all this is going to happen.
But for me, the journey of South Africa was a pilgrimage.
When we recall South Africa, it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When these words fall on the ears of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world, Gandhi and Mandela - their faces appear before us.
During my South Africa tour, I had visited Phoeni Setlement, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I was also fortunate to have got the opportunity to travel through the train in which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and the train that was launched to make a Mohandas Mahatma Gandhi.
But what I want to say, this time I got the opportunity to meet the dignitaries who had spent their youth for equality, for equal opportunity and for the society.
He had fought with Nelson Mandela shoulder to shoulder. He had spent twenty-twenty years in prisons with Nelson Mandela.
In a way, he had sacrificed his entire youth and had the privilege of visiting Mr. Ahmad Kathara, a close associate of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Laloo Chiba, Mr. George Bios, Ronnie Casrills.
Original Indians, but wherever they went, they were ready to live for those who lived among them.
On their faces, even after doing such a great penance, it was not visible anywhere.
A kind of duties that were not described as the symptoms of duty in the Gita, they appeared to be absolutely realistic.
My mind will always remember that meeting - equality and equal opportunity.
There can be no bigger mantra for any society and government.
Equality and maternity are the only ways that lead us towards a bright future.
Want a good future for children.
The priorities will vary, but the path is the same and that is the path of development, equality, equality of opportunity, equality and maternal feeling.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have lived the original mantras of our lives in South Africa.
Being a woman, I'm sorry for her family.
And as technology is doing a very big role in the economic system, its misusers also come to the ground.
Sometimes you might be confused and they write to you in such a wonderful manner as if it is the right letter.
Your credit card number, debit card number and your account becomes empty through technology.
This is a fraud in a new way, this is a digital fraud.
I believe that there should be avoidance of this fascination and there should be some kind of falsehood, then we should share our friends and friends and make them aware.
I would like that Shilpi Verma has brought good things to my mind and you would have experienced that, but perhaps you would not have seen it so seriously, but I feel that there is a need to look at it.
My dear countrymen, while the Parliament session is going on these days, I also get the opportunity to meet several people of the country during the session of Parliament.
But these days I had a pleasant experience.
Some students of Aligarh came to me.
Artificial paintings have been done at the station.
Moreover, the plastic bottles or oil cans that were lying in the garbage were collected by them by searching them and by planting them with soil and planting them they made vertical gardens.
And in a way this vertical garden has been created in the plastic bottles towards the railway station and it has been transformed into a new form.
If you ever go to Aligarh, then definitely look at the station.
Nowadays, I am getting the news from several railway stations in India that local people are identifying their area on the walls of railway stations through their art.
A newness is feeling.
This is an example of how a change can be brought about by public participation.
Congratulations to all those working in this manner in the country, special greetings to my colleagues from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with you, you are also celebrating festivals in our country.
Festivals will be celebrated in temples, in worship places and you will also be associated with the festival outside the house.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a special festival here.
Like last year, can not you offer Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of your country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
Just imagine, give such a gift to the sister who will really protect her in life.
And I am the first Prime Minister of India to be born in a free India.
75 years of uit India and 70 years of India's independence can give us new inspiration, new zeal and an opportunity to do something for the country.
The whole country should be colored with the colour of freedom fighters and feel the fragrance of freedom all around.
This environment should not be a government programme, it should be for the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope that you too will do something good related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Send his picture to the NarendraModi App.
Make an environment in the country.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, I get a good opportunity to talk to the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
There will be some things in your mind that you would like to keep your point as intensely from the Red Fort.
I invite you, the ideas that come to your mind, who feels that as your representative, as your Principal Servant, I should tell you this thing from the Red Fort, you must write and send me.
Whatever is spoken from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is a matter of 1. 25 billion Indians.
I invite you, let us remember the virtues of the freedom fighters, let us remember the great men who spent their lives for India and take a pledge to do something for the country.
Greetings to all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
I am also grateful to All India Radio for their successful efforts to present this mind in regional languages at 8. 00 pm.
And I am also happy that those who listen to me later convey their feelings to me through letters, telephones, through MyGov website, through Narendra Modi App.
Many of your things help me in the work of the government.
My interaction with you people and this relationship is very useful for the welfare of the people.
I hope that you will surely strengthen the democracy by becoming more active and democracies with public participation.
The heat is increasing.
Nearly the maximum part of the country is experiencing heat fire.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The forests were reduced, the trees were cut off and in a way mankind destroyed nature and paved the way for its own destruction.
5th June is World Environment Day.
There are discussions and concerns for the environment all over the world.
This time, United Nations has put this topic on ero Tolerance for Film Film Film Trade on World Environment Day.
It will definitely be discussed, but we have to discuss trees and plants, we have to discuss water and how to increase our forests.
Because you must have seen the fire in the forests in Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir and Himalayan lapses in the past.
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha - I could have done a meeting of all the drought-hit states, but I did not do so.
What the states have to say, listen to them closely.
Normally, how much money was spent by the government of India and how much it was spent - it does not matter much closely.
It was also surprising for the officials of the Government of India that several states have made excellent efforts in water, in terms of environment, in dealing with the situation of drought, for the animals, for the affected human beings and in a way, in every corner of the country, the government of any party came to realise that there was a focus on this problem, in the long-term situation, what should be the permanent solutions, what should be the permanent treatment.
In a way, it was a learning experience for me and I have asked my NITI Aayog to work on how to take the best practices in all the states.
Some states, particularly Andhra Pradesh, have made a lot of use of technology.
I would like to further convey the special success of the States through NITI Aayog to us and the States.
Public participation is the basis for great success in solving such problems.
As we go to the temple, give a prasad and even a little prasad falls, there is an annoyance in the mind.
Take him up and ask forgiveness from God five times.
This water is also God's offerings.
If a drop is also ruined, then we should have pain.
And that is why water conservation is equally important and water irrigation is equally important. Therefore, per drop-more crop, micro-irrigation and minimum water crops.
Now it is heartening to note that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, someone is using drip-irrigation and someone is doing sprinklers.
When I was sitting with the states, some states have successfully used drip-irrigation for paaddy and rice cultivation and due to this their yields also increased, water was also saved and wages also decreased.
When I heard from these states, there are several states that have taken bigger targets, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have done a great job in drip irrigation and they have tried to add 2-3 lakh hectares each year to micro-irrigation.
If this campaign is going on in all the states then farming will also benefit greatly and water will also be accumulated.
Our Telangana brothers have tried to utilize the water of Godavari and Krishna rivers very well through Mission Bhagirathi.
Andhra Pradesh has also tried to use technology and ground water recharge in the Neeru Pragati Mission.
People are also sweating and giving money in the mass movement that Maharashtra has created.
I realize that this movement will really be of great help to save Maharashtra from the future crisis.
Chhattisgarh has launched Loksuraj - Jalsuraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh's Balram Talab Scheme - nearly 22 thousand Talabs are not small statistics
Rajasthan and Gujarat, where there are older Bawdias, have launched a big campaign to revive them as a water temple.
Rajasthan has launched the Chief Minister's Water Supply Campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas, where there is a problem of water.
He has launched a massive campaign of heck farm.
They have tried to stop water.
Some states have made small obstacles in the rivers and have launched a campaign to stop ten-ten, twenty-two kilometers of water.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that this June, July, August, September - we decide, even a drop of water will not be wasted.
And this is not just a matter of farmers
This is a matter related to everybody in the villages, poor, labourers, farmers, urban, rural, rich and poor. Therefore, if the rainy season is coming, water should be our priority. And this time when we celebrate Diwali, we should also enjoy how much water we saved, how much water we saved.
You see, our happiness will increase manifold.
What a precious treasure is given by God
Media gave a detailed account of the problem of water in the past.
I hope that Media should guide people in the direction of saving water, run a campaign and become a media partner for the everlasting emancipation of water crisis. I invite them too.
My dear countrymen, we have to make a modern India.
We have to create a transparent India.
We have to bring a lot of systems from one corner to the other, so our old habits will have to change a bit.
Today, I want to touch upon a topic on which if you help me, we can successfully move forward in that direction.
If you want salt, then give such a vegetable in return.
Business used to run from the barter system itself.
But now the time has changed.
The whole world is moving towards cashless society.
We can also get the money and also pay the money through the electronic technology system.
You can buy things, you can pay the bill.
And this will never raise the question of stealing wallets from ab.
There will not be any concern about accounting, automatic accounting will remain.
The beginning will be a bit difficult, but once it is a habit, then this system will become easier.
And this is the possibility that the bank accounts of nearly all the families of the country have been opened by the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana.
We can move forward towards this cashless society while coordinating with the Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM), JAM.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given along with Jan-Chan account.
In the coming days, this card is going to be used both for credit and debit.
I don't need to get the money out of the zab, count it out.
There is no need to roam together.
Whatever initiatives have been taken by the Government of India, how to pay the payment through a PSU
It will be very easy to manage through your mobile phones and it is a matter of happiness that NPIC will be able to transact.
In a way, the bank has worked in that direction at your doorstep.
Post Office has also been alerted for banking services.
If we learn to use these systems and get used to it then we will not need this currency, we will not need the notes, we will not need the money, the business will run automatically and it will lead to a transparency.
Look, once we start, we will move forward very easily.
Twenty years ago, who had thought that so many mobile phones would be in our hands.
Gradually became a habit, now he can not live without it.
It may be that this cashless society also takes the same form but it will be better if it happens in a short time.
My dear countrymen, whenever there are games of Elympics and when the games start, then we sit in front of our heads.
Everyone in their own way has encouraged and encouraged our sportspersons going for Rio Olympics.
Write a song, create a cartoon, give a message of good wishes, someone encourages a game but the entire country should create a very positive atmosphere towards these players.
The results that will come - will come.
It becomes a very powerful force in itself. When the player feels that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with him then he gets encouragement.
I had spoken for the Under-17 World Cup and the suggestions I received from all over the country and these days I have seen that an atmosphere of Cootball has started to appear in the entire country.
Many people are making their own teams by taking initiatives.
I have received thousands of suggestions on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Perhaps, a lot of people would not be playing, but it was a pleasant experience for me that there is so much interest in the sports of thousands and millions of youth of the country.
We know the attachment of cricket and India, but I have seen that such an attachment to the football also indicates a very happy future in itself.
So, in the days to come, we will create an atmosphere of zeal and enthusiasm towards all our sportspersons who are eligible for rio lympics.
Everything should not be done by the test of victory and defeat.
With the sportsman spirit, India has made its mark in the world.
I appeal to the countrymen to do something to create an atmosphere of zeal and enthusiasm for our sportspersons.
New results are coming from somewhere or the other for the last eight-ten days.
I am talking about those students who worked hard throughout the year, who gave an exam, who gave a reward of 10th, 12th, one after the other.
It is clear that our daughters are showing valour.
It's a pleasure.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to those who have succeeded in these results.
Once again I would like to tell those who have not succeeded that there is a lot to do in life.
If the result has not come according to our wishes, then no life is stuck.
We should live with confidence, we should move ahead with confidence.
But a big new kind of question has come to me and I had never thought about this.
But I was surprised that everybody in the house told me this thing, hey man, four marks used to come more, you would get 90 percent.
That is, my family and my friend, my teacher no one was happy with my 89. 33 percent marks.
Everyone was telling me, man, you've got 90 percent for four marks.
Now I cannot understand how to handle such a situation.
Is this everything in life
What did I do, wasn't it good
Did I fall even less
I don't know, I have a burden on my mind.
I have read your letter very carefully and I feel that perhaps this pain is not only for you but also for millions and millions of students like you because an atmosphere has become such that finding dissatisfaction with it rather than satisfaction with what has happened. This is another form of negativity.
We can never take the society towards satisfaction by finding dissatisfaction from everything.
It would have been better if your family, your friends and friends had praised your 89. 33 percent, then you would have thought of doing more by yourself.
He has also written to me Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur, about this way.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
I don't remember poetry completely, but I had read it a long time ago, a poet had written that I made a picture of pain on the anvas of life.
I wish, even a single spectator on the picture of my pain would have shed tears.
This was the word of poetry, I do not remember it anymore, but it was a long time ago, but this was the emotion.
There is a burden on you to fulfill the expectations of the people.
I will only say to you that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses expectations, keep listening but keep on talking about yourself and try to do something better.
But if you do not satisfy what you have received, you will never be able to build a new building.
The strong foundation of success becomes the basis of big success.
The dissatisfaction that has arisen out of success cannot make a ladder for success, it becomes a guarantee of failure.
But I want to say this thing more than neighbours and parents and companions that please do not impose your expectations on them by pleasing with your children.
Friends, did sometimes fail in life, does that life fail
Whoever cannot bring good marks in the exam, he goes a long way in sports, he goes ahead in music, he goes ahead in artwork, he goes ahead in business.
God has given everyone a wonderful mode.
Just recognise your inner strength, emphasize that you will move forward.
And it happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument named Santoor.
There was a time when the santoor instrument was attached to the folk music in the valley of Kashmir.
But there was a Pandit Shiv Kumar, who handled him and today made an important instrument of the world.
The clarinet clarinet was in a limited place in the entire region of our music.
Most of the courts of kings and princes used to have their place on their gates.
But when Ustad Bismillah Khan handled the clarinet, today became the best instrument in the world, it has become an identity.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that the expenditure on the health of our poor families also imbalances the path of life.
And it is true that the cost of not getting sick is very low, but the cost of getting healthy after getting sick is very high.
Why should we not live such a life so that there is no disease, there is no financial burden on the family.
One is the biggest basis for saving cleanliness from disease.
If someone can do the biggest service of the poor, then he can do cleanliness.
And the second one for which I constantly urge them is Yoga.
Some people also call him Yoga.
21st June is International Yoga Day.
There is also an attraction for yoga all over the world and the world has accepted it.
Our ancestors have a valuable gift to us, which we have given to the world.
The world with stress gives the strength to live a balanced life.
Prevention is better than cure. Being healthy in the life of a person associated with Yoga, being balanced, wealthy of a strong will, a life full of immense self-confidence, concentration in every work - these are easy achievements.
21st June - Yoga Day, this is not just an event, it should be expanded, it should become its place in the lives of every person, every person should spend 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes in his daily routine.
And for this 21st June Yoga Day inspires us.
And sometimes the collective environment becomes the cause of change in the life of a person.
See, do it in your village, do it in your neighborhood, do it in your city, in your school, in institution, in even seven offices.
Start a month from now, look, you will become a partner on 21st June.
I have read several times that Yoga and Pranayama are collective in several offices as soon as they get regularly in the morning, the efficiency of the entire office increases so much that the culture of the entire office changes and the environment changes.
You must join that day, the whole world is going to do Yoga.
It is my request that you should not be left behind.
Being healthy is very important for making India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I constantly associate with you with Mann Ki Baat.
Dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hello.
Talk of mind, April 2016
Please change this condition, Ravi ji has expressed his anger, but I believe that perhaps he is not angry with me, he is angry at the situation.
P.
J.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that print only positive news on the first page of the newspaper, he used to keep saying this thing continuously. A few days ago, a newspaper had written to me and he had said that we have decided that on Monday we will not give any negative news, we will give positive news.
This time also I saw a lot of letters, comments, phone calls have been received. There are so many stories, suggestions, motivations. Everyone wants to do something or the other.
You will remember the last time I had talked about a book on Premchand ji's stories and we had decided to share with everyone through the NarendraModi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people have shared information on a variety of books
I was glad that people are discussing books written on subjects like science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business, lifestyle and so on.
Some people have also advised me to talk about many more books
But one thing I have to admit is that I ' m not able to spend too much time reading books
But one advantage has been that if you send by writing then I have got the opportunity to know about many books.
But with this experience of the last one month, I feel that we have to take it forward.
Why shouldn't we create a special books corner on the NarendraModi App and whenever we read a new book, write it there, discuss it and you can suggest a good name for our books corners.
Friends, It seems that when I touched this point in the matter of water conservation, but perhaps today I am feeling that water conservation was a touching subject of your heart, it was a favourite subject of the common man.
And I am feeling that these days the hearts of India have shaken the issue of water.
Several scholarly and effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation
People have shared information about traditional methods.
Media has launched several innovative campaigns on water conservation
The government, the NGOs are doing something or the other at the war level.
Looking at the strength of collectivity, it feels very good and satisfying.
Villagers donated labour and gave a definite direction to the waterfall flowing from the mountain.
That too pure indigenous way
This has not only prevented soil erosion and waste of crops, but the fields are also getting water.
You will be happy to know that the beautiful state of North East, Meghalaya has become the first state in the country which has developed its water policy and water policy.
I congratulate the government there
In Haryana, the cultivation of crops that require less water and farmers also do not suffer.
I would particularly like to congratulate the Government of Haryana for communicating with the farmers, inspiring them to move from conventional farming to low-water crops.
Now it is time for festivals .
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals .
Why not use these fairs for water conservation
People from all sections of society reach fairs .
We can deliver the message of water conservation in these fairs in a very effective manner, exhibitions, street plays, festivals as well as message of water conservation.
Friends, Some things in life fill us with enthusiasm and especially the achievements of the children, their exploits, give us a new energy and that is why today I feel like talking about some children and these children are Nidhi Bipotu, Monish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronyatesh Ganguly and Hrithik Al-Manda.
You will also be filled with pride and zeal by what I will tell you about them.
We all know that cancer is a word that scares the whole world
It seems, standing at the door of death, but all these ten children, in the battle of their lives, have not only defeated the deadly disease of cancer, but have also illuminated India's name throughout the world with their exploits.
In sports, we often see that players become champions after winning tournaments or winning medals, but this was a rare occasion where these people were champions before participating in the sports competition and that too the champions of the war of life.
In fact, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow this month.
This is a unique sports tournament in which young cancer survivors, who have emerged fighting cancer in their lives, take part.
Competitions like Shooting, Hess, Swimming, Running, Cootball and Table Tennis were organized in this competition.
All these 10 champions of our country have won medals in this tournament.
Some of these players won medals in more than one game .
In fact, 2019 has been a very good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists had launched A-Sat in March and after that there was not much discussion about the big and important news like A-Sat during the Chandrayaan-II elections.
While we achieved the ability to kill Satellite, three hundred kilometers away, from the A-Sat missile, in just three minutes.
India became the fourth country to achieve this achievement and now, on 22nd July, the entire nation saw with pride how Chandrayaan-II moved from Sriharikota towards space.
Photos of the launch of Chandrayaan II filled the countrymen with pride and zeal and joy.
Chandrayaan-two, this mission is special in many ways.
Chandrayaan-two, will further clarify our understanding of the moon
This will give us more detailed information about the moon. But if you ask me what two major lessons I got from Chandrayaan-II, then I would say that these two lessons are aith and earlessness.
We must rely on our talents and capacities, believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be glad to know that Chandryan 2 is completely Indian.
It's Indian with Heart and Spirit
is a fully indigenous mission
This mission has once again proved that when it comes to doing something new in the new field, it has been decided to do something new.
The way our scientists, in record time, day and night, by correcting all the technical issues, have launched the Chandryan-II, it is unprecedented in itself.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists
It should be a matter of pride for all of us , and , despite the disruptions , they did not change their time .
We have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but, always remember, we have the power to overcome it within us.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share information about a very interesting competition with the student friends and young friends of the country, about competition, and invite young women from the country.
I urge young colleagues, students to participate in this uiz Competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with their stake.
I urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their school victorious.
For these victorious students, it will be a historic event in their lives. But for this, you will have to take part in the uiz Competition, get the highest marks, you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have observed one thing.
Our mindset has given momentum to the cleanliness drive from time to time and similarly efforts towards cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago today is setting new benchmarks of cleanliness with the participation of the people.
Its not that we have achieved an ideal status in cleanliness, but the way we have achieved success in the cleanliness drive in public places, it is the strength of the resolve of one hundred and thirty crore countrymen, but we are not going to stop there.
This movement has now moved from cleanliness to beauty
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team in Media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has left his job in America and returned to serve Mother Bharti
He took the initiative to make Delhi not only clean but beautiful some time ago
He started with his team from Lodhi Garden dustbins
Through the street art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of Bridge and school to the slums, they began to enrich their skills so people also got along and in a way this process started.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during Kumbh.
There is no sound in the colours and lines, but the rainbow that is produced from these pictures proves to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of making waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making garbage from garbage.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting comment on MyGov.
It was from Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote like listening to the mind program
I am happy to state that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my state Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organized in June
I think such programmes should be held every three months
Besides, the programme should also have an online monitoring system.
In my view, this was the first such programme of its kind in which the public had a direct dialogue with the government.
Brother Mohammad Aslam ji sent me this message and after reading it my curiosity to know about the Back to Village Programme increased and when I got to know about it in detail, I felt that the entire country should also know about it.
This program shows how the people of Kashmir are desperate to join the mainstream of development, how enthusiastic they are
In this programme, for the first time, the officers who had never visited the villages directly, they themselves came to their doorsteps so that the obstacles in the development could be understood and problems could be solved.
This programme lasted a week and in all the four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state government officials gave a detailed account of government schemes and programmes to the villagers.
How can Panchayats be further strengthened
How can their income be increased
What can their services affect the lives of ordinary human beings  The villagers also openly explained their problems .
Friends, This programme was not a government fund that the officers returned after roaming around the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
This program has been included in many other things to create interesting
Sports Competition for children under Khelo India
The same Sports Kits, MNREGA Job Cards and SST Certificates were also distributed
People of Kashmir become open partners in this festival of development
It is heartening to note that the Back to Village programme was organised in such far-flung villages where government officials had to travel on foot for one day and a half days through inaccessible roads.
Many officers were so overwhelmed by their reception that they stayed in the villages for more than two days .
It is very pleasant to organize Gram Sabhas in these areas, participate in a large number of people and prepare plans for themselves.
New resolution, new zeal and spectacular results
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, want to create obstruction, they can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, the Gyanpeeth Awardee Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre has presented the glory of Sawan Month in one of his poems as follows:
People from different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Savan in their own way throughout India.
In this weather whenever we see around us it seems as if the earth has covered itself with greenery .
Around, a new energy begins to communicate
In this holy month, many devotees visit Kanvad and Amarnath Yatra, while many people fast regularly and eagerly wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami.
During this time, the festival of Raksha Bandhan symbolizes the love of brother and sister also comes.
You will be happy to know that this time the most devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
Since 1st July till now more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave .
More than the number of pilgrims who had participated in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, this time they have joined in just 28 days.
I would like to especially praise the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey are convinced of the warmth and affection of the people of the state.
All these things are going to be very useful for tourism in the future .
I have been told that more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within a month and a half since the Chardham Yatra has started in Uttarakhand this year.
After the horrific disaster in 2013, for the first time, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there
I appeal to all of you to visit those parts of the country whose beauty is visible during the monsoon season.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of our people, tourism and travel, perhaps no teacher greater than this can be there.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and vibrant month of Saawan will bring new energy, new hopes and new hopes to you all.
Similarly, the month of August brings memories of uit India
I would like you to make some special preparations on 15th August to find a new way to celebrate this festival of freedom.
On the other hand, this is the time when heavy rains are taking place in many parts of the country.
By the way, when we see TED, the only aspect of the rain looks flooded, flooded water, traffic jam
The second picture of the monsoon in which our farmer, charming birds, flowing waterfalls, green sheet covered land, you will have to go out with your own family to see this.
Rain, freshness and happiness i. e.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
Today, people of Christian community are celebrating Easter worldwide.
I convey my best wishes to all the people on Easter.
And for some people there will be a criterion because on the one hand you will be waiting for the matches of India and Australia on the other side and the T-20 cricket world up on the other side.
In the past, India has won two best matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
A great momentum is visible.
Today, when Australia and India are going to play, I convey my best wishes to the players of both the teams.
65 of the population is young and we have lost ourselves in the world of sports.
Time is, a new revolution in sports.
24 teams from around the world are coming to play in India.
India won the Gold Medal in 1951, 1962 Asian Games and India was ranked fourth in the 1956 Clympic Games.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we went on the lower pair, went back, fell and fell.
Cootball is an opportunity, can you give me your suggestions
I believe that there is a huge opportunity to brand India at the global level.
I consider the opportunity to identify the youth power of India, what was found in the midst of Match, what was lost in that sense.
By preparing for this host, we can decorate our strength, we can express our strength and we can also brand India.
Can you send me your suggestions on NarendraModiApp, please
My dear students, you must have thought of tourism in the days of holidays.
Some people go out of their states.
Last time also I had requested you people to upload photos from wherever you go.
People, language, food and living habits do not know what to see.
India is full of diversity.
Once you go out to see, you will be watching all your life, you will be watching
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to travel a lot.
When there was no Chief Minister, there was no Prime Minister and as young as you were, I traveled a lot.
I consider it a good sign.
It gives an opportunity to see something new in itself.
I hope that when you visit these holidays, can you contribute to cleanliness
Maybe it's not happening in a very scientific way but it's happening.
Can you also emphasize on cleanliness as a tourist on tourist destination
I believe my youngsters will definitely help me in this.
India is far behind in tourism compared to the world.
But we should decide that if we want to strengthen our tourism then we can attract the world.
We can attract a large part of the world's tourism to us and provide employment opportunities to millions and millions of youth of our country.
Whether it is the government, the institutions, the society, the citizens, all of us have done this together.
Let us try something in that direction.
My young friends, I do not like this thing that the holidays should come in such a way.
You also think in this direction.
Will your vacations, the crucial year of your life and its important time go the same way
I have an idea to think about you.
Can you make a solemn pledge to add a new talent to your personality on holidays
If you don't know how to swim, then you can make a solemn pledge during the holidays, if I don't know how to swim, if I don't know how to swim, if I don't know how to drive a cycle then I will drive a cycle on my holidays.
Even today, I type the computer with two fingers, will I learn typing
How many skills are there for the development of our personality
Why not learn him
Why not remove some of our shortcomings
Why shouldn't we insist on our strengths
Just imagine, there should be a lot of clases in it, there should be a trainer, it should be very big bees, it should not be such a big budget.
Just assume that I will make a best from the waste.
Look at something and start making it.
Namaste Prime Minister, during the last summer holidays you said that the birds also feel warm, so we should keep them in a utensil and keep them in our balcony or on the roof, so that the birds come and drink water.
I did this work and I enjoyed it. I became friends with many birds on this pretext.
I urge you to repeat this task back to the point of mind.
And I was not in my mind that today I would say something on this subject but that Abhi reminded me that last year I had pottery outside the house for birds.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to Abhi Chaturvedi for a child.
He called me and remembered a good job.
Abhi told me that he has been doing this work for a year and many of his birds have become his friends.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved those birds very much.
He wrote in his poetry - do not let you go away, fill the courtyard with donations and fill in the hod, we will fill the sweet and sweet cold water.
Let us also do this thing of Mahadevi ji.
I also congratulate Abhi and also express my gratitude that you have reminded me of a very important thing.
Shilpa Cook from Mysore, he has kept a big sensitive issue for all of us.
They have said that there are people who sell milk near our house, those who sell newspapers and postman come.
Sometimes those who sell utensils pass through there, those who sell clothes pass through.
Have we ever asked them for water in the summer days
Have we ever watered it
I am extremely grateful to you Shilpa. You have kept the sensitive topic in a very simple manner.
True, it is a small thing but if the postman came to the house in the middle of the heat then he would like to drink water.
Well, this is the nature in India.
But Shilpa, I am grateful that you have observed these things.
What is the situation in the market, what is the situation in the mandis, what is the period of good crops these days, what medicines are suitable and there are many topics on it.
Not only this, there is a button in it that directly connects you with agricultural scientists and connects you with the experts.
If you put any of your questions in front of him then he answers, explains and explains to you.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters should download this farmer's facility App on their mobile phones.
Do you try to do something out of it
And if you still feel a little lack then you should also complain to me.
But our countrymen also have to think about what will happen without water
Is it time for us to take water to the ponds through our ponds and ponds where there is a waste and some encroachment then the water stops and the water conservation is gradually decreasing.
Can we prepare those old places for more water harvesting by digging them once again
If the water is saved in the first rain, if the water is saved, if the ponds are filled, if our rivers are filled with drains, then there is also rain in the back then our loss is reduced.
This time you must have seen that 5 lakh ponds, fields and ponds have been constructed.
MGNREGA has also emphasized on creating assets for water harvesting.
There will be several such villages in the country, many such progressive farmers will be there, many such aware citizens who have done this work.
But still there is a need to do more.
I welcome it.
The misuse of more fertilizers has sickened our motherland and we are the sons of mother Earth and children. How can we see our mother Earth sick
This is similar to Certilizer, no matter how excellent Certificate, but if we use more and more Certificate then it will become a cause of waste.
The more water will be saved the more it will be beneficial for the farmer, the more life will be saved.
My dear countrymen, World Health Day is on 7th April and this time the world has focused on World Health Day on Beat Diabetes and defeat Diabetes.
Diabetes is such a host that he is eager to host every disease.
Once the diabetes enters, a lot of ill-treatment guests enter their homes and bodies.
It is said that in 2014 there were about six and a half million diabetes patients in India.
3 of the deaths are due to diabetes.
And there are two types of diabetes i. e.
And because of Type-2 habits, because of age, because of obesity.
The world is concerned about diabetes, so it has been kept in the World Health Day on 7th.
We all know that our life style is the biggest reason for that.
Physical labor is decreasing.
The name of sweat is not-o-nishan, it is not going to happen.
Can we do something to defeat diabetes in our personal life by taking some inspiration from the 7th
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we dont hesitate to get medical check-ups.
And after a very bad situation, it comes to mind that oh, oh, I had a very old diabetes.
On March 24, the world celebrated TB Day.
We know, when I was young, I was scared to hear the name of TB.
But there is a lot of TB patients compared to the world.
This means that this disease is such that it can be checked soon.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is being done in this direction.
If you check once then do it.
And this disease can go.
Just get the right treatment and continue treatment till the disease is destroyed.
I would urge you to defeat it whether it is TB or Diabetes.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But this government, doctors, medicines do not happen unless you do it.
And that is why today I urge my countrymen to defeat the diabetes and get rid of the TB.
My dear countrymen, several important occasions are coming up in the month of April, especially on 14th April, the birthday of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country throughout the year.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar on April 14 this year.
We have given a lot to Baba Saheb to become a good citizen.
We can pay homage to them by following that path as a great citizen.
In a few days, Vikram Samvat will start.
Different states are celebrated in different states.
My best wishes to everyone for my New Year.
You can hear at your own time.
You can hear on your own mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
The youth of India takes time to observe the information about it and watch it on TV.
Perhaps there will be no district of India where I have not got the opportunity to go.
They don't go on that route as before, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
And there is a possibility of huge employment through tourism.
And your personality will be recognised by this and your confidence will increase so much.
It will probably be a matter of our colleagues.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
If you download this Kisan Suvidha App in your mobile phone then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weather in your palms.
My farmer brothers and sisters, There has been an opportunity for the rest of the people for summer holidays but it becomes an opportunity for the farmers to sweat even more.
He waits for the rain and before waiting, the farmer gets ready to prepare his field so that he does not want to waste even a drop of rain.
The time for the farmers to start the season of farming is very important.
Is that the food bad
You must worry about him.
But when TB and death were added, we were scared but now we have become careless about TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
You might be listening to my mind on the radio, but you might be wondering if the children's exams are being started, some people's exams of the tenth-twelfth are probably starting on March 1.
So the same will happen in your mind too.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am equally concerned about your children's exams.
But if we change the way we look at the exams and the way we look at the exams then perhaps we can be free from anxiety.
I had said in my last episode of Mann Ki Baat that you must send your experiences and suggestions on NarendraModiApp.
I am glad that teachers, those who have been successful in their career, those students, parents and some thinkers of the society have written and sent me a lot of things.
The second thing came in so many thousands that I believe that this is probably a very important topic.
But most of the time we have limited the topic of exam to the school premises or to the family or to the student.
From the suggestions made on my App, it seems that these topics should continue to be discussed throughout the country.
Today, I would like to talk to my parents, examinees and their teachers especially in this matter of my mind.
I have heard that I have read, I will tell some of the things I have been told.
I will add whatever I think.
But I believe that these 25-30 minutes will be very useful for those students who have to give exams.
I would like to recite to you the message that Bharat Ratna Shri Sachin Tendulkar has sent to the youth of India who have a sense of humility: - Namaskar, I am speaking Sachin Tendulkar.
I know that the exams are going to start in a few days.
Many of you will also be tense.
I have the same message that your parents, your teachers, the rest of your family members and friends will do it.
Wherever you go, everyone will ask you what kind of preparation is going on, how many experts will score you.
I would like to say that you yourself will set some targets for yourself and you will not come to the preservation of someone else's expedition.
You must work hard but set a realistic achievable target for yourself and try to achieve that target.
So it was very important for me to find a solution.
And I always tried to achieve those targets.
My focus was on ball pay and targets automatically became self-slowly achievable.
I would like to tell you that it is very important for you to be positive.
Positive thinking will follow positive results.
So you must be positive and you must give the best results. I sincerely hope for it and I would like to give you the best wishes for the eams.
Friends, see what Tendulkar ji is saying.
Don't suppress them under the burden of expedition.
You have to make your future.
You decide your goal by yourself, decide your target yourself - free from the mind, free from the thinking, free from the capability.
Why not compete
Why should we waste our time in competing with others
Why not compete with ourselves.
Why do not we decide to break all our earlier records
You see, no one will stop you from moving forward and when you break your own previous record then you will not expect anyone else for happiness and satisfaction.
There will be satisfaction from within.
Friends, do not consider the examination as a game of marks.
Where did you reach, how much did you reach
Do not be stuck in that account.
Life should be linked with some great purpose.
One should move ahead with a dream, one should be determined.
These examinations, whether we are going to be correct or not, we account for them.
And that is why if we keep dreaming of Virat then the examination will become a festival of joy in itself.
Every examination will be a step to fulfill that great objective.
Every success will become the key to achieving that great objective.
Let us move with a very big objective and there will never be anything less than expected in it, then there will not be any disappointment.
And dare to insist, and empower, and try.
Thousands of people have written to me smaller things than mobile phones on my App.
Shreya Gupta has stressed that there is a healthy mind in the healthy body.
Students should keep in mind your health along with your studies so that you can write properly in the exams.
Now, on the last day I will not say that you should start a meeting and go for three kilometers and five kilometers.
But one thing is true that what is your routine especially during the eam days
Anyway, our routine should be conducive to our dreams and resolves for 365 days.
I agree with one of Shri Prabhakar Reddy ji, he has urged us to sleep on time and revision early in the morning.
Access to the Deamination Centre and access to other things before time.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said that I do not dare to say this because I am a little indifferent to sleep and my friends also keep complaining to me that you sleep very little.
This is one of my shortcomings, I'll try to fix it too.
Sleeping time is as important as your day-long activities and this is possible.
Otherwise, there is a habit of some people who talk on long telephones before sleeping.
And when I talk about sleeping, don't think I'm asking you to sleep for eam.
I'm talking about sleeping for a stress-free state to give you a good exam on the time of exam.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
Otherwise, it should not be that the marks should come down and the mother asked why the sons came less, then say that Modiji had asked to sleep, so I was asleep.
Will not do this
I will not believe it.
Even if one or half of our body parts do a little problem in our body then you must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable.
Not only this, our routine is also eroded.
And that's why we don't consider anything a little.
You see, do not engage in the habit of composing yourself in the prescribed manner.
Fix it, check it out.
You must have seen these two kinds of people.
There is a negative impact on the outcome of the paper that will come in its teension.
On Viswanathan Anand, he will share his experiences.
You must have seen that their eyes also do not go around.
Sometimes we used to hear that Arjuna's life was an incident of how he looked at the bird's eye.
Similarly, when we see Viswanathan playing, his eyes are at a bigger target and he is a manifestation of inner peace.
It is true that someone should say that peace will come back then it is difficult to say that but we should try that.
You are not talking to friends or you are walking alone, you are walking furiously, you are shaking a lot of books, you cannot be calm again.
You can imagine that you are standing on the edge of a pond and you can see very good things below.
But suddenly if a stone starts moving in the water and the water starts shaking, then what is the best thing that was visible below
If the water is calm, however deep it may be, it can be seen.
But if the water is turbulent, then there is nothing below.
There is a storehouse of hard work for a year but if you feel tired then you will not be able to find that treasure.
If you feel calm then it will emerge from your treasure and your exam will become very simple.
And sometimes I try to understand by concentrating more and more, I feel an inner tension.
Then I think, no-no, I'll relax a bit, so I'll be fine.
So I have developed myself with the help of technology.
I'll breathe a lot.
I breathe deeply.
Three times I breathe deeply five times, the time goes 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, but then my mind becomes calm and ready to understand things.
Maybe it's my experience, you can also work.
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing.
If the parents are also educated in the house and if the parents are also teachers then they write the entire paper again, tell me what you wrote, what happened
Man, I made a mistake.
Hey man, I knew this, but I didn't remember.
We get stuck in it.
Make a chat with the family and on topics, refresh the memories of old joy and happiness.
If you ever went somewhere with your parents, remember the scenes there.
Spend half an hour after getting out of them.
The point of Rajat ji is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, while interpreting it in the present context, is trying to convey this ritual to Sarita in the country and the world.
I am also grateful to the revered Murari Bapu for giving us a very good message.
Friends, I want to tell you one more thing today.
I can see that Yoga has been discussed in the people who have shared their experiences this time.
And it is a matter of great pleasure for me that somebody whom I meet in the world these days, no matter how much time I get, somebody does something or the other.
Well, friends, let me just say today, start doing yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
But those who do yoga are at least exams, so do not do it today.
Do it then do it.
But it is true that whether it is in a student life or in the second half of life, Yoga is a big key in the development journey of inner life.
Simple to simple key.
You must pay attention to it.
Yes, if you are familiar with Yoga, if you ask them about Yoga then you would not have done Yoga before in the days of the exam, you would also tell them about two or four things that you can do in two to five minutes.
Look, if you can,
Yes, I have a lot of faith in it.
My young friends, it is very early for you to go to the exam hall and wish to sit on your bench at the earliest
Why do these things hurry
Why not manage your whole day's time so that if you stop in traffic, we can reach on time.
Otherwise such things create a new tension.
And one thing is, the number of time that we have received, the question papers that are instrumentations, we sometimes feel that this will be our time.
It's not like that, guys.
You read those instructions closely, it will take two minutes or three minutes or five minutes, there will be no loss.
But with the confidence of the same paper, now I have this paper, no new questions are going to come up, I have to tackle the same questions and when I started thinking again, he has written that I understood this paper so easily. For the first time, I felt that it does not come to me, but if I repeat the same thing then I realized that the question has been raised in a different way, but this is the same thing I know.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Sometimes the question seems difficult to understand the questions.
I would like to emphasize upon the fact that you should read the questions twice, read three times, read four times and try to match it with whatever you know, you see, it will be easier before writing the question.
It is a matter of great pleasure for me today that Bharat Ratna and our most respected scientist, CNR Rao, have stressed on patience.
In very few words, he has given a very good message to all the students.
Whatever I spend half an hour in saying, they say in three minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb that he inspired the children of the country.
Whatever he has said is firmness, loyalty, penance, this is the same thing dedication, determination, diligence.
If you stay awake, then fear will also be scared.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do well.
Now on my App, a journal Ruchika Dabus has shared his eam experience.
He said that there is a constant effort in his family to create a positive atmosphere at the time of exams and this was discussed in his fellow families as well.
Together, a positive environment.
This is true, as Sachin ji also said, "Positive approach, positive frame of mind positive energy".
Why not at any stage of your life, excellent examples, truthful events inspire a lot, they give a lot of strength and they also create a new path in times of crisis.
We all read about the inventor of the Electricity Bulb, Thomas Elva Edison, in our syllabus.
But today that electricity, that bulb also illuminates the lives of our people.
It is said that failure also contains the possibilities of success.
J. K. Rolling is a great example that success can ever be achieved by anyone.
Harry Potter Services is popular all over the world today.
But from the beginning it was not so.
How many problems they had to face
Rolling himself had said that in the difficulties, he used to put all the energy in that work, which really meant for him.
Nowadays, not just the students, the entire family and the entire school, the teacher becomes a part of everyone.
But without the support system of parents and teachers alone, the situation is not good.
The examination becomes easier if we become a team, if we move forward in a planned manner, be it a teacher, a partner, a partner or a senior student.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the App, he has complained that parents should never pressurize them to ask for more marks on their children.
We should be encouraged to prepare only.
They should be relaxed, they should worry about it.
Vijay Jindal writes, do not put the burden of his expectations on children.
This is right.
I don't want to tell the parents more today.
Please do not make pressure.
If he is talking to any of his friends, do not stop.
Build a light-hearted environment, create a positive environment, see how much confidence your son or daughter will come.
We like to join him.
We also want to move ahead of science.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Knowledge, science, technology, all these things should become an intuitive part of our development journey and this time the theme of National Science Day is Make in India.
Friends, sometimes successes are very late and when success comes, the view of the world also changes.
If you may have been very busy in the exam, then perhaps you might have not had a registrar in your mind.
But I also want to repeat this thing to my countrymen.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a huge and important host in the world of science.
Scientists from all over the world worked hard, the generations came, some went on doing something or the other and almost after 100 years a success took place.
The Gravitational Haves were highlighted and detected by the valour of our scientists.
This is a very far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only proves the theory of our great scientist Einstein in the last century, but is also considered a great discovery for Physics.
This whole human race is going to be used for the entire world. But as an Indian, we are happy that the sons of our country, the promising scientists of our country were also associated with it in the process of exploration.
I would like to heartily congratulate all those scientists.
In the future, our scientists will be trying to pursue this dinner.
India is the third such system in two places in the world.
The integration of India will give a new impetus to this process and will give a new momentum.
India will certainly become an active partner in the process of this important scientific diagnosis of human welfare even among its limited resources.
Once again I congratulate all the scientists and convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I would like to write a number to you, from tomorrow you can listen to my mind by calling missed and listening to this number in your mother tongue.
I also have to give the exam tomorrow.
25 billion Indians are going to take my examination.
But yes, you must have seen, I must have heard that how healthy I am, how confident I am.
Just, let me get an exam tomorrow, let me start with you all the time.
And if we are all successful then the country will succeed.
My best wishes to you all, my friends.
Free from the stress of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind, remain firm.
Talk of mind, December 2015
I have a lot of observation in this portal.
No, we have to make changes according to the requirements of India. The poor person works hard, he feels physical labor, but some youngster makes such a thing through innovation that the poor get some benefit in wages, I consider this as start-ups. I would like to ask the bank to help such youngsters, I would like to tell them that they should move ahead with courage, Market will be available.
Then I was contemplated in my mind that perhaps we feel that he is a disabled person, but experienced that he has an extra power, an extra power and then I got the idea of that. Why shouldn't we use the word 'Divyang' in our country instead of 'Divyang'. These are those people who have one or more organ, which has the communication of divine power, which we don't have the ordinary body, I am very nice. Can we make the word 'Divyang' prevalent instead of 'Divyangjan'
On 26th January, when we observe Republic Day, can we observe the excellent hygiene and best adornment on 26th January, by the citizens, by the children of schools and colleges, what kind of statues and statues of great men in our city have been set up in our city, cleanliness of that complex, cleanliness of that complex, best cleanliness and best toilets on 26th January
Dear Countrymen, Namaste
During the holy festival of Deepawali, you must have celebrated the holidays very well.
There must have been an opportunity to go somewhere.
Business jobs have also started with new enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
Christmas preparations on the other hand will also have started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
Sometimes festivals work to fill wounds, and sometimes festivals give new energy.
But sometimes when the crisis comes in this time of the festival, it becomes more painful, and it seems painful.
Every corner of the world constantly reports about natural calamities.
And there are reports of such natural calamities that have never been heard or thought.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is growing.
In our own country, the way in which heavy rainfall and that too unseasonal rains have been reported in the past, especially in Tamil Nadu, and the states have also been affected.
Many people lost their lives
I convey my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
State governments gather with full force in relief and rescue operations.
The central government also always works shoulder to shoulder.
Now a team of Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I believe that despite this crisis, the power of Tamil Nadu will continue to move forward at a rapid pace and will continue to play its role in furthering the country.
But when we look at the crisis all around, we need to bring about a lot of change in it.
15 years ago, natural calamities used to be a part of an agriculture department because then more natural calamities i.e. famine was confined to it.
Today its form has changed.
After the Nepal earthquake, I had spoken to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif.
There has been a good beginning.
Today, I have got the phone of Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab.
I am speaking from Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab District Jalandhar.
We do organic farming here and guide a lot of people about farming.
One of my questions is that people who set fire to these fields, how they should guide the straw or the wheat foam to the micro-organisms that are being polluted to the mother earth and how they can get relief from it in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh Ji, I am very happy to hear your message.
One of the joys was that you are a farmer who cultivates organic farming.
And they themselves do organic farming. Not only this, you understand the problem of farmers very well.
And your concern is correct but this is not the case only in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of our people throughout India and traditionally we follow the path of burning the remains of our crops.
Secondly, what are the measures, there is no training.
And when the impact of this crisis began to come to the cities, a little sound was heard.
But the pain you have expressed is correct.
But this is not the truth.
The residues of the crop are also very precious.
They themselves are an organic manure.
Secondly, due to burning, the upper layer of the ground burns.
My farmer brothers and sisters should think for a moment that our bones should be strong, our hearts should be strong, kidney should be good, everything should be there but what will happen if the skin above the body burns
Similarly, burning the residues of these crops does not just burn the throat, it burns the skin of the Mother Earth.
The upper layer of our land burns, which pushes our fertile land towards death.
And therefore, he should make positive efforts.
Once again this stump is suppressed in the ground, even then it becomes fertilizer.
Or if a pit is stacked in a pit and put a little water of earthworms, then a good type of organic fertilizer comes into existence.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who cultivated bananas.
And they told me a great experience.
Earlier, when he used to cultivate bananas and when the banana crop was finished, he had to spend Rs. 5,000, 10 thousand and 15 thousand rupees per hectare to clean the bananas.
And till the people who took it didn't bring the tractor-vactor, he was standing like this.
However, some farmers have developed 66-8-inch pieces of that stove and buried it in the ground.
So it was experienced that there is so much water in this banana thread that if there is a tree, if there is a plant, if there is a crop then there is no need to get outside for three months.
Today, the demand for the clutches has increased, which had to be spent on cleaning the throat.
Our farmer brothers are not less than any scientist.
Dear countrymen, on the 3rd of December, International Day of Persons with Disabilities will be remembered throughout the world.
Last time in Mann Ki Baat, I had discussed the Organ Convention.
I had also spoken about the helpline of NEET for organ donation and I was told that after that the phone calls have increased almost 7 times.
Film actress Raveena Tandon, very well-known people associated with it.
Organ donation can save valuable lives.
Angadan brings immortality in a way.
When an organ goes from one body to the other then that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
What can be the best donation from this
I am confident that widespread awareness will also increase in this area and in the true sense the needy will get better help because these help cannot be obtained from anywhere unless someone donates.
As I have said earlier, December 3 is celebrated as the Day of Disability.
Physically and mentally handicapped, they are also rich in a great courage and capability.
Sometimes the pain occurs when they ridicule sometimes.
Occasionally a sense of compassion and mercy is expressed.
But if we change our vision, change the look of them, then these people can inspire us to live.
Some taxes can inspire to pass.
If we get a little trouble then we sit to cry.
Then I remember that my crisis is very small, how does it last
And that is why all these are a source of inspiration for us.
His determination, his way of fighting with his life and his passion for transforming the crisis into strength is immense.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
4042 is the age.
In 1996, Javed Ahmed was shot by the terrorists.
Lost a part of the intestine and intestine.
Oserious nature has become a special injury.
The ability to stand on his feet always went for help, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
The injury of terrorism could not even hurt them.
His own strength, but the biggest thing is that without any reason, an innocent person has suffered such a big problem, the youth has been in danger, but no resentment, no rage, this crisis has also been converted into sensitivity by Javed Ahmed.
He dedicated his life to social service.
The body does not accompany, but for 20 years, they have been immersed in children's studies.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for disabled persons in public places, government offices
They are working on it.
Is not the life of Javed enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Javed Ahmed, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
In the absence of time, even though I am talking about Javed, the lamps of such inspiration are burning in every corner of India.
Are giving new light to live, showing the way.
On 3rd December there is an opportunity to inspire everyone by remembering them.
Our country is so huge.
There are a lot of things in which we are dependent on governments.
For the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the oppressed, the exploited and the deprived sections of the society, there is a constant link between the government and the government.
And as a citizen, sometimes a bad experience comes from some government babu.
And that very bad experience changes our perspective of looking at the government system throughout our life.
There is a truth in it, but sometimes lakhs of people sitting in this government do such good work with dedication and dedication that never comes to our sight.
Sometimes we don't even know because it is so simple that we don't know that some government system, some government officials are doing this thing.
ASA workers in our country which are networked all over the country.
Sometimes I have not heard of discussions about ASEA workers amongst the people of India.
But when I have become an example of his success in the world as a world famous family entrepreneur of the Bilgates Foundation.
We had given joint Padma Vibhushan to both such billgates and Milindagates.
They do very social work in India.
They are spending their time of retirement and whatever earnings they have earned throughout their lives to work for the poor.
Whenever they visit, whenever they meet and whenever they get the opportunity to work with the ASHA workers, they appreciate it so much, and they have the opportunity to say that what kind of hard work they are doing for the ASHA workers.
He explains how much enthusiasm is there for learning new things.
In the past, the Orissa Government honored an ASA worker on Independence Day.
Tendagaon, a small village in Balasore district of Orissa, is an optimist and the entire population of the schedule tribe.
And there is an area affected by malaria.
And Jamuna Manisingh, a hope worker from this village, decided that now I will not let anyone die from malaria in this village.
If he gets the news of a small fever going home, then go to the house.
Based on the primary arrangements that have been taught to him, it is necessary to get treatment.
Emphasis on using every household pesticide mosquito net.
As soon as his own child falls asleep and as much as he needs, ASA worker Jamuna Manisingh continues to work with full dedication for the entire village to avoid mosquitoes.
And he fought malaria, prepared to compete with the whole village.
So how many Jamuna Mani will be.
There will be millions of people who will be around us.
We'll look at them with a little respect.
Such people become the biggest strength of our country.
How do the happiness and misery of society become big companions
I salute all such ASA workers through Jamuna Mani.
I urge you to look at it.
See, not only this, you should also read it and it may be possible that you want to add such things.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
Discuss books and if an enthusiastic youngster goes to the schools in the neighborhood to tell the children of class VIII, Class II that this happened here.
So you can truly become a social teacher.
I invite you to join the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is concerned about climate change.
There is also concern about climate change, global warming, dug-dagger and it is getting approval as a standard before doing everything.
Earth's temperature should not increase anymore.
It is also the responsibility of everyone, it is also anxiety.
Once I had said that on the night of full moon, we should take a bath in the full moonlight by shutting down street lights.
You should experience the light of that moon.
A friend had sent me a link and I had the opportunity to see it, so I wanted to tell you this thing too.
In Kanpur, a woman does not think that she has got the privilege of reading more.
But one such work is being done which perhaps no one would have thought.
He is working to provide light to the poor using solar energy.
He is fighting war with darkness and is illuminating his name.
She has formed a committee of women and has installed a plant of solar powered lanterns and she provides lanterns for a rent of Rs. 100 per month.
It costs about Rs. 3-4 per day but there is light in the entire house and this Noorjahan keeps working day after day to recharge the lantern with solar energy in that plant.
Now see what big people of the world would do for climate change but a nook and corner may inspire everyone.
And anyway, Noorjahan means to illuminate the world.
The light is spreading through this work.
I congratulate Noorjahan and I congratulate DEET as he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the country and the world.
Many congratulations.
Thank you Abhishek ji.
You sent me a message from Gorakhpur.
Prime Minister MRA scheme under the unfunded.
Those who do not get the money get the money.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginning has been good. In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people got Rs. 42 thousand crores from the Pradhan Mantri MRAY scheme.
Whether it is a washerman, a barber, a seller or a seller of milk.
Small businessmen and I am glad that there are about 24 lakh women in these 66 lakhs.
And most of the people who have received these help are SC, ST, B, people of this class who work hard and try to run the family with respect to their feet.
Abhishek himself has told the story of his enthusiasm.
I have a lot of news.
Someone just told me that there is no Shailesh Bhosale in Mumbai.
He received a loan of Rs. 8.
And they started the business of sewage dress, cleanliness.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhosale did it.
They have brought a tanker, they are doing that work and I was told that in such a short span of time they also returned the bank to 2 lakh rupees.
After all, this is the intention under our MRA scheme.
Someone told me about Mamta Sharma of Bhopal that she received 40 thousand rupees from the bank from the Prime Minister MRA scheme.
She is working to make a wallet.
And she makes a wallet but earlier she used to get more money and it used to run a business with great difficulty.
Now, due to the good amount of money coming together, he made his work better.
And earlier due to the extra interest and due to reasons, due to the excessive expenditure incurred on him these days, he started saving more than Rs. 1,000 per month.
And his family started developing a good business gradually.
But I would like to get more publicity of the scheme.
All our banks are more sensitive and help smaller people.
In fact, these people run the country's economy.
People who do small things are the economic power of the country's economy.
We want to emphasize that.
Good, but to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had discussed Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
These are things that should be consistently aware of social life.
The national awareness drive Internal Vigilance is the price of liberty, the unity of the country should continue.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, I want to make it a scheme.
MyGov had asked for suggestions on him.
How is the structure of the programme
What's the logo
How to increase public participation
I said for all the suggestions.
I was told that a lot of suggestions are coming.
But I expect more suggestions.
Some big priests have also been declared.
You should also apply your creative mind.
How can Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat make this mantra of unity integrity connecting every Indian
What is the plan, what kind of program
Whether it is life-style, be it spectacular or life-style, it is easy to connect everyone.
What will the government do
What will Civil Society do
There may be many things.
It's fun to wear clothes, but I would urge you to exercise.
I would urge you to use these good weather for some time or the other to keep the body fit.
And we should create an environment in the family itself, it should be a festival of the family, this should be done by getting together for an hour.
So if there is a good weather, then there will be a good habit.
Once again, I have got the privilege of connecting with you all with Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the fifth one-day match between India and South Africa is going to be played in Mumbai.
This is the series named Gandhi Mandela Series.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased further.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of All India Radio Kannur Centre.
Congratulations are to be given that when I started talking about the mind, many people went to join him.
In it, a 12th student of Kerala was associated with reverence.
I have to talk about Kerala once again today.
The students of Saint Mary Oper-Primary School of Chittoor, Kochi, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter is special in many ways.
On one hand, these girls have made a picture of Mother India with their thumb impressions, on a very big cloth.
He has sent me that picture of Mother India and the map of India.
At first I was surprised why they made a map of India with their thumb marks.
But when I read his letter, I realized that he had given such a wonderful symbolic message.
These are the girls who have just tried to awaken the Prime Minister, it is not so.
He is also trying to make people aware in his area and his mission is Angadan.
They are running public awareness campaigns for organ donation.
He has also staged drama in many places, so that the understanding of Angad is spread among the people.
Angadan became a tendency and tendency.
These girls have written to me in a letter that you should appeal to the people about organ donation in your mind.
He says Angadan should be a festival.
These days I also receive a lot of messages on phone calls.
Devesh of Delhi has also given me a similar message.
Every year one lakh eyesight is needed.
On the death of a road accident, the organ of the body can be donated.
Some legal confusions are also very much.
Efforts have also been made to guide states in this direction.
Some states have made a very good effort to speed up the paperwork by reducing it.
Today I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the front line in the field of organ donation.
Many social institutions, several NGOs are doing a very good job in this direction.
National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOT) has been set up to promote organ transplant.
A 247 fillline 1800114770 service is also available.
And it has been said here that Ten Tyakten Bhunjitha is a very good description of the joy of abandoning Ten Tyakten Bhunjitha.
In the past, we all had seen on TV that a poor handkerchief, hawker and his wife were diverted to G.B. Pant Hospital in Delhi.
And this wiver was brought from Lucknow to Delhi by special arrangements.
And that operation was successful.
A life survived.
Angadan Mahadan
We should fulfill this feeling of Ten Taykten Bhunjitha and we must emphasize this.
Dear countrymen, we just celebrated the festival of Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days we will also celebrate Deepawali.
Eid is also celebrated, Ganesh-Chaturthi is also celebrated.
This is the first time that such a large scale event is being organized on the soil of India.
Leaders of Chavan African countries and unions have been invited.
Outside Africa, one of the largest conferences of African countries is happening.
India-Africa relations are deep.
The population of India is as much of the population of African countries.
And together we are one-third of the world's population.
And millions of years ago, it was the same territory.
Later these two pieces were divided from the Indian Ocean.
There is a lot of similarity between us.
And nearly 27 lakh people of India have lived in these countries for a long time.
India has economic ties with African countries, cultural ties, diplomatic relations, but India plays a very important role in training the younger generation of most African countries.
More than 25,000 African students have studied in India in Human Resource Development, Hapacity Building.
And today there are leaders of many African countries who have studied in India.
So how deep we have.
And from that point of view this Summit is very important.
Generally, when there is a summit, the heads of different countries meet.
Similarly, a meeting of heads is going to be held in a summit.
Look, it is our endeavor that these people should also meet.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the RD Ministry, has done a very good programme.
A day competition programme was organised between the children of all the affiliated schools of BSF, poetry writing programmes and programme to increase their participation.
About 16 hundred schools participated in it.
There were also schools outside India and India.
And thousands of schoolchildren wrote about India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, an exhibition, Mobile Exhibition from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is going to Delhi from Porbandar on 29th October.
Millions of schoolchildren saw this exhibition, the villagers saw it.
There were very good compositions in the competition that took place.
I pay attention to a composition, I like it, so I want to tell you.
But we can clearly see the opportunity to connect the people.
I congratulate the dignity, the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and the RD Ministry.
On August 15, I had proposed a proposal regarding the MP Adarsh Gram Yojana for the last time.
After that many MP friends realized this work.
Staying with a big mind.
Last month there was a workshop in Bhopal.
In which these ideal villages are going on, the head of the village, the collector of the area, some MPs from there, the Indo-Government, the state government, all together discussed the topic of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Under the influence of these leftist militants, many areas of the area have been wasted.
However, our MPs are very senior, they have also been deputy speakers in Parliament. Mr. Karia Munda ji, he has spent his life for the tribals.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to make an ideal village.
I congratulate the Honble MP Shri Karia Munda ji.
I got the same news from Andhra.
Andhra MP Ashok Gajapati Raju ji himself was consumed in the scheme of Adarsh Gram and he selected the Kipadi Gram Panchayat for the ideal village through Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The rest of the arrangements are underway but they have done a very special innovative work.
Mr. Ruwala ji started the Kurtaya Kut Sugarcane festival in the village on 11th March.
The people of all the areas united in it.
How can the village be made a hub for economic activity, how can the village market its own production
His effort to make an ideal village as well as a self-reliant village is truly an officer of congratulations, Shri Ruwala ji.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be so that there is no talk of cleanliness
Savita Rai has sent me a message from Mumbai via a telephone, every year we clean our homes to prepare for Diwali.
We should keep this Diwali clean along with our homes and outside environment and keep it clean even after Diwali.
They have attracted attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I want to remind you that after the festival of Diwali last year, the media has launched a massive campaign in our country especially after Diwali and after Diwali, all the firecrackers were seen and they said that this is not right.
So it is true that we should do whatever we worry before the festival even after the festival.
Every public program should be done.
And today I want to especially congratulate all the media persons of India.
And I was also watching how many kinds of activities were going on.
How-how people are working themselves like a one-like forest mission for this.
How many places are there in our country that have been kept so clean.
All these things were exposed and I congratulated the commendable work of the India TV Group at that time.
However, since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan has been launched, I have seen that T. Denadu from Andhra, Telangana and especially Mr. Ramuji Rao is very old but his enthusiasm is not less than a young man.
And he added about 51 lakh children of nearly 55-56 thousand schools to this work in Andhra and Telangana.
Whether it is public places, stations, religious places, hospitals or parks, a big campaign of cleanliness has been launched in many places.
Now these reports show the power to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat in itself.
ABP News has started this programme in the name of India and it has done the work of highlighting the awareness of cleanliness among the people and training the countrymen.
There are hundreds of channels in our country, thousands of newspapers, everybody, I am not able to take the names of all, because of lack of time, but this campaign has been launched.
And that is why Savita Rai ji's suggestion that today the entire country is considering this work as its own and is taking it forward.
From Meghalaya, our Governor Shri Shanmuganathan, he has written a letter to me and by writing a chitti, he has mentioned me in the village of Mavalyannong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last several years, this village has taken up a mission of cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this cleanliness.
And it is said that a few years ago, he received the award in the form of Leanest Village in Asia.
This is what makes all of us confident that our country will be clean.
And when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to say the 125 crore Indians with pride, see, we have freed our Mother India from dirt.
My dear countrymen, I had told the Red Fort on 15th August that there are some things where corruption has gone home.
When a poor person goes for a small job, he does not know for anybody's recommendation. Does he suffer or how a group of brokers grabs money from him
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who conducts a thorough investigation in an interview of one minute or two minutes.
And with this idea, I had announced that why not we should finish the interview of these small pottery jobs.
My dear young friends, today I want to say with pride that the government has completed the entire process and no interview will be held for recruitment in Group D, Group C and Group B posts of the Central Government.
1st January, 2016 will be implemented.
We will not interfere in the process where the process is underway, but it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
My best wishes to all young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget, we had announced an important scheme.
In a way, gold has become a part of social life in our country.
Gold has been considered as a medium of economic security.
Crisis time key is considered as gold.
Gold can be the economic wealth of the country and every Indian should contribute to it.
Today, I am glad that we are going to launch important schemes in the budget, in the festival of Diwali and when Dhanteras and people especially buy gold that day.
We have brought the Gold Monetization Scheme.
Under this, you can deposit your gold bank and the bank will give you interest on it as if you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier kept in the gold locker and we had to pay the locker's rent.
Now keep in the gold bank and the money bank will give you as interest.
Say, My countrymen, Can gold become a property or not
Whether gold can transform from Lead-Money into a living force or not
That's what we have to do. You give me the support.
Do not keep gold in the house now.
Another thing is that in the sovereign gold bonds, you dont have a gold bag in your hand.
So you'll get two and a half thousand rupees in exchange for that paper.
So we are starting this thing.
Where to keep gold, his concern will be removed, and no one will come to steal the paper.
So I will put this scheme of security guarantee in front of the countrymen in the coming weeks.
I am happy to say that we are also bringing gold ueens.
It was almost 70 years since the Ashok Chakra Gold Coin, but till now we have been using the Foreign Gold Coin or the Gold Bullion Bars.
Besides, 20 grams of gold cooking will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, Iron Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's birth anniversary is on 31st October.
Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat
Remembering Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the map of entire India comes out.
This great man has contributed a lot to the unity of India.
Iron-male has introduced his strength.
We will pay tribute to Sardar Sahib, but his dream of uniting India was his dream.
Geographically he did it, but the mantra of unity should be the medium of our thought, behaviour, expression.
Several sects, numerous sects, dialects, many castes, many environments, our country full of diversity and this diversity is the only reason that we are proud of.
If this was not a diversity then perhaps the grace we are proud of would not be able to do it.
And therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, goodwill, unity is the herb of development.
Over the last several years, on 31st October, there are Run for Unity programmes in many corners of the country.
I have heard that this time too, its plans are being made around, people are enthusiastically preparing for the race for unity.
The race for unity is the race for development in the true sense.
In the second sense, the guarantee of development race is also a race of unity.
Let us pay tribute to Sardar Saheb.
Push forward the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, now all of you will be engaged in the preparations for Diwali, there will be cleanliness in the house.
New things will be bought.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated differently in every corner of our country.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the auspicious festival of Deepawali.
But, in the days of Diwali, some incidents also come to mind.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Deepawali, I have to visit Britain.
I'm very excited about my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also give scholarships to such promising children who go abroad to study abroad.
I am confident that when our children of India will be studying in the UK then this place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage centre for them, it will become an inspirational land and learn something in life but later living for the country, this message was given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And that is why I am saying that in my visit to Britain, I am very excited, the topic had been complicated for several years and now you can imagine the joy and joy of the people like me if that building becomes a property of 1. 25 billion Indians.
I will also get another opportunity in London, unveiling the statue of Lord Vishweshwar.
Several years ago, the work that Lord Visvesvara had done for democracy, for the Employment of Women is a truly studying aspect of the world.
The dedication of the Statue of Lord Visvesvara on the soil of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India thought centuries ago.
So you know that when such incidents are related then the heart of all the countrymen gets thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
By telephone, your suggestions continue to meet me through MyGov.in.
There is also a discussion on AIR in your letters.
Calling government officials is discussed.
Some people write their problems and try to solve problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
I have got the privilege of learning some languages but still there are so many languages that where did I learn
But still I am grateful to All India Radio that at 8 o'clock in the night, they broadcast in the regional language of each state.
Even if that voice is of someone else, but the thing is of my mind.
Last time I was completing one year, today we are entering the new year.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind.
Talk of mind, September 2015
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
On the other hand, on the other hand, the Parliament and the children of this country should talk about cleanliness, on the other hand, what can be the good fortune of a bigger country than this, the atmosphere of hatred and hatred that is going on in the country, on the other hand, there has been an awareness about cleanliness, this government will also compel the governments to work, will do it.
Institutions of local Swaraj - be it Panchayats, Nagar Panchayats, municipalities, municipalities or states - all of us have to work on this movement. We have to move forward, we have to move ahead despite these shortcomings. And when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Just like Sonam Patel, I met a very young girl, she is the daughter of a very poor family of Sundarpur resident of Varanasi, she is a daughter of a very poor family. And I was surprised that the girl, the entire Gita is very skeptical. But I felt that when I asked her, she used to interpret it in English and used to define it in Hindi.
They said, we don't even know, so I said, and what is the situation in studies, only the Gita reads and does something else
Once again, I got the opportunity to come amongst you, to talk about mindsets.
In the far south, people are dyed in the festival of Onam and tomorrow the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes related to social security for the common man.
I am glad that in a very short span of time, in a comprehensive manner, everyone has accepted these schemes.
I had made a small suggestion that we should give this security scheme to our sisters on the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
I have come to know that eleven crore families have been associated with this scheme since the launch of the scheme.
And I was also told that nearly half of the benefits have been given to mothers and sisters.
I consider it auspicious sign.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up on a massive scale a year ago.
I also saw the richness of the poor.
ero Balance had to open an account but the poor saved, saved and deposited twenty thousand crore rupees.
The mainstream of the economy is also the banking sector and this system has also emphasized the scheme of banking friends to reach the poorest of the poor.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
Now thousands of people have become entitled to overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it.
And this belief that the poor can get money from the bank.
Once again, I congratulate all the stakeholders and urge all the poor brothers and sisters who have opened the bank accounts to not break the bond with the bank.
This bank is yours, you should not leave it anymore.
I've brought it to you, now it's your job to hold it.
Our accounts should be active.
But in a very short span of time, the enlightened, my citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat took over the situation.
He played an active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating and once again went to Gujarat on the path of peace.
This is the path of peace, unity and brotherhood and we have to walk shoulder to shoulder on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I can tell the truth that the way I got the opportunity to listen to them, the way music is playing in a way.
The choice of his words, his way of conversation, i.e. the generosity in the Sufi tradition, which is the rhythm of a music, all of them experienced me among these scholars.
I liked it a lot.
Perhaps the world has become the most necessary to reach the true nature of Islam in the right way.
I believe that the Sufi tradition that is associated with love, generosity, will reach this message far and wide, which will benefit humanity and will also benefit Islam.
And I also tell others why we do not believe in any sect, but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider this invitation as my good fortune.
In India, scholars of Buddhist traditions from many countries of the world are coming to Bodh Gaya and are going to discuss global issues related to humanity, I have also been invited to it. And I am happy that those people have invited me to come to Bodh Gaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru went to Bodh Gaya.
I am going to get the opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with these scholars from all over the world. It is a moment of great joy for me.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Once again I would like to especially inform you about Mann Ki Baat.
I have already mentioned this subject in the matter of mind.
You must have heard me in Parliament, heard me in public meetings, listened to me in mind.
I have been telling you once again that the government's mind is open on the issue of dispute regarding the Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion of the interest of the farmers, I have been saying this repeatedly.
This means that the situation before the formation of my government has now been re-established.
But there was one thing incomplete in it and that was 13 such points which were to be completed in a year and that is why we had brought it in the Ordinance but the matter was also complicated in these disputes.
Ordinance is going to end but it is going to benefit the farmers directly. We are implementing those 13 points, we are implementing them under the rules so that farmers dont face any loss or financial loss. And that is why we are fulfilling the 13 points that were left in the earlier law and I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan is not our slogan. This is our mantra - the welfare of the villages, the poor farmers.
I would like to say one more thing that two days ago, the war of 1965 took fifty years and when it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is very natural to remember Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan Mantra too.
And it is very natural for all those martyrs to remember the Tricolor Flag of India, its pride and glory.
I salute all the stakeholders of the victory of the 65th War.
I bow down to the heroes.
And the events of such history continue to inspire us.
The way I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi tradition last week, in the same way it was a pleasant experience.
I had the opportunity to interact with the dignitaries of the country for hours.
And I was glad that in the field of science, India has been doing very good work in many directions.
Our scientists are truly doing excellent work.
Now we have the opportunity to bring these amendments to the common man.
How to convert the principles into tools
How to add Lab to Land
We have to move forward as an opportunity.
I also got many new information.
I can say that he was a very inspiring person for me, he was also a ducative person.
And I saw how many young scientists were talking with excitement, how their dreams were visible in their eyes.
And when I had said in Mann Ki Baat last time that our students should move towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are many opportunities, there are many possibilities.
I keep coming many letters from citizens.
From Thane, Mr. Parimal Shah has written to me on MyGov.
The emphasis is on reforms in the education sector.
I would especially like to tell my young friends that I had told the Red Fort on 15th August that why this interview for lower level jobs
Everyone runs, and perhaps this is also a reason for corruption at the grassroots level.
And I had said on 15th August that I want freedom from the tradition of interview below one level.
I am glad that in such a short span of time, it has been 15 days but the government is moving forward at a rapid pace.
The information is being sent and the decisions will be implemented very soon that small jobs will be left behind due to the interview.
The poor will not have to run for recommendation.
There will be no deployment, no corruption.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For the sake of health, especially mothers and infants, and for their action plan, 24 countries of the world together thought about India's land.
This is the first time outside the US, this programme was held in another country.
And it is true that even today, nearly 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die in our country at the time of childbirth and immediately after that.
This is worrisome and scary.
Well, the improvement is enough.
India has also been appreciated internationally, yet this figure is not less.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of tetanus in the death of mothers and infants.
The world has accepted it.
But we still have to save our mothers, save our newborns.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays news of dengue keeps on coming.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And what I am talking about Swachh Bharat is directly linked to it.
We see advertising on IT but we do not pay attention.
Advertisement is published in the newspaper but our attention is not paid.
There are methods of maintenance of small things in the house with clean water.
There is widespread public education in these things, but we don't notice and sometimes we feel that we live in a very good house, we have a very good system and we don't know that we have water filled ourselves and somewhere we invite dengue.
I would urge all of you that we should not allow death to be so cheap.
Life is very precious.
Water indifference, indifference to hygiene, this becomes a cause of death, this is not right.
Free checking facilities are available for dengue at around 514 centres across the country.
From time to time, investigation is useful for saving life and your cooperation in it is very important.
And cleanliness should be given great importance.
These days, in a way, festivals are celebrated in our country from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali.
Why not add every festival to cleanliness now
You will see that rituals will become a nature.
My dear countrymen, today I have a good news to tell you, I always say that now we will not get the good fortune to die for the country but we have got the good fortune to live for the country.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
In America, Race Across America is a cycle race, it is very difficult, it has a race of about 4,800 kilometers.
This year, these two brothers won this race.
See how everyone is making efforts to take the country forward.
And this is the case, when such incidents are heard, the chest gets strained.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth due to perception.
And the older generation always feels that the new generation does not understand anything and I believe that this process has been going on for centuries.
Experience in relation to my youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the youth, we also get a lot to learn.
I have met several youngsters who say, "Brother, I have taken a fast in my life today on Cycle.
Some people say that I have kept a cycle day in a week.
It's also good for my health.
And I also enjoy being a young man.
Nowadays, bicycle runs in many cities in our country too and there are many people who promote bicycles.
But these are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today when two youngsters of my country hoisted the flag in America, I like mentioning the direction in which the youth of India thinks.
I would like to especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
I enjoy.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar - the land of Indu Mill in Mumbai - had been hanging for a long time to build his memorial.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now there will be a grand monument of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, which will continue to inspire us to work for Dalits, victims, exploited and deprived people.
At the same time, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to live in London - 10, King Henry Road and that house has also been purchased.
When the Indians travelling across the globe will go to London, the memorial that Baba Saheb Ambedkar is going to build in the state of Maharashtra will become our inspiration.
I salute the Government of Maharashtra for these two efforts to honour Baba Saheb Ambedkar. I respect him and congratulate him.
My dear brothers and sisters, You must tell me your thoughts before the next episode of Mann Ki Baat because I believe that democracy runs with public participation.
The country can move forward only by joining the shoulder.
My best wishes to you all.
This year the rain has started well.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will definitely help in sowing kharif.
And a happy thing has come to my mind and I am very happy.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor should have pulses, there should be some oil in vegetables and so on.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this. I congratulate them.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The country's farmer's relationship is as much from the land as the country's youth.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers was overwhelmed by hundreds of enemies.
I bow down to those brave soldiers who have failed their enemies, regardless of their lives.
The Kargil war was not fought only on the borders, it contributed to this war in every city, every village of India.
This war fought for those mothers and sisters whose young sons or brothers were fighting against the enemies in Kargil.
Those daughters fought, with whose hands, the peacock's peacock had not yet landed.
And therefore, on the occasion of Kargil Vijay Diwas, I salute all these freedom fighters.
On 26th July, I consider it to be even more important because, in a few months after the formation of our government in 2014, we had launched MyGov on 26th July.
Our resolve to enhance public participation in democracy, to connect the people with the work of development and today after one year I am happy to say this thing that nearly two crore people have seen MyGov.
Nearly 5. 5 lakh people made their comments and most glad that more than 50 thousand people suggested on PM applications, they took out their time, they made Mind Apply and it was considered important.
Now the matter is small, but nobody in the government ever noticed this, nor was it ever thought about it.
But the government seriously considered the suggestion of Bhai Akhilesh Vajpayee and today this system has been implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today, the people who are formed, the taglines are formed, the program is created, the policy is created, the MyGov receives very positive suggestions.
There is a new rich air experience in the governance system.
A new consciousness is experienced.
These days I have started getting suggestions on MyGov as to what I should say on 15th August.
Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai, he has sent a lot of suggestions.
Beti Bachao, speak on daughter-in-law, speak on clean Ganga, speak on clean India.
But this gave me an idea, what should I say on 15th August, can you send me suggestions
You can send it to MyGov, write letters on All India Radio and write letters to the Prime Minister's Office.
I believe that perhaps it is a good idea to suggest suggestions from the public about my speech on 15th August.
I am sure you will send good suggestions.
One thing I want to express my concern.
I do not want to preach nor do I seek a way out of the responsibilities of the state government, central government or local Swaraj units.
Just two days ago, I saw an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver was tortured for 10 minutes.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people keep writing on this thing that you speak something on the road safety.
Be it Hoshakote Akshay of Bengaluru, Amay Joshi of Pune, Prasanna Kakunje of Murbidari in Karnataka.
And when you look at the data, the heart shakes.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to the accident, one death occurs every 4 minutes due to road accident.
And the biggest concern is that nearly one-third of those who die are young people between the ages of 15 and 25 and one death shakes the entire family.
The government must do whatever it wants to do, but I ask parents, whether it is driving two-wheelers or running four-wheelers, the environment of safety should also be encouraged in the family.
Another project is for us, it is going to be expanded further, it is going to be expanded, from there to Mumbai, Ranchi, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondia highways, and it means that who will not pay for the first fifty hours or not, who will not give the money, who will not give up all these concerns and whoever is injured in the road accident, how to get the best service, how we are giving priority to it.
Toll-free 1033 numbers, ambulance arrangements for providing information about accidents across the country but all these things are done after the accident.
We all are really very dear to see that every single life is very dear to the accident and we need to see it in that way.
Sometimes I say, become an employee Karmayogi.
In the past, some incidents came to my notice, I felt good to talk to you, sometimes the person gets tired of doing a job, and for a few years things are fine, salaries are available, work will be done.
I was glad to see this great example of how life can be brought to my work.
Vijay Biswal has told how his interest, his art, his ability can be linked to his work.
Perhaps Vijay Biswal's painting will be discussed in the coming days.
And one more thing came to my mind - the entire team of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, the entire group started a work that touched my heart and I liked this thing.
He started Operation Mali Yudh - Now somebody will hear it and it will be something else.
See how Rakshabandhan has changed, I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
Sometimes these small things enjoy my heart, so I am sharing it with you.
There is a small village by haircut in Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village have tried to make toilets for the last few months.
And now no person in that village has to go to open defecation.
He did this, but when the entire work was completed, the entire village celebrated such a big festival as it is celebrated.
These excellent examples of how the society is changing the values of life, how the minds of the people are changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I am writing from Bhavesh Deka, Guwahati, in relation to North-East questions.
The people of Northeast are also very active.
They keep writing a lot, it's a good thing.
But today I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to them that there is a separate ministry for the North East.
They will go to the districts, they will go to the villages, they will meet the local government officials, talk to the people's representatives, talk to the citizens.
We will listen to the problems, we will do whatever the Government of India has to do to solve the problems.
These efforts will bring very good results in the coming days.
And those officers who come after visiting, they also feel that how beautiful state, how good people, now they have to develop this area and they have to stay by solving their problems.
Returning with this resolution, even after coming to Delhi, it has become very easy to understand the problems there.
So a good effort is to go from Delhi to the far east, which I am calling Act East Policy. This is the fact.
My dear countrymen, we all are proud of the fact that we enjoy the success of Mars Mission.
But sometimes these ideas also come to the fore. Today, if we talk to the younger generation and ask them what you want to be ahead then one or half of the 100 students will be found who will say that I have to become a scientist.
It is a matter of great concern that the trend towards science has diminished.
It is very important to take interest in innovation, to encourage them, to know their capabilities.
I would also like to tell the IAS officers of the government that if you have proceeded by reading so much then you should also go to a school-college near you for two to four hours a week and talk to the children.
Your experience and your strength will certainly be of use to this new generation.
Work is difficult, but to do.
We have started this and in the years to come, we will get 24 hours of electricity.
Even the children of the village, if you want to read in the days of the examination, do not have the problem of electricity.
If the small industries are to be installed in the village, then electricity will be obtained.
Today, even if we have to charge mobile phones, we have to go to another village.
The benefits that the cities get should be met by the villages.
And that is why we have started the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti programme.
I know that such a large country, lakhs of villages and villages have to reach far and wide.
But, it's only for the poor to run.
Today, in the matter of mind, there was a mind to talk about different things.
In a way, in our country, the month of August, the month of September, the festivals are celebrated.
There are a lot of festivals.
My best wishes to you all.
Surely send me suggestions for August 15.
Your thoughts will be of great help to me.
In the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had requested you people that if you go anywhere on vacations, if there is a memorable picture there then an Incredible India will be established.
When I said, I didn't think there would be such a tremendous result.
Millions of people posted photos, Twitter Pay, Facebook Pay, Instagram.
I can say that we can see a scene more than one, India is full of diversities.
Be it architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas.
Perhaps the government of India has never thought that in terms of tourism, people can do such a big thing that you people have done.
And I was so impressed that I too had re-tweeted it.
We will carry it forward, we will continue, the world will see, our countrymen will see, our new generation will see.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister but sometimes a person within me loses himself from all the other dignitaries.
June 21, International Day of Yoga, I can say that my mind was agitated in the same way as I had put this topic in the NCC.
We can say with the claim that the sun never sets in the world of yoga practices.
The way the world has honoured Yoga by spreading its footsteps, the way the entire world took it on its shoulders, who would not be proud of it
The mind was overwhelmed.
And when the people of France, for whom the Sean River and Field Tower are very glorious symbols, chose that place to do Yoga, they gave it the place of equality.
People in New York performed Yoga on Times Sure.
If we talk about Australia, Sydney then the picture of Pera House comes to us.
The citizens of Australia have done yoga at the same time by placing Yoga in equivalent to the pera House.
It is a matter of pride in itself whether it is North America or Silicon Valley or Milan's Eumo Cathedral.
Similarly, the NPCC-Kepping Force also performed well in the field of Yoga.
Even in India, our soldiers were performing Yoga on Siachen, on a white sheet of snow, while Yoga programmes were organised by the Navy in the sea, all around, wherever our naval ships were.
Delhi has registered its position in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became Yogapath.
I am grateful to the country and the world, and I can say that this was not a programme.
It seemed as if every corner of the world had a new curiosity, a new joy, a new zeal, a new engagement.
A few days ago, when I had tweeted a photo on Twitter, a family from Vietnam suming up a small child, it was so lovely that it became so popular all over the world.
Everyone, be it old men or women or children or be it villages or be it developing countries or be it developing countries or be it developing countries, everyone has joined.
Yoga became a reason to connect the world in the true sense.
But one thing I feel, and every Indian can feel proud that the world is very keen to know India.
A curiosity towards India has increased.
The values here, the traditions here, the heritage of this place, the world wants to know.
We all have the responsibility of sharing this legacy of ours without a lagulpet and sharing the world with us.
But we will be able to introduce this when we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so familiar that what is new in our things, it seems like our family values, we do not know that India's family values are very big for the world.
I'm sure it'll be amazing.
There are a lot of things that our ancestors have given us and the world has the right to the best.
The success of International Yoga Day has brought a new responsibility with joy and satisfaction.
It is our responsibility to give the best yoga teachers to the world.
It is our responsibility to see all the traditions of Yoga from the world through a platform.
Institutions related to yoga should be introduced, knowledge of yoga gurus, information about yoga.
If you want to learn Yoga then you can learn where to get a Yoga teacher, a database should be prepared and I believe that you can do it.
Let us start from somewhere, this will also become a new power.
I have seen the events and the perspectives of the past few days, the government working, the government running, once the target is set, we have seen how the results can be achieved.
And when there was disappointment all around, we should not forget that a year ago, a single voice used to be heard from all around, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine that AYUSH is a department in the government and sometimes no one pays attention to it.
In 2-5 years, sometimes a small news comes in the newspaper and it comes in a corner, a small department, but it leads the Yoga Day.
And the small departments of the world have done such a big job.
If the goal is in front, then how much small units also work, it is a sample.
In the past, the world saw how our people saved the victims from Yemen.
In a short span of time, when the people of India reached Nepal to help them, when the government working in the bank opened Jan Dhan accounts, people from all the banks came to the ground and in a short span of time crores of countrymen were connected to the bank.
On August 15, I had appealed for toilets in schools from the Red Fort and I had said that we have to complete this work by August 15.
The work that was not completed in 60 years was very courageous and about 4. 5 lakh toilets were being constructed but today I can say with satisfaction that there is a delay of 15th August but it has not been completed but people have completed the construction of toilets in almost every school.
It means that the government, the people, the government, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month we had launched three public safety schemes, I had done it from Calcutta.
There has been a very positive result in such a short time.
In India, very little work has been done in terms of public safety but due to these three schemes we are putting a huge jump.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined these public safety schemes somewhere but we have to move forward.
Rakshabandhan festival comes in August.
On behalf of Rakshabandhan's brother, sister can have a huge gift.
Let us all work together with me to fulfill this resolution.
When I talk about mind, many people send me suggestions too.
This time I should say something for the monsoon, many people have sent such suggestions.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harsh Vardhan ji of Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji, he said that you must tell something about the mind for the monsoon.
They have sent good suggestions.
You might also enjoy hot pakoras, bhajiyas, corn along with tea in the rain.
But the way the sun rays give life, the same rain gives strength to our lives.
The water of the village should remain in the village, the water of the city should remain in the city, it should be our resolve and efforts should be made to stop the water.
And rain water stops and if it returns to the ground and there is a recharge in the ground then problems of the year are solved.
I always tell the people that if you visit Porbandar in Gujarat and if you visit the house of Mahatma Gandhi then there is a tank in the geography within the house of two hundred years old people in which there was a provision to go there straight away.
Porbandar is on the coast of the sea, but sweet water was stored in the house by collecting rain water, so much care was done at that time too.
We can also do so.
All of us should be planting trees, planting trees in large quantities by social organizations and youth during this rainy season.
And I give you a suggestion and I have a direct experience and a very successful experience.
This is my total rural technology.
When you plant a plant, plant an old soil pitcher in the bugyal of the plant and fill it with water.
If you fill the water twice a month, it will also run.
I also tell the farmers to plant trees instead of fencing on the edge of your farm.
They will become your property.
And we know that in the rainy days, diseases spread a lot with water.
Due to the increase in moisture in the environment, bacteria start flourishing and cleanliness becomes very important for this, cleanliness becomes very important.
Insistence on drinking pure water is necessary.
It is true that the number of cases we will care will be far from us.
Water should also be rained, but disease should also be avoided.
Friends, We have just launched three new schemes, especially for the urban masses.
There are about 500 small towns in our country.
Under the Amrit (AMRT) scheme, we have taken a big campaign to make our cities eligible for life.
In the same way, there should be a country that can equalize the world.
There should be such a smart city in the country and on the other hand the poorest of the poor should also have their own house to live in the country and the house should also have electricity, water, toilets and schools to study nearby.
In 2022, when India will celebrate 75 years of independence, we want to give our countrymen home.
We have started a big scheme with these three things.
I am confident that all these schemes will help in transforming urban life.
I myself am connected with you all through social media, you keep meeting me with you people, you keep getting good information about the government.
But sometimes a person sitting in a remote village also touches our hearts.
You know, a daughter Bachao-Beti Teacho Program is being run by the government.
But when a person, society, village becomes a part of the government's programme, how much increases its strength.
In the past, Shri Sunil Jaglan ji, a Sarpanch of Bibipur village in Haryana, took him a very funny initiative.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low compared to boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country in which this condition is worrisome.
Most in Haryana.
But the Sarpanch Beti Bachao Abhiyan of a small village of Haryana will be given such a turning point, then it gives a lot of pleasure and a new hope is awakened.
That's why I express my happiness.
But this incident has inspired me and therefore I also urge you to post the selfiewithdaughter with your daughter.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao with her will write a tagline that will give strength to this idea and will write a best line, it can happen in any language be it English or Hindi or be it your mother tongue or any language.
The very inspiring tagline I will retweet your daughter and your daughter.
In a way, we can all convert this thing into a mass movement to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao.
Brother Sunil started the work from Bibipur village in Haryana and let us move forward together and I urge you to post the selfiewithdaughter.
I wish you all the very best in this rain and enjoy the rain.
Make our country green.
You should continue the practice of Yoga, not for one day.
You see, you'll see the benefits.
Make it a part of your life, do it.
Incredible India, you must travel somewhere, keep sending photographs.
The country and the world will know how diversity our country has.
One thought that there was very little about handicraft in it.
We have to reach the world, we have to reach the characteristics of India all around.
And we have a simple medium, we'll reach.
My dear countrymen, today I will meet for the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
He used to listen, repeat and sometimes inspire his own thoughts and ideas as a self-sufficiency of the family of 130 crore countrymen.
You can imagine how it must have been in the middle of the period.
Perhaps, it wasn't a lifeless program.
This programme was full of vitality, affinity, attachment of hearts and because of this, the time spent between me and me felt very difficult.
I was missing something every moment and when I talk to my mind, I may say, the words are mine, the voice is mine, but, the story is yours, Purushartha is yours, Parakram is yours.
Feeling an emptiness
But this Sunday has waited a lot
Well, I've got the chance.
A lot of messages have been received in the last few months in which people have said that they are missing the mindset
Sometimes I feel that this is my own journey to the world.
This is my journey from vital to vital
My silent conversation with you for me was in a way a part of the experience of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions as to why I went to Kedarnath during the election crisis.
Most people have drawn political meaning from it
For me, that was the opportunity to meet me.
In a way I went to meet me,
I will not tell you other things today, but I will certainly do that because of this compulsion of my mind, perhaps he had given the opportunity to fill something in the valley of Kedar, in that lonely cave.
The rest of your curiosity - I think I ' ll ever discuss it .
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, your effort to emphasize a positive thing, I constantly feel about you.
The letters that come in for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are received are completely different from the government functioning.
In a way your letter also becomes an inspiration for me and sometimes it becomes a cause of energy .
Sometimes some of your words do the job of sharpening my thought process.
People present the challenges faced by the country and the society as well as the solutions.
If someone writes for hygiene , he is displeasing with dirt , but also appreciates the efforts of sanitation .
If someone talks about the environment then he feels the pain, but at the same time he himself tells the experiments he has seen - he also tells the experiments he has seen and the imaginations that he has in his mind also depicts.
This tells us that there is no dearth of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
Needless to incorporate those strengths and talents, provide opportunities, implement them
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that all the 130 crore people want to join the country in the development of the country with strength and activity. And I must say this thing that I get so many letters in Mann Ki Baat, so many telephone calls, so many messages are received, but the element of complaint is very low and someone has asked for something for himself.
When I analysis these things, you can imagine how much pleasure my heart will have, how much energy I will get.
Actually I have not come - you have brought me, you have set me up and you have given me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this spirit, let's move forward with the talk of mind.
When the Emergency was imposed in the country, its opposition was not confined to political circles, it was not confined to politicians, it was not confined to prison bars.
During the Emergency, every citizen of the country had started feeling that some of them had been taken away.
Recently, the General Assembly of Democracy, the massive election campaign, the rich and the poor in our country, all of them were happy to decide the future of our country in this festival.
When something is very close to us, we underestimate its importance and its amazing facts are also ignored.
In India, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, more than 61 crore people voted, city one floor
This number may seem very common to us but if I say in terms of the world that if we leave a China then more people in India had voted in comparison to any country in the world.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost double
The total number of electors in India is more than the total population of Europe .
It introduces the vastness and broadness of our democracy
2019 Lok Sabha Election was the worlds largest democratic election in history till date
You can imagine how much resources and manpower would have been required to complete such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and employees have been elected hard day and night
In order to successfully fulfil this great yagna of democracy, nearly 3 lakh security personnel of paramilitary forces have fulfilled their responsibilities, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also laboured.
These people ' s hard work resulted in more voting than the last time .
About 10 lakh polling stations across the country, more than 40 lakh EVMs (M) machines, more than 17 lakh VVPATs (VVPATs) machines, you can imagine how big tamas
All this was done so as to ensure that no voter is deprived of his franchise
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, polling station was created for just one female voter.
Polling station at the highest level in the world is also in India
The polling station is located at an altitude of 15000 feet in Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is also another fact of pride in this election.
Perhaps, this is the first time in history that women have voted with enthusiasm like men
Voting percentage of women and men in this election was almost equal
Another encouraging fact related to this is that today there are 78 women MPs in the Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission, and every person associated with the election process, and bow down to the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from me several times, don't book, I was urging you to give books instead of flowers in reception.
Since then , people have started giving books in many places
However, I could not get much time, but during my stay I got an opportunity to read some of his stories again
His stories encompass the whole of India ' s mind .
When I was reading the story of his written drug addiction, my mind automatically went to the economic inequalities prevailing in the society.
This story of amindar's son, Ishwari and the poor family's bir, teaches that if you are not cautious then you don't know when the impact of evil consistency comes.
The second story, which touched my heart inside, was Idgah, the sensitivity of a child, his pure love for his grandmother, such a mature feeling at such a young age.
When Hamid of 4-5 years reaches his grandmother with a spoon from the fair, in reality, human sensitivity reaches its peak.
The last line of this story is very emotional because it has a great truth in life, child Hamid played the part of old Hamid, old Amina, girl Amina.
One such big poignant story is the night of Puss
This story saw a live depiction of the irony of a poor farmer life .
Even after the crop is destroyed, the light farmer is happy because now he will not have to sleep in the cold field.
Although these stories are almost a century ago, their relevance still feels the same.
After reading these, I had a different kind of feeling
When it comes to reading, in any media, I was reading about Kerala's Akshara Library
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village situated between the dense forests of Idukki.
P. K. Muralidharan, elementary school teacher and P. V. Chinnathampi, who runs a small tea shop, both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by filling in the clutches and putting them on the back
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone along with tribal children.
Gujarat campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat
Millions of people of every age group participated in this campaign to read books .
In today's digital world, in the time of Google Guru, I would urge you to take some time to place the book in your daily routine as well.
You will really do a lot of enjoyment and write about all the books you read on the NarendraModi App so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat will know about it .
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of our country are thinking about issues which are a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModi App and Mygov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written to me about water related challenges.
Water is of great importance in our culture .
Give your mother ' s blessings . Keep showering your grace upon us .
Lack of water affects many parts of the country every year
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water received from rain in a year is saved in our country .
I believe that like other problems, we will also solve this crisis with the strength, collaboration and determination of one hundred and thirty crore countrymen with the participation of the people, with the power of the people.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country keeping the importance of water paramount
This will enable faster decision making on all issues related to water
A few days ago I tried to do something different
I wrote a letter to Sarpanches across the country to Gram Pradhan
I wrote to the Gram Pradhans that to save water, to accumulate water, to save drops of rain water, they should convene a Gram Sabha meeting and discuss with the villagers.
I am happy that he has shown full enthusiasm in this work and on 22nd of this month crores of people have donated shramdaan in thousands of panchayats.
People in villages resolved to accumulate one drop of water
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to tell you about a Sarpanch.
Listen, Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Cuttackamsandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us a message. My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
People there, once again ready to play their active role for water conservation
On behalf of me, I convey my best wishes to all the Gram Pradhans, to all the Sarpanches, to them for this activism.
There are many Sarpanches across the country who have taken the lead in water conservation
In a way, it has become an opportunity for the entire village.
It seems that the people of the village have now gathered in their village, as in the competition to build a water temple.
As I said, collective efforts can have big positive outcomes
There can be no single formula for dealing with water crisis all over the country .
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in different ways for this.
But everyone's goal is the same, and that is to save water, water conservation
Trainage lines are being corrected in Punjab
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging
The construction of the tank in Thimmaipalli (Thimaipalli) of Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the villages.
In Kabirdham, Rajasthan, there has been a major change in the small ponds built in the fields.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20,000 women came together to revive the Nag Nadhi.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working very well on rainwater harvesting.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we work together, we can also make the impossible possible.
When people will connect, water will survive
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I am making three requests from the countrymen.
My first request is that the countrymen should make cleanliness a mass movement, just as they should start a mass movement for water conservation.
Together we should resolve to save every drop of water. And I believe that water is God's offerings, water is the form of Paras.
Earlier they said that iron becomes gold from the touch of Paras .
I say, the water is Paras and from Paras, the touch of water, the new life is created.
Initiate an awareness campaign to save one drop of water
Tell us about the problems related to water, as well as spread the ways to save water.
I specially urge people from different fields to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is in the film industry, in the sports world, in the media, in the social organizations, in the cultural organisations, in the storytellers, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
Awaken the society, connect the society, join the society
You see, we will be able to see changes in front of our eyes.
My second request to the countrymen is that many traditional methods are being used for conservation of water in our country for centuries.
I urge all of you to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar, Pujya Bapu's birthplace then there is another house behind the house of revered Bapu, there is a water storage tank of 200 years old and there is water in it and there is a provision to stop rain water then I always used to say that those who go to Kirti Mandir must see the stalk of that water.
Let us connect with water conservation and motivate people to conserve water by making a list of more and more methods
You can share your content using all JanShakti4JalShakti hashtag
My dear countrymen, I have to express my gratitude to you for one thing and also to express my gratitude to the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again in Yoga Day, with the zeal and enthusiasm, three-four generations of each family came together to celebrate Yoga Day.
The awareness that has come up for the Holistic Health Care, the importance of Yoga Day is increasing.
Everyone, in every corner of the world, if a yogic lover welcomes him as soon as the sun sets, then there is a complete journey to the sunset.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from air force to aircraft carriers, from A gyms to penetrating desert, from villages to cities, Yoga was not only done everywhere, but it was also collectively celebrated.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities, ordinary citizens from many countries of the world showed me on Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their respective countries.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family
We all know that a healthy society requires healthy and sensitive persons and that is what Yoga ensures
Therefore, the promotion of Yoga is a great work of social service.
Should not he be honored by recognizing such a service
The announcement of Prime Ministers Awards for outstanding contribution in the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019 was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award has been given to organizations around the world about which you have not even imagined how they have made significant contributions in the promotion of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and training courses there or take the name of Ms. Antonietta Roi of Italy who started Sarva Yoga International and spread Yoga throughout Europe.
These are inspiring examples in themselves .
If this is a subject related to yoga, can Indians stay behind
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger was also honoured. For the past several decades, Yoga has been dedicated to Yoga.
It is a very important journey for me to connect with your thoughts.
Let us meet, keep talking
Keep listening to your emotions, keep absorbing, understand
Sometimes I try to live those emotions.
Be your blessings
You are my inspiration, you are my energy
Let's sit together and enjoy the matter of mind and also play the responsibilities of life.
Then once again next month we ' ll meet again for Mann Ki Baat
Thank you very much to me
This weather is also hot on one side, and it is also a joy somewhere.
Talk of mind, April 2015
Talk of mind, December 2014
And I have seen that there was no programme for the evils of the government, there was anxiety and I believe that in a way there was a need to get out of the problem and due to this an atmosphere of good deliberations has started. The government's responsibilities have also been sensitized. They think that they cannot remain indifferent.
Have you ever thought
Imagine
This is the money of drugs if they go to terrorists .
If the terrorists buy arms from these money
And with the same weapons , a terrorist would have to stain the breasts of my country ' s soldiers
My country's young will be martyred
Have you ever thought that a mother who was killed in the red of a mother, the life of the mother of India, who was shot in the chest of a soldier who lived and died for the country
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their secular progress with our children
Modi ji, do not you get tired
A month is very long .
Many incidents happen in the country and the world .
All of you celebrated Diwali with zeal and enthusiasm .
Festivals are such that from time to time they keep on enjoying their lives, be it the poor, the rich, the village or the city or everybody's life has its own importance.
Sometimes they think that people are useless, people have nothing to do. Our country is like this.
It is very important for me to change this thinking. Our country is not like this, the people of our country are not like this.
Sometimes I feel that the country is far ahead, governments are far behind.
And when I say with experience that perhaps even the governments need to change their thinking .
And that is why I see that these young people are committed to doing something or the other especially in India, they are looking for opportunities.
and doing it in its own way .
I had said last time, buy at least one Khadi cloth.
I didn ' t ask anyone to become a khadi strip . But I learned from the Khadi stores that in a week , there was an increase in the sales of nearly 100 percent of the Hundred and Twenty five percent .
In a way , more than double khadi was sold in a week since 2nd October as compared to last year .
This means that the people of the country are many times ahead of what we think.
I salute the people of India .
Cleanliness can be imagined that cleanliness will become such a mass movement.
There are plenty of expectations, and should also be.
And I can see a good result. Cleanliness is now being seen in two parts.
What is the old mess that is filthy, what is the government machinery, what will the people sitting in the government do for it
It ' s a big challenge , but you can ' t run away from responsibility .
All governments have to take steps for this responsibility as the pressure of the public is going to increase.
And the media is also playing a very good role in it .
But the other aspect that is very exciting, enjoyable and satisfying the mind. The common man is beginning to feel that lets go off the first thing, lets not dirt anymore.
We ' re not gonna do it in the new filth .
Someone from Satna, Madhya Pradesh, Shri Bharat Gupta has sent a mail to my Mygov.
He was going to visit his.Railway, his own experience said. He said that I used to go to the railway earlier, even this time I went to the railway but I am seeing that every passenger in the railway. People keep eating and drinking in the railway, keep throwing paper and paper. They did not throw anybody, not only did they find that there is a dustbin in the box, put garbage in it.
And when they saw that there was no arrangement in the railways , they collected their garbage in the corner .
He said it was a very pleasant experience for me .
I am grateful to Bharat ji for giving me this information .
But I am seeing this that the biggest impact has been on small children .
Hundreds of families discuss this thing that if our child still eats chocolates somewhere then he takes the paper immediately .
I just saw someone in a social media that someone had written. My hero of today and in my hero of today he had given a picture of a child.
You see. Everyone has started feeling that our country, we will not be dirty.
We don ' t blame the filth .
And whatever they do, they feel embarrassed, and soon somebody gets to touch them.
I consider this auspicious sign .
It is also a good thing that people who come to meet me these days, people from all walks of life meet me.
Somebody talks about cleanliness, somebody talks about education, somebody talks about social reform.
Someone is discussing the loss of our family life .
I think , otherwise , if such a businessman comes first , he will talk to the Government about his own selfishness .
But I see a major change .
They talk about their selfishness less, they talk about taking some responsibilities in society.
These are the things that I see by adding, I can see that we are moving forward in the direction of a very good change.
If a poor family of mine is not ill , there will never be an economic crisis in his life .
If he is healthy then he will work hard, earn, family will run.
And therefore, my cleanliness is directly related to the health of my poor brothers and sisters.
Whether we are able to serve the poor better or not , we don ' t do dirt , even if we don ' t do it , it is good for the poor .
Even then , I have seen that those who are working in this field are sending me their success stories .
But two things came to me from my Government .
After my saying the officers of H . . . ministry whom we had to do something .
And the officers made a plan together .
See how change starts in government .
On one hand he decided that if he wants to go to the specialty-all child then he has planned to give him special scholarship after liking such a thousand good specialty-all child .
I compliment all the officers of the department for their ideas .
I had the opportunity to visit Siachen in the past .
I spent my life in the midst of the dead for the country of Diwali .
When the country was celebrating Diwali, I went to Siachen.
Because of them, we are able to celebrate Diwali, so I went among them.
I experienced how many difficulties they live in.
I salute the soldiers who protect the country .
But today I have to say another pride .
The youth of our country work in the field of security .
During natural calamities by putting a stake in life anyone becomes ready to do any courage to save us .
I specially congratulate these soldiers .
I had just got the opportunity that I had organised a tea programme with the youngsters, youngsters and the winners of sports.
I got a new energy .
His enthusiasm, excitement, I was seeing that our facilities and facilities are very low compared to other countries but they were talking about doing more with enthusiasm and enthusiasm rather than complaining.
Tea-drinking programme was very inspiring for me in my own right.
On one hand, I want to tell the countrymen, and I really want to say it and it is my mind.
And I believe that the countrymen have faith in my words and trust in my intentions.
But today , once again , I want to repeat it on my behalf .
As far as black money is concerned, Black Money is concerned, my countrymen, trust your Prime Servant, this is the Artificial of Father for me.
The money that has gone out of the poor of India should come back to the pi-pie, this is my commitment.
There can be differences of opinion in terms of ways, methods and methods.
And democracy is natural , but I assure you that we are on the right path , on the basis of my understanding and knowledge that I possess .
Today no one is aware of it, neither I know nor the government, neither you nor the previous government knew how much money was out.
Everyone keeps on telling statistics in their own way .
I don't want to engage in those figures. My commitment is that of two rupees, five rupees, billions, billions and billions of dollars.
And I assure you that there will be no dearth of my efforts .
Nobody will be allowed to do so .
Just keep me blessed.
Whatever I have to do for you, whenever I have to do it, I will continue to do it.
I assure you of this .
I have received a letter .
Mr . Abhishek has come from Parikh .
However, even though I was not the Prime Minister, many mothers and sisters had expressed this feeling.
He has told me that you must discuss this matter in your mind .
I agree with his suffering .
When I talk about the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely discuss about this drug abuse, these drugs, these drug mafia and the greatest crisis that India's youth can face.
If you have some experience in this regard, if you have some information, if you have saved the children who are addicted to this addiction, if some government officials have played a very good role in protecting them then if you give me such information then I will talk to the countrymen about these good efforts and we will create an atmosphere in every family that no child should follow this path due to frustration, we will discuss it in detail.
I know that I am handling topics with which the Government comes first in the dock .
But how long will we hide things
I am also daring . Because of your love .
Because of your blessings and I will continue to do so .
Some people have also told me that Modi ji, you were asking us to give suggestions on the face book, give it on Twitter, send an e-mail.
But there are very large sections of the country, who don't have this, what do they do
Your point is correct .
All of them don ' t have this facility .
So I tell you that if you want to say something about my mind then if you listen to me on village-village radio then you will definitely reach me if you send a letter to AIR, Parliament Street, New Delhi.
And I ' ll take it seriously . Because the active citizen is the largest capital of development .
You write a letter, means you're very active.
To speak of my mind, you should also add to your mind.
Maybe you ' ll write a letter .
I will try to talk to you next month.
My effort will be, whenever I talk, I will do it on Sunday, I will do it at 11 a.m.
So I ' m getting more access to you .
Gradually the start of cold is happening .
There is a very good weather for health .
But along with this there is also a very good weather for health .
Don ' t let it go .
Use it a lot .
My dear countrymen, today is the auspicious festival of Vijayadashmi.
Many-many congratulations to you all on Vijayadashmi.
I will try to talk to you once in a month or twice in a month.
Further, I have also thought in my mind that whenever I talk about it, it will be Sunday and the time will be at 11 o'clock then you will also be convenient. And I will also be satisfied that I have succeeded in conveying my thoughts to you.
Today, the festival of Vijayadashmi which celebrates Vijayadashmi is a festival of victory of good over evils.
But a gentleman of Ganesh Venkatadari Mumbai, he sent a mail to me, he said that in Vijayadashmi we will resolve to abolish ten evils within us.
I express my gratitude to him for this suggestion.
Everyone must think that as a nation, let us resolve to rid ourselves of dirt on the auspicious festival of Vijayadashmi and achieve the victory by eliminating dirt, we can make this resolution on the occasion of Vijayadashmi.
I had said one thing yesterday in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that I will invite nine people and they will clean themselves and upload their video to social media and they will invite nine more people.
When we talk about Mahatma Gandhi, the talk of Khadi comes in very natural meditation.
You know, our scientists have successfully used to reach Mars in the least cost.
There is no shortage of our strength, only we have forgotten our power.
Have forgotten yourself.
Swami Vivekananda always used to say one thing that Swami Vivekananda always used to say one thing.
Once, the child who had gone with the lioness had grown up.
He said hey, what are you doing
You're a lion.
They made me bigger.
Look at my voice, look at the way of my conversation.
So the lion said that let me show you who you are.
He took him to a well and showed his face inside the water in the well and said to him with his own face - Look, the face of both of us is one.
I am also a lion, you are also a lion and as soon as the self-esteem arose from within him, he got his own identity, he also started roaming like that lion, the lion grew between the sheep.
The essence within it has awakened.
Swami Vivekananda ji used to say this.
My countrymen, within 1. 25 billion Indians, there is immense power and immense potential.
We need to recognize ourselves.
There is a need to recognise the strength within us and then as Swami Vivekananda ji had said, we will be victorious if we move ahead with that self-esteem and accurate identity then our nation will be victorious and successful.
I spent two hours with them, perhaps it was a very emotional, inspiring event in my life.
God may have liked that family, but that child is the responsibility of the whole nation.
Later, I was so emotionally touched that I used to do different Olympics for Specialty Abeld children in Gujarat.
Thousands of children used to come, their parents used to come, I used to go there myself.
And that is why I liked Gautam Pal's suggestions that he has given me and I felt like sharing the suggestions that I have received with you.
A story gives me even more attention.
You knew why you did not tell.
My countrymen, unless we resolve to walk, we ourselves will not find even those who show the way.
We will not get to hold the finger and run.
We will have to start walking and I am confident that we are capable of walking 1. 25 billion and will continue to do so.
Many suggestions that come to me for a few days, big interesting suggestions are sent by people.
Some people have told me that when they start small scale industries then the process of registration of them should be easy.
I will definitely inform the government for it.
Some people have written to me and sent children to teach skill development from fifth grade.
Someone has written to me that there should be a dust bean within every hundred meters, if you have to arrange for cleanliness.
Some people have written to me and sent me that polythene pack should be banned.
A lot of suggestions are sending me.
I would like to tell you from the front that if you send me a true incident anywhere, which is positive, which inspires me, inspires the countrymen, if you send me such true events with evidence then I will certainly convey the message of Mann Ki Baat to the countrymen.
Come, let us all work together to serve our Mother India.
We should take the country to new heights.
As it comes to mind, I will definitely talk to you in the future.
I have told you the things that came to my mind today.
I will meet at 11 a.m. but I believe that our journey will continue and your love will remain.
Even if you want to say something to me after listening to me, please send it to me, I would like it.
I was very pleased to know that today it is a simple medium of radio that I will be able to reach far and wide.
I will reach out to the poorest of the poor because the strength of my country is in the hut of the poor, the strength of my country is in the village, the strength of my country is in the mothers, sisters and youngsters, the strength of my country is in the farmers.
The country will move forward only with your trust.
I believe.
I believe in your power, so I have faith in the future of India.
Starting with the mind , today is full of minds .
10 days ago, Mother India lost her brave sons
These brave heroes, we spent ourselves protecting 1. 25 billion Indians.
As the countrymen could sleep in peace, these brave sons had kept themselves together day and night.
In Pulwama terror attack, after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, people across the country, and people have tremors and resentment.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families have risen all around
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives, in the defense of Mother India.
We have to face this challenge before the country by forgetting all the differences of casteism, communalism, regionalism and others so that our steps against terror are stronger, stronger and decisive.
Our Armed Forces have always shown unique courage and valour .
In order to establish peace , where they have shown wonderful ability , they have also responded to the attackers in their own language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack .
Army has taken a pledge to destroy the terrorists and their helpers
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational stories of their families that have emerged through the media have further emphasized the freshness of the entire nation.
Ram Niranjan ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, in this hour of grief, the zeal shown by him inspires us all.
They said , They will send their second son to fight against the enemies , and if need be , they will fight .
The whole country is saluting the indomitable courage of Meena Ji, wife of martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
He has also vowed to join his only son
When the body of the martyr Vijay Shoren wrapped in the tricolor reached Gumla in Jharkhand, the innocent son said that I will also go to the army.
The zeal of this innocent person today expresses the feeling of children and children of India.
Similar feelings are being seen in the houses of our brave and brave martyrs.
One of our brave martyrs is not an exception, his family is not an exception
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya, the parents of Kangra's martyr Tilakraj or the six-year-old son of the martyr Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of the martyrs is full of inspiration.
I would urge the younger generation to know and understand the zeal shown by these families.
For what is patriotism, sacrifice and penance, we will not need to go towards the old events of history.
These are living and awakening examples before our eyes and these are the reasons for inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, the war memorial that was waiting for us for so long after independence is going to end now.
The curiosity and curiosity of the countrymen is very natural about this.
On NarendraModiApp, Shri Omkar Shetty from Udupi, Karnataka expressed his happiness at the National War Memorial being prepared.
I was surprised and anguished that there was no National War Memorial in India.
A memorial where the bravery of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives to protect the nation can be preserved.
I decided that there must be such a monument in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, i.e. on 25th February, millions of our countrymen will hand over this national military monument to our army.
The country will make a small effort to repay its debt
The heart of Delhi is that place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are present, just near it, a new monument has been built.
I am sure this will be like going to a pilgrimage site for the countrymen to visit the National Military Memorial.
National Sainik Memorial symbolizes the nations gratitude to the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice after Independence
The design of the memorial showcases the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers
The concept of the National Soldier Memorial is focused on four concentration circles, where the journey from the birth of a soldier to martyrdom is depicted.
The flame of Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier
The second circle is Veerta Chakra which showcases the courage and bravery of the soldiers.
This is a gallery where the exploits of bravery of soldiers on the walls have been engraved
After this, the sacrifice cycle is demonstrating the sacrifice of soldiers.
The names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the country are written in the golden letters .
After that the protector cycle displays security
This circle has rows of dense trees
These trees are symbols of soldiers and are giving messages to the citizens of the country assuring that every morning soldiers are stationed on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Overall, the National Soldiers Memorial will be identified as a place where people will come for the purpose of learning, expressing gratitude and research of the great martyrs of the country.
Here is the story of the sacrifices that have sacrificed their lives for the country , so that we may survive , so that the country can be secured and developed .
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our Armed Forces, Police and Paramilitary Forces to the development of the country in words
In October last year, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be grateful to the men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our security.
I hope you will visit the National Soldiers Memorial and National Police Memorial.
Whenever you visit, share your pictures on social media so that other people get inspiration from it and they too are eager to see this holy place, this memorial.
My dear countrymen, for the sake of Mann Ki Baat, thousands of letters and comments keep getting me read through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your comment, I got a very interesting comment from Atish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He has written that on March 3, 1900, the British had arrested Birsa Munda, then his age was only 25 years old. It is a coincidence that on March 3, Jamshedji is also the birth anniversary of Tata.
And he further writes, These two personalities are entirely from two different family backgrounds that enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In Mann Ki Baat , Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata are like bowing down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand in a way .
These two great personalities have enhanced the name of Jharkhand not the whole country
The whole country is grateful for their contribution
Today, if our youth need an inspirational personality for guidance, then that is Lord Birsa Munda
The British caught them secretly, while they were asleep
Do you know why they resorted to such cowardly action
because even the British who built such a big empire were afraid of them
Lord Birsa Munda shook the British rule equipped with guns and guns only with his traditional arrows
Indeed, when people get an inspirational leadership, then the collective will of the people on the power of arms is huge.
Lord Birsa Munda fought the British not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals .
They did all this in their little life .
In the dark life of the deprived and the exploited , the sun shines like a sun
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the young age of 25
Mother India's sons like Birsa Munda have been in every part of the country.
Perhaps some corner of India will be such that no one has contributed to this struggle for centuries of freedom.
But unfortunately, the stories of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice did not reach the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda made us realize his existence, then a person like Jamshedji Tata gave the country a big institution.
Jamshedji Tata was truly a visionary who not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He knew very well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry is essential for the future.
Not only that, he also established several world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai was born on 29th February.
As you all know , this day comes once in four years
Wealthy, peaceful personality, Morarji Bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Record Morarji Bhai Desai has the name of presenting the highest budget in Parliament in independent India .
Morarji Desai efficiently led India at a difficult time when there was a danger to the democratic fabric of the country.
Morarji Bhai Desai throws himself in the movement against Emergency to protect democracy .
For this he had to pay a heavy price even in old age .
The then government arrested him and put him in jail .
But when the Janata Party won the election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his tenure only 44th Constitutional Amendment was introduced .
This is important because the 42nd Amendment that was brought in during the Emergency, which included reduction in the powers of the Supreme Court and other provisions that violated our democratic values, was returned to them.
Provision of publication of proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies in newspapers through the 44th Amendment
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored. In this amendment, it was also made that the fundamental rights found under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution can not be violated even during the Emergency.
For the first time such arrangements were made that the President will announce the Emergency only on the written recommendation of the Cabinet and it was also decided that the period of emergency cannot be extended more than six months at a time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the manner in which democracy was killed in 1975 by imposing Emergency could not be repeated in the future.
His invaluable contribution to the upliftment of Indian democracy will always be remembered by future generations
Once again I pay my homage to such a great leader
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of curiosity about the Padma Awards.
Today, we are moving towards a New India. In this we want to respect those who are doing their job at the grassroot level with utmost sincerity.
With their hard work, they are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways.
Indeed, they are true Karmayogis, who are selflessly engaged in public service, social service and above all in national service.
You must have seen that when the Padma Award is announced , people ask who it is .
In a way, I consider it a big success because these are people who are not on the front page of TV, magazine or newspapers.
They are far from the world of glare, but these are people who do not care about their names, just believe in working at the grassroots level.
Yoga : Karmasu Kaushalam lives the message of the Gita in a way
I want to tell you about some of these people
You must have heard of Odisha's Daitari Nayak. He is not called the Danal Man of the Disha. The Daitari Nayak cut the mountain with his hands in his village and made it a canal for three kilometres. With his hard work, the problem of irrigation and water ended forever.
Take Abdul Gafoor Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job of reviving the traditional pathogen paintings of Kutch.
They ' re doing a great job of bringing this rare painting to the new generation
Tree of Life art by Abdul Ghafoor was gifted to former US President Barack Obama .
Among the recipients of the Padma Awards, Shabbir Sayyid of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau Mata
This is unique in itself , as they spent their whole life in the service of goats .
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who first tried to empower the victims and the exploited through the Kalanjium movement in Tamil Nadu as well as introduce community based small financial system
Even at the age of 100, he is training yoga to people all over the world and so far he has made 1500 people Yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, famously known as Lady Taran in Jharkhand, did the courageous work of taking iron from Timber Mafia and Naxalites. He not only saved 50 hectares of forest from debris but also motivated ten thousand women to unite and protect trees and wildlife.
It is the glory of Jamuna ji's hard work that today the villagers plant 10 trees on the marriage of 18 trees and girl on the birth of every child
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagli of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration. It is difficult to get an example of what he did for the upliftment of women with disabilities. They are engaged in the work of making visually impaired children self-reliant by establishing an institution called Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj.
The story of farmer aunt of Muzaffarpur in Bihar i.e. Rajkumari Devi is very inspiring
She has set an example to empower women and make farming profitable
Kisan Aunt linked 300 women in her area to Self Help Group and motivated them to become economically self-reliant.
He trained the women of the village in addition to farming and other means of employment. The special thing is that they worked in connecting technology with farming and my countrymen, perhaps for the first time it has happened that 12 farmers have received Padma awards in the Padma awards given this year.
Usually very few people associated with agriculture and very few direct farmers have come to the list of Padma Shris .
This in itself is a living picture of changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk to you about a heart-touching experience that I have been feeling for the past few days.
Nowadays, wherever I am going in the country, it is my endeavor to meet some beneficiaries of PM-JAY scheme of Ayushman Bharat.
He was treated with this scheme and he became healthy, the head of the house, he became a victim of the accident who took care of his family by working hard and was unable to work - he got the benefit of this scheme and he became healthy again, he started living a new life.
Brothers and sisters, Nearly 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme in the last five months.
I found how big a change was taking place in the lives of the poor
If you all know any poor person who is unable to get treatment due to lack of money , tell him about the scheme .
Separate education boards across the country will start the process for the examination of boards of Class  and II in the next few weeks.
I extend my warm greetings to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who take the exams.
A few days ago, a big event in Delhi was held in Format, Town Hall.
One of the characteristics of the discussion on the examination was that there were open discussions on various subjects related to the examination .
There are many aspects that can definitely be beneficial for the students .
If all the students, their teachers, parents can see the recording of this entire programme on YouTube, then my best wishes to all the Heam Warriors for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, it is not possible to talk about India and not to talk about festivals.
There is hardly a day in our country which does not have any significance, which has no festival
Because we have this heritage of culture thousands of years old
A few days later, the festival of Mahashivaratri is going to come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday, its special significance is enshrined in our temple.
He discussed a number of topics and his self - confidence was really influential - motivating .
During the interaction, when I was talking to an intelligent young man, he said, I am a stage artist, I mimicry in entertainment programmes, so I asked whom do you mimicry
So he told me I mimicry the prime minister
So I asked them to show a little bit and it was a pleasant surprise for me, so they did a mimicry of the way I talk about Mann Ki Baat.
I was very pleased to hear that people not only listen to mind but also remember it on many occasions .
I was really impressed by the power of that disabled young man .
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to join you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Through radio , I ' m going to meet millions of families every month
Sometimes when I talk to you, reading your letters or listening to the ideas sent on your phone, I feel that you have accepted me as a part of your family.
It ' s a very pleasant experience for me .
Friends, election is the biggest celebration of democracy
Next two months, we'll all be busy in the gathering of elections.
I myself will be a candidate in this election
Respecting a healthy democratic tradition, the next mind will be on the last Sunday of May
That is, in the month of March, in the month of April and in the entire month of May, all these three months of our emotions will be started with a new confidence after the election and once again with the power of your blessings I will start my conversation with you through Mann Ki Baat and I will continue to talk to you for years.
Once again I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
Shri Sri Sri Sivakumar Swami Ji, Doctor of Shri Siddhganga Math in Tumkur district of Karnataka has not been among us
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicates his entire life to the service of society
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us that Kayakav Kailas is like performing his duties while working hard, it is like being in the residence of Lord Shiva, Kailash Dham.
His fame was as a scholar who had a wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages
He was a social reformer
He dedicated his entire life to the cause of food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
Be it the welfare of the farmers in every way, it was a priority in the life of Swami ji.
Siddhganga Math regularly organised animal and agricultural fairs
I have often had the privilege of receiving the blessings of the supreme lord Swami ji .
In 2007, on the occasion of Centenary Year Celebrations of Shri Sri Shivkumar Swami ji, our former President Dr. A.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for Swamiji on this occasion .
On giving, you receive happiness almiight will bless, all your actions. This poem by Dr Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Sri Sri Shivkumar Swami Ji and the mission of Siddhganga Math in a beautiful manner.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
ECI was the foundation day on 25th January, which is observed as National Voters Day
The people of the world are surprised to see the scale on which elections are held in India and it is natural for every countryman to be proud of the Election Commission by seeing the good conduct of the Election Commission.
No effort is left in our country to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, is a registered voter, gets an opportunity to vote
When they hear these things , it is very natural to be proud of the Election Commission .
In view of that voter, that voter gets an opportunity to exercise his franchise, the entire team of EC staff goes to far-flung areas and arranges for voting - that is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its continued efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also compliment the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other staff who participate in the voting process and ensure free and fair elections.
Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country this year, this will be the first time that young people born in the 21st century will exercise their vote in Lok Sabha elections.
There is an opportunity for them to take the responsibility of the land on their shoulders .
Now they are going to be part of the decision making process in the country
It's time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register themselves as voters if they are eligible to vote.
It is my duty to vote together - these feelings should flourish within us
For any reason in life, if you cannot vote then there should be great pain
Sometimes there should be sadness if something goes wrong in the country .
I urge the celebrities of the country to collectively create awareness among the people about voter registration or voting on the day of polls.
I hope a large number of young voters will be registered and their participation will further strengthen our democracy
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some amazing, unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is polygamous
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different style
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I have the privilege of inaugurating a Museum dedicated to the heroes who have contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You know that many such rooms, buildings were closed since independence inside the Red Fort.
The rooms of those closed Red Fort have been converted into very beautiful museums, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and ICAI.
Museum dedicated to the Indian National Army
In each brick of these museums, the fragrance of our glorious history lies.
Things that tell the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle on the rocks of the museum inspire us to go within history.
At the same place, the brave sons of Bharat Maa Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillon and Maj Gen Shahnawaz Khan were tried by the British.
When I was visiting the memories associated with Netaji in the Red Fort, Kranti Mandir, then the members of Netaji's family presented me a very special cap, cap.
Sometimes Netaji used to wear the same cap
I kept the cap in the museum, so that the people coming there would see the cap and take inspiration from it.
Indeed , the valour and patriotism of our heroes need to be constantly conveyed to the new generation .
Just a month ago on 30 December I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands .
In a programme, the tricolor was hoisted right at the spot where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted at the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because it was the tradition on 15th August.
This was the 75th year of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and skilled organizer
a brave soldier who played an important role in the freedom struggle
Come to Delhi, give me blood, I will give you freedom, like Netaji made a place in the heart of every Indian with vibrant slogans
For many years it has been demanded that files related to Netaji be made public and I am glad that we can do this thing.
I remember that day when Netaji's entire family had come to the Prime Minister's residence
We together did a lot of things related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am glad that efforts have been made to develop many places associated with the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar
If you come to Delhi you must visit these places .
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I want to share a story related to Netaji's life with you.
I have always considered radio as an important means of connecting with people. Likewise, Netaji also had a very deep relationship with radio and he also chose radio to interact with the countrymen.
I was told that these radio stations also used to broadcast weekly news bulletins in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto Urdu etc.
The programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the masses and their programmes gave a lot of strength to our freedom fighters.
A visual art museum has also been built in this Kranti Mandir .
This has been an attempt to tell Indian art and culture in a very attractive manner .
There are 4 historical ehibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and art works of three centuries old .
Excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avnindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Saloj Mukherjee have been exhibited in the museum.
And I would especially urge you to go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji.
Now you must be wondering that art is being talked about here and I am talking to you about Gurudev Tagore ' s excellent work .
You have so far to go to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not name most of his work
He believed that the person who saw his painting himself understood that painting, let the message given by him in the painting go from his perspective
His paintings have been displayed in European countries, Russia and America
I hope you ' re going to see their paintings in the Kranti Mandir
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints
Our saints have given the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
One such saint was - Saint Ravidas
Ravidas Jayanti is on 19th February
The dohas of Saint Ravidas ji are very famous
Saint Ravidas ji used to give greatest messages through a few lines .
He had said that there is a caste in the caste, which can not be added to Ketan's feet, Radas man, unless the kind of banana stem is split, then the leaf under the leaves and finally nothing comes out, but the whole tree is over, in the same way the person has also been divided among the castes and not the human being.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every human being, then it is not appropriate to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life through his messages.
It would not be wrong to say that they have explained the real meaning of labour prestige to the world .
He used to say that if the mind is cheerful , then in the Kathauti Ganga meaning if your heart and mind are sacred , then God is in your heart .
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced the people of every section, be it the Maharaja of Chittor or the queen of Mirabai, all were his followers.
I once again bow down to Sant Ravidas ji
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov to highlight Indias space programme and its future aspects.
They also want me to urge the students to take interest in space programmes and think beyond the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate your thoughts and especially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, where I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Numerous young scientists of the country have contributed to our space programme.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching space.
The Kalam set created by our students on 24th January has been launched.
Sounding rockets made by university students in Odisha have also made several records.
The number of space missions that have been launched since independence till 2014, almost the same space mission has been started in the last four years.
We have also created a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously with the same spacecraft.
We will soon register India's presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign
Our country is also using space technology to protect our lives.
Whether it is cyclone or rail and road safety, space technology is getting a lot of help.
NAI devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which is helpful in their safety as well as in economic growth.
We are using space technology to further improve the delivery and accountability of government services
Around 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been geo-tagged in the scheme for Housing for All.
Along with this, about three and a half million properties were also geo-tagged under MNREGA.
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country
It has contributed a lot in our better relations with many countries of the world
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has gifted development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through its very competitive launch services, India today launches not only the developing countries but also the satellites of developed countries.
Sky and stars are always very attractive for children .
Our Space Programme gives children an opportunity to think big and move beyond the limits which were considered impossible so far.
This is a vision for our children to keep watching the stars and inspire them to discover new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that those who have played, they have played and this time in Khelo India, a lot of youngsters and young players have come to the fore.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 Games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January
When the local ecosystem of our sports will be strong i. e.
This time, players from every state have performed well at their own level in Khelo India.
The life of many medal winners is inspiring .
They live in a parking shed with their family
At the same time, the captain of the Under-21 Women's Kabaddi team of Maharashtra, Sonali Helvi is a resident of Satara.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother promoted the skills of Sonali .
It is often seen that daughters do not get so much encouragement in sports like kabaddi
Despite this, Sonali chose kabaddi and performed excellently
Asansol's 10 year old Abhinav Shaw is the youngest gold medal winner in Khelo India Youth Games
A farmer's daughter Akshata Baswani Kamati won gold medal in weightlifting from Karnataka
He credited his victory to his father and his father is a farmer in Belgaum
When we are talking about the creation of India then it is not only the resolution of youth power but also the New India.
These stories of Khelo India are telling us that not only the people of big cities are contributing in the construction of a New India but also the youth, children and sporting talents coming from small towns, villages and towns have a huge contribution.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot about the prestigious beauty contest.
But have you heard of the toilet shine contest
More than 50 lakh toilets have also participated in this unique contest that lasted for nearly a month.
The name of this unique contest is clean beautiful toilet
People are making their toilets clean and colorful, paintings and making them beautiful. You will also be able to see the beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup in the entire photos social media.
I urge all Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans to lead this campaign in my Panchayat
Share your clean beautiful toilet photo with MylatGhar on social media
Friends, On 2nd October 2014, we had started a memorable journey together to make our country clean and free from open defecation.
In collaboration with the people of India, India is moving ahead to become Open Defecation Free long before 2nd October 2019 to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
The audience of Mann Ki Baat has also contributed a lot in this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat. And that is why you are happy to share that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and six hundred districts have declared themselves ODF and have crossed the Sanitation Coverage 98 in rural India and nearly nine crore households have been provided toilets.
My dear brothers and sisters, the days of exams will come.
Anshul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about exams and am arriors
Anshul ji, thank you for raising this issue
Yes, the first part of the year for many families is Ham Season.
Students, from their parents to teachers, all people are busy doing exams.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers

I had requested the people to send inputs and videos for this.
And I am very happy that a large number of people on MyGov are sharing their views
I ' ll certainly put some of these ideas and suggestions before you during the Town Hall program
You must be part of this program. You can also see its live telext through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu

Successfully carry forward this visit of 2019
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
That ' s where he performed his steadfastness towards justice .
Today, I would like to say that one thing that touches my mind in the matter of mind is that when we listen to the mindset of all the family members then it seems that the head of our family is sharing our own words with us when I have heard this thing in detail that I am very satisfied that I am from you, I am from you, I am from you, I am from you, you have made me bigger and in a way I will continue to come here again and again as a member of your family, I will continue to be associated with you with your happiness and sorrow, your happiness and grief, your aspirations, my ambitions, my ambitions and my ambitions.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
You will be pleased to know that this award for best policy making in this sector is similar to the scar in that area. Not only this, our Sikkim won this award by overcoming 51 Nominated Police Forces of 25 countries and I congratulate the people of Sikkim for this thing. My dear countrymen, it is also at the end of October. There is a lot of change in the weather and the season has started with the changes in the season. Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhaiyya, Chhath is the month of New Year.
