Mann Ki Bat , October 2019 .
O my beloved country , bow down .
Everybody has many ruins in the contribution of Deepavali .
It is said that light in this world brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destroys antagonisms and visions of soundness.
Festival tourism is a special attraction of the world .
There are immense possibilities of festival festivals in our India.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My beloved countrymen, we have decided to do something new for this Deepavali in Christmas Maan Ki Baat.
On seeing this , innumerable stories were engraved in social meditation .
This day our brethren are in good professions.
She is really Indian Lakshmi .
Ramesh Garu , and your mother ' s tribute .
Their strength to poet Tiwari is Indian Lakshmi .
How pride they feel that their daughter is wearing good paintings .
She brought a good rock in the CLAT test .
clouds are coming , 92 years old ancient hill has provided water for travellers in Gwalior railway station .
Meghaji got so much support from the listening , compassion of this Indian Lakshmi.
People are Shering many such stories .
Definitely read, get suffocated.
You also make such things around you .
All these are my blessed gifts to the Indian Lakshmans . My beloved countrymen , in the 17th century a poet was written in the language of Kannada at that time .
These emotions , those substances , Indian Lakshmans , now we say that the foundation of all those who have said that the foundation has been done there .
How important things , how important emotions , how excellent thoughts are poet in the eye .
Because of the magnificence of these archaeologists our society is the future of our society .
My beloved countrymen, on 12 November 2019, Shri Guru Nanak Devji will celebrate the 550th festival of Guru Nanak Devji throughout the world.
The effect of Guru Nanak is not in India but in the whole world .
In many countries of the world our brothers and sisters of Sikkim reside , they are completely unparalleled in the museum of Guru Nanak Devji .
I can never forget the journey done by the Gurudwara of Vancouver , Tehran .
I can tell you how much about Shri Guru Nanak Devji, but it has many episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
They were standing at the highest place .
It is believed that Guru Nanak Devji had done the service done with emotional emotions .
They were opposite to the social illusions like unconsciousness .
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Garh has displayed his message from afar of the world .
They were one of the people traveling more during their time .
They went to many places, wherever they went, they spent their hearts with their ruthlessness, humility and simplicity.
Taking good , equal messages they went to all directions in the north - east west , everywhere with people , saints , sages .
It is believed that Shankar Dev, the well-known saint of Assam, also embraced him.
They traveled the sacred Haridwar .
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi .
Sri Guru Nanak Dev had stayed there .
He also visited religious places like 'Rajgir', 'Gaya' of Buddhist religion.
Guru Nanak Dev had traveled Sri Lanka .
During the journey of Bidar of Karnataka Guru Nanak Dev had discovered the problem of water there .
During one Udasi, Guru Nanak Dev visited the neighbouring areas of North Kashmir.
They traveled to Uzbekistan , wherever they were worshipped .
In a Udasi, he also travelled heights to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They have bought in the minds of lakhs of people who have followed their teachings with complete devotion to those people , are still following .
Approximately 85 countries have gone to Amritsar from Delhi to Amritsar .
The Golden Temple of Amritsar is visited there , Guru Nanak Devji is present in the year 550 .
Here not only visiting the Golden Temple of all these scholars but also the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions , culture .
The 550th light of Guru Nanak Devji is my hope to bring their thoughts , ideals in our life .
Then once I bowed my head and prayed to Guru Nanak Devji .
It is believed that my beloved brotherhoodrimans , October 31 you will definitely remember all of you .
If we read about the Sadar Saheb style , then how strong is their planning .
In order to participate in the Kangras Summit in Ahmedabad in 1921, thousands of representatives from all over the country have to come.
All the administrations of Samadhishwar were on the Sardar Patel .
He also used the issue to illuminate the network of water supply in the city.
Who has been organised without deficiency of water .
Not only this, you will be surprised to know that everybody's things, shoes and shoes are not stolen at the venue.
He contacted with rails , made minerals .
At the same time the victory of Khadi was also shining .
In order to play the role of Ulkhani in the state the Sardar Patel of our country has always fallen .
As if there is no chance of diversity occurring on the basis of Kullu , tradition they have done the main work of determining the primary hiccups .
Sahastrala , India 's first hobbbbbby of India , we all know that a great Bhagirathi , historical program was organised by the Sardar Ballabhbhai Patel Institute .
You know very well that the group of some islands of Lakshadweep islands .
After the division of India in 1947 our neighbouring country is on Lakshadweep .
He also sent a ship with his flag .
Immediately after knowing this news of Sardar Patel he took difficult churches without delaying at all .
Starting with brothers, Arcot Ramswamy, and Arcot Laxmanswamy, he said, "Travel Core is a flagship flight in Lakshadweep.
Immediately with his country Trivarna had fled there , Lakshadweep had discovered all the neighbours who attacked Lakshadweep .
After that they do not want to make all efforts for the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep has played its main role in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I believe that these beautiful islands , sea shores will visit you .
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity, built in the memory of Sardar Patel on October 31, 2018, has universally dedicated itself to the world.
This is the highest statue of the world .
This is twice higher than the ' Statue of Liberty ' of America .
The highest statue of the world is the pride of every Hindustani .
About eight and a half thousand people visited the Statue of Unity every day.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has declared his belief , devotion of his mind , besides this there are many centres like Cactus Garden , Batter Flight Garden , Jangel Safari , Children New Yutrition Park , Ekta Corporation .
People are getting new opportunities every day and the facility of tourists is being provided where people of many villages are providing homestead facility in their homes.
We are a witness to how a region develops as a world famous tourist area within a year.
People from the country and abroad come there .
The government has played its role .
Brothers and sisters, Time Magazine in the midst of this cannot be proud of any Hindustani pride in the top 100 major tourist destinations of the world.
I hope that you will be going to see the Statue of Unity in your invaluable time.
At least 15 tourist destinations in India who want to travel and travel will always be requested to stay there for a night.
Brothers and sisters, you are aware that every year from 2014 on 31st October we are celebrating the International Day of Importance.
Today, we convey the message of the unity and integrity of our country in such situations.
On 31 October again arrangements are being done for Ran Far University .
In the last five years we have seen that apart from Delhi, a large number of men and women residents, villagers, children, youth, elderly and disabled people are also gathering in hundreds of cities in India, in central areas, in the capitals, in the district centers, in the smaller Tier II towns.
That is why in today 's time we have seen an interesting , craftsmanship in people on Marathon .
Run Fort University is also a special opportunity .
Running mind , brain is beneficial for body .
Therefore, not only the body but also the mind and culture, for the unity of India, to take India to new heights.
Therefore you are in any city where you can know about the Ran Far University nearby .
I believe that on 31st October, India will definitely participate in the race for your fitness.
My beloved countrymen , Sardar Patel is sitting in the Ikta Sutra .
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired his twenty-fourth interaction through PRAGATI - the ICT-based, multi-modal platform for Pro-Active Governance.
My beloved countrymen, our society has always been conscious and conscious to fulfil the shared values of the country.
If we see around us then many such examples are found, in those examples, people who work continuously to increase mutual prosperity.
Organisations try to defecate those situations according to their own benefits in their own way .
How many types of words were spoken to increase the industry in the environment .
Try to increase burning sensation in different voices .
Some scholars , important goals are not only known for their famous people who talk about themselves .
We remember how responsible things speak .
But all these five days , seven days , ten days are going on , but as soon as the judgment came , a joyous , surprising change has been seen in the country .
On one side it has been done to increase the excitement of two weeks , but on the coming of judgment on Ramjanmabhoomi the government , political organizations , social organizations , social society , society , civilizations , civilizations , civilizations have been exhibited .
Try to reduce stress in the environment .
But those days I remember very well .
The dignity of the court has been acknowledged with pride, wherever there is no chance of exercising and increasing heat.
These things should always be kept in mind that they give us strength .
Those days those symptoms , we teach us .
It is an example of how much energy gives the country to the country .
On the day of a big injury to the country .
I also dedicate my faith today .
My beloved countrymen, today we have heard a story from afar off the shores of the house that tells the story of every village that from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from the east to the corners of Hindustan it is a clean story.
Every individual, every family, every village wants to share his joyous experiences related to cleanliness because the efforts of Swachhata are 100 crore Hindustan.
Their fruits are also 100 crore Hindus .
There is a pleasant thrilling experience .
Not only to separate the garbage of garbage in it , this arrangement is also very important .
In it , to remove rotten on 130 tonnes round about glacier , which is a pleasant environment there , how big service is it .
That is also the place of Ecosystem residents of rare species of snow leopards where there are rare animals like Siachen species , sheep , wheat bears .
We all know that these Siachen rivers are clean water sources, glaciers.
Therefore, the work of hygiene i. e.
My dear countrymen, Festivals are a fountain of new consciousness in all our lives.
Otherwise Deepavali i . . specially buying some new objects , the family of the family is less .
I told you once that we should try to buy locally available things .
If we get necessary things in our village then for them we do not have to go to Taluka .
Once again I tell you many blessings on the occasion of this Deepavali festival .
We are of various kinds of tomatoes for Deepavali .
But sometimes salt gets stuck by carelessness .
My many luxuries .
Blessed are many more .
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Nobody is proud to see our soldiers , our armed forces .
Any species , any place , any religion , or any language is always ready to tell our soldiers , their happiness , Madhuni .
All 125 crore Indians have celebrated the Parade and recalled the Surgical Strike that took place in 2016.
During the war of paralysis on our country in the territory of the territory , their unparalleled ways have given our soldiers in the form of surgical strike .

Special days like Parakram Parva reminds of traditional traditions like that of our soldiers in our country .
We are encouraged to maintain the balance and ethics of our country by Tadwara.
I also participated in a programme at Jodhpur, Rajasthan, where the land belongs.
In the two world wars happening in the twentieth century the soldiers of our country gave clean sacrifices for peace more than one lakh .
With the purpose of reconstruction in Shantibat it is an adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous games of our country .
India is also one of the largest number of soldiers sent to various peacekeeping camps of the ICT state.
The decade of our soldiers play an role in establishing peace in the world by wearing blue helmet .
O my beloved country , the sky is unique .
On the 8th day of October we celebrate the day of air conditioned team .
In 1932, the very small air force with six ladders , 19 soldiers etc. increased, which was one of the brave and powerful air warriors in the twentieth century.
In 1965 the enemies of the enemies had also given our air conditioned .
Who knows about the independence of Bangladesh done in 1971 .
The Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from Chorbatta in 1999.
On the establishment of enemies in Tiger Hills night and night bombs made them soil .
The support of the archaeological support , seed construction was done , how much thanksgiving to the country due to the works of the warriors of our airways .
Cyclone , air , floods , jungles , natural opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite to the people of the country are marvellous .
Gender ease in the country i . . in producing equality of women , men they stand as an example .
Now our Air Force has made an alternative to womens Short Service Commission as well as Permanent Commission from the Red Fort on August 15.
India can be proud of the fact that the strength of women in the armed forces of India is equal to that of men and women.
The powerful woman is now also becoming adventurous .
My beloved country , for some days creatory of our boating team the ruler of Abhilash Tomi had fighted with death for his life .
How to save him from the youth country
You know that Abhilash Tomy is a very adventurous ruler .
Without using any kind of modern technique , only with the help of a small boat the Indian is the first Indian .
To participate in Golden Globe Race in the southern Indian ocean he is moving ahead in the sea for eighty days , but the terrible sea storm has brought him distress .
But this guide of the boating team of India had spent several days in the sea .
He is the greatest example of adventure, culture and heroism and after a few days he was brought back to the ocean and I spoke to him in the phone.
My beloved Deshpraja , how important is the second day of October to our country
This year October is a speciality of both .
From today onwards, we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi through various programmes across the world.
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi gave the inspiration of the world .
In 1941 Gandhi Garh Museum started writing some thoughts in the form of a positive program .
Then in 1945 when he was breathing freedom fighting in 1945 he made the environment of his thoughts .
Puja Bapu rail , villages , villages , workers have given their thoughts before the people of the country on many things like cleanliness , education , education .
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
This is a special identity of his personality .
Bapu had understood how important , important opportunity for the country .
And it shall come to pass , as thy doubt is being resurrected , that thou shalt feel as if thine arrogance is melting .
My beloved country , this mantra of Gandhi Garhwal is still special .
Today the middle class of the country is increasing , their economic power is increasing , shopping power is increasing .
When we go to buy something then remember the worshipped Bapu once , we remember this mantra which he had said .
Because of shopping these things I am giving benefit to any calorie in the country .
Who has enjoyed happiness in Mughals .
This is his message. I believe that the poorest of all, the weakest of all, can bring a significant change in your life.
It is said Gandhiji that if my beloved countrymen , cleanliness is obtained then freedom will be obtained .
Although he does not know but India has come to India .
For example , because of shopping in special contributions many people have helped the workers of Khadi , fishing products .
All these Khadi clothes are also so difficult but they are not made , they are used each other .
Looking very quiet from outside , there was a scientific composition of pills like mountains from inside Lal Bahadur Shastri .
"Jai Jawan Jai Kisan" is an excellent display for the great personality of the scientific scholarship.
And he gave the mantra to the soldiers of his country , and to the soldiers of his country , and to the soldiers of his country .
My beloved countrymen , it is common to talk about cleanliness while remembering the priests of these countries .
On September fifteen ' Cleanliness Service ' started a campaign .
Millions of people participated in this programme and I also got the opportunity to pay homage to the children at the Ambedkar School in Delhi.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar himself founded the foundation of that school .
People of all classes of the country participate in the contribution of this September fifteenth day of September .
Come on, let us hear a phone call - Namaskar
Thank you specially for your phone call.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention i. e.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be concluded with the commencement of 150th Birth Anniversary of Bapu on 2nd October, 2018.
Shooting , physiotherapy , bored people want to give freedom , peace , justice , it is specially important .
Several places have been done for the primary hiccups in the state built by Baba Saheb Ambedkar .
Inspired by this, on 12th October 1993, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established.
In a few days NHRC has completed the tablets .
NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also worked to increase our dignity.
Our Chief Minister, our beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has clearly stated that human rights are not ours.
In the symbol of the symbol of our national human handicraft the ideal superstition of Vaishali is unparalleled .
NHRC has provided an extensive opportunity for human hiccups and has also played an important role in stopping the misuse of these hiccups.
In this journey of feet NHRC has made a belief , a belief environment in the country .
It is my belief that for a healthy society, for the best democracy, this is a big immense event.
In the national level of Italy along with the work of human cuisines the commission of human cuisines of twenty six countries has also been established .
In the form of a society, we have to make an effort to understand human rights and to bring them into the courtyard. This is the basis of the idea of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' - 'Enhancement for All'.
My beloved countrymen , in the month of October the Jayanti of Jai Light Narayan Ji is the Jayanti of Rajmata Vijayraj Scindia in this month .
I will describe them in Raboe Mann Ki Baat but I will surely propose this proposition . The last few years of Sardar Saheb Jayanti on October 31 , the Rann Fort University is being organised in every small town of India , in every big city of India .
This time also we make an attempt to make this ' Ran Far University ' in every small city , areas , villages .
The program called 'Run For Unity' is the best way to remember Sardar Sahib .
By October 31 ' Ran Far University ' all the places of the society , everywhere in the society of the country we will give strength to all the efforts to kiss the society of the country .
This is the same faith that we give him .
My beloved countrymen , Navratri , Durga Puja or Vijayadashmi tell you many congratulations to all of you in the context of these sacred festivals .
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Yavat India is celebrated with sacred protection festival of India .
This sacred festival is many hustle-bustles for all the people of the country .
This protective festival is a symbol of the belief of each other for the love affairs between brothers and sisters .
This festival also provides a big example of social natural beauty .
The entire environment is filled with elephants , horses , palanquin Shri Krishna Jai , Govind , Govind .
Bhagni Chinmai , Bhavan culture - tradition .
Friends, on the day of Shravan Purnima, along with Raksha Bandhan, we also celebrate Sanskrit Language Day.
I also wish all the people who are taking care of this great legacy, decorate it and provide it to the common people.
Every language has its own grandeur .
The ancient language of the world is Tamil language which is a matter of pride of all the people of the country .
It is science , technology , agriculture science , health science , sculpture science , Jyotistra , Ganesha , management , environment .
People living in the Mattur village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka state also speak in culture language .
His Jayanti is celebrated throughout the country on the day of meditation .
It is said that the meditation of coming to all the students of the country has been told in the contribution of the day of the year .
At the same time science , education , students have impressed your devotion .
My beloved countrymen, this rainy season brings many hopes to our farmers for their hard work .
The dried trees , plants , dried rivers , dried rivers with strong sun .
But sometimes this rainy season also brings the floods that give immense vision , destruction .
At some places less rains , at some places more rains are raining .
The risks leaving behind themselves are unforgettable .
But on occurrence of danger humanity meaning what we understand .
We all know that the soldiers of the soldiers of the soldiers running in Kerala are the soldiers of the soldiers .
They did n't leave anything in protecting those stuck in floods .
Air Force but navy, not farmy, but BSF, CISF, RAF, everybody has played a very big role in helping, protective efforts.
I would particularly like to mention the hard work done by NDRF and how excellent they helped in such difficult times.
The efforts made by NDRF to keep their competence, their commitment and effective decisions are a matter of concern for every Indian.
Ninnam is a festival of Onam .
To come out of this danger very soon , we pray that the state of Kerala should give strength to the state of Kerala , especially the state of Kerala , the resurrection of the state of Kerala .
I believe that the people of Kerala , the people of the country , the people of the country have been with them all the other places , the whole country .
My beloved countrymen , this time I am seeing the informations coming for Mann Ki Baat .
They are about Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swan Berji from West Bengal, Akhilash Pandey from Katihar in Bihar etc.
On the sixteenth day of August the death of Atal dynasty is drowned in the world , the country of the country .
And he was the chief captain of the nation , which left the eleventh year old .
If you want to say that the last teeth were gone away from the royal palaces .
People have given him the best parlor , a pleasant archaeologist , a great lord , a lover .
Because of being brought in the birthplace of the public life the country of Atal Ridge has fallen .
Our thanks to Atal ji for the 91st State Amendment Act, 2003.
This amendment has brought two main changes in the royal palaces of India .
First change is that in the number of mantras in the states the number of mantras in the number of states is fifteen percent .
Atal guide changed it .
That is why the vegetation of money became Adada .
Therefore the ability of the job has increased .
Due to the point of view of Atal ueen this situation has changed . Healthy traditions have started increasing in our royal culture .
Atal Garh is a true country .
Change has been changed while entering the budget in his administration .
Initially, according to the tradition of the British, during the time of parliament in London, we used to enter the market in the evening.
In 2001 Atal guide changed the time of five in the evening , eleven in the morning .
In the same way you will see how many acquaintances of states , central states of the country once .
It is a good option for delivery .
Healthy democracy, best democracy, best democracy, constant efforts to empower democracy, uninterrupted churches etc. all will also be the best tribute to the Atal Tinkering.
The worker of Lok Sabhavat is eighteen percent , state worker in the council of the state seventy four percent .
The Monsoon Session of Parliament reminds us of social justice and development seminars of the youth.
Several important children using the youth, backward classes have been adopted in these events.
Like the decade of the decade of the decade of the decade of the decade there is a desire to make the commission of Ooty commission .
In order to ensure the powers of the backward classes, the country has accomplished the task of appointing an OD commission this time.
It has also given the authority of a state which takes forward the goal of social judgment .
That is why the parlor of parlor has entered the difficult education by entering the parlor of the parlor .
According to this the iniquities who do illusions not only less teeth , but also in the twelve girls in the twelve girls are executed .
A few days ago, you might have read in the newspapers and a judgement in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, after only two months of inquiry, sentenced two offenders to death in the case of an injury.
Earlier, in a court in Kathani in Madhya Pradesh, after just five days of inquiry, the guilty were executed.
In Rajasthan also the judges there have taken some such fast decisions .
This chatti plays an important role in stopping the unrighteousness occurring on women , girls .
When we move ahead for the country, we can bring change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the oppressed and the deprived.
In the rainy season everybody has kept an ideal ideal .
I am telling thanks to the heart of all the parlors of the country .
My beloved country , these days the eyes of crores of people are on Asia creeds happening in Jakarta .
Asia cream is happening even more .
I tell all the sports done for the country .
If India is fit then India will have a bright future.
I would like to say that once again I would like to see the best exhibition of other sportspersons in Asia .
Everyone is the contemporary day of the national year .
Besides this the whole country also remembers him with great pride , spirituality .
In his memory September is celebrated as the fifteenth day of September .
The engineers of our country walking in their steps have published their own in the world .
It is called 'bhuga' in the coach.
This house has seen three earthquakes .
But if you see any harm at some places .
Our ancestors of this house have been built according to the environment here according to the environment here .
It has been said pride . It has been told me that what has been told me that in centuries before that time the engineers of that time , according to the local conditions , normal people living safely .
Now when we are celebrating the engineer destination then we should also think about our future .
Keep workshops at every place .
In changing times we want to learn any new things .
What should be taught to the students
Then meet .
In the midst of this meditation rains are coming properly .
At some places maximum rains are also coming to the architects .
In some places people are waiting for rains because of no rains .
Natural opposite to nature is human .
That is why sometimes nature comes on us .
Therefore the responsibility of protecting nature is our responsibility .
Twelve Junior Football players in Thailand went to a cave for their coach tour .
Normally it takes a few hours to come out in that cave .
But the decision of that day is another way .
On not getting any way out they were left near a small cave inside the cave .
Not only in one , two days , but in the same way for eighteen days .
On one side they are fighting with obstacles , on the other hand on the other hand the human species of the world has exhibited the price of humanity .
Throughout the world these children prayed to come out safely .
Where the children get stuck , in what situation they are in , to know all possible attempts have been made .
How to take them out , if it is not possible to save them at the time of rainy season then it is possible to bring them out .
Unfortunately they have enjoyed everybody throughout the world as soon as they are safe .
But I considered the entire program as if this protection program was done .
The responsible responsibility found in every level has been marvellous .
Government , children , parents , their family members , media , people of the country , everybody has also been seen marvellously .
In this entire behavior a Jawan of Dhai Land has also lost his lives .
Keeping mind on our goal with cosmetic , stable mind it is enough to work .
The favorite poet of our country had left us off for some days .
Even our Indians can give strength to the Neeraj River every time , inspire us .
This is the time of the start of the art galleries .
Not only this , the youth who come here asks in the most important part of their life where they turn from the point of view to the cut-off .
The meditation of students changes from home to hospital.
The students come under the shadow of professor from the shadow of parents .
I believe that my young friends keep keeping their college life very happy , enthusiasm .
This is the time when you have to leave your house for the first time , after getting out of the city , separating yourself from a definite environment .
How many youths come out to give their house for the first time , to give a new direction to their life .
Everybody has to say that stay calm , spend life , enjoy your mind completely in life .
Small friends are priceless .
But to choose new friends , mixing friends , keeping those friends standing this is a very knowledgeable task .
New experts , new languages .
The student of Asram Chaudari of an eminent family of Madhya Pradesh has achieved success by crossing all the difficult competitions of his life .
Jodhpur AIMS has conducted victory in the first attempt of MBBS test .
His father was able to fulfil his family by working to gather the dirt .
My beloved country , some days creatory has attracted a newspaper that the dreams of two youths together with my eyes .
If we read inside then it has been told that our youth technology has been trying to bring change in the life of a normal person .
I am celebrating with Indian youth once in Sanjoj city called Technology Hub in America .
I want to think about how to use everybody for India, I want to do something for the country.
By using their professional experts both of them have made a memorial ypnotise .
Apart from mixing the people of this village with the youth world they have to give any advice to Gony , information if they have to get it available in their own mobile itself .
In a way, this Yap Village has been trying to bring digital revolution in the village and it has become easier to record, track and monitor the development works being done in the village.
The YAP includes the Phone Directory, Warfare Department, Jabita, Health Centre and Information Centre in the village.
In order to know FACT ratio among the rural features of this Yap, Market Place will be used for their production.
If you look at this thing very carefully then one thing comes to mind - those youngsters are leading their lives in America, in the lifestyle of America, in the midst of thoughts and thoughts.
That is why they can do anything properly in the village .
This relation with their village , with its roots , for the country something or the other is natural in every Indian .
But sometimes because of time , because of afar , conditions , a thin dust named on it . but if someone touches them with a small coal then all the internal things come up again .
Pandarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
A fifteen-twenty days before Akadeshi, Varkari means pilgrims and palanquins along with Pandarpur pilgrimage.
This journey is called Waterfall in which devotees participate in lacs of numbers .
Gyaneshwar , Tukaram etc . important saints keep in the palanquin , Vithal , Vithal , Vithal , while dancing , walking on foot .
Pilgrims or Vithoba or Pandurang reach there for visiting Vithal Bhagwan called by the name of Vithal Bhagwan .
Vithal Bhagwan protects the poor , bored , oppressed , oppressed .
Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana people have unparalleled faith , devotion .
Going to Vithoba temple in Pandarpur, the glory, beauty and spiritual joy is a unique experience.
If possible then I want to feel the experience of Pandarpur once .
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdeva, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram etc. are punishing the common people even today in Maharashtra.
Their main folk music is Bharud or Abhang which we get the message of Sadbhav , love , beauty through them .
Because of this one gets the mantra to fight against the foolish beliefs of the society .
The power to see their errors of the British rulers is in him .
The English Tilk meaning as much as they were afraid , in twenty years they tried to ignore the kingdom three times .
This is not a small thing .
An interesting incident about the idol of Tilak located in Lokmanya Tilak, Ahmedabad is participating with the people of the country.
He said that during the death of Lokmanya Tilak on 1920 AD, his memorial in Ahmedabad should be renovated.
Sardar Vallabhai Patel Ahmedabad was selected as the Mary of the cities of Ahmedabad . Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokman Tilk Resort of his world . This Garden is known as the queen of Britain .
Finally the idol was built . Sardar Garh was built with whom the idol was built in 1929 on 28 February 28th Mahatma Gandhi Giri .
The most important thing is that in this accident the worshipping Bapu in his progressive council is that after coming to Sardar Patel the idol of Tilakji is also possible because of his architecture .
Due to the attempts of Lokman Tilk the tradition of community Ganesh Festival started .
These Community Ganesh Festivals have become an effective medium for bringing forward the traditional beliefs, festivals, social good, community, ethos and ethos of the people.
Our old heritage , history standing in the history of these dynasties also know how much interesting in our youth .
Today in many cities approximately in every street we see to worship the idols of Ganesh .
Pujas are organized together in that street mixed with a team .
This is a unique opportunity for our youth where they can learn the qualities of nervousness, construction etc.
Give good milk , development fruits to every Indian .

Mann Ki Bath February 2018 .
This question has given a great scientist to our modern India .
While talking about science we were talking about India Sir C . .
His research was famous by the name of Raman effect .
On one side there is a tradition of the main Ganesha scientist Bodhgaya , Bhaskar , Brahma Gupta , Aryabha etc .
On the other hand in the treatment rang , Charanda is our pride .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose , Har Govind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose are the pride of India .
On the name of Satyendranath Bose the name of the main particle BOSO has also been done .
In the meanwhile, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai - the invitation to the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence in the beginning of the year.
It is very interesting to know about wonders happening in science .
Through artificial intelligence robots , boots and other specialist instruments can be prepared .
In the middle instruments also increase their intelligence even more .
This technique is useful for glittering the lice , baadhis , needed people .
Is it possible to get any help from the Artificial Intelligence to make the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters easier in this programme
For a few days, I got the opportunity to visit I Create in Ahmedabad, Gujarat along with the Prime Minister of Israel.
I saw a design made of a young man there .
I believe that Artificial Intelligence can be used in many ways.
The price of science and technology is stable .
There is no price for them .
Every instrument we want to work as if we want .
But by the instrument we do any work which depends on us .
Here the goal of human goal is main .
Science should not only be used for human welfare , but also for stopping the best peaks of human life .
Thams Alva AIDS has been successful in its researches many times .
And it is a matter of luck that I am in Auroville, the Karmabhoomi of Auroville of Auroville.
In the same way he questioned every calm in life in the form of a Maharshi .

To know the truth it is the main thing to keep questioning every time .
I am talking about the national science destination to all our scientists , scientists and scientists .
Friends , at the time of obstacles I keep coming many times on subjects like security , distortion etc . people keep coming to me something or the other .
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval for the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Puna on Cooperation in the field of Occupational Safety.
Safety standards are not very important in our country where factory and construction work is being done.
As the fourth day of March is the National Safety Day, Prime Minister has given some precautions about Bhadrata in his Mann Ki Baat programme, he added.
In daily life we are not able to take precautions about Bhadrata , not taking precautions , it becomes difficult to get Bhadrata during obstacles .
Concentration among them - the danger happens - one destruction destroys - one destruction destroys happiness, joy and laughter - one who ignores the bonds of brotherhood - do not play with emotion - do not lose life like that.
On crossing that path one can not use all times in our life .
But if natural symptoms leave , then most of the dangers occur due to our layer .
We are very good , taking necessary precautions , not only protecting our lives but also protecting the society from big dangers .
There are many informations about Bhadrata at the place of working once but nobody participates properly .
I want to make microscopic drill in front of the children of various schools once in a week with fire museums situated in metropolitan cities .
This country has faced many chemical , industrial accidents of many natural , human creations .
These are the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) that they are manufacturing major seeds in the country.
On occurrence of various types of dangers like earthquake , floods , storms etc . NDMA reaches there along with them .
Besides this they also organise training programs for capacity building .
In the districts coming to floods , storms a program was organised by the name of Walterla training .
How important role is training , best role .
Two-three-three-year-old Lu - i. e.
In 2017 the number of deaths occurring due to heat as if the number of deaths occurring due to heat oxen is 220 .
That is why we know that if we give importance to Bhadrata then we can be safe .
I would like to congratulate innumerable people, social events and best practices in the society where there is an obstacle in the society.
Under the leadership of India, all countries with the name of BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal, etc. have done a joint disaster management exercise.
It's a first, great human use.
They should participate in our life .
Normally we keep on traveling in airplanes many times and in the beginning of air travel, air hostel is giving information about Bhadrata .
All these informations are also heard many times .
But if someone takes us to the airways , where is life jacket , how should it be used , then I can say that nobody can say proper peace in us .
The opportunity to see them clearly .
That's it.
But we do not pay attention .
Therefore, while sitting in the air, our ears are heard to be cautious, but we are supposed to say that they are doing our best.
We consider every kind of life as if we want .
We should not consider this Bhadrata not for us .
If all of us are best for our Bhadrata then the society is also international in it .
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, we have started a programme keeping in mind the fact that we have to wealth, weight to energy for villages under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan i. e.
GOBAR-Dhan meaning Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The aim of Gobar-Dhan is to clean the villages, make the name of the animals more sensitive, not only to convert into COMPOST, BIO-GAS, but also to produce wealth and energy through them.
The number of animals in India is approximately thirty crore whose lice is produced three lakh tonnes .
Some European countries , Chinese animals , remaining in the name of animals , remaining voluntary energy is produced .
But it is not useful in the whole state of India .
The Swachh Bharat Mission is now moving forward in this direction.
A goal has been set to generate bio gas based energy from the waste available from animal lice, sensory license sticks, etc.
Under the Gobardhan Yojana, rural India has to be encouraged to see the names and vandalism of Ratu brothers and sisters in rural India, not only in terms of work, but also through the means of securing wealth.
The health of animals becomes shining and their production increases .
Because of bio gas , lighting cosmetic energy increases in the subject of energy .
This technique is helpful in increasing the arrival of rail , animals and animals .
New gardens increase for vegetarian infection , transport , economy , etc .
An online trekking platform is also prepared for the sanctuary of Gobar Dhan which is conserved with roses , shopping .
I would like to urge the businessmen, especially the brothers and sisters living in rural areas, to come forward and utilize this opportunity to build a self-sufficient, cooperative body.
I would like to invite you to participate in the Clean Energy and Green jobs and ask you in the direction of making Gobar-Dhan by converting the waste into wealth in Tadwara villages.
My dear countrymen, till now we have heard about many types of festivals like music festival, food festival, film festival etc.
But at Raipur in Chhattisgarh, the festival of vandalism was organised for the first time through a special effort.
The objective behind this festival, which was launched by the Raipur Municipal Corporation, is to create awareness about the various ways of utilising the city's vaccine creatively and not recycling.
Everybody participated in the various programmes that took place in this festival till the elders of the students.
After getting inspiration from Raipur , in some remaining districts also vain festivals have been done in various districts .
Every seventh March is celebrated on the eighth day of the international women day .
Many programs are organized in our country , worldwide .
That is, we are talking about the development of women-led development by moving ahead from women's development.
In this context, I recall the words of Swami Vivekananda: The idea of perfect womenhood is perfect independence - the idea of Swami Vivekananda a century ago expresses the idea of Nari Shakti in Indian culture.
In the tradition of recognizing men we were participating in the tradition of women . Yashodananda , Kausalya Nanda , the son of Gandhari , this was the identity of every son .
Now I have given me some information from Jharkhand .
Approximately fifteen lakh women in Jharkhand under Swachhta Abhiyan - this is not the smallest number - fifteen lakh women have joined the cleanliness drive for one month.
Beginning from 26th January, 2018, these women have set a new example in just twenty days by constructing one lakh seventy thousand dollars.
How big incident you can imagine this .
Jharkhand has proved that women can make an effort to make cleanliness propaganda and hygiene in normal life a natural way for the common people.
After seventy years after the independence of three villages of brotherhodarimanulara , Eliphant island I saw in the news that how much enthusiasm was there in the people there .

If there is desire , strong cultural heritage , then there is no impossibility of any hand .
Today all women in India are increasing the pride of the country by developing in every kind of hole .
Since ancient times the pride received by women in our country , the place they have got in the society , their support is surprising the world .
There is a tradition of many poisons in India .
In the museum of Vedasar there is an adventurous Indian poisons .
Behold , the memorials like Lopamudra , Gargi , Matrai .
These are representing us as "Save the Children, Read the Children," but a long time ago, in our scientific ways, what is said in the scriptures, "In the case of a son, a son of a daughter, a son of a daughter, a son of a daughter, a daughter is like a daughter.
The pilgrimage of ten sons is available with one daughter only .
This shows the importance of women in our society .
And if there is any wisdom in Lopamudra, Gargi, and Maitrei, which are the tortures of the day
The arrangement of Ahalyabai Holkar administration was done , Rani Lakshmibai , the woman Shakti has always been inspired by us , protecting the pride of the country .
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given several examples .
The happiness of Sitaraman done by our adventurous conservation mantra of our adventurous conservation is giving inspiration to all women .
Three adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous games , Sukhoi 30 warriors are being trained .
Under the leadership of Kshamata Vajpayee, All Women Crew moved from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and then to Delhi via Air India Boating Jet.
They said properly - It is said that apart from the queen of women in every kind of hole they are playing leadership .
These are also showing some or the other women in every kind of hole .
A few days Christian President Rashtrapati had started a new work .
A book has also been prepared on these women achievers and first ladies in order to learn about the strength of the entire country, to inspire them from their lives and work.
This is available in the form of this book in the Nrandra Modi website .
In the social changes happening in the country , society of the country there is an important role of the women of the country .
It is said that we are talking about women 's economy , therefore I want to tell about a railway station .
You can consider what is the relation of a railway station cooling .
The Matang station of Mumbai is the first railway station of the country full of women captives .
There in all parts women were discovered .
In the Department of Commerce, Railway Police, Ticket Checking, Anonymous Subbdivision, Point Personnel, more than forty women.
This time after seeing the parade of the Ganesha day many people came to the main opportunity of their past by the Twitzer , other social meditations .
The view of this adventurous use has also surprised all the guests coming to the country and abroad .
This is a form of women 's power , self confidence .
These are playing the nervous system of our women .
They are changing .
One more thing has come to me that our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have seen an important example.
Adivasi women i . . in every mind a picture is seen in a jungle , in which the weight of the curtains tied on the head is seen .
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have shown a new picture of the country .
In the Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, the maoists have created a terrible environment with violence, atrocities, bombs, tempests.
In such a dangerous place tribal women were standing on their feet by walking this - tuberculosis .
During some time some women meet in it .
Therefore three benefits are being taken , on one side self-confidence has made them healthy .
Leave the unconsciousness in our hands , accept changes in important places .
Repeated itself is the speciality of our society .
Such Indian tradition , such culture has been found in our heritage .
For some days Christian Bihar has taken an interesting new wave program .
The biggest human chain of the world has been seen to be more than thirteen thousand kilometres away from the evil methods of the state .
Through this program the opposite opposite to the marriages of children , vertebral illusions .
The whole state has been contributed to fight against the evil methods like child marriage , vertebrae etc .
Children , elders , enthusiasm full of enthusiasm , mothers , sisters , everybody participate in this fight .
From the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, these humanitarian territories are connecting people with the borders of the state.
If all the people in the society are able to develop properly then the society should get rid of the evil methods like this .
Come , let us all suppose that such evil methods are removed from the society .
Everything in a New India, builds a vibrant, capable India.
I am an important attempt to make the people of Bihar state , main minister , where the administration of the administration there , every person participating in human food in the direction of their society .
My dear countrymen, the visitor to Mysore in Karnataka will have six thousand rupees per month for his dry treatment.

After knowing about the reproductive centres of reproductive medicines started not buying medicines there , the expense of medicines decreased 75 percent .
The medicines available in the centres of reproductive medicines available in the market are available in the fifty percent of the branded medicines which are available in the market .
That is why common people , especially medicines , how much economic help is available for old age .
Due to this reason good quality medicines are available in less price .
Three thousand medicine centres have been established in the whole country of Italy .
Therefore besides getting medicines cheap there is also a chance of the people who do their own business .

The objective of the scheme is to provide healthy and prosperous healthcare services to every citizen of the country and to build a healthy, prosperous India.

But he never let the feeling of hate reach .
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to participate in the 350th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Govind Singh in Patna this year in January .
Those who were born 2000 years or after the birth , that is , in 21th century everyone born in the 21th century is adventurous .

In the meanwhile, I am aware of the inspirational story of Shri Anjum Bashir Khan Khattuk Talluku, who is at the forefront of the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
He had stayed as a top in the test of acute pain , hated chains , Kashmir Administrative Survey .
In 1990 acute pains were burnt the house of their ancestors .
There the acute pain , hyssop is so much that their family had to leave the land of their ancestors .
All around such a negative environment is enough to fill the blind , cruel thoughts in the mind of a small child . but Anjum does not let it happen .
He never let go of hope.
He chose a new way for himself . The way to serve people .
He had come out from the opposite environment that he had come to his victory story .
These are the inspirational examples of the youth of the country, not only in the Jammu and Kashmir region.
Even if the situations are not able to fulfil the clouds can be discovered by suitable tasks .
Last week I got the opportunity to meet some of the girls in Jammu and Kashmir.
When I hear about their tactics, enthusiasm and dreams, they have heard how much progress they want in life.
While talking to them I did not see anywhere in them .
There is enthusiasm in them , there is energy , dreams , culture .
This is my youth . This is the future of my country .
Beloved my country residents , not only in our country but on coming to the famous religious areas of the world , it is natural to propose about the temple of Shebarimala of Kerala .
For the blessings of Appa Swami in this world famous temple every year many devotees come here in numbers of crores .
How important is the place of all the devotees coming to the devotee , cleanliness is participated with how much luxury .
Especially because of being a place situated between mountains , forests it is even more difficult to purification .
But to solve this problem , not to change the problem , how to tell the way out of the problem , this is why the support of people is so important example of the temple of Shebarimala .
Shri P.
Vijayan started a program named Pungavanam .
Every traveller calls for cleanliness for some time only in the worship of God . works to clean the garbage .
Every morning the view of cleaning the premises of the tourists here is so unique .
The more important , how big authority , how much rich , how much rich , everybody goes ahead after participating in the program of cleanliness .
Many such examples are for the people of our country .
The Swachhta Abhiyan, which is so developed in Shebarimala, will be a part of the pilgrimage to Pungavanam.
There along with difficult rules , cleanliness also runs with them .
My dear countrymen, on the 2nd of October, 2014, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Puja Bapu ji, we are determined to transform our country into a Swachh Bharat, an incomplete India, and an India that does not belong to Muri.
Bapuji is 150th Jayanti today in an attempt to give him the clean India of his art .
Several attempts are being made to participate in the country .
Changes occurring in rural areas , cities , expansive projects are seen .
The Clean Survey 2018 will be organised from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to assess the level of sanitation in urban areas.
These symptoms are held in four thousand cities in the population of about 40 crore .
The Survey also envisages participation of people for making cities free of open defecation, collection, collection of funds, scientific cleaning, changes in habits, innovative efforts for capacity building and sanitation.
This survey , various waters go and make their own cities .
Talk to the citizens and take their views.
The Cleanlining App is being used to calculate changes in various other services.
Through this survey the estimation of cleanliness system in cities is done in the cleanliness of the city or the life style of people .
Cleanliness is not only the government .
This is also a big responsibility of every Pauri , every progressive incident .
In this survey of Jagbuary in the days of coming everybody has participated with enthusiasm .
In this survey, you must try hard without your city, your place, your streets.
It is my belief that by using blue color , leafy colored leafy vegetables in your house different from wet garbage , dry garbage of your house all of you will have a good habit .
Reducing dirt , using again , repeated use is very beneficial .
In the Swachhta Survekshan held between January 4th and 10th, 2018, it is also a matter of public discussion in every city that you do not lag behind in this healthy competition related to cleanliness.
Our city - our effort, our development - is the progress of the country.
Come , with this very contribution we all try to fulfil the contribution of clean India once again .
Beloved my country residents , some things look very small to see but society has a lot of effect on our identity .

Who has adopted such a rule
Why do n't necessity
When I went to the depths of this matter then I came to the independence that we were seventy years ago that we knew that we had stopped .
The decades Muslim women have done unrighteousness but no church has happened .
There is no rule of this rule in many epidemic countries .
But Muslim women of India do not have this right.
Our government has made me very happy to pay attention to this thing .
Usually Haj pilgrims are permitted through latrine method but it is my belief that women alone are kept away from this latrine method.
Our women should also get equal power in comparison to men. In the progress they also need to make equal opportunities for them to walk with men.

The substance of our food is contacted with this soil .
A kind of whole food chain is tied up with soil.
There is no soil , trees do not increase .
Where does the cost of human life possible .
How can it be possible to live animals .

On the one hand, in our culture, there were natural attempts to create a sense of devotion and fervour among the people of the soil, on the other hand, soil nutrition and scientific methods have become part of our lives.
Our soil is devotional, scientific soil conservation and conservation both are important in the lives of farmers of this country.

Blessed is my generation , generation of people of the country , many people of the country .
After Hockey India has also got a good quality in badminton .
By exhibiting the best sports of Badminton Star Kidambin Srikanth the Denmark Open Siris has filled every Indian with pride .
Indonesia open, and after Australia open it's his third super series.
I convey my best wishes to our young friend, to this end, for enhancing the pride of India.
Friends, FIFA Under-17 World Cup was started in this month.
All the hairs worldwide came to India , everybody has shown their everybody in the field of football .
I also got the opportunity to see a game .
I tell you that once I am playing games , their partners , players , sports , hustle-bustle-bustle .
My beloved countrymen, how many people are coming to me in the matter of Swachh Bharat , if I want to judge all those opinions then I have to make a programme in my mind everyday and everyday I have to speak in my mind.
If one has sent photographs of small children , then there are stories of young hair attempts at another place .
If there is some creative observation related to cleanliness at one place , then there is a news about changes occurring with some authority at the other place .
A few days creatory has given me a very expansive report in which there is a story of the resurrection of Chandrapur fort in Maharashtra .
There, an NGO Vrindrapur Fort, called the Ecological Protection Organization, had undertaken a cleanliness drive.
In this program running for two hundred days people did not get tired , not tired , the cleanliness program was run by standing in a hair .
Walking for two hundred days .
Before the program , after that photographs were sent me .
The attempt of this Bhagirathi done for cleanliness is a unique example of beauty , community , forever .
Forts are our heritage symbols .
The responsibility of keeping historical buildings safe , clean .
I convey my best wishes to all the people of Chandrapur for the Ecological Protection Organisation.
O my beloved country , on the fourth day of November , on the fourth day of November we celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti .
Apart from the first Guru Nanak Guru of the Sikhs , Jagat Gurus also .
All the species of T . . have been seen together for their entire human campaign .
Women have given importance to pride , women pride .
Guru Nanak ji had travelled twenty-eight thousand kilometers on foot and gave a message about the true humanity of this journey.
They were talking to the people , truth , temporary way .
In the society, the message was given about equality and not only through words but also through his work.
Guru Nanak had also discovered Gurubani to speak his words .
In the year 2019 we are celebrating the 550th glimpse of Guru Nanak Giri .
Come , we try to walk ahead on the teaching road of their messages .
My beloved countrymen , after two days we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31 October .
We all know that the foundation of modern India is the foundation of India .
With the extraordinary journey of the great child of India we can learn how much .
On 31 October 31 Mrs . Indira Gandhi had left this procedure .
He is a witness to him in doing counsel .
The palanquins standing on the one side of India have been displayed by the Sardar Ballabhai Patel .
The people of Kotla India are determined to bring India under one country and under one state.
Their decision has given them the power to face all obstacles .
Where psychological importance was working with psychologists .
Where there is need of strength there it is necessary .
He decided a goal that he went ahead with complete artificial artificial artificiality .
This program which is done in the country can be done by each other .
Everybody has imagined the country like that .
I want their words to be inspiring for all of us - let us not stop the gulf between us.
This story of Sardar ji is also inspiring and relevant for our New India vision.
That is why their Jayanti is celebrated on the fifth day of the country .
Its support is unparalleled in giving an unparalleled form of the country .
My beloved countrymen , after the festivals of Deepavali , with new decision , you will start again in your daily life .
All the residents of my generation want to want their dreams , hustle-bustle .
Three three times spent in your mind by the sky .
These are the words of the mind 36th .
I have never said these words in my mind .
And it came to pass , when I had spoken in this mind , that the people of the land had sent me words , saying ,
In these many were inspired me .
Many people are like bringing changes in the government .
Some people are like physiotherapy , some social problems .
Once in a month, I take your time for half an hour but people keep on reaching out their words for a word in their minds on the 30th day of the month.
That is why the journey of three-three times in this mind is the journey of all the people of the country , experiences , experiences .
I tell thanks to all the people of the country for giving me the opportunity to understand the common feelings of India in such a short time .
Now three times have been completed therefore social scientists , university scientists , researchers , media specialists do its position . good , both are lifted up .
But such poisonous churches are very useful for the mind in the future . A good memory , new enthusiasm .
After that I told me that many social institutions of the country , many social institutions , many youths have done such works before .
I am very happy , how many people who want to use it in one place , how many people have come in my sight , how much happy I have been very happy .
Once again, I have seen a surprising photo of Selfie with Daughter in Haryana, I have spoken to everyone about it.
On seeing, not only in one India but also in the world of youth, a big initiative called 'Selfie with Daughter' was started.
This is not only a subject of social meditation .
This is the incident of producing a new self-confidence in every girl .
Everybody felt that parents should take selphy with their daughters .
Every girl has some importance in itself , it has been believed that it has its own importance .
A few days ago I am sitting in the tourism department of India .
It is said that while going there the people going to Incredible India -LRB- unparalleled India -RRB- going where the photographs were taken out there .
Lacs of paintings from different parts of India, in a way, stand for all those who work in the tourism sector.
I felt as if a small incident can lift up the large garden .
As soon as the thought of the completion of three years came , many incidents of my mind were glittering in the door .
The country is always before walking in the right direction .
Every person in the country wants to do something or the other for the benefit of the society, for the welfare of the society and for the progress of the country.
It is a part of my three-day Mann Ki Baat programme that the people of the country have heard, understood and learnt.
This is the biggest power of any country , the biggest power of any country .
I worship the heart of all the people of the country .
Once in my mind, I talked about Khadi and said that it is not a cloth, it is a thought.
Discounts are given in Khadi girls about October and a lot of reduction is available .
I want to increase this Khadi procedure in such a way that I want to increase .
Due to the increase in oxygen of Khadi plateau , the enthusiasm of thinking in a new angle has also increased in the people working in Khadi Rang , Government of India .
How to bring new technologies , how to increase the yield energy , how to bring glory to the work of solar energy , how to revive the ancient tradition of 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years after shutting down etc .
Many people were produced .
Resumed the training centre of closed Khadi and rural industries in Pampore, Kashmir, there is a lot of work in Kashmir to provide this sector.
Now the training centre will be helpful in making new generations in their construction, learning and doing new things. In the meanwhile, it gives me great pleasure to choose Khadi items to give me a big corporate institution.
People also began to choose expensive things while giving gifts to each other .
Some things naturally go ahead , how came we all experienced .
My beloved countrymen, we have made a resolve in the minds of the people of Christmas and decided to celebrate the Cleanliness Festival in the country fifteen days before Gandhi Jayanti.
Our pride President Garud started this program .
Children , elders , men , women , cities , villages , everybody has been participated in the proposal of this campaign .
As I said that I can meditate with culture , we are moving ahead in any way we are seeing before the eyes .
Everybody has adopted this procedure , to help it , to make it successful .
That is why the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery .
Besides this, every class of the country is also considered to be its own work and everybody has been associated with this proposal.
In the Christian era, he mixed with them, students, schools, art galleries, universities, rails, coolies, police, children, Jawans, everybody.
If these places are ugly then people do not feel unconscious then this pressure is also seen in those who work there .
It is very good that more than seventy five lakh people, more than forty thousand people have joined the programme in four days since the launch of the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign.
Some consequences are continuously working with the goal of showing the results .
Once again, we have also seen a new feature - taking care of one side of the programme, otherwise not being wasted.
If you want to change cleanliness in a natural way , Bhavodavgadh garden is also important .
This time many competitions have been done by cleaning service .
More than two and a half thousand children participate in the competition of this cleanliness .
Thousands of children have been made pictures .
The pictures about cleanliness with their own imagination .
I will never forget to know the blessedness of the media .
We are watching the cleanliness of the electronic media, print media and the country in our country.
In the midst of this study somebody told me about the nineteenth girls of Sri Nagar .
It is said that for the administration of Sri Nagar Portuguese this Billa Darbar has made his brand Ambassador i . . Brand Ambassador i . . Brand Ambassador i . . Hero of Sini Rang .
Not only .
Billa Darjeeling kept an eye on the cleanliness of his twelve - three years of age .
He is the inspiration of all those who are interested in cleanliness at the age of age .
Billa Dar is offering many congratulations.
We have to confess that my beloved country , future history , past history .
This time Nanaji Giridi , Pundit Din Dayalgiri is also the year of the century .
Do not know what is the center of all these great men
A common thing situated in everyone is that living for the country , doing something for the country .
Leaving the life of the country of Nanaji , leaving the life of the royal family , it is natural to have the pride of their village program .
The President of India, Shri Abdul Kalla, interacted with the youngsters and said that Nanaji Deshmukhgiri is an important part of rural development.
Like Mahatma Gandhi Giri the teacher of Din Dalhousie also used to talk about the person sitting in the last floor of the society .
We should also run for the unity , oneness mantra forward .
The unity in diversity is usually said to be the speciality of India .
We pride the diversity but do you ever try to feel this diversity .
The nearest airport from Deepavali is at a distance of 2 K . . from Thalassery .
Going to every tourist is a common thing .
But it is a matter of anxiety that people don't see our country, they don't know the diversity of the country.
Our country is full of many options .
All these Mahabharata have also been developed in the country .
Before starting this work an attempt has been made to understand the country of Bharat .
The attempt to fill India in itself is not an attempt .
My own experience is that I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India .
I got the opportunity to spend night in more than four hundred districts .
I would like to not only reflect the unity in diversity but also to feel that this vast country of India is full of unwavering energy.
One India - the best India is hidden in it .
This is the biggest power of our country tourism .
My request is that you want to go out somewhere in your holidays , do not know anything other than Kosmo Baaldev , understand that you should learn , go out with the purpose of learning .
Watch India inside you .
Your life will be enriched by these experiences .
Your thought will be large .
There is more milk for experienced experiences .
Normally from October to March is better for tourism .
Definitely send your photo in the incredible incredible .
You can also send pictures of humans connected with the place where you go .
Not only the identity of construction , but also come about the life style of the people there besides natural beauty .
Can you put in the incredible box
You see, everybody from one state has discovered from the beauty of the state and I will tell the government that most of them have to create a literature about the seven places.
The Government of India works on them .
The government will accept the information of beauty , so many places from you by making pictures , video , propagation and encouragement .
Come , walk with me .
You can also change a big excitement to use the time of March in the month of October , to encourage the tourism of the country .
I am inviting you .
My beloved country , many things like a man meet me .
My mind recognizes the mosquitoes .
I leave a deep effect on my mind .
No matter how much I am human .
Why does Asaman say that while serving India their husbands are not heaven .
We can imagine how the condition of their inner state is imagined in small age .
Along with eleven months she trained her life to make her husband dreams with difficult industry .
Although the husband of Nidhi Dubba had forgotten the death by working in the army of Mukhsh Dubey .
His wife also reached in the army as well .
Every Indian is natural to have the pride of this maternal power , our gloriousness of these ventilators .
I am telling many hustle-bustle-bustles in the heart of these two sisters .
He gave new inspiration, new excitement to the people of the country.
These two sisters are many opinions .
My beloved country , Navratri festivals , Deepavali festivals have a big opportunity for our country .
The FIFA Under-17 World Cup is being held in our country.
It is believed that the sounds of football keep refreshing all around .
The rate of foot balcony is increasing every generation .
In any school in India, there will be no youth who play football in the art gallery.
My beloved country , Navratri festival is celebrated .
Durga Devi is worshipped .
The environment is sacred , aromatic .
On all four sides spiritual environment , festival environment , devotion is full of devotion .
It is considered as the festival of energy .
These are also called Sharda Navratri and now the vision of Dandi starts .
O thou that art my beloved country , and worship the Sadar .
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand it is natural to worry about the country when there are positive news from any corner of India.
This is the country of the birthplace of the country of Buddha Bhagwan , the birthplace of Gandhi , the birthplace of Sardar Patel for the IIDS of the country .
The ' Ahimsa Parmar Dharamshala ' . We came to hear it from a small time .
I also said from the Red Fort - there is no persecution in the name of beliefs, but it is a traditional belief that although it is the belief of political ideologue Taluku, it is the belief of a person, it is the belief of an individual, it is the traditional belief.
According to the state given us Baba Saheb Ambedkar , every person has all kinds of arrangements for judgment .
I believe the people of the country that they take the chatti in their hands , if they are a person , if they are a group , then this country will not be able to bear any government .
Our festivals are also full of many diversity .
Because of the archaeological culture of thousands of years we get heritage , cultural traditions , social traditions , historical events , everything , therefore it will not be a day of any festival .
All our festivals also keep coming according to nature .
Everything is directly related to nature .
Jain society is celebrated every year .
Jain society is celebrated in the month of Bhadrapad .
Festival of men is celebrated on the last day of the year .
Actually this is a unique tradition .
Festival of the year is a symbol of forgiveness , non-vegetarian feelings .
My beloved country , nowadays everybody of the country is celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi festival with grandeur .
On coming to Ganesh Chaturthi it is natural to come to the matter of Bahrang - Ganesh Festival .
Bal Gangadhar Tilak ji, 125 years ago, gave birth to this tradition and the last 125 years of independence were symbols of freedom.
After independence they stand symbol of social education , social consciousness .
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated for ten days .
This festival is said to be a symbol of unity , equality , cleanliness .
The contribution of Ganesh festivals for all the residents of the country is many ruins .
Now the festival of Onam is celebrated in Kerala .
In the colorful festivals of India Omnam of Kerala is a major festival .
This festival tells social , cultural heritage .
The festival of Onam presents an important cultural heritage of Kerala .
This festival awakens new enthusiasm, new hope and new faith in the minds of people with the message of love and compassion in the society.
Now our festivals also change their attraction of tourism .
Navratri festivals in Gujarat, Durga Puja festivals in Bengal have become their attraction in a way.
Our other festivals are also useful for attracting foreigners .
In that direction we should think what we can do .
In the tradition of these festivals the festival of Eid-ul-uha is celebrated in a few days .
Many congratulations and best wishes to all the people of the country on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
The festival meaning is a symbol of faith , belief .
Festivals should be made symbol of cleanliness in the Navbharata country .
This is not new for us but changing it into a social habit .
Cleanliness i. e. not only in the house but also in the entire village, in the city, in the city, in the state, in our country, cleanliness and cleanliness should be made an important part of the festivals.
My favorite country , modern meanings are changing .
These days, no matter how rich you are, no matter how modern your thought process is, everything has become a new core, a new comparison and a balance.
That is why in the days of this festival everywhere the soil of the environment has started .
If you look at the YouTube , then in every house the children are making mud in their colors .
Some vegetables are colored , some colorful pieces of paper .
The media houses are also giving inspiration and direction to the people to make the idols of Ganapati idols suitable for the higher environment.
See how big change has come .
Happy change.
As I said , our country is full of marvellous thoughts of crores of crores .
It 's a lot of fun if someone has done new shapes .
Some engineer himself told me that he got some special kinds of soil , mixing it , giving training to people making soil .
After worshipping the idol melts in a small baket , the statue melts in water immediately .
Three-three years ago I started the cleanliness drive, which will be completed by October 2-3 days.
The consequences of this park are seen .
Construction of Madurai ranges from 39 to 67.
It is said that more than two lakh three thousand villages , Bahrang excretion has been freed from excretion .
There have been terrible floods in Saurashtra .
Many people lost their lives .
But after the water of the flood very bad odour spread .
In such a scenario, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind workers at Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned the flood affected two and twenty-two houses and three mosques in a phased manner.
They saved everyone by sweating their sweat .
The attempts to make dedication for nature change the permanent nature of our country can fly at a height of another .
In a way Deepavali , Navratri , Durga Puja is considered to be adventurous .
Go to the market nearby , go to the nearby village but consider this as a garden .
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
My social media friends can also take up your positive role and work is also being done on Virtual World Forum which can inspire us.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is organising business competitions, story competitions, short-telling competitions, painting competitions etc.
In this you can get exercise in various languages .
You can take a luggage picture with your mobile.
Film can be prepared for two-three minutes like inspiration for inspiration .
In this competition there are three gifts in the district level of participating in these competitions .
Therefore, on September fifteen, take the mantra of 'Parishudhya Seva' home.
Give me some step for purification.
After fifteen days of publicity, after Parishudha Seva, while celebrating Gandhi Jayanti on October 2, you can imagine the sacred joy in you when you pay homage to Bapu ji.
My beloved countrymen , I want to accept all your desires specially .
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you, not to talk in my mind for a long time, but to join me in my Mann Ki Baat programme.
The number of hearing is in crores but lakhs of people are coming north , messages are being sent by phones , this is like a big monkey .
I have become a big opportunity to know the words of the heart of all the people of the country .
The more you wait for talking in mind , more than that I will wait for your messages .
They come into use for the work of my work .
Once some things get together in our habits , we also consider that we are ignoring .
"Prince Garu, I am talking to Arpana from Pune.
I want to tell you about my friend.
She is in an attempt to help people but a habit of her own has made me .
I went to the shopping mall once with him.
On one pus it has been expensively expensively two thousand rupees .
The pizza has been kept 450 rupees but the auto driver going to shopping mall has made barasa for five rupees .
The vegetables bought on the way . Bermadi remains 4,5 ruins on one vegetable .
I didn't like it.
Not only this , if you go to buy sarasam in Shorum but if someone comes to work with lice then there is no unconsciousness .
Do you ever think that what is the cost of the poor
In your life there is no importance of two rupees , five rupees in your life but do you ever think that how deep your mind can be wounded
My thanks to you, Madam, for telling me through your phone call about such a heart attack.
My country ' s people also have a habit of walking with their poors , they believe that they must change .
My beloved youth , August 29th honey is celebrated throughout the country on the day of national year .
This is the birthplace of great hockey sports , hockey midwives Major Dhan Chand .
And he said unto them , It is no service that he hath done for Hachi .
The reason for remembering this thing is that my desire to get rid of our country 's emotional sports .
Sports should be part of our life .
The youth of the world can also be seen in the sports of that youth country .
One type of sports is a big medicine for mixing mind .
Come forward in the youth of our country . I warned that the playing field of playing in the computer age of Italy computer is very important .
Play FIFA in computer but also show the football at any time in the outer field .
Cricket plays in computer but playing cricket under the sky in the open field is different .
At one time the children of the house go out , when will they sell .
Now the situation is such that children are also drowned in seeing phono , carton films or mobile gam .
Youth friends , playing games have prepared a sports tour centres for lighting , glittering every year .
Wherever every child in the country is in the field of sports, the success achieved in the playground can be uploaded either by biodeta or by uploading the portal.
Adventurous games give training to the sports players .
This portal has started to morrow .
The happy news of our sports is that in India October 6 October 28 Vruku , Fefa Ardar 17 world camps started .
These six girls are going to cross the sea by taking a small boat .
The name of this procedure is ' Navika Sagar Parikrama' .
He returns to India after a few months or a few months after the entire world.
The journey of six girls between the waves of the sea is the first incident of the world .
Watching these girls the Indians are not pride .
I want to participate their experiences with the people of the country .
I will also organise a department for their experiences to read yourself in the Narendra Modi Yap.
Because one kind of adventurous story , swimming experiences . I am happy to receive the words of these girls .
I tell many blessings of these girls , many blessings .
My beloved countrymen , September is celebrated on the fifth day of September .
One student , Pundit , one royalist , President of India also considered a study every moment .
The joy of creative emotional emotions , knowledge of Taluku in its students is the most important quality of one study .
Everybody kiss the five dates of each other with some or the other .
Look at the way to successfully enjoy successfully in life .
Such environment can make our schools , our art galleries , our education .
If we talk about change in our country , if we talk about family , then the teacher remembers about the society .
There is a very big role of meditation in change .
Every student in life because of his natural creation in the life of his natural creation in an attempt to bring changes in each other 's life , sometimes incidents happening .
If we try to contact together , then we can play a big role in changing the country .
Let us move forward with the mantra of Teach to Transform.
"Prime Minister Garu, my name is Dr.
Announcement .
I am staying in Mumbai City and the Howard University will work in their Indian Research Centre.
A researcher Financial Inclusion , I have special interest in the economic museums related to it .
My beloved countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, financial inclusion, have been discussed not only in India but also in the economic world.
I started this procedure with a mixture of my mind on 2014 August 28 .
Tomorrow, the 3rd edition of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) will be completed on 28th August.
Muffi crores of new families have opened Jatpancha , Bangkok by this .
This number is more than the population of many countries in the world .
He has changed his habit , he is going to Bank .
But now due to the convenience atmosphere atmosphere atmosphere he also starts working for the needs of children .
It is understood that in the days of coming what good work is done then money will be used .
The poor now sees his pocket card in his pocket , seeing himself like rich people , if there is credit card in the pocket , then it is satisfied that there is card in my pocket .
It is considered its pride .
Approximately 65 thousand crores of rupees have been included in our lice through the prime minister 's treasure .
In one way this is their strength during the days of the coming of the poor .
Those people who are expensive by the prime minister 's treasure , they also got the benefit of Bima .
On the occurrence of obstacles of lice , on the death of the main person in the family they get two lakh rupees in a few days .
Reproductive vaginal irrigation , insulin , rubber card , prime minister mudra medicinal value , common people have done any benefit .
I will make a complete attempt to reach them .
Due to such inspirations the media can also get complete benefit .
Such people can give new inspiration to new generations by giving face to face .
My beloved countrymen , forgive me once again if you are suffering from ' chicken pox ' - pox .
In rainy season the mind of man remains very important .
Animals , birds , stairs , nature , everybody turns into joy due to rains .
Changes in the environment are happening due to the changing season and its effect is also very fast.
In the last few days, natural obstacles have to be faced due to the obstacles in Assam , north-eastern regions of India , Gujarat , Rajasthan , Bengal .
My friends of the Cabinet are also reaching any place if possible.
The state governments also provide the best help to the afflicted with floods in their own ways .
In such a situation the social institutions , cultural institutions , services of people are helping them in their own way .
The Government of India is happy to assist those who have lost their lives in such times as the Military Jawans, the Air Force, the NDRF, or the Armed Forces.
The life of people becomes very unsuccessful by floods .
Fruits , animals , economic customs , roads , electricity , meditation etc . are affected .
Especially when our brethren , fruits were destroyed then they were not destroyed , especially the insurance companies of the fruits , specially the climate centres of the rail centres , they were very excellent plans .
In order to face the situation of flood the control Room Health Line is working continuously for 24 hours .
People are also telling their problems .
Slowly we also do our work according to the environment information , we can save us from harms .
When I am preparing for Mann Ki Baat programme, I see that more people of more than me are getting ready.
I was very impressed by listening to your Chartered Accountants Day .
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced in our country on the same day last month.
Can you say that in the last months the government has come to the fore or not
In this matter I want to know your thoughts .
I am very happy and happy when I get an answer from someone who has come out of the name of GST, telling me how they are reducing the prices of goods and how things are getting cheaper because of GST.
Especially the trade of yoga is increasing on the business trade .
I see the impact of GST on transportation and logistics.
How fast changes occurring rapidly , imagination registration has created a new belief in the country .
Scientists and technologists in the financial system have studied the use of GST in India and must stand before the world sometimes as a model.
This is one of the world 's world university stadium .
Because with such a big height , such an important change , with the effort of crores of people in this large country it is a very big task to run ahead in victory .
Definitely researches on this thing .
All the decisions have been taken concentration by mixing state , central governments .
The consequences of those concentrations are not able to take any kind of weight in lice .
Whatever was the price before the GST, what is the price in the new situation today, you can easily know it through your mobile phones in the GST yard.
How easy , friendly environment has been created between the government , businessmen and the government has played an important role in enhancing the faith between the government and the government .
I would like to congratulate all the Ministries participating in this programme, all the departments, central governments, all the state governments and all my heartfelt greetings.
GST is a great example of Indias vibrant strength.
If you want to say one way , this is a social collection .
On the second time I am giving a fort to all the residents of the country like Kotla fort to make such a big attempt easy .
Beloved my country residents , August i . . the month of option .
On 1920 August 1 support of support of support we were listening to the smaller time .
The uit India Movement was launched on 9th August, 1942, which is also known as the uit India Movement.
In 1947 August 1547 had come to the country .
Seeing a way , all the incidents happening in the month of August are also especially engraved with the history of freedom fight .
Our new generation should know what happens in the 9th honey of August in 1942 .
For the freedom movement from 1857 to 1942, the people of the country who were immersed in the freedom struggle, who distributed the urge to build our emotional India.
At the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians led their lives through the mantra of Door or Die.
Lakhs of youths stopped their readings , leaving books .
The great men like Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan played an important role in the garden.
The uit India Movement in 1920, the uit India Movement in 1942, both of which showcase both the forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1942, great men like Mahatma Gandhi also gave the mantra of 'Doo RD' and peoples interest is behind it.
Once I visit the history of India, I say that the first freedom struggle of India started in 1857.
Then the initial independence struggle was going on some or the other corner of the country in 1942 .
This surgh period has produced an independence in the minds of the country .
Everybody has become determined to decide something or the other .
This industry done in 1857 to 1942 had reached the last stage of a new condition , 1942 AD .
The garden of uit India has changed so much that in 1947 the British had to leave the country in 1947 .
1857 till 1942 this independence reached all the people of this independence .
Besides this 1942 , 1947 along with the five vertebrae of 1947 , all the people were decided with one mind , immensely immensely to give freedom to the country .
These five are like a spot .
Now I will meet you with a past .
We came to freedom in 1947 .
Now 2017.
Approximately seventy years passed .
Governments came .
The arrangements have been made , Marai , increasing , increasing .
Everybody has tried to come out in the problems of the country in their own way .
As soon as I had spent 2017 the five storeys of 202222 were also driven to the confluence of five storeys .
Try to fulfil them .
For example, from 1942 to 1947, five miles for the country's independence
These five , i . . till 2017 i . . till 20222 should be given miles for the future of India as well .
After five decades the country celebrated diamonds .
Therefore all of us should make this a strong alternative .

My dear countrymen, on the 15th of August, the Red Fort will provide an opportunity to interact with the people of the country.
The voice of hundred crores of people from the Red Fort .

This time too, I invite you to send your thoughts to MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
In the last three August 15 months I heard that my delivery is taking a long time .
That is why I decided to reduce my progress this time .
Beloved my country residents , I proposed another thing .
There is a social meaning in the economy of India .
We should never take it less .
Our festivals , our festivals are not only enjoyable .
Our festivals , our festivals are also social collections .
But along with this our festival is also directly drowned with the economic life of Pauri .
In a few days Raksha Bandhan , Janmashtami , Vinayak Chatti , after that Chaturdashi , Durga Puja , Deepavali .
Lakhs of small domestic industries start making Rakhi in small domestic industries for a few months before Rakhi .
The people who make Rakhi , Rakhi sell sweets , thousands of people who make sweets , trade of thousands of people get engraved with a festival .
The families of our poor brother , sisters were spent because of which .
Not only the festival of lights but also the festival of bringing glory to the house .
Its relation is directly engraved with the families of making small soil .
But I want to talk about festivals , while talking about the economic arrangement of the poor people lying with those festivals , along with them also talk about environment .
Sometimes I feel that the people of my country are very high , active .
In the last months the best people for environment have written me north .
125 years , 125 crore people of the country .
At the same time we will say that for environment conservation environmental Ganesh i . . soil Ganesha is worshipped .
It is said that for the festivals of different festivals coming to all the country residents of the country Gunnu has told many other festivals .

Cricket hair of our country has exhibited a unique sports in the competitions of the world .
In this week I got the opportunity to become Bhenti with those games .
I enjoyed talking to them very much but I thought that they were not able to spend the world camp very heavy .
In their mohans also that disappointment , pressure has been pushed .
If the players of India were smitten then we saw many games breaking on them with anger .
If you were not able to wander , then you had spent the hearts of 125 crore people .
I have told the players that in reality the youth of our country is especially our girls .
Once again I tell my heartfelt congratulations to the youth of the country , especially to our girls .
I also remember that 2022 will be 75 years old for our independence.
Every country should make a sign of five paths for its cultural principle .
The future of the country , future is the best .
Blessed is the blessedness of all of you .
It is an experienced experience that we are in conflict with each other, we are exercising ourselves, either in a single life or in a life of a people.

Are we able to implement this nationally or not
I had the opportunity to remember the unconscious ovary of the corner .
When I am the main minister of Gujarat then I decided to give books instead of flowers or welcome with handicrafts .
Immediately I started giving the country to the government officers .
Gradually this should change a part of our nature .
A flower vomits for a while .
Taking it in hand once , leaves again .
I am describing such stores which have historical value .
And it came to pass , when he went to London , that the British queen Elizabeth called me to eat .
The ruins made of an hundred which give me a glimpse of a glimpse in her eyes .
On the day of his lips this hand had left the ruins of Mahatma Gandhi , which he gave him in the marriage of his marriage , that he had left it .
It is surprising to preserve the beauty of Mahatma Gandhi along with the queen of Elizabeth .

I know that such good habits come to the night .
There is complete transparent transparent .

In the development of personality sports play a unique role .
Sports are very important in the construction of the person .
There is no dearth of every part of our country .
If the children like our families then give opportunity to those who want to play in the game .
Taking water from the field of sports , it is not possible to change the worms of books by binding in the room .
Along with studying they should also encourage the students in front of the students in the year , in the school , in art gallery , in all the places of the family .

There are goods in our country , nasty .
There is a dedicated to the idol , there is a opposite to the idol worship .
Such Siddharthas , such worshipping places , such a tradition , all of us have digested the art of staying connected with us .
Religious , traditional , Siddhartha , Acharya gives us a message - that is peace , unity , impossible .
This sacred Ranjan is helpful in moving ahead of this peace , unity , emotional path .
I am telling everyone the next time .
It has given me a lot of happiness to give it to many people .
Everybody has encouraged the enthusiasm to tell their things .
I could not read all the water , everybody could not hear at least . All the messages came .
But I have seen briefly that some attempts to learn music , some try to learn new music , some try to learn new things with the help of Europe , some try to learn new languages .
Some are learning , some dancers are learning , some are learning , some are also learning poets .
Try to know about nature , living , understanding direction .
I'd like to hear you even on a phone call.
That is, I am talking about Diksha Kaital.
I had a complete habit of reading .
Therefore I decided to read again in these holidays .
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I understood that how many sacrifices have to be made to fight for India's independence, how many freedom fighters have spent their years in jails.
The ruins of how much magnificence in small age were influenced by Bhagt Singh .
Therefore, I would like you to give a message to the younger generation about this.
I am very happy to learn about the history of our country, about our freedom fighters, about the sacrifices made by them for the country.
The great men who were counted had lost their youth in jail .
Those great men who spend in the jail in freedom fight , reading , writing etc . have done a very big work .
We also know that the secrets of all of them have given very power to the country of India .
Many years ago I went to see the Cellular Jail of Andaman - Nicobar .
The poets used to come on the walls .
He was bound in a small dark room .
What sorrows have the lovers of freedom experienced
When I read the book 'Maji Janmathe' of Savarkar, I was eager to see the Cellular Jail.
There's also a light sound show, which is very inspiring.
I have said that for the freedom that we have got, people have experienced so many difficulties, if we go to the Cellular Jail, if we go to Kalapani then I will definitely tell the youth of the country.
If you are also possible then definitely go to this pilgrimage area related to our freedom fight .
Beloved people of my country , June is one Monday in 5 months .
If you want to say another thing, back to basics.
Nature has to be seen with nature , increasing the betel plate .
Who can say this better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi repeated times saying 'one must care about a world one will not see'.
That is , we should also think about the world , take care of the world .
You will keep in mind that the power of nature is that on getting tired properly when a glass of water cools on the mouth then how freshness comes .
On getting tired properly opening the windows , opening the doors , fresh air comes new chaitanya .
That is why the attempt of the world to drown with the nature of June should also be given our own attempt .
Our ancestors are now available to us as a result of protecting environment .
It is said that the cause of cleanliness of our body is Prithvi .
It is a matter of coming out on the head of Lord Buddha that the birth of Lord Buddha , his wisdom , his Mahapravan had been done under a tree .
Readers , readers , city residents , villagers , tribals , all nature worship , nature lovers are naturally a part of their social life .
But we need to contact this thing with modern designs , modern thoughts .
In the midst of this I am giving gifts from the states .
That is , in approximately all the states rains start , big plants start the program of planting .
Plants are planted in the number of crores .
Yoga is not just exercise .
Keeping in mind the day of yoga day of two days I came to the north of all the governments of the world , all the governments of the world .
Christian year I declared some competitions related to yoga .
Gradually the tasks move forward in that direction .
It's a very interesting advice.
Girl , mother , mother , mother , mother , father , mother , mother , son , son , daughter , one - three generation yogasana should be done by putting those photographs in yogasanas .
Today, today, tomorrow, this beautiful yoga offers a new dimension to Yoga and I thank them for giving this advice.
It is a matter of pride as we have gained a very interesting experience through the method of ' selfie with dollar'.
These three generations wearing yogasana definitely give their photographs to the country , worldwide .
Where three generations they have done yoga , they are doing yogasanas together , definitely send me the photographs of Narrendra Modi , my pocket .
In a way it should be called as a combinational health care garden .
Since then I have been toured in different states of India .
Although while returning I realized that some are moving very minutely , where are the modi going
If this phone call is heard then it is considered to be Mikda .
Modi Garu , I am often seen in the middle of the social media that at every place where you go people are taking special care of cleanliness .
On Mumbai , Surat I . . on your newspaper people are adopting cleanliness as a brilliant carpet .
The publication of cleanliness that you have started from Kashi Ghat has turned into a motive with your inspiration: 'Your words are true.
Wherever I go, the government will organise the cleanliness programme but in the middle of this society also cleanliness has become a festival.
Five days ago, seven days ago, ten days ago, a massive cleanliness drive will take place.
Do not know how much carefully all these things of the country , do not consider this thing , how much joy can you imagine .
I also congratulate all those who encourage this cleanliness drive.
Somebody gave me advice .
The advice of reality is very interesting .
I do not know whether I can do it or not .
Modi Garu , when you decide your tourism then what kind of tourism do you want , with whom do you want to call me Babu , how much will your cleanliness level be
The alternative is very good but I should think .
But such a garden should be made . It is a very good thing to clean the garbage of so many tonnes which is giving a lot of things .
By doing this many people are saved from the diseases .
The Government of India has decided to start an important program on the construction of vandalism with the help of state governments , with the help of urban projects .
On the 5th day of the world environment day of June , approximately 4 thousand cities of the country , liquid forms of liquid are available .
Two types of garbage are available . one green colored diabetes , other blue colored diabetes .
All these work properly in the fields . keep in mind that the fields are green , what is remembered in the garbage of greenery .
The second type of dustbins, bags, iron, glasses, plastic, polythene, broken rubbers, metals etc. come under various kinds of dry plants and must be recycled by putting them in the instruments.
In the last few days, you must have heard that Versova Beach has become a clean, beautiful Versova Beach in Mumbai.

Beloved my country , in the last fifteen months of the last fifteen months , TV Channels , Soshil media people are counting the number of the government .
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of 'Principle Servant'.
Many symptoms , opinions have been done .
All these procedures are adopted to healthy information .
In every test all these three legs have been tested .
Every part of the society has polluted it .
There is an excellent process in delivery .
I also tell blessed to all those who have given special , special food bakery .
On coming to the light of Lotu , Lopalu there is an opportunity to fulfil them .
The thing is good , something good , something bad , learning from it , walk ahead with its evening .
The negative examination gives strength to the delivery .
For an excellent country , a conscious country this importance is necessary .
This thing has been written to me of many families .
One person , one ordinary Pauri has increased this incident with my enthusiasm .
Even while sitting in such a big place, I would like to congratulate President Riki, Vice President Riki and Speaker Raki for giving so much importance to Mann Ki Baat.
In a way, a new approach has been given to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Friends, sometimes I was talking to you when I was working on the book Mann Ki Baat.
I'll be in debt to Akbar.
Beloved my country , this time the rains of all the countries keep on falling on mixing with us .
Come , let us move ahead while loveing nature in this environment .
Blessed is the blessedness of all your generations , blessedness .
Beloved , O people of my country , worship .
Probably arrangements , people have become a habit of these problems .
The subjects of children , youths , elderly experiences etc . are coming in my sight .
If someone coughs while traveling in the bus , train then immediately someone comes and gives some advice to something like this .
Advice , information is that we are in our nature .
Many people trying to reach me , to give advice are doing something or the other in their life .
With some good handicraft they change their intelligence , energy , capacity according to the situations .
Some people also tell advice about their advice at the place of working , the rest of the people who have heard that they have become a comprehensive form for everyone .
Not only this when I proposed something then it would be very happy to remember such things .
After that, Narendra Modi App, MyGov and many people from all parts of the country have made such creative efforts to see food ineffective.
I also sent some videos .
There are roti bananas at some places .
May is the establishment of one , Maharashtra , Gujarat states .
This conception is many ruins of the people of both these states .
Crossing many new development peaks of both the states continuously try to give their support to the progress of the country .
In both the states the great men of both the states labour for ever , every kind of society of the society keeps on giving us their life .
These great men are reminding , on the day of independence on the occasion of the state seventy five , i . . 2022 , all our states , all our society , all our cities , all our families should be included .
Make a plan to establish that cultural heritage . walk ahead with the help of all people .
On the second time these two states are my many ruins .
The rapidity of summer staying in the months of May , June in our country has to feel the situation of feeling in March , April .
That is why this time when I am advising advice to talk in mind , most of the advices have been given advice to take any precaution in this summer .
All these are also published not only new but it is also good to remember them at the right time .
It is said that Balcony has to keep water for birds , birds .
In many families small children also saw this work .
Once if this work comes in their sight , then birds come and see whether there is water in the cup or not .
We have such a sports but in reality it is a unique experience of lifting up the civilization in the minds of Pasi .
Although in our country it is necessary to give strength to such efforts about animals , natural life with animals , nature .
When I was the main minister of Gujarat then Daudi Bohra society came to the Sayadana district of Sayadana .
They lived an hundred three times .
On the day of his hundredth day the Bohra society of Bohra society has run a very big garden to preserve the names by their Burani Foundation .
I got the opportunity to start it .
Approximately fifty two thousand Bird Fairs have been sent to all parts of the world .
This has also been recognised in the Guinn Book of World Records.
Sometimes we were not able to take so much that the people wearing the name , milk , vegetables , Post Man , such that in these summer days somebody drinks good water in the gate .
Youth friends , I want to say some things with you as well .
Sometimes I like to spend life in our youth in comfort zone itself .
Mothers also rule their alternative in a protective environment .
Its diversity is also there but most of the comfort zones are seen .
Now tests have been done , to enjoy the cells .
After the summer season the cosmetics remain well after the summer season .
I want to tell you how to spend your summer holidays like a friend .

Give new use .
The experiment should be positive and it should bring you out of your comfort zone.
We belong to the middle class .
What about those travellers, what do they do after getting down at the station
In the evening go to the bus with your foot balcony , Wali Bal Tono or some other games .
Play yourself with those poor children , then see that you get the joy of never enjoyed in life in playing game .
If the children spending such life in the society get the chance of playing with you then they will know what changes come in their life .
I can say with belief that if you go once then I will go again .
This experience will teach you a lot .
The ill effects of technology have come to reduce the borders , but their ill effects have changed how six persons living in one house are in one room also to imagine the distance between them .
Away from technology can you try to spend time with you
If we pay attention to our country full of many opinions then we will get to learn something around us .
If you do not swim , learn this , try to give something or the other on the imagination of driving , not coming to the best imagination , the human hidden in you will be saved .
If we feel small tasks then sometimes we can not learn if we do some tasks then we can not learn .
You can learn to walk but when you want to learn auto rickshaws then do you want to learn to walk
You can come to wearing a cycle but can you ever try to take people to Trichakra car
Look , these new attempts , new experts will not only give you happiness , but will also pull your life out in it .
Keep showing indrasana to your friends .
I am talking with my experience , how much learning the world is possible to know how much we can not even imagine .
New places , new cities , new cities , new villages , new villages , new places .
But before going wherever you are going , go to that practice , seeing a gynaecologist there , to know , to ask people , to ask them , to see those places you will have a different joy .
That is why you will get the opportunity to learn how much .
Friends , this time the government of India has also given you a good opportunity .

Now even if red light has gone on vehicles , the red light entering the brain can not be said hard .
Namaskar Prime Minister Garu, from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, I will be speaking to Shiv Chaube.
I'd like to talk a little bit about the government-decided red beacon light ban.
It seemed very pride to me .
Now my time is also very important .
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic jam.
I want to know the blessedness of my heart for this decision .
The Red Fort is a part of the Red Fort by the government 's decision .
The importance of EPIs in place of VIPs in the country is the emotion of New India.
EPI in place of VIPs, my emotion is clear- Every person is important.
Every person has the importance of every person, every person has importance.
If we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country , then how big power is to make important dreams of 125 crore people of the country .
Do this work together .
Dear countrymen, we will always remember our history, our culture, our traditions.
Therefore we get energy , inspiration .
This year our 125 crore people of the country are celebrating their thousandth birth anniversary of Swami Ramjacharya .
Because of some reason we are not able to take so much that how small we are thinking that more than one century is thinking .
Use cosmetics .
It is also so difficult to come out by bringing out the social chains .
How was it that before a thousand
Ramajacharyas had done very big fight against the society of the society , description , internationality , species etc . during his time .
They were hungered by their own jewellery , who takes care of the society .
Before giving them entry into the house of thousands he got permission to enter the house of all them .
It is our fortune to keep the great men from our society to end the evil of that time in every age.
Today we are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Ramarajacharya, let us draw inspiration from him in the effort to enhance social integration.
To morrow the government of India has released a Tarikh Swami Ramjacharya in the memory of a Tapala Billa .
I am telling the customs of Swami Ramjacharya , I am offering .
Beloved my country , to morrow there is another speciality of Tarikh .
It is celebrated in many places in the world as a day of labour.
It is natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedakar on the day of afflicted with trouble , when it is discussed about troubles , it is natural to remember .
Italy I am reminding about Babasaheb Ambedakar , Swami Ramjacharya , the twelfth century of Karnataka , the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society .
In the twelfth century, he had taken deep thoughts on the subject of hard work and labour.
And he said unto them , Cailas , Cailas , and Cailas .
It means, 'You can attain the house of Shiva by your enterprise'.
That is , heaven gets obtained from doing karma .
On the other hand if you want to say , Shree Shiva .
It is natural to remember the guide of Datttapat Thangdi while talking about the labors .

On this sacred day I get the opportunity to offer Buddha in Sri Lanka .
Their memory is available to remind their memories .
My dear countrymen, we have always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' in India.
In India, "Sabka Sath-Sabka Vikas" comes not only in India but also in the global arena.
Especially it also comes to our two countries .
Our two countries should be helpful with our two countries , development should happen to them .
Many uses are done .

Maximum number of families of the country are standing in their children 's test .
In the families of tests the atmosphere of cosmetic atmosphere , tests done in the families of tests there is a very stressful environment .
In such a scenario, I can say one thing, listen to what I have said to the students in the Manas for the last time.
In a historical war happening opposite to unrighteousness Bangladesh has achieved the victory of Bangladesh in a historical war .
On such a special day, I would like to convey my best wishes to my brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of the Independence Day.

The memories of our Ravindranath Tagore are pride with the pride of the heritage of both our countries .
Because Bangladesh is the secret of our Guru Ravindranath Tagore .
One interesting thing about Rabindranath Tagore is that he was the first person to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913 and the British gave him the title of Knighthood.
Rabindranath Tagore is also one of the great men who created the English in Jalianwala Bagh in 1919 .
This incident is the time of showing strong effect on the mind of a twelve children .
In the childhood to spend playing this Jalianwala Bagh has given an inspiration to the life of that child .
In 1919 the twelve dynasty was the favorite , inspiration of all us , Amarvi Bhagt Singh .
These are three days creatory March , on the 23th day of the month of 23th March , he had climbed Sukhdev , Rajguru Language .
We all know that without the fear of three deaths of this incident Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , Rajguru , India has remained happy for us .
We can not even keep the story of the stories of the life of Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru .
The British empire was afraid of this three empire .
They were in the jail while they were in the jail , how was the brush of worry with them .
Therefore nobody had to impart training on 24th honey in the month of March , on 23th March the education of the day of March was done .
Besides this their dead goddesses were thirsty by bringing them to the place of Punjab .
Many years ago when I went to that place for the first time then a kind of progress occurred in my body .
Whenever opportunity is available , then I am suggesting to the youth of the country by going to Punjab , Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , Bakteshwar darshan .
At that time calling for freedom , its acuteness , its quantity is increasing .
On one side these were inspired by the youths like Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru .
Right before the bridge of Italy on the 10th day of April 1917 on the 10th day of April the Mahatma Gandhi Champaran had done the collection of Mahatma Gandhi .

In the fight of India Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary , Gandhi Giri Vihar style first time was known during Champaran .
Specially this incident is a milestone in the whole of the journey of fighting for independence for independence .
The Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, the Sammelan of Millal Carmels in Ahmedabad, all of which have a strong influence on Mahatma Gandhis thoughts and behavioral style.
A man who had returned to India in 1915 was only two activities.
The Prime Minister said that Mahatma Gandhis vision of the unifying power of the people, of the society, of the people of the British empire, of the people of the British empire, of inspiring, of fighting, of fighting, of fighting, and of fighting.
If we know about Gandhi Ridge during the contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary life then it is necessary to know how much the contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary of any person starting life .
How to start ordinary life , how much industry Gandhi had done Gandhi Garhwal from him .
We were sent to the village of Gandhi Garhwal at the same time all the big disembarks of listening to Rajendra Babu Garh , Archaeological Garhwal .
How to learn the color of freedom fighting with people , how to do the work of people .
A wonderful balance is in the work style of Gandhiji .
The desire of hundred crores of people to bring change , this is the foundation of new India , India .
There's a desire, a resolve, an enthusiasm.
Dear countrymen, if we come out of the lives of cosmetic minds, if we look at the activities happening in the society with cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetics, if we try to understand what is happening around, then the goals will certainly be able to do something for the society, not only for the society, but also for the society.
That also like a penance , meditation , like a closed service they are doing their work .
Everyday there are many people who serve the patients by going to the hospital .
That is , blood donation is everyone running along .
The people who give meals to food habits are so many .
Once on seeing its community , incidents it is known with such a big power .
All these are not celebrated with the government , non-government , government treasures .
But you see the country sometimes, the dream of a New India of an hundred and fifty crore people is visible in front of our eyes.
It is said that everybody should participate the responsibility of Pauri .
Then it starts a ruin of New India on its own .
2022 will mark 75 years of Indias independence and recall the horses of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Raj.
We will recognize the contemporary museum .
Whether we are also a part of the journey from 'Swaraj to Surajya' by keeping our lives intact
In the last few months there is no weather in our country , very high people have been participated in digital garden .
After the rubbing of the mouth various kinds of designs can be seen very increasing in the methods of distortions .
The beginning of Bhim Yap is only two and a half months , nearly one and a half crore people have done this ypnotise .
O people of my country , black wealth , which has to move ahead to fight with water .

Reducing the river , reducing behavior with mouth , do not pollute our part .
My dear countrymen, whenever I ask my advice for Mann Ki Baat, I am delighted to receive a variety of advice.
But in the matter of cleanliness pills are listening every time .
The eleventh edition of the eleventh edition of the Gayatri, the girl Deh Ra Don, sent a message to the Honble Prime Minister Garu, Prime Minister Garu, greetings and good wishes to you all.
First of all these so many acquaintances are many luxurys .
I want to speak in my mind .
I want to tell people how important cleanliness is .
People travel everyday on a river polluted by putting a lot of garbage .
This river comes to our house on the Rispna bridge .
I recognize it .
I want to be angry with the anger of purification in the hearts of hundred crores of people .
Once the anger starts , if we are satisfied , then we start applying something or the other cleanliness .
It is the best , the active part of the active , the garden is so important for them .
But cleanliness is always covered with a habit as well .
It is believed that in the November of the country , in childhood , students , youth students , this feeling is a good result on its own .
We know that we have eaten food in our house , in community food also we keep taking diet in our stomach more than required .
It becomes difficult to eat after putting everything in the eye .
Wearing in Kanchenjunga half of them can not be put in the stomach , leaving there .
Do you ever think how harmful we are to leave these swallowing things
If you are not able to swallow it after swallowing it then do all think of filling up the stomach of the lice
It is not a matter of understanding .
It is said that on cooking small children in our houses how much food can be eaten .
But such a thing is that family is also good for family .
They made some mobile yaps.
You will find such people at some places in every state of our country .
Water life also does not leave us flying , as much as we can eat , it gives us sports .
See , these are the paths for change .
Those who take care of body , health cautions then keep a little empty in the stomach , keep a little empty in the belly .
Therefore the matter of health is that April 7th Tarikh is the World Health Organisation .
The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) for the year 2030 has been decided as "Health for All".
This time Iraj Samiti April 7th Tarikh has paid attention to the depression of the World Health Organisation .
According to an estimate people of 35 crore people in the world are suffering from mental depression .
The danger is that even among those around us, we are aware that we are also interested in talking about this thing.
The person who is a victim of depression also does not talk about it because he is also ashamed to discuss it.
I would like to tell the people of the country that there is no freedom from depression.
On making a psychological environment release starts getting rid of .
First pill is that instead of suppression x-ray is necessary .
Tell your friends , parents , brethren , meditation between your brethren , what will your mind open .
Children residing in the hall sometimes suffer from loneliness.
The good fortune of our country is that we are connected with the big families of the upper households and therefore there is no size for depression.
It is believed that it is the first step towards depression .
This is the best alternative .
This depression becomes the cause of physical , mental diseases .
As diabetes is the root of all kinds of diseases , like depression also does not stand , do not take decision , do not take decisions , do not take decisions .
There is also another method .
When someone meets others , if you do any service , then you can lighten the weight of your mind easily .

When the nature is enjoying , the environment is enjoyable then man also enjoys that environment .
Festivals like Panchami , Maha Shivratri , Holi etc . fill the colors of fun in the life of man .

Once the history created by sending 104 museums in space once India remained the first country of India .
It is a matter of enjoying the use of 38th victory of PSA .
This is not only a 'ISRO' but also a historic activity for India.
This space programme, run by ISRO with very low cost, has become a marvellous event in the Yavat world.
The scientists of India have displayed this victory over the whole world with a large heart .
Brothers and sisters , this 104 museum is the main among the 104 museums of India .
How useful are the pictures , wildlife mapping , infrastructure , development estimations , urban development plans etc.

The next question related to India Bhadrata of India was also put .
In this matter India has also achieved another important success .

In the protection of India also the Ballistic International Missil has been tested successfully .
Their tuberculosis technology has achieved success by identifying the tuberculosis of enemies from the height of 100 kilometres near the earth .
Our Indian scientists have seen this .
And what is its strength is that if a tuberculosis comes from a distance of 2000 kilometres to attack India then our tuberculosis has the power to destroy it in space.
On seeing new technology , when we get some scientific new victory then we enjoy .
Memorial has played a very important role in the development of human life Taluku .
Special scientific , every person does not allow his memory to be like a gynaecology .
That is the reason for new research .
Their questions are not able to sleep .
If we look at the journey of thousands of years of development of human life, we can say that the journey of development of this human life is not the end.
It is impossible .
Everything , creation rules , human mind keeps on continuously trying to know the mind of man .
Although every new technology , new science gives birth to a new age .
My dear young ladies and gentlemen, while talking about the hard-working industries of science and scientists, I have often said that in Mann Ki Baat, our younger generation has enhanced the attraction of science.
There is a need of many scientists of the country .
Today scientists become the cause of a permanent change in the life style of coming .
Mahatma Gandhi said no science has dropped from the skies in a perfect access.
Science should always be used naturally to keep in mind the needs of ordinary people , how to use their principles , it should be considered beneficial to any technique , because it is beneficial to the common man .
I have seen how such creative identification , exhibition , exhibition of people , giving information about them , how such creative observations are useful for people , how to produce them at a high height , how to use them , how important work has been done .
I saw a fashion .
In 2005 more rains came in Mumbai .
Its meaning is that in the society , in the country , this type of role is very flock .
Our society is also very positive in the direction of technology .
All the arrangements are also run in the direction of technology .
In a way, technology has become a different part of our lives.
In the last few days the vagina of digestion is very strong .
Gradually people move forward towards digital consciousness leaving the river .
Digital Ladwa Devi is developing very fast in India as well .
Especially the youth is a habit of celebrating their digital parents from their mobile phones .
I am considering this auspicious sign .
A few days ago, in our country, the 'Lucky Grahak Yojana' and 'DG-Business Yojana' got a huge boost.
Through these two methods, an effort has been made to convert cash flows into a public activity in India.
In this plan more than a hundred minerals have been obtained everybody according to the lakh rupees .

Our Ratu brother , sisters filled our grains with so much trouble .
This seventh year in our country grain has been produced in the record level with rails in our country .
All the signals say that our rail records were bound all the old records .
This time the fruits in the pulses have been seen as if everyday Pongal , Baisakhi festivals are celebrated .
This year about two thousand seven thousand tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country .
This time 8  more than the emotional record of our rails .
This is the success of flying so much .
I am specially impressed the rails of the country .
Because besides traditional fruits they were able to pay attention to poor people , various kinds of cereals because they give maximum proteins with pulses .
Keeping in mind the need of rails in the country I enjoyed the fruits of various kinds of pulses in the land near two hundred ninety lakh hectares .
This is not only the production of various types of pulses , but also an important service for the poor people of my country .
My prayer , my brethren , my country ' s rails have produced records of pulses , so that my brethren are specially adventurous .
Dear countrymen, in our country, some work is going on in the direction of cleanliness by the government, by the society, by the institution.
In a way everybody seems to be very behavior related to cleanliness in some form .
The government is also continuously trying .
Six houses toilet pits were empty , they were healed .
The Twin Pit toilets were empty , then the rulers themselves saw the methods of using those toilets again .
How we do other cleanlinesss , these toilets can also be cleaned in such a way .
Because when an ice authority cleanses the toilets themselves then it is natural to attract the attention of the people of the country .
It has also been proved .
Six members are filled in five stard tower toilets for the family .
After that the garbage can be easily turned into another pit.
In six to twelve months the garbage reached in the toilet goat gets completely broken .
The government takes this pre-delivery , others also use such before .
Clean birds are continuously going on in various parts of the government as well .

Perhaps our ancestors, in any situation, the menstrual cycle, the economic cycle, the social life system has been embraced.
Till now we have celebrated many festivals .
The birth of Shri Krishna Festival happened in the whole of Hindustan .
The cost of such personality is that even after spending thousands of years also takes a new dimension , it gives new energy to someone imagines .
Today I am talking to you about two important monasteries .
One is Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan , another Charkhadhari .
And it came to pass, when Sudarshan Chakradhar had left the shore of the Yamuna , and went to the sea shore of Gujarat , and stood in Dwarkanagar , that Mohan the son of the sea shore came to the shore of the Yamuna , and spent the ends of life in Delhi .
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan had used his intelligence , to stop the war , to stop the war , to stop his intelligence , his intelligence , his scientific worry .
At the same time, India is at the forefront of a big festival.
Not only India , this is the church of the whole world . O my beloved country .
I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served the rails being identified in the slaughter .
In order to remove many illusions related to blood pressure they themselves have served the patients of blood pressure .
Services have kept their life for example .
We can understand this thing directly from the life of Bapuji .
Mahatma Gandhi 's person , society , humans , humanity was this very special .
Finix Farm of African , Tal Stay Farm , Sabarmati Ashram , Wardhana , all the places of the society , community , committee mobilization were dedicated to them .
All these emotions of society , society , community community community community community mobilization are important for us to bring in our behavioral life .
It is true that this is the true devotion of Mahatma Gandhi , true work .
We are connected with people in the society , with all the classes , together with all the age groups , the woman of village city is a man of all ages or what should I do with everyone , one person can do my attempt .
The cost of my waves is good that it is good .
Community is our strength .

There is no limit in mind that if good wishes, goodness and goodwill can be served with a complete sense of pride then it is enough.
It is also comfortable if it is for a unique pleasure.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
Dandi is a very important turning point in the freedom struggle.
I participated in the opening year of a state-of-the-art museum given to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
By this others also write three - four words by expressing your emotions along with those photographs .
During the coming many programs , competitions , exhibitions have been organised .
But in this context one interesting thing is to participate with you .
Venice Biennale is a famous art exhibition where artists from all over the world meet.
This time an interesting exhibition was organized in the Indian building of Venice Biennale with Gandhian memorials.
In this Haripura Panels are specially interesting .
In Haripura of Gujarat the conclusion of Kangras is celebrated , in which the history of Chandrabus is reminded you .
This is a beautiful past for Art Panel.
Princepal Nandlal Bose, Tattkali of Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan Kalabhavan in 1937-38, before the meeting of Haripura of Kangras.
Gandhiji wished to showcase their lifestyle in India through art and exhibition of their artwork in this council.
The art work of our kingdom is this Nandal Bos .
The state has given a special identity to the state .
Along with the art gallery of this Bos Gir art gallery has immensely embraced itself .
Nandal Bos Haripura has been made a art canvas by touring the villages near Haripura , in the end the rural life of India .
This invaluable artefact was discussed in Venice.
I would like to convey my best wishes to Gandhiji on his 150th birth anniversary.
Do something or the other for the country , society , society .
The same will be Bapu's exact, genuine functionality.
This time it starts from 11 September .
At this time we will come out of our homes and pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi.
Home , streets , but the roads are Gony , but the art gallery should be organised in all the public places .
This time pay more attention to plastic .
I told that while talking from August 155 crores of people of hundred and a half crore countries have done voluntary voluntary voluntary voluntary voluntary work .
And all of us must stop Single Use Plastic's man.
All sections of the society are enthusiastic about this proposal.
With this money will be saved, it will play an important role in protecting the environment.
This time in the context of the celebration of October Bapuji 150th birth anniversary of Bahraang was not only dedicated to the people of India who had got rid of excretion but also laid the foundation of plastic opposite park .
I am giving a gift to all the classes of the society , every village , every city resident .
This year Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated with the plastic garbage of India .
All the Municipality , corporation , district administration , village Panchayat government , private arrangements , all the institutions , everybody has to say that there should be adequate arrangement of plastic roof .
I would like to urge all corporate sectors to examine how the disposal can be arranged if the plastic was collected at one place.
It can be rescilled .
It can be fuel .
Today I want to say a very important thing with a culture .
There is a lot of importance of food in our culture .
As much as we were also included in science .
In the Nutrition Abhiyan, the country is making nutritional progress in modern scientific methods.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new interesting methods .
Once the matter came into my point of view .
In Nasik, a major thrust has been made on fibre-filled corn.
In the days of harvest in it anganbari services are administered a cereal from the people .
Women , children are made to make this grain hot food .
In this the person donating donating is becoming the servant of the society .
This culture is celebrated during the feeding of the child for the first time .
Liquid diet is not honourable .
Saurashtra had taken a thought in 2010 that why shouldn't it be necessary to provide compulsory food to children in the context of food processing.
This is very important , which can be participated everybody .
In many states people eat food .
A marvellous function of service , joy is spectacular .
O sisters , by many small methods our country can be influenced by fighting with malnutrition .
Today the right information or poor , wealthy people are also becoming victims of malnutrition .
The month of September is celebrated as Nutrition Abhiyan throughout the country.
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I felt very sure that there would be a lot of questions about this.
During the last few weeks, I had met the people where I had come to the public about Man Vs Wild.
I have not imagined that the opportunity of refreshing the youth of the world has come in my life .
But what happens .
Last week I went to Bhutan .
As the Prime Minister, whenever I come to visit, I am going to see one more thing: International Yoga Diwas has made an interaction with anyone in the world and someone talks about Yoga for five to ten minutes.
The people who do not discuss Yoga with me in the world 's biggest leadership , I am talking about the whole world .
Discovery Channel has planned to publish this program in 165 countries .
People want to know the churches taken in the direction of climate Jasts , clean environment in our country .
But another interesting thing is that some are asking me a word , Modi , tell me that you are talking in Hindi , Bear Grylls do not Hindi .
Do not do the cost of adventure after this .
Then what happened to the cost of shooting again .
It is questioned very carefully .
See , there is no secret in it .
Many people have this question in their minds. Okay, I tell you this secret now.
Actually this is not mystery .
In fact, technology has been used completely in the conference that happened with Bear Grylls.
As I have said something, it has been done in English and as a result, Bear Grylls put a small card lace in the ears.
Therefore, if I talk in Hindi then it has become a miracle of technology by listening to him in English and it is a miracle of technology.
After this show many people are seen discussing about Jim Corbett National Park .
You must also go to the places of nature , wildlife , living .
What is the nature here
You will remain watching .
Your interference will also expand .
On 15th August, I had requested you that at least 15 places in the three days to come, 15 places in India are completely tourist destinations.
You go, see, study, take the family, spend some time there.
Your thought will be enlarged .
My beloved countrymen , the thought of environment protection , conservation i . . conservation is seen naturally in India .
In the last month I was spectacular to release the population of tiger in the country .
Do you know how many tigers in India
The number of tigers in India is 2967 . two thousand nine hundred sixty seven .
It was difficult to stay half in this number below the branches .
A tiger conference was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010 about tigers.
In which the number of tigers has been taken information about reducing the number of tigers .
2022 calculla is the contribution of double the number of tigers of the world .
But now we will complete the goals of New India very soon .
We double the number of tigers here in 2019 .
The number of tiger reserves has also increased not only in India but also in the number of wildlife reserves .
I also recognized the Gir lions of Gujarat while releasing the tiger deta .
When I responsiblely responsible there the residence of lions in the jungles of Gir .
Their number was decreasing .
We have done many things together in Gir.
In 2007 the decision of making women guards there .
Improving infrastructure for increasing tourism.
Whenever we talk about natural , wild animals then preservation is discussed .
But along with safety think about taking this church towards mercy .
Therefore it is not necessary to save forests , trees , wild animals , they should also give appropriate environment to increase properly .
My beloved countrymen, how can we forget Swami Vivekananda's historical address in September 11, 1893

If this research is not new alternative then how does the water standing without flowing , how does the pollution spread by increasing the pollution also becomes heavy .
If we want to live with the help of old technology without research , then this world will go behind us in the changing age of this world .
Therefore in the youth scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific research has done many programs .
In our schools, wherever these tinkering labs are monthly, they will not only enroll Rs. 16 lakhs but will also provide Rs.

These sculptures encourage the Government of India with special archaeologists .
Abdul Kalam is the true belief that research , innovation , technology for the prevention of problems of our daily life , simple complications to stop our problems - how much our youth works in the development of India in the 21st century.
It is my belief that Abdul Kalla is the true faith of our offering .
To provide support to the problems related to the central state governments the shoulders without strength mixing the shoulders with the shoulders .
No matter how many snakes , races are running that we do not even think about us once .
Portuguese medicines are not working for that patient , fighting with disease , making new medicines , scientific researches have not been done , such a disease is a new problem .
Therefore it is very important to be cautious in the matter of disease .
The microbes that spread the diseases of tuberculosis , malaria can bring changes in our body as soon as there is no effect of medicines .

I remember that when I was the main minister of Gujarat then travellers used to come in large numbers in the month of Bhadrapad in the Ambaji Temple there .

Although lacs of people have sent this seven lacs of vegetation to the travellers who came at the feet .
Temples can also be started the tradition of giving plants instead of Prasad in this seventh rainy season .
This day we have to get down from the foreign countries for making houses , houses in our country , for making crores of rupees .
If we plant trees on our fields then if the trees which come to work in the house , ferniture then after 15-20 years the government can sell them by the permission of the government .
The central government has also approved the compassionate chatti which provides state governments for planting more than 40 thousand crore rupees under this chatti.

This work has been done under the Green India Mission run by the Central Government .

If this is the way the government has assisted, I can organize a meeting with all the Chief Ministers of the states which are in neglect, but I cannot do it.
I had a separate meeting with every state and spent about two and a half hours in each state.
I have listened carefully to every state.
Normally, such discussions have enriched the number of subsidies that the Central Government has enjoyed in the manner of States, and no matter how much money the State has spent.
In such a scenario, the Central Government officials were surprised to know that some States have made remarkable efforts to address water, environment, malnutrition, and to take care of the suffering human beings.
I would like to urge NITI Aayog to exercise the best practices to all the states.
Some states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, have been using technology completely.
I would also like to recognise the immense success made by these states in the future by NITI Aayog.
Peoples participation is a strong foundation for solving such issues.
We accept it and pray for God's forgiveness five times.
Water is also a goddess .
Hence, water consumption, water consumption and consumption of sufficient water, all these can also be given due importance.

I'm pressurizing you to do this.
Do not leave the time to come in vain.
We will convert these four-month-old drop of water into a 'Jal Bachao Abhiyan'.
It is not a mantra, it is ours.
It is the responsibility of all of us that the media and media have elaborated on the oxygen of water in the past.
These mediums also seek to guide people towards water conservation, as well as to make them a part of our efforts towards water conservation.
I also welcome those mediums.
Make a little change in our old habits.
If you help me in that matter, I would like to say that we will not be able to develop in that direction.
Sometimes there were no coins or no mouths.
If you want salt, you want vegetables.

There are automatic numbers.
In the first place, it will be poor.
But if it becomes a habit slowly then this system will become easier.
Through the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, we have opened the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country.
In the coming days, this card will be used in two ways - Credit and Debit.
There is no need to remove and count the pockets.
There is no need to deceive the diabetes.
The second step we have launched will transform the Bank on Mobile - Universal Payment Interface Banking Transactions (UPI) process.
Mobile phones will facilitate monitoring of money.
If you look at this, you will not be able to keep your RuPay card so easily.
Nearly 1.
25 lakh banking correspondents are being transferred to the youth.
But the sooner it happens, the better it will be.
That's how food is.
This will become their biggest strength when the sportsperson knows that 125 crore people are with him then that enthusiasm will be reflected.
If we do not get the desired results, life will not stop there.
Live with self-confidence, move forward with self-confidence.
But I have come forward with a new approach and I have never thought about it.
My job.
In case of an e-mail in the index, my vision has moved towards it.
He placed his presentation before me as Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh.
It seems to be a burden on my mind and he sent it away.
You were supposed to have developed better before.
I would like all of you to confess that when your children bring home the results of the test, please give them happiness and happiness.
Encourage them to grow further and if not, they have brought hundred per hundred.
If anything else is done then it will be better that day.
Our surroundings are not recognised.
These lines are not properly marked.
But whatever the poet has come, I have painted my pain on the embryo of life.
While keeping the picture in view, the sights should be illuminated, the blue-coloured rather than blue-coloured, it would have been better if the songs were not brick-coloured.
The pain of the picture is not understood, but most of those who say it should be shining.
But if you don't rejoice at the outcome, you will never be able to do new things.
Sankalp will help in furthering the happiness and happiness of food.
It continues to be faced in life.

When water level rises then there is a lot of change in water consumption as well.
Clean drinking water is also a cause for GDP growth.
But how many people around us are making every effort to deal with the evils, how new methods are being adopted to solve them.
This time why shouldn't we dug the soil in the pond and throw it into the field
Farming will also work well, and the power of water accumulation will also increase.
Sometimes, in cement bags, sometimes in empty bags, stones, soil filling and stopping the water from flowing through the waste.
He wrote in MyGov, Shri Kumar Krishna, and also interacted with various stories.

This is one thing that the economic scientists of our country are also thinking differently.

However, I am convinced that now the time has not come to read more books.
But, a benefit has come to me, that is, if you look at the descriptions that you are writing, I would like to know the details of a lot of books.
It is expected that we will have to take this forward as per the experience of these months.
Why shouldn't we put a permanent books corner on this NarendraModi App that can read, write and discuss new books
You will not give a good name to this books corner.
This will be a dynamic platform for the readers and writers.
Keep reading and writing, and keep sharing with all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat.
I would particularly like to congratulate the government for conducting discussions with the farmers and encouraging them to grow less water in place of their traditional farming practices.

But we will not stop here.
The mission will go a long way in enhancing cleanliness.

Through the Street Art, many areas of Delhi were decorated with beautiful paintings.
The work on the Over Bridge, from the Badi Walls to the Slum huts has also been done in collaboration with the people and not through their arts.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh.
This will also bring us to the fore in the beauty of Swachhta.
This is the description of Mohammad Aslam Bhai of Shopia, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote that it would be better to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.

I am aware that more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham this time in the month and a half since the start of the Chardham Yatra in Uttarakhand.
Pilgrims have reached such a record number for the first time since the horrific floods in 2013.
My request to all of you is that you should not go to those places where the beauty of the country remains in the rainy season.
To see these beauty in our country, nobody is more than a tourist destination to know the soul of the people of our country.
There is a lot of hardship in other parts of the country.

In the past some decades we slipped to the places from there .
I don't even want to tell you about our rankings in the FIFA.
On the other hand, I am going to grow so much in the youth of India that it may be English Premiere Leg or let Leg or let Indian Super Leg match.
Indian youth are giving time to know about these matches, or to see them in TV.
I have said that when we get the opportunity to host the FIFA under-17 World Cup, we will not only fulfil our responsibility by playing an important role.
Or do we encourage sports by using this opportunity to benefit us
Football, Football, Football, We should create a changing environment this year in schools, arts and in every corner of India.

In scientific method this attempt is not possible but work is done .
But if we want to enjoy the tourism of 125 crore people of the country then we can attract the world .
We can make a big part of the world tourism .
Otherwise our crore youth can show the opportunity of the youth .
Government Gony , Institutions Gony , society , people do the work of adventurous activities .

Look around you.

In the past water places , places of water , places again we can prepare water by cleaning the garbage by cleaning the garbage .
Filling up the ponds , if our rivers , canals are filled then the deficiency of water does not cause much damage to us .
But it is possible to stand by holding the leopard of every rain water .
This time there is a contribution of excavation of five lakh water .
Although it is necessary to make any more attempt in this direction .
Beloved my Ratu brother , sisters , the Government of India has played a heavy rate of India .
Everybody should be in balance .
That is why the expense of less money remains .
Our summons were reduced to higher yields.
This is the mantra that we should follow, we should increase scientific methods in our agriculture.

This contribution is considered to be the speciality of Kolkata India .
In comparison to the countries of the world India is very behind the tourism sector of India .
You also think like this .
I'll tell you one thing to think.
Look - you will have happiness .
I would like to tell you again about this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
If you want to say the truth , I forgot its identity .
Why did you enjoy this thing
For the preservation of water we should take these churches with complete care .
Many other diseases of our body are the guests of our body that enter our house.
Definitely think about this thing .
It is said that for testing Babu test the tuberculosis comes .
It is said that he had come to T . . .
It means that this disease is such that it can also be tested very soon .
But if you do not think that this work is not because of the government , doctors , medicines , therefore the people of the country are my support .
Therefore , it remains shining in your mind as well .
I also want to meet you in this journey.
As much as you are in the matter of tests of your children , the same is the same .
But if we change the thought of tests , perhaps we will get rid of this campaign .
I have said this much in Mann Ki Baat that your experiences and suggestions must not be sent through the NarendraModiApp.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to my parents, examiners and their teachers.
I know that tests start in a few days .
Everybody asks how is ready to go , tests .
How many times come , how much do I scorpion , I told one another .
You decide yourself a goal for you .
I kept many estimations on me while playing cricket , how much hoped from me .
While passing time the estimation of some estimations started becoming even more named .
Then how important is it to find out the result of this .
I decided my goals myself , I am able to conduct them so much good for the country .
I was constantly trying to conduct those goals .
My eye lashes have been fulfilled slowly on the ball .
Good luck.
Make your future .
It is my belief that these words of sunrise will definitely be useful for you .
Why should we not keep ourselves touched with us
Wherever we reached , how far we came .
Do not get stuck in the number of such numbers .
One of the greatest goals of life should be decided, one should travel with a dream.
Therefore if a large , high dream is made then the tests become a joyous year .
It is very best to say that in the healthy body there is a healthy mind in them .
In this context, our daily routine should be a medium of dreams and resolves for 365 days.
He has specially done that you should sleep regularly , as soon as you wake up early in the morning , we should take ourselves .
Taking the entry centres of test centres , other things should be reached before time .
Do not do this .
I believe that you can do this .
Although the foundation of success in life is responsible for keeping the foundation of victory nutritious .
A strong foundation takes place with regular care .
They are unconscious , they do not taste regular carelessness in the morning , they do the work of gardening in the morning , how much of the work to be done in the afternoon .
Not only this , our daily routine is also very important .
Therefore we should not see anything small .
Definitely, do it.
Friends , O ye friends ,
Sometimes I saw that two types of water is seen in the students going to the test .
Who can say this better than me, that is - Charangam Champion Vishwanathan, who has played the role of sportspersons in the world.
He will divide his experiences with you .
Come , let us learn how to build these tests by him .
Hello, I'm enjoying Vishwanathan.
How I am ready to test my tests , what is my experience now .
It has been seen that these tests have been done beforehand in life .
Therefore if you are peaceful , eat nutritious food , sleep straight then only your brain can remember the right peace at the right time .
Therefore stay calm .
In the last minute very important store , otherwise you will feel that you do not have a good memory once more .
The joy of Vishwanath is really important .
How much he sits in the international charang competitions , how much concentration you will discover .
Is not Arjun standing on the eyes of the bird
If you are standing on the banks of a pond then you will find many things in the water below .
Initially when there is no cost of anything then you will see after putting a stone .
If water is melted , then foot objects are also seen in it .
It takes 30,40,50 seconds but once my mind is ready to understand subjects .
This can be my experience and it is also useful for you.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing .
He wrote in my App: We will talk peacefully with friends and family members at least half an hour every day.
Whenever you go somewhere with parents , then wear things .
Ranchi Manas has been trying to reach out to the entire world within the country and outside the world by extending its expansion to the present situation.

How much happy is this to me .
All this has come to the birth of memory which seems very good to me .
And I would like to say that today, start doing Yoga from the bottom of the pit - it will be wrong for you.
Very light solution .
You must pay attention to it .

Why do all these things do the cost of cost .
Read these informations as per your precaution . two minutes , three minutes , five minutes .
If the question is not understood then sometimes the question feels difficult .
Therefore competition tests .
Do not fall , do the work without bending your energy .
And I said unto all my young friends , This is the same .
At the same time, keep in mind that there is a lot of potential in this country.
Decide what you want to do in life , do not take it forever .
You win.
You don't forget about this world's maternal child.
You also have the right to stay here on the lines of trees and mountains.
You will have to take the precaution , unconscious emotion , meditation .
By these symptoms you will be excited in all the tests .
I hope that you want to do victory in every matter .
Bless you .
Seeing , how does a great scientist speak
To say that I take half an hour , that thing is said in three minutes .
This is the strength of scientific science . This is the strength of the scientist mind .
I tell thanksgiving thanks to the children of the country to give support to the children of the country .
If you are strong then fear will also be scared .
For doing good , the future of gold is waiting for you .
Now a message from the taste doubs on my app has tasted the experience of its tests.
It is said that during the test the members of his family members keep trying continuously to stay in a social environment , this is the same kind of exercise is also done in their families .
Sometimes there are many things that do not think that the words that inspire us do not inspire the students only.

You will know that no traditional education has been impossible in the past .
Raling . Hari Port Siris has changed all over the world .
Tests are not only one of the students , whole family , school , students .
But without parents , teachers the situation of alone student is not good .
Vijay Jindal had written that he should not bear his weight on children .
Today parents do not want to say much to their parents .
Do not let the child fall in tension .
If you talk to a friend - do not worry .
Why do I say that today national science day is the day of national science .

Solar energy is bringing light to the poor using solar energy.
It is fighting against darkness.
The crowd takes her to Lander in the evening.

I received a script from the top graduates of St. Mary at Kerala-Kochi and Chittor.
I was sent a picture of Mother India in the shape of India.
I was astonished to see why they had painted the shape of India with their own seals.
But I understand after reading the script that they want to give such a great Simbelic message.

Their aim is to transform body into a profession and process.
These girls have written to me in writing, "You must urge people to participate in your Mann Ki Baat Manas.

This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has done a very good job.
Millions of students visited the exhibition.
The people of the village have seen it.
The people knew how Mahatma Gandhi had played an important role in African-India relations and how the impact of Mahatma Gandhi was on both these lands.

My dear brothers and sisters, how can we not reflect on cleanliness in this conversation
This message was sent from Mumbai to Savitarai through a female telephone.
This time we will clean our houses and our traditions on Diwali.
As a result, with the launch of Deepawali, the mission on sanitation itself started.
You have said that what we think before the festival should be brought into the forefront of the festival.
We should do this in every public programme.
Today, I convey my best wishes to all the media organizations in the country.
I am fortunate to participate in the gathering on the occasion of the commemoration of the year of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti Swachh Bharat programme on 2nd October last year.
The institute conferred the Clean India Awards.
I conclude that the people who have worked for Swachh Bharat, such as the One Lake One Mission.
What kind of countries have been cleaned in our country.
All these came to light and I heartily congratulate the India TV Group on this magnificent work.
Around 51 lakh children from around 55,56,000 schools in the States of Andhra and Telangana participated in the programme.
He also unveiled a plaque to mark the laying of foundation stones for the development of Bahrainag region, railway stations, spiritual places, hospitals and parks.
Now these words give us the strength to achieve the goals of Swachh Bharat.
Therefore, whatever Smt. Savitarai suggested, all the citizens of the country are now taking this initiative forward as their duty.
He further said that in Asia, the most clean village of the clinest village, Arwar, has been found in this village.
It was heartening to note that in our country, far away, in the beautiful north-eastern state of Meghalaya, the villages have won pioneers in the field of sanitation.
My beloved countrymen, I have said that there are a few things that have been lost in Unani (internal burial) in the Red Fort on 15th August.
When a poor person goes to smaller enterprises, how much he has to pay for the recommendations, how he asks for pills from the groups, how he gets the job done, how he gets the money when he does not get the job.
I have never heard of such a psychiatrist who understands one person in one or two minutes home.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all young friends.

In our country, gold has become a part of social life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the banks.
Now do not keep gold in home .
The second thing is that in the Savarin Gold Bond, gold cannons will not fall into your hands.
But now we are starting it .
Therefore, there is no need to buy gold now.
The scheme, which will guarantee security, will be launched by the people of the country in the coming weeks.
I am happy to say that we are also bringing gold coins and gold coins with Ashoka Chakra.
Why shouldn't there be an indigenous seal in our country
Therefore, in the coming week, before Dhanteras, we will start the five grams and ten grams of Ashok Chakra with gold coins.
Besides, 20 grams of gold canals are also available to the people.
I would like to assist you in bringing about a new transformation in the direction of this new scheme being arthritis.
But one mantra - one's thinking, one's behaviour, one's behaviour, should be constantly measured.
There is a diversity in India .
Many categories, mothers, traditions, many languages, different species and cultures.
Therefore, diversity is the only mantra.
Peace, harmony and integrity - these are divine medicines for development.
The "Run for Unity" programme has been organised in many places across the country in the last few years on 31st October.
Take the mantra forward.
Now all of you will be at Deepawali and you will be cleaning your houses.

The festival of Deepavali is celebrated everywhere in the country.
My best wishes to you all on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
But on the day of Deepawali, I will continue to hear a few words.
Therefore, I am particularly excited about my visit to Britain.
Many years ago, for the empowerment of women for the Bhagwan Vishwasvara people, it is indeed a matter of study in the world.
The statue of Bhagwan Vishwaswar on the land of London will prove to be an excellent example of how India's great men think far and wide.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
I will also try to reach you in your language for 8 hours at night.
And so there was a good bond between us.
The last year has been completed.
Now we are entering the new year.
Once again my best wishes to my beloved countrymen.
Prime Minister's Office PM's Mann Ki Baat Programme (Deputy) September, 2015
My dear countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat - Mann Ki Baat - One year, many words.
I don't know what you have achieved, but I can't say it without saying how much I have achieved.
The power of the people is immensely immense in public life.
There is a prior thought in my life, so I have immense respect for the power of the people.
However, in Mann Ki Baat Mann Ki Baat, I learnt through a talk programme, I mean, I got it, and I said that the power of mankind is more dangerous than we think.
Our ancestors say that people are a part of the future of God.
But lakhs of people used to send me messages in a conscious manner.
It is a great power on its own.
These lakhs of products have taught me a big role.
That is, information must go from the bottom to the bottom, it must go from the bottom to the bottom.
He said that this information is being translated into Mann Ki Baat Mann Ki Baat.
But this has happened.
In the same way, Mann Ki Baat - Mann Ki Baat has changed into an urgent need to showcase the power of the common man.
I urge all the citizens to take note of the tourism sector in India, incredible India, brothers and sisters, if you are going then send me a good photo.
But there has been a lot of trouble.
Like lakhs, people from all parts of the country sent photographs.
It is an experience for the power of the people.
Once I have spoken in Mann Ki Baat Manas, the poor households will have smoke and children will cry.
It is compulsory for the common man, middle class and lower middle class to leave the bill.
There is nothing from Siachen, but from Kutch, but from Cameroop, Kashmir or Kanyakumari to Gony-Phone.
Fonds were done from all the places .
This is a pleasant experience.
He sent his message to all age groups.
I liked to hear a few messages myself and I am very good.
My team is working on the rest of them.
But this is the reason why they cannot watch TV and listen to radio.
I am aware of the importance of radio for the blind.
I have seen another new attribute, how many good things they have told them - it is enough to consciously make the government aware.
Pawan Acharya sent a message from Alwar, Rajasthan.
Soil pumps are also invaluable.
My dear countrymen, I have had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with our soldiers on this auspicious occasion.
Our Armed Forces, Navy, Air Force, Army, Air Force, Navy, Air Force, Navy, Air Force, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy
The war with Pakistan was completed 50 years in 1965.
In this context, a luxurious exhibition was organized at the India Gate in Delhi.
I had seen how impossible .
Fighting in Hajipur, but the day-long fighting took place in Ghani and Chamunda, but the hailstorms cease to see the victorious scenes of the Yamuna and Hajipur Pass.
History will be linked with our heritage.
I would like to see you and your families - if you are around Delhi then this sight will remain for a few days.
Don't go on seeing it as soon as possible.
I returned in two and a half hours.
A young boy asked the Prime Minister, but the boy soon forgot to mention his name.
For the first time since independence, the Parliament has been discussing the issue of cleanliness for hours.
I am seeing good in this .
The country parliament also looks forward to discussing cleanliness.
On the one hand, parliamentarians and professionals from across the country are talking about cleanliness.
And you know what Mahatma Gandhi would say.
He said that once he had to choose one of both freedom and hygiene, he would have chosen cleanliness, and freedom would have ended.
Gandhijis cleanliness is more important than independence.
He said that Din Dayal ji is keen to know about Shatabdi.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi.
5,550, whichever is incurred or incurred, will be for the last person.
This joy also gives you a little bit.
When I went to Kolkata in the month of May, members of the family of Subhash Chandra Bose came and met.
Chandra Bose, son of Sodurni, was also present on the occasion.
Subhash Babu got the opportunity to spend the evening with joy and happiness with the family members.
Chandra Bose and his family members are in the fray for the last week and more than 50 members of the Subhash Bose will be invited to the Prime Ministers residence.
But more than that, it is a matter of joy that I would never have had the opportunity to host such a great man, the Prime Minister's residence, in October.
This is why more than 50 members of the Subhash Babu family are coming from different countries.
Is it a comfort to enjoy it
Is it safe to have the invaluable right I have.
In the meanwhile, I have visited Kashi.
I met many people.
He also interacted with some other student on the occasion of Kshitij Pandey.
Banaras Hindu University is undergoing some improvement in Central Universities.
However, at such a young age, we have seen physics related issues.
Whatever he said, it may contain subtle knowledge, but his faith and belief.
I am sure that all the children of the country will be interested in scientific aspects.
Sometimes it also enjoys something like this.
Sometimes our sky-high mates - half an hour .
But I will reflect your feelings.
Thank you for your suggestion.
Now it is perfect once a month.
You know that the Mann Ki Baat programme has been a part of the year.
Do you know how much Subhash Babu uses radio
He called Azad Hind Radio with Weekly News Bulletin.
He used to conduct radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Pass and Urdu.
I too am now talking to you in the sky.
My Mann Ki Baat - In my mind, the word has become meaningful in your mind.
I am, but those things will be yours.
Your suggestions must be there.
The government will also benefit from your suggestions.
Responsibility will rise.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2015
Once I got the opportunity to tell words in my mind .
In the southern direction of Sudur, people are immersed in Oman Sabar and celebrated the festival of sacred Raksha Bandhan throughout the country.
The Government of India has entered many new ways for the social devotion of common people .
11 crore households have been covered under this scheme since its inception.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the occasion of PBD.
Today, I am talking to you, I will make the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana a year ago at a bigger level.
Youth observations have also been found . In one year Bangking Rang , economy , names .
Do not stop opening of accounts.
We are connected to the poorest of the poor that we will get pulses from the bank.
These banks are yours, you don't leave them now.
I have brought them to you, it is your duty to start buying them now.
The bank accounts of all of us should be alive.
I don't think you'll be able to buy it.
Incidents and violent associations of Gujarat have embraced the entire country.
Anything that happens in the area of Gandhiji and Sardar Patel will cause distress and distress to the nation.
However, in a short span of time, the elders of Gujarat, my brothers and sisters, all of you have reconciled the situation.
He played a key role in tackling the situation unexpectedly.
Peace, unity and harmony is the right path.
They do not obey their words, the way they speak, the essence of the Sufi community, the harmony that lies in it, the rhythm of music.
I felt all this while I was amongst them.
I am convinced that the world needs to understand the true nature of this world in accurate manner.
I am sure the love and affection of the Sufi community will reach this message far and wide.
I would also like to inform others that there is a need to understand the sufficient tradition of any of our mothers.
I am lucky that I will get another opportunity soon.
Buddhist scholars from all over the world will come to Bodhgaya in India.
It gave me an invitation to participate in the event and it was a pleasure to invite me when I came to Bodh Gaya.
Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of our country, went to Buddha.
I have also spoken about this in the Mann Ki Baat programme so far.
We have issued an Ordinance on earthquake.
The Ordinance will expire on 31st August, 2019.
But there was a depth in it .
Therefore, on 15th August, we have taken this decision very quickly, not in the field of agriculture but in the field of agriculture and agriculture.
You don't have to be a victim of fears.
It is usually a reminder of the 1965 war as a student of Lal Bahadur.
Remembering the mantra of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' is simple.
It is very relevant to recall the trinity of India and its dignified dignitaries.
Such historical events always inspire us.
Last week, I got the opportunity to interact with the people of the Sufi community, and it was a pleasant occasion.
I have had the opportunity to interact with eminent scientists of the country for hours.
How should the workshop be added to the area
It has to be taken forward as an opportunity.
I have said in the following Mann Ki Baat programme that there is a lot of scope for students to come forward and there is a lot of opportunity for them to imbibe what they dream of in their eyes.
Especially to my young friends.
Everybody is running at the lower level which can also be the cause of water .
The decision to liberate small enterprises from interviews will now be approximately implemented.
This is the first time that this meeting will be held in other countries outside America.
More than 50,000 observers and 13 lakh children in our country are reproducing at the time of reproduction or at the time of delivery.
As we get rid of polio, we also get rid of tetanus in case of maternal and infant mortality.
There are reports on dengue between them.
We should not die so easily.
How much price is life .
Not paying attention to drinking water, not satisfying sanitation, these are the causes of death - it is not possible.
Dengue assessment tests are available free of cost in 514 centres across the country.
Now we will not get the opportunity to change for the country but if we have the privilege of living for the country then we will get it.
Both of these brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
Sometimes because of the deficiency of self-confidence, we injustice our youth.
I believe that this Orissa has been the centuries old.
My experience with youth is different.
Sometimes talking to the youngsters - there is a lot to learn from them.
These include: "Sande on Cycle".
Some say we're playing a cycle day in a week.
Man Ki Bath , June 2019 .
O my beloved country , worship .
Sometimes our words were inspired to us .
In this middle I can imagine how to spend my time .
On Sunday , the last Sunday , at 11 o'clock I felt as if something had lost .
Sure it feels like.
Probably this is not a regular program .
In this program there was life , it seemed as if the heart was luxurious , therefore this program was very difficult for me to come to this program .
But this Sunday has waited a lot.
In the last few months, many messages have come and people have also said that Mann Ki Baat is being missed.
It will be very good for me when I read them .
Why did I travel to Kedarnath in how many acquaintances I questioned that it is your right to question .
I can fulfil your curiosity .
I also want to participate those feelings with you .
But if they talk then the form of Mann Ki Baat will change.
In how many acquaintances , in the contact of Jaypajayas , even before the end of Poling I was Baaldera .
Many people were discovered in it .
It's my fault, I have the chance to spend with me.
Everything can be said just a while ago that due to the small breakdown in the Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to fill the Kedar valley in the solitary cave.
I also try to fulfil your curiosity one day .
When I do not say that I do but definitely do .
Because you have that right over me.
In the matter of Kedar people have considered how sports , with the same sports you have seen some positive things , many times in your words .
Sometimes the work of paying attention to my thoughts also keep doing your words .
People , country , society , problems , challenges coming in my sight along with bringing them in my sight .
If someone is writing about cleanliness , then the pollution keeps trying to give their wrath to cleanliness as well .
That is , the results of a kind of problems are seen in your words in the society of the society .
The country of Mann Ki Baat and the society's anger is like an element.
The international power , strength , talent situated in the country is known by this .
There is a need to activate these strengths and talents by providing them an opportunity.
One more thing to know through this Mann Ki Baat is that all 130 crore people want to participate actively and effectively in the development of the country.
You can imagine how much energy I get when I analysis such things.
Actually I didn't come, you brought me, sat down.
With this feeling, we will take the tradition of 'Mann Ki Baat' forward.
There was an obstruction in the mind of all the people .
Therefore the country has given invitation to how many administrations for the protection of democracy besides its own profit .
Perhaps in any country of the world where people have not taken their rest , authority , powers , needs only for democracy or not only for the democracy of this country has seen such a number of 77 -LRB- 77 -RRB- .
Today, in our country, there has been a lot of aspirations and a lot of aspirations for the democracy, from the rich to the poor, everybody has participated in this festival with joy and zeal to decide the future of our country.
Anything we'll understimate when we've got it, we'll also ignore it's a maximing facts.
We may find this number somewhat normal but if we look at the world then we can say that if we leave China then most of the people of the rest of the world have lost their lives today.
But how many people were put in the number of the members in 2019 , that number is more than the total population of America .
The total number of Ootys in India is more than the population of Europe .
It introduces the magnitude of our democracy.
The number of civilizations in 2019 is still the biggest democracy of the world in history .
In such a situation you can imagine how many acquaintances human power , arrangements are needed .
This is possible only when lakhs of teachers , rulers , workers were troubled day and night .
Approximately three lakh Paramilitary teams have been responsible for ensuring this great yagna of democracy and 20 lakh police personnel of various states have also worked at a very proud level.
As a result of their hard industry this time more Ooting was done more than this time .
You can imagine 10 lakh Polling Stations across the country, over 40 lakh EVM machines, over 17 lakh Vivipayat (VVPAT) missions.
It has been done that no one has to come to the unforgettable condition of its Ooty .
A Polling station has been set up for only one woman Ooty in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
If you have to travel for two days to reach there then you will be surprised .
But this is the pride of democracy .
Polling center of the highest place of the world is in India .
It is located at a height of 15000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Not only this , how many prides are there .
Perhaps for the first time in history, women also participated in Ooting with enthusiasm.
The quantity of polio in many women , men is about equal .
Although the reality of enthusiasm is that in parlor today 78 -LRB- seven8 -RRB- women are epilepsy .
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of me saying Book not Book.
My prayer is to give books instead of flowers in welcome .
Approximately at many places such books are being given .
In the meanwhile, the book "Prem Chand Ki Look Beloved Kahania" was given to me.
It gave me a lot .
I did not get a long time , when I was in labor then I got a chance to read some stories again .
Their stories reflect the feelings of the whole of India.
While reading the story of 'Nasha', I looked at the economic imbalances of the society.
When I was young then I remembered how many nights were spent in the churches on this matter .
If the son of Jammu is not cautious about this story of Ishwari, the family of the poor, then we are aware of the fact that whenever there is an adverse effect of the bad company.
The second legend Id Gah, the heartbeat of a child, the love of his mother, the love of his mother, his matureness at such a young age.
It is said that taking 4 . years from Hamid Sanctuary to go to my mother , really the pride of human heart .
The last stories of this stories are not so impressive , the small Hamid old hamid part plays - old Amina , Amina have become a small sin .
In the same way, Puss Kir Rat is a myth.
In this stories a poor life style is seen .
If its fruit was destroyed then Haldu Ritu had to sleep at night like a field in the cold shivering itself .
In reality this stories were old for a century , today it seems sufficient .
After reading these I felt a special feeling .
If we talk about reading , then in some media I read about Akshay Library of Kerala .
If this library is in a village of dense forests then you will not be surprised .
The first school teacher there was P . . .
K . . .
Both of them were polluted for this Library .
Once the books have to be brought by bending on the shoulders .
Today this Library is looking everybody along with the children of tribal tribals .
Walking Gujarat -LRB- Gujarat -RRB- is a successful use of Gujarat .
In lacs of numbers all age groups participate in this garden .
Write exactly what is reading in the NarendraModi App and everybody can know about it in Mann Ki Baat.
My beloved countrymen , apart from the present people of our country think about the subjects of future apart from the present .
When I read your descriptions in the NarendraModi App and My Voices, many people are writing about the problem of water.
Pavan Gaurai in Belgaum , Sitansu Mohan Parida in Bhubaneswar , Yash Sharma , Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related problems .
Water is very important in our culture .
It has been said about the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness .
Every year in many places of the country the problem of water is lifting up .
In the rainy season we can hide only 8  water in the rainy season that you are not surprised .
Only 8 .
The result of this problem has come to the time of discovering .
This problem has also been solved with the help of all the other problems like the participation of people , with the capacity of 100 crore people of the country , with the help of culture .
A new Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country, especially considering the importance of water.
By this decision can be taken fast in all the cases related to water .
Some people did a new work .
The serpentine of the country has written north to all the villagers of the country .
It has been written that for making a collection of water for the villagers , to collect water , to collect water every drop of rain water in the village , to make them a collection in the village .
In this work participate in the whole week with enthusiasm the people of 22 thousand crores of people have done distress in this month .
People in the villages have made every drop of water affordable.
Today, I will hear you a serpent during Mann Ki Baat programme.
The Lupung Panchayat Serpent of Katam Sandi Block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand gives us a message and my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
The people there were ready to play their role for the conservation of water once again .
All the villagers , all the serpents of the villagers are many hustle-bustles for their work .
People of the village , their villages look like competition to build a water temple .
I will see the positive results of adventurous efforts as before .
There is no alternative for the result of the problem of water throughout the country .
Therefore in various places of the country , attempts are being made in various ways .
That's why the water logging problem is restricted.
Small ponds at Kabirdham in Rajasthan have brought about a major change.
20,000 women have collectively tried to revive the Naga river in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.
I also read that even in Gadhwal, all the women are working together on the Rain Water Harvesting.
Such efforts are being done very much . I believe that if we try to make the impossibility possible as well .
My first request - how the countrymen have laid emphasis on cleanliness and also for water conservation.
I believe that water is the prasad of Parmeshwar.
In order to save one drop of water we should do a necessity .
Talk about the problems of water in it , talk about water conservation methods .
Specially, for the mainstream of various regions, for the conservation of water, I have to give leadership to innovative campaigns.
Leave the film rang , let us not let our friends of media , but let the people of social institutions , not let the people of cultural heritage , but let everybody in their own way .
Wake up the society , do the society together , work together with the society .
See, we must see changes before our eyes.
I would like to share the traditional methods of conservation of water.
If any of you has a chance to visit Porbandar, Puja Bapu's birthplace, there is a house behind the house of worshipped Bapu, where there is a water storage tank of 200 years.
Therefore I always say that if someone goes to Kirti temple then definitely see that water tank .
Come , let us inspire the conservation of water conservation related to water conservation .

Hello.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Italy is India 's heart if the mind starts becoming heavy .
The creator of ten days Bharatma had lost his sons .
These volunteers have lost their life for the protection of 125 crore people of the country .
For the people of the country to sleep peacefully these virtues save us from their sleeping .
Our armies are always displaying unparalleled adventurous adventurous games .
Ram Niranjan, father of Amarvir Ratan Thakur, from Bagalpur in Bihar, has said in such a sad moment, the feelings inspire all of us.
He told that he also sent his second son to fight with enemies , if needed he will also fight .
Seeing the courage of the wife of Amarvir of Jagsangpur of Orissa , seeing the courage of the wife of Prasanna Sahu , the country worshipped her .
This small psychological psychologically tells us all the small children of India .
Such feelings , we get to see in the houses of our virtue , paralysis , Amarvi .
Their families also have no ministration in it .
The martyr of Deoria, the family of Vijay Maurya, the parents of Tilak Raj of Kangra, the son of Hem Raj of Kota, the son of Hem Raj of Kota, is full of inspiration from each family of these martyrs.
I am giving an attempt to understand the feelings exhibited by these families .
The living witnesses situated in front of our eyes are the inspirational examples of India .
My beloved countrymen , freedom came home , all of us are waiting for the memorial of war .
I am surprising that the national war memorial of India was not surprising .
It is a memorial to preserve the bravery of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation .
I have decided to make such a memorial in the country.
It is a matter of great happiness to finish this construction at a very little time when we decided to make a memorial of the national war .
To morrow , i . . February 25th honey , our crores of the country have given this national soldiers to the army of this national soldiers .
It is a small attempt to fulfil their desire .
The memorial was organised in the heart of Delhi i. e.
It is believed that to visit this national soldiers memorial is like a pilgrimage to the people of the country .
After the independence of the country the soldiers given maximum sacrifices for the country are the symbol of this national soldiers .
The shape of this memorial showcases the unparalleled courage of our martyrs.
The National Military Memorial is based on four core concentration circules, the first volume depicts the entire journey from birth to sacrifice.
The flag hoisting of the flag hoisting wheel is a symbol of Amarvi .
The second cycle is the beauty wheel.
There is a queue of dense trees in this wheel .
If seen on softness , it has become a place to visit this national soldiers coming to know about the important martyrs of our country , to tell them thanksgiving , to exhibit them about them .
The asses of those who sacrificed their lives to stay with our lives, to keep the country safe, to develop.
For the development of the country it is not possible to say in the words of our weapons , police , Para Military teams .
In the last year in October I also got the fortune of giving this national memorial to the country .
This National Police Memorial is a reminder of the thoughts of the women who have been continuously involved for the protection of all of us, and the police of men and women, to express our gratitude.
I hope that you will definitely go to see the memorial of the national soldiers , national police memorial .

Man Ki Bath , November 2018 .
On the 3rd of October, 2014, on the day of Vijayadashmi Festival, Mann Ki Baat programme was started.
Our Mann Ki Baat Dharmahik safari fulfils fifty years of our journey.
That is why this is our Golden Jubli Apsod i . . Italy Man Ki Bath Festival .
This time the phone calls from all of you, north and north also proposes to identify this Golden Festival.
Shri Anshu Kumar of Delhi, Amar Kumar, Patna-Vikas Yadav, Mr.
They ask what they ask , people say that the technology of technology technology , social media is the medium of social media , mobile ypnotise is the person who plays mobile ypnotise .
But why did you choose radio between people to meet people
I will tell you a story .
This was in 1998 .
I am a member of the Indian Janta Party that is working in Himachal Pradesh.
The couple of ' Bharat ' is called the bomb of the country .
I don't mean anything." I mean.
Then he said , Behold , listen to radio , radio has been discussed on the same thing .
Since then our prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayi came forward , told that the international test was done on that day , how much of this tea was smitten in radio .
It was estimated that radio was estimated .
After I became the prime minister it is natural to turn my eyes towards the most powerful medium .
Fade Back coming in this survey is very interesting .
How extensive discussion has also been done about the positivity of Puja .
This is an example of the point of view of social , positive emotional feelings situated in the minds of all our country .
Because of the program of Mann Ki Bath the feeling of voluntary service i . . voluntary service has also increased some experiences .
People are coming forward at a big height for social service . This is a change .
Because of the program of Man Ki Bath I am very happy to change radio more favorite to people .
The north , online expansions , phones , phones , in all these the objects of the objects are clearly visible .
Modi comes , he goes , but this country remains stable and our culture remains alive .
All these small stories of 130 crore people of the country remain alive forever .
All these give new inspiration to this country , how does the highest peaks with new enthusiasm .
My experiences also participate with water as well .
After that gradually this thing comes towards a change by buying the sugar of house , social meditation , vatsop .
Sometimes even the Prime Minister of Phone Calculations gets the opportunity to make his households stronger.
Can any government be able to fulfil the selfiewithdaughter propaganda from a small village in Haryana and also from abroad
Many times the monastery has also become the victim of monastery but in my mind all the people of 130 crore country remain at any time .
My mind is of all them .
Man Kei Bath is not the word of the government , this is the word of the society .
Mann Ki Baat is a spiritual India, a revered India.
There is a kind of spirituality in your question .
The biggest glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious gloriously .
If you want to answer your question easily then there is nothing to make .
Absolutely a very easy job for me.
Every time the north of the people comes in front of the Manki Bath .
In My Gau, Narendra Modi Mobile Yap, people share their thoughts as well as a toll free number 1800117800.
People done this November record their message with their throat .
More north , more expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive attempts to read themselves .
I will hear myself at a lot of phone calls.
Do not fall near the Mann Ki Bath program , in the time of my journey I read how permanently .
Every moment all the people of my country are in my mind . Therefore who read the north , the conditions of north , their emotions become part of my thoughts .
This north is not only the piece of Kaiti .
In reality things that is , the name of the village , person etc . keeps mouth of the descriptions .
I thank all those who participated in the Mann Ki Baat, I thank all those who participated in the Mann Ki Baat.
Their north , expansions are not able to read , then again the number of people sending northern , trade is in lakhs .
An attempt is also made to bring in unparalleled norths, information and related areas in the Mann Ki Baat.
I also thank all my colleagues in the medium of radio , far-off darshan , remaining TV channels , social media .
Because of their tribulation Man Kei Bath reached most people .
Akashwani Vrindra Bandhan has been published in many languages .
Some people are listening to the sound of the sound near the throat of Modi throat in the province language as well .
Similarly they are changing the Nrandra Modi along with those three minutes .
All of you also want to hear the program of Mann Ki Bath in your language .
It is believed that everybody has been done about themselves , or the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically .
But the media has changed many things proposed in Mann Ki Baat .
Cleanliness, Road Safety, Drugs Free India, selfie with daughter etc.
If you do not support then my journey of this monkey was incomplete .
"Thank you so many more for your phone call.
If you want to say the truth then there is no secret with me .
We do not stop the old things of our own life , it is easy to understand anyone before .
Sometimes our paralysis gives the biggest obstruction to the conferences .
Not confessing , not confessing , trying to understand something instead of every activity is my first importance .
I keep trying to talk with the youth in various programs or social meditation .
I am trying to understand that they do , I am trying to understand .
The question of youth is very good .
They're experts in multi-tasking.
If we pay attention to our neighbourhood then social enterprise ina, startups or any other kind of change in the society.
Does the youth adventurously dare to meet big dreams
If we bring young thoughts to the ground , give them freedom to express them then they can bring social changes in the country .
My dear countrymen, I would like to talk about the day of the state going to Mann Ki Baat tomorrow i. e.
It is very special today because we are asking the state in the seventieth year by adopting the state .
Blessed is the blessedness of your information .
In the depth of three years all of us had given us such an expansive , expansive state .
The sea shore built with an extraordinary speed is also an example of Time management cool , producing cycle .
This also inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities during record .
It is a combination of the great personalities of the country that the people of the country are empowered and the people of the country are also empowered.
About Hakulu , responsibilities we described in our state that is the speciality of our state .
Both of these combinations take the country forward in the lives of the people of the country.
On the completion of 60 years of the state of India in 2010 , we swimmed on the elephant of the state in Gujarat .
In order to increase the best state in youth , to encourage their state it is an attempt to remember that it has been done in the state .
In the year 2020, we will complete 70 years in the form of a Republic and we will complete 70 years of our independence in 2022.

Guru Nanak Dev Garhwal was always along with the category of people .
He had seen the way of truth , Karma , service , mercy , self-confidence .

All the state governments , central governments have to celebrate this festival gloriously .
Similarly 550 Jayant Festival of Guru Nanak is celebrated in all the countries of the world .
Along with this a special train is also run by connecting all the sacred places related to Guru Nanak Giri .
I was reminded of the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Sahib when I attended a meeting related to it.
Due to the earthquake coming in 2001 the Gurudwara also got injured rapidly .
But the state government , associated with local people , this is an example of the resurrection of Gurudwara .
The Government of India has taken a major decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the tourists of our country can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak Ji in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
Come , let us move ahead this journey .

Six and a half months before independence, on 27 January 1947, an international journal "Time Magazine" was published on the journal 'Time Magazine'.
The journal in its lead store has given the status of an India.
But it is not like the falling of India .
It is the falling of India divided into many parts .
There were approximately 550 national institutions in the country .
The interest of the English decreased in India but they wanted to go to India by pieces of pieces .
Time magazine has also made other stores of the life of man in his business .
It has been told that in the floods coming in Ahmedabad in 1920 how he was organised , how Bardoli museum was guided .

All this India bound with the Ikta Sutra , seeing our Bharatmata we remember the Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel directly .

My favorite country , sports , nobody likes .
Sports , strength , expertise , capacity - all these are main .
These are the guides of a game .
How important is the construction of any country of these four qualities .
The country which has all these qualities in the youth of the country , not only the economic , scientific , technological development of that country but also brings its victory in the cream .
Italy has been a collection of two times .
Firstly, in the Asian Para Games 2018, we got the opportunity to meet our para athletes.
In these sports, our para athletes have enhanced India's pride in creating a record by studying a total of 72 talents.
These parts have got the fortune of meeting para athletes themselves.
Similarly, the opportunity to meet the summer yatth olympics 2018 in Argentina.
You would be glad to know that our youngsters have exhibited their reputation more than ever before in the Yutth Olympics 2018.
In these competitions, our country has won three other medals apart from the Thirteenth MICS event.
This time in Asia cricket also our country will remember all of you .
See how many times in a few minutes I am more than this , which is more important than this .
India is not only in the playground but also in the way we have never imagined India's new records.
In order to lead a life without coming out of the office, he did the work of cleaning DTC buses, watering in Dhabal on the roadside in Delhi.
At the same time Narayan is participating in the international competitions , golden objects of India .
Not only this , see the capacity of increasing in India sports .
India has never achieved any Olympic measure in both Junior Level Vehicles and Senior Level Vehicle in Judo.
But in the Europe Olympics the history of Tababi Devi has created the history of silver .
Sixteen youth player Tababi Devi resides in a village of Manipur .
If the father goeth to the cooling , then the mother ' s fish was sold .
Many times there were no money for food in their house .
In such situation also the courage of Tababi Devi has not been lessened .
The history has created the neck for the country .
Every youngster, he is a recognition of Sports New India.
My beloved countrymen, you all remember that in 2017 FIFA U17 World Cup was organised successfully.
The most successful tournament gives the world to the world .

More than twelve lakh stadiums from different places of the country and more than twelve lakh stars enjoyed those football competitions , encouraged the youth games .
This year, India got the fortune of hockey World Cup 2018 at Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Complex starts from 28 November and December 16 December .
Any kind of sports playing Indian or some sports activity Indian hockey is definitely interesting .
There is a golden history of India in Haki game .
The magnificence of Haki Mantra is known worldwide about Major meditation .
After that Balwindar Singh Sinier , Leslie Claudius , Mohammad Shahid , Udham Singh has decided a very big journey from Dhanraj to Dhanraj .
These are giving inspiration to new waves playing games with their industry , handicrafts with their industry .

Watching the hockey matches while going to Bhubaneswar yourself enjoy your sports .
Many people are coming forward voluntarily to organise social programs of my beloved country and everybody is also inspired by the people of the country .
We will be able to see this legacy everywhere in the society and everywhere in the society that has come to power in thousands of years.
But in this new age , new generations are coming forward to do this work with new enthusiasm , new hopes , new dreams .
Its name is 'self 4 societies', Myov, and the IT, electronic instrumentary in the country, that they should not motivate their workers to carry out social programs, so that they could not give them the right opportunity to do this portal.
To organise this program all Indians pride on seeing the enthusiasm , devotions seen throughout the week .
From IT to society, I don't, we don't, we don't have a pride, it's the journey of crossing Samiti.
Some children read , some elders are reading .
Some paying attention to cleanliness , some helps the rails .
Behind all these there is no self-confidence . only the emotional emotional emotional emotionality .
A young man himself learned wheelchair basketball to help the wheelchair basketball team.
Mission mode activity i . . this interest is the feeling of dedication .
Definitely becomes pride .
The spirit of 'No, we' inspires all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time, if I look at your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I have seen an interesting reference to Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pondicherry.
What is in his Magau , he said , 'Bharatti Gijan traditions , customs , nature along with nature , how important example you should say in the program of Man Ki Baat .'
Mansh Garu , such thing has been impossible for proposing you before the surface of Mann Ki Bath .
It is a good opportunity to inspire us to look back to our glorious culture and past that these are being discussed to protect the environment of the world, especially the western countries.
Our India also faces this problem .
For its result we should take the pill once in ourselves and see our history , traditions once again .
Especially we should know the lifestyle of our tribals that being embraced with nature is in the culture of our tribals.
Our tribal brothers worship the trees , trees , fruits and goddesses .
The tribals of Bhilwara residents of Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh region of Madhya Pradesh worship the trees of Ravi , Arjun .
In the desert area like Rajasthan Vishnoi society has seen how they should do environment conservation .
Especially in the matter of preserving trees they are ready to make their life soldiers but one tree does not harm .
It is believed that the Mishmi pestilence of Arunachal Pradesh is related to tigers .
The tigers are considered to be their garden .
In Nagaland also tigers are protected from forests .
In the bridging season of Central India, the people of Gonda stop fishing in some areas of the Cathon river.
Adivasis make their homes with natural materials which will not only strengthen but also facilitate publicity.
In South India a small cutting of smoke residing in the solitary areas of Nilgiri Peeth in the south India is made with small things found in their own place .
It is true that my beloved brothers and sisters , the tribal tribes believe that they are living peacefully with one another , but if someone harms their natural jungles then they are not afraid of fighting for their rights .
My beloved countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we would recognise the people who have done extraordinary work for the society.
Seeing small , it has a very deep effect on those tasks .
I read about Gurubachan Singh of Punjab for some days .
A common returbance of labouring was married to the son of Gurubachan Singh .
Before this marriage Guru Bachan had married the parents of the parents of the parents , but I was a Sherut .
But all of you will be surprised to hear a simple driver asked Gurubachan , that is the true strength of our society .
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh is such an example in front of us .
I read about Kallar Majra another small village near Nabha of Punjab .
Why did this village come to the churches of Kallar Majra , where the people there instead of burning the cereals in the field instead of burning the cereals , they are covered inside the soil , how much technology is necessary for it .
My brother Gurubachan Singh is my opinion .
To keep the environment clean for the people of Kallar Majra , to keep the environment clean .
Your clean lifestyle is moving ahead in the reality of Indian tradition .
If drops , drops are included then small precautions , good tasks , social tasks , always play an extremely important role in making the environment of social environment .
We will establish peace everywhere in life, in the heart, in thee, in every part of the world.
The 11th honey coming to India is special because the first world war of November 1111 was completed .
The end of the war was completed , when the heavy destruction occurring , people completed a century .
First world war is a major incident of India .
If we want to say properly then we have no relation with unconscious war .
Although our soldiers were fighting with so much virtue , how big role was played , most sacrifices were given .
On coming to war Indian soldiers had seen the world to take them away .
In rare places , poisonous conditions also our soldiers have seen their courage .
The only purpose behind all these is to restore peace.
In the first world war the world has seen the destination of the world .
According to estimates approximately one fort soldiers , other fort people had lost their lives .
That is why peace is known as the world .
The meaning of peace in the last dam has changed into the same way .
It is peaceful , sadness meaning not only the war is not happening .
Change in the environment from acute pain , economic development has to change the social judgment of social judgment .
Nirodh is the true signal of the development of the person .
My beloved country , our north-eastern states are different .
The natural beauty of this place is supposed to be very different from the people here .
This award, which gives you for best policy packing in this hole, is similar to that hole with Oscars.
Besides this our Sikkim had discovered this archaeologist to cross fifty naminated milk from twenty five countries .
This is why I told the people of Sikkim many opinions .
My beloved country , October has become October .
Many changes are coming in the environment as well .
At the same time the weather of festivals has also come . Dhan Terracotta , Deepavali , Bhaiya Duj , Chhat . if the month of November is the month of festivals .
All these festivals of the country are many hustle-bustles .
I want all of you to keep in mind your health along with your safety in these festivals .
To make new decisions also these festivals give opportunity .
With a mission mode, I would like to change these festivals into an opportunity for you to move ahead in your life.
Your development is an important part of the country's development.
If you have developed so much that the country will progress as much as the country .
Your everyone is my many luxury .
