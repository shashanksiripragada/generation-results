Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Enemy intellectual destruction Deepajyotirnamostte
I bow down to such Divyangjans.
What could be a better idea to remember this blasphemy, to spread positivity and to wipe out the feeling of hostility
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community participates in it but now the governments of many countries, its citizens and its social organizations celebrate Diwali with full fervor.
In a way, India realizes that.
Friends, Festival tourism was an attraction in the world.
Our India, which is a country of festivals, has tremendous potential for festival tourism.
We should strive to involve people from other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals by spreading such festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal and Bihu.
We have so many festivals in every state, in every region that people from other countries have a lot of interest in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in increasing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, it was certain that we would do something different during this Diwali.
I had said - let all of us celebrate this Diwali as the women power of India and the achievements of all three, i. e.
And immediately after that, innumerable inspirational stories began to emerge in the social media.
In Warangal, Kodipka Ramesh wrote on Namo App that my mother is my strength.
When my elders died in 1990, my mother took up the responsibility of five children.
Today we have five brothers in good business.
Ramesh ji, my greetings to our mothers
Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for him Major Khushboo Khushboo Khushboo Khushboo Khushboo is India's Laxmi who is a bus driver and he led all the women teams of Assam Rifles.
Kavita Tiwari ji and Lakshmi ji of India are his daughter, who is also his strength.
They are proud that their daughters do good paintings.
He has also achieved a very good category in the CLAT examination.
Megha Jain writes that a 92 year old woman provides free water to travellers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Meghaji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of Laxmi in India.
Many such stories have been told by the people.
You must take inspiration and do something similar in your surroundings.
I salute all these Laxmis of India.
My dear countrymen, Sanchi Honma, a well-known poet of the 17th century, wrote a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
Similarly, the words that we are talking about every Laxmi of India, the foundation of it was laid in the 17th century itself.
How beautiful words, how beautiful emotions and how excellent ideas are there in these poems of Kannada.
Our daughters, these are our pride and because of the glory of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and the future is bright.
My dear countrymen, November 12, 2019 is the day on which 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
The influence of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but in the whole world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters have settled in many countries of the world who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget my visit to Vancouver and Tehran's Gurudwara.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can tell you but it will take several parts of Mann Ki Baat.
He has always placed the spirit of service at the top.
Guru Nanak Devji believes that there cannot be any value for the selfless service.
He stood firm against social evils such as untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji has conveyed his message to the world far and wide.
He was one of the most travellers of our time.
And wherever he went, he won the hearts of everyone with his simple nature, humility and simplicity.
Guru Nanak Devji undertook several important religious voyages, which are called sadness.
Conveying the message of goodwill and equality, he visited the people, saints and sages everywhere, be it the north or the south or the east or the west.
It is believed that the famous saint Shankardev of Assam had also inspired him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
While travelling to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water there.
In Bidar, there is a famous place called Guru Nanak Jira Saheb, which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Dev Ji who constantly reminds us of.
During a depression, Guru Nanak ji travelled north, Kashmir and surrounding areas.
This established a strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also went to Tibet where people considered him Guru.
He is also revered in Uzbekistan where he had gone.
During one of his depressions, he also travelled to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He stayed in the minds of millions of people who followed his teachings and are still doing it.
Just a few days ago, the ambassadors of nearly 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
He visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar, and this event marked the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
All these messengers not only took a glimpse of the Golden Temple but also got an opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
Thereafter, several envoys posted their photographs on social media and wrote gloriously about good experiences.
I wish that the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji inspire us to inspire our thoughts and ideals in our lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, I believe that the 31st of October will be remembered by all of you.
This day marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India, who was the greatest enthusiast of the country.
On the one hand, Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to unite people, on the other hand, he was able to match those who had ideological disagreements.
Sardar Patel also looked at small things in depth and watched them.
In the true sense, he was the Man of Details who urges the pen.
At the same time, he was a master of organisational skills.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from across the country would participate in the Congress Session in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the systems of the session.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
It was decided that no one would have water shortage.
Moreover, he was supposed to visit a delegate's luggage or pair of shoes at the convention site.
He urged the farmers to make Khadi pipelines.
The farmers produced such pigeons and sold them to the representatives.
Wearing our shoes in these bags and keeping those bags with us, the pressure of the representative to steal the bag.
On the other hand, Khadi sales have grown significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
They did a very important job in determining the fundamental rights, so that there was no discrimination based on caste and sect.
Friends, As the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done a great bhagirath and historic work to unite the institutions.
Sardar Vallabhbhai ji had this unique feature that he looked at every incident.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, he was discussing about certain regions in the integration of the country.
He told Mudaliar brothers, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar and Arcot Laxmanaswamy Mudaliar that he should take the people of Travancore and travel there immediately and tri-color there, and the first tricolor should be fluttered in Lakshadweep.
The tricolor was fluttered immediately after his orders and the neighbouring country's mindset of Lakshadweep was washed away.
After the incident, Sardar Patel said that he should personally assure that Lakshadweep will get every necessary support for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly to India's progress.
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope you will travel to these beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, the statue of unity that was built in the memory of Sardar Saheb on 31st October 2018 was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the world's tallest statue.
The effigy of freedom fighters in America is twice the height.
The tallest statue in the world fills every Indian with pride.
Every Indian is respected by the Garvans.
You will be glad that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists went there to see the statue of unity.
This means that everyday 8,500 people will see the magnificence of the statue of unity.
He expressed his heartfelt devotion to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and now there are several attractive centres of attraction such as Select Garden, Phulpakhuru Garden, Wildlife Sanctuary, Childrens Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery etc.
Considering the convenience of the tourists coming, the people of many villages are providing such facilities in their homes and in their homes.
Professional training is also being imparted to those who provide homeless amenities at home.
I am sure that the people there have started the farming of dragon fruits and will soon become the main source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, the effigy of unity can be a subject of study.
We are all witnesses to the fact that how a place was developed in a year as a world famous tourist destination.
People from India and abroad come there.
Several facilities like transportation, locomotives, guides, environmental supplementation are being developed automatically.
There is a huge economic upheaval and people are facilitating it as per the requirements of passengers.
The government is playing its role.
Friends, Last month, the effigy of unity in the 100 important tourist destinations of the world has been at the forefront of this place.
I hope that all of you will take some time out of your valuable time to see the statue of unity.
However, I urge that every Indian who takes time to travel should travel at least 15 tourist destinations in India along with his family and wherever he goes, he will stay at night.
Friends, As you are aware, 31st October is celebrated every year since 2014 as National Unity Day.
This day gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country by giving us any price.
On 31st October, every year, Run for Unity - Unity Run is being organized.
This will involve people from all walks of life, from all walks of life.
Run for Unity is a symbol of the fact that this country is one, moving in one direction and achieving a goal.
However, if we look at it nowadays, people see a verse and a verse about marathon.
Run for Unity is also such a fast-paced facility.
We are also running here for Fit India and also for Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
And because of this, not only the body but also for the unity of the mind and culture of India, we have to take India to new heights.
You can get information about the Run for Unity around you in the city where you live.
In the portal, the Run for Unity is being organised across the country.
All of us will run on 31st October for Indias unity and for our own well-being.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has made the country united.
This mantra of unity is like a value in our lives and we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every juncture, at every juncture, at every juncture in a country full of diversity like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and consistent in empowering the unity and harmony of the country.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court had given its verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi.
It was a day to remember what was the atmosphere.
How many people had come to the plains.
How the interest groups used to play games to take advantage of the situation.
What kind of language was being used to fever the environment .
Attempts were also made to fill in different voices.
On the one hand, everything was there to fever the atmosphere for two weeks but when the decision was taken in the Ram Janmabhoomi then the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all communities and saints gave a very moderate response.
Trying to reduce the stress in the environment.
But I still remember that day.
These things should always be kept in mind and they give us a lot of strength.
This is an example of how unity gives strength to the country.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated on 31st October.
I pay my homage to the nation today.
My dear countrymen, today some story can be heard from far off places in the households, every village can hear a story. The story of cleanliness is being heard in every corner of India from north to south, east to west.
Every individual, every family, every village wants to share its pleasant experience in terms of cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is the effort of 1. 25 billion Indians.
125 crore Indians are also the owners of their results.
But there is also a pleasant and entertaining experience .
If I hear, if I ask you, please tell me.
You can imagine that the world's highest battlefield, i. e.
The air is called life-saving .
In such a difficult situation, staying in such challenges is no less than a bravery.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country but also running the Clean Siachen Campaign.
I compliment the countrymen for this remarkable commitment of the Indian Army.
I express gratitude.
Its so cold that even some disruptions are difficult.
In such a situation, segregation and management of waste is an important task.
In such a scenario, 130 tons of waste from glaciers and adjoining areas and that too in such a degraded environment, is such a huge service.
We all know that Siachen is a part that is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, running a cleanliness drive here means ensuring clean water for those who live in the lower areas and also utilizes the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyak.
My dear countrymen, the festival is a new ecstasy festival in all our lives.
And in Diwali, especially in every family, there is a need to buy something or the other from the market.
The more we try to purchase local goods, the greater the 150th Gandhi will be.
And I would urge you to buy something that was made by the hands of our weavers and the hands of our Khadiwala.
In this Diwali too, you must have purchased a lot before Diwali.
But there will be a lot of people who would be thinking that if they go after Diwali then they will get a little cheaper.
There would have been a lot of people who would still have been buying.
While congratulating Deepawali, I would like to urge you to purchase local goods.
See how Mahatma Gandhis dream can play an important role.
But sometimes there is a fire that remains unconscious.
Somewhere wounds occur .
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Every Indian, be it any region, caste, religion, creed or language, is always ready to express his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion Indians celebrated Parakram Parv.
We recalled the target of 2016, when our soldiers reacted sufficiently to those who fought against terrorism.
Our Armed Forces and Exhibitions have been put up in different parts of the country so that the maximum number of people of the country, especially the younger generation, can understand their strengths.
We will be able to know how capable we are and how we protect our countrymen by putting our soldiers on the verge of life.
On the occasion of Parakram Parv, I remind the youth of the glorious legacy of our Armed Forces and inspire us to maintain the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
It is certain that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to those who are trying to wipe out the atmosphere of peace and progress in our country.
We believe in peace and we are committed to encouraging it but we are not able to reconcile ourselves with respect and at the cost of the sovereignty of the country.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
This was a bravery of our soldiers towards peace.
Even today, India is one of the countries that send more and more troops to the United Nations Expeditionary Peacekeeping Forces.
Over the decades, our soldiers have played an important role in ensuring peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, the story of the sky is different.
One of the emotions of the people in the Republic Day programme is the Fly Paste in which our air force selects its capabilities by exhibiting pretty windows.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the air warriors and their families who have served the nation.
In 1947, when the Pakistani attacker launched an indirect attack, the Air Force itself ensured that Indian soldiers and materials would reach the battlefield in time to defend Srinagar.
The Air Force responded to the enemy in 1965.
Who does not know the freedom struggle of Bangladesh in 1971
The Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from fugitives in 1999.
On Tiger Hill, he was dumped by air force during the night at the enemy base.
Whether it is relief and rescue operations or disaster management, the country is grateful for the commendable performance of these brave hearts of our Air Force.
Their task of tackling natural calamities and helping the countrymen is amazing.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of each of our departments for the girl child.
Now the air force is giving an alternative to the 'Permanent Commission' along with the Short Service Commission, which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
India can proudly say that in our Armed Forces, women power is contributing in the same way as manpower.
Women are not only empowered but they are also getting armed.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, one of our officers in the navy, Abhilash Tommy, was bowing down to life and death.
The entire country was worried about how to save them.
You all are aware that Abhilash Tomy is a brave officer.
He is the first Indian officer to travel to the world by taking a small name from any modern technology.
For the past 80 days, he was moving ahead at sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean. However, the cyclonic storm struck him.
I pray for the good health of Abhilash Tomy and that will inspire the young generation of our country with the courage, valour and determination to win.
My dear countrymen, little children are also aware of the significance of 2nd October for our country.
On 2nd October this year, there is another special significance.
Two years from now, we are going to organize several programmes across the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhis ideas inspired the entire world.
Whether it is Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela, the great genius, everyone gained strength from Gandhian thoughts and fought for a long time to give our people the right to equality and dignity.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss another important work of revered Bapu which more and more people should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
Thereafter, in 1945, when the freedom struggle was undertaken, he revised these ideas.
Respected Bapu placed his thoughts before the countrymen on issues such as protecting the rights of farmers, villages, labourers, spreading cleanliness and education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a public collector.
It was his nature to connect people, to mix with them.
Everyone must have experienced the uniqueness of his past.
He gave this experience to everyone that that person is the most important and absolute requirement for the country.
The biggest contribution of freedom fighters is that they made this struggle a mass movement.
Responsive to Mahatma Gandhis call for the freedom struggle, people from all walks of life, from all walks of life, from all walks of life, from all walks of life, from all walks of life.
Bapu gave you an inspirational mantra.
Can he gain control over his life and destiny
Whether it will provide Swaraj to crores of people, who are hungry and whose soul is unhappy...
Then you will find that your apprehensions have started decreasing and your ego has started to finish.
My dear countrymen, even today a mantra of Gandhiji is equally important.
Today, the middle class is growing in the country, the growing economic power of the middle class, the rising purchasing power of the people, can we remember Bapu Ji for a moment
Who would be lucky, whose purchase would benefit directly or indirectly...
I would be delighted to be among the poorest of the poor.
Keeping this mantra of Gandhiji in mind, while celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji in the days to come, you must keep in mind that whatever kind of country should be built because of your purchases.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I believe that this small step of ours can transform the lives of the poorest and the weakest.
But it was achieved that India got independence.
Similarly, today we can feel that this small task of mine can also contribute to the economic progress of my country, economic empowerment and the poor to fight poverty.
In today's era, this is the true patriotism, this is the work of revered Bapu.
He said that all these Khadi clothes have been made very hard, and every thread should be used.
The feeling of intimacy towards the country and affection towards the countrymen was different from that of the childhood gentleman.
Two days later, along with the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri ji.
With the name of Shastri ji, the feeling of indomitable faith emerges in the minds of the people of India.
His gentle personality is always a matter of pride for every countryman.
The specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he looked very humble from outside but he was determined to be a mountain.
The announcement of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is a recognition of his immense personality.
It was the result of his selfless penance towards the nation that in the short span of about one and a half years, he gave a mantra to the soldiers and farmers of the country to scale new heights of success.
My dear countrymen, if we remember the revered Bapu today then it is natural that we will not live without talking about cleanliness.
The Swachhata Hi Seva campaign was launched from 15th September.
Millions of people participated in it and I got the good fortune of labouring with the students of Ambedkar School, Delhi.
I went to the school where the foundation stone was laid by Baba Saheb himself.
People from all walks of life participated in the Shramdaan on the 15th of this month.
Hririri also participated in the event.
School students, college students, NCC, NSS, youth organisations, media groups, private enterprises, all have done a lot of Swachhta Shramdaan.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these Swachhata lovers.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a successful story not only in the country but in the entire world.
On this occasion, India is organizing the largest Global Sanitation Convention in history, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
The Swachhta Ministers and experts from all over the world are collectively experiencing their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will conclude on 2nd October 2018 with the commencement of 150th Birth Anniversary of Bapu.
My dear countrymen, in Sanskrit, there is a saying: "Justice, self-governance, justice is at the root of Swaraj, when justice is discussed then the spirit of human rights is inherent in it.
This is especially essential for the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited, the deprived and the underprivileged.
The Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar provides for the protection of the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was set up on October 12, 1993.
The NHRC will complete 25 years in a few days.
NHRC has worked towards enhancing human dignity along with the protection of human rights.
Our beloved leader, former Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clarified that human rights are not a different concept for us.
The symbol of our National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has been depicted in the Vedic era.
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing abuse.
In this 25-year journey, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
I believe that this is a promising thing for a healthy society and for a better democratic value.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up along with the National Level Human Rights Act.
As a society, there is a need to understand the significance of human rights and behave in a manner that is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
Even this year, with your efforts, organise the Run for Unity in your village, city and metropolis.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb for unity because he worked for unity throughout his life.
I urge all of you to strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society through the 'Run for Unity' on 31st October.
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you for Navratri, Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today, the festival of Rakhi Purnima is being celebrated across the country.
I convey my best wishes to all my countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
Rakshabandhan is celebrated as a symbol of love and trust between sisters and brothers.
Janmashtami will also be celebrated soon.
The hailstorms like Hathi, Ghoda, Palaki-Jai Kanhaiyalal, Govinda-Govinda will be spread everywhere.
The joy of going in the color of Lord Krishna is different from that .
Smt. Adiya Sanskrit Dinamasti
Sanskrit languages like Sarala etc.
Brothers and sisters, Along with Rakshabandhan, Shravan Purnima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
At the same time, we are proud that from time immemorial to the present, Sanskrit language has played an important role in the propagation of knowledge.
In Sanskrit language and literature in this language, there is a lot of knowledge about every field of life.
Moreover, there is a detailed reference to the mantras of todays global problem to the challenge of rapid growth in Sanskrit language.
You will be happy to know that residents of Mattur village in Shivamoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit language to speak.
You will be surprised to know that a special feature of Sanskrit language can create new words in this language.
How important is Guru Namka in life , it is said in Subhasita that one-time Akshramastu , Guru Shishya Prabodhya .
My dear countrymen, the rainy season brings a new hope for our hardworking farmer brothers.
This is a boon for the sandy, dry trees and dry reservoirs due to extreme heat.
But after some time this very rain brings devastating, catastrophic Mahapura .
Rainfall at most places with heavy falls at isolated places over the country.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural calamity improve their nature at the earliest.
But we also see the philosophy of humanity in times of crisis.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everybody can do whatever is possible at their own level, whether it is a disaster in Kerala or in any other district of India.
They did their best to save the lives of people stuck in floods.
Whether it is the air force or the navy or the naval or the army, the BSF, the CISF, the RAF and the Army have played a very important role in the rescue and relief operations.
We pray that in this holy period of Onam, the country, particularly Kerala, gets the strength to come out of this crisis as soon as possible and that the development journey of Kerala gets a boost.
Once again, on behalf of all the countrymen, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and the people of Kerala who have faced such a severe drought in the country that the entire country is with us.
For the last ten years, he had gone far from active politics.
But after 16th August, the country and the world saw that even after 10 years of age, Atal ji had immense affection.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This transformation has brought about two major changes in India's politics.
First of all, the size of the Cabinet of States has been restricted to 15 of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limit prescribed under the Parties Act was one-third, it was increased to two-thirds.
In addition to this, a clear direction has also been fixed to ensure that the members who have been partisans are not eligible.
Atal ji was a loyal patriot.
During his tenure, the time for the country's budget was changed in the House.
In the year 2001, Atal ji changed the time for introduction of Budget in Parliament to Akkar.
Some of the rules of the Code enabled the tricolor to flutter in public places.
It gave more and more Indians the opportunity to flag our national flag.
Atal ji has done a great job to bring our favourite Tricolor closer to the common man.
In this regard, somebody, as a protester, is asking for your opinion.
He saw that by reiterating his resolve to fulfil the dream of a prosperous and developed India, I pay my tributes to all of you, Atal ji.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and Rajya Sabha was 74.
The Act will further safeguard the interests of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had pronounced the sentence for only five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
In Rajasthan, the courts there have been quick decisions on the issues of atrocities against women in a similar manner.
The Act will play a pivotal role in preventing the atrocities committed against women and children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
In this Monsoon Session of Parliament, all the members have come together with an ideal Goods and Services Tax.
Today, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country for this thing.
My dear countrymen, today the attention of millions and millions of Indians is being drawn to the Asian Games in Jakarta.
The Asian Games are still on.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
The number of medal winners for the country has gone up, particularly those who are participating in it give a very positive signal.
Take care of your health as it is a healthy, healthy country that can build a prosperous and prosperous India.
Namaste Spirit, I respect your feelings.
Everybody is amazed to see the "ueen Ki Baw" built in the eleventh century at Patna in Gujarat.
The land of India will be called as a laboratory of engineering.
Several engineers in India have brought out these things that are not only possible in their imagination but also in their imagination.
We have received such a gem in our tradition that shares the legacy of great engineers.
This is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
Visvesvaraya.
The Krishnaraj Sagar Dam which he built on the Kaveri River still benefits lakhs of farmers and the common man.
In Kutch, it is called Bhunga.
My households have seen and experienced 3 earthquakes.
I myself have experienced three earthquakes in this house.
But go inside and see, you don't see any damage.
This house has been built by our ancestors in accordance with the geographical composition and the environment here.
After seeing that house, I was contemplated that even before ages, the engineers of that period had thought about the local situation and had constructed it in accordance with the local situation so that the common man could be safe.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers Day, we must also think about the future.
Workshops should be taken at some places.
What new things should we learn in the changing times
What things should people learn
How to connect
Nowadays, disaster management has been a big task.
The entire world has to face natural calamities.
How can we have a new form of structural engineering
How can it be different courses
What should the student class learn in this
Several such things should be considered when the Engineers Day is celebrated.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of celebrations.
At the same time, preparations for Diwali will also start.
You will be meeting in Mann Ki Baat and will keep on talking about it.
At the same time, we will be working to take our country forward with all our hearts.
With this feeling, my best wishes to you all.
The citizens of some parts are still waiting for Varunraj.
India is vast and there is diversity in it, but in this country, the kingdom of Varun sometimes shows its favourite dislike.
In such a scenario, the most important responsibility is that we all should be nature-loving, nature-loving and nature-friendly.
If we become a nature-friend then the balance of nature-oriented things will automatically be achieved.
You must have seen this incident on television.
Actually it takes usually a few hours to return back after entering that cave .
Now it is not possible to come out, these kids have taken shelter at a slight height in the cave.
However, they did not stay for a few days, but the Tabal stayed within 18 days.
Now you can imagine that when a person dies in front of him, he will have a moment in his mental state.
On the one hand, these children were sweeping in two hands in the face of crisis and on the other hand humanity in the whole world was united and Goddess manifested human qualities.
Specially, after seeing the very restraint of everyone, I feel that this is a learning, understanding and learning quality.
Those whose daughters were stuck inside, their parents didn't feel sad or they didn't get tears from their mother.
But with patience and patience, the peaceful behavior of the entire society is very important.
In the entire mission of this assistance, a soldier from Thailand's Navy lost his life.
They showed the bravery and patience of helping those who were stuck in the cave in extremely difficult situations, full of water and darkness.
This incident demonstrated that when humanity was united, such wonderful things happen.
But for that, we need to focus only on peaceful and stable mindsets and on the goals we are working for.
A few days ago, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji left us forever.
Neeraj ji was a speciality.
He had great faith in himself along with hope, faith and determination.
Everything of Neeraj ji can be very inspiring and inspiring for all the Indians.
However, the months of July and August are very important for the farmer brothers and the youngsters.
Because there is a problem of admission to colleges during this period.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam get out of their lives and go to colleges.
The youngsters take steps on a new path of life, so that their focus is shifted from questioning to cut-off.
The focus of the students is now on the hostel from the house.
Students have come out of the umbrella of their parents and have come under the umbrella of their professors.
I am sure that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about the beginning of college life.
For the first time you have to leave your homes and leave your village and go to the other side. You have to go out of a safe environment and become yourself.
Many youngsters have left their homes for the first time to give a new direction to their lives.
I would like to tell all of you that stay calm and enjoy this life.
You must have to study but you must have the natural eagerness of finding new things while learning.
Old friends have a special role.
I was told that a student named Asharam Choudhary from a very poor family of Madhya Pradesh has achieved many adventurous achievements in the life of a student.
The entrance examination of MBBS for ASHARAM Jodhpurs AIIMS has been completed in the first attempt.
Similarly, Anushka Panda, a disabled person from Gurgaon, is suffering from a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy.
All of them have achieved this thing that the entire world should keep an eye on every obstacle in their determination and distress.
If we look at each other then we will see many such examples.
Any good event in any part of the country, in every corner of the country, gives me energy.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my sight fell on a news item and wrote: Two youngsters had fulfilled the dreams of Modi.
On reading the news, it was a news that how our youngsters use technology today, how smart and creative, and how they try to transform the lives of common man.
The incident was such that San Jose City in America was considered as the hub of technology and I was interacting with the Indian youth there.
At that time, I urged them to think about how you can use your wisdom and your India and take some time to renew it.
I had called for brain-drain solutions to the problem of brain-drain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Shri Yogesh Sahu ji and Shri Rajneesh Vajpayee ji accepted my call and brought out an innovative vision.
Using our professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly created a SmartGov App.
This App not only connects the people of the village to the entire world but also provides information and information on your mobile phones through this App.
Residents of Taudakpur village in Rae Bareli, Gram Pradhan Sarpanch, District Penalty, District Penalty, Chief District Officer, all have created awareness among the people about the use of this app.
Well, you say that this is a wonderful journey of Pandharpur.
Friends, This year on the 23rd of July this year, Ashadi Ekadashi is celebrated in Pandharpur with great devotion.
Pandharpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
In the footsteps of great saints like Saint Dnyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram, a warrior walks towards Mridung Bajwat Pandharpur while embracing the 'Thaun Vithal Nama' in Palkhi.
Vithal, also known as Vithoba or Pandurang, the pilgrims reach Pandharpur for their philosophy.
It is a deity that protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have tremendous faith and devotion to Panduranga.
Go to Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and describe the glory and beauty there.
Important messages of goodwill, love and brotherhood have been given from the literature of these saints.
The Saints gave the mantra to give the society the strength to fight against blind faith.
And he also worked to eradicate the old evils from the society, and to promote compassion, equality and sensitivity in the minds of people.
Lokmanya Tilak is a sea of adventure and self-confidence.
The British made an unwavering effort to prove their blame by running a sedition barrier thrice in 20 years.
This is not a simple thing.
Today, I would like to tell the countrymen that an incident related to the effigy of Lokmanya Tilak and his effigy in Ahmedabad has happened.
During that period, more than 40 thousand people were present in Ahmedabad for his reception and during this visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with Tilak Ji.
The personality of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel and Lokmanya Tilak was very impressed by the ideas.
On 1st August, 1920, when Lokmanya Tilak was convocated, Patel decided to build a memorial of Tilak Yanch in Ahmedabad.
At the end, a statue of Tilak was made and Sardar Saheb inaugurated the memorial on 28th February, 1929 by Mahatma Gandhi, not from anyone else.
My dear countrymen, this effigy is as rare as it is, Lokmanya Tilak has settled on a Khurchhi and has written 'Swaraj Hamara Janmadhi Dhara Hai' along with Tilak.
Public Ganesh Utsav became an effective medium of social awareness, collective action, harmony and equality among the people along with traditional faith and devotion.
In that case, there was a need to fight against the British in that particular period.
And because of the festivals started by Tilak, they used to go to the society and to unite everyone by breaking the walls of the communities.
The popularity of organizing these festivals has increased in Ogha during the times. It is recognised that today's younger generation is also very attractive to the heroes of our ancient traditions and history.
Today, in many cities and in almost every streets, a pavilion of Ganesh festivals is seen.
The Ganapati festival is being organized by all the families of the streets.
Even here, our youth gets a good opportunity, their leadership qualities, festival organizers, program organizers and coordinators can be developed.
From the idol of Ganeshji to the decorated things, there should be some environmental affection.
Today, every Indian needs to get good results of good governance and development.
I am talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Azad brought his life back but he never went beyond foreign rule.
I am fortunate that Chandrashekhar Azad Yanch village is located in Alirajpur, Madhya Pradesh and I got the opportunity to visit this village.
I also had the opportunity to pay my homage to Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad, who had pledged that Chandrashekhar Azad was not a brave man who had to die by the bullets of foreigners.
This was a special feature of him.
Once again I salute both the great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
A few days ago, Hima Das, a valorous daughter of India and a son of a landlord, has won a gold medal in the 400m event of the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship.
I have been sent an e-mail from Indonesia in reply to my letter by one of the country's Kanya Ekta Bhayans, who is currently preparing for the Asian Games.
In our e-mail, unity has been written that the most important moment in the life of an athlete is the moment when a player catches a tricolor in his hand.
Unity, we all feel proud of you.
We are proud of you for enlightening our country.
Unity has won gold and bronze medals in the World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 in Tunisia.
We should move forward, sports and development.
My dear countrymen, several historical events have taken place in the month of August and several festivals also take place this month, but due to the monsoon season, there is sometimes the entry of disease into the house.
Once again I will meet at Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, today I have got the good fortune of interacting with you through Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, there was a historic battle of cricket in Bengaluru.
You too must have noticed that I would like to talk about the Cricket Cricket between India and Afghanistan.
The two sides demonstrated a very good sporting performance in this fight.
Rasheed Khan, a Goldman from Afghanistan, performed well in IPL this year.
I thank our Indian friends for providing a platform to our sportspersons to showcase their skills.
Representatives of the best and best in Afghanistan.
We have experienced the sportsperson's attitude, the feeling of sportsmanship.
Sports is a very good medium for uniting the society and showcasing the skills and talents of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that in the same way we will continue to play with each other and continue to develop.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, the fourth Yoga Day was a different view.
Whether it is the European Parliament, the UN headquarters in New York or the Japanese Navy's fighter ship, people were seen performing yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic Yoga programme and I was told that women were guided by several seminars.
Indian and Chinese soldiers jointly practiced Yoga on the high altitude snow peak in Ladakh.
It is working to connect everyone by breaking the boundaries.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have gone beyond caste, religion, region, colour or gender and celebrated Yoga Day.
If people from all over the world were so enthusiasticly participating in Yoga Day programmes, then would it not be an excitement to showcase their cakes in India
Our country's security forces have performed Yoga at three places such as Army, Navy, Air Force.
Some brave soldiers performed Yoga on Paanbudi.
Some soldiers performed Yoga on the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our air warriors surprised everyone by performing Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the ground.
It should be said that he did not practice Yoga while sitting in the plane, he did Yoga in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports fields, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
Yoga has worked to unite people all over the world by crossing the boundaries of caste, creed and geographical boundaries, and since ancient times, we have come to the world with the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.
Our sages, saints and sages have always emphasized on this idea.
Today, Yoga has been demonstrated in the right way by proving it properly.
I believe that today the idea of Wellness is working as a revolution.
We see Mother as a god, mother gives birth to us, so we consider her as a god, this is our culture.
Sometimes doctors reproduce us.
The role of doctors is not limited to medication alone.
They not only funly cure but also facilitates doctors to have medical knowledge about their own lifestyle, the impact of a shali and its impact on our health is a very good and intense experience.
Indian doctors have displayed their unlimited capabilities and skills and have made their own unique identity in the world.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens on the eve of Dr.
India has a rich history.
When I was in Gujarat, when I was in Gujarat, the people of the tradition of Saint Kabir had organized a massive national session.
In the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, Saint Kabirdas had greeted Maghar.
But do you know that Kabirdas ji chose this place for a memorial
At that time, he believed that one who dies here does not find a place in heaven.
And on the contrary, those who commit suicide in Kashi go to heaven.
But Sant Kabirdas had no faith in such things.
Saint Kabirdas ji emphasized on social equality, peace and brotherhood through goodwill and friendship.
This was his ideal.
This is the ideal that we see from their creations.
This means that the person who considers the suffering of another person is the true fakir, the saint.
And those who do not know the sorrows of others, they are loyal.
Kabirdas ji had special emphasis on social harmony.
He was thinking ahead of time.
Peoples knowledge should be considered as the basis and they should be respected.
Today, even after such a long time, Kabir's words are as effective.
Today we have read and heard the words of Kabir ji. They are telling us about the facts of today's knowledge.
We can see that their thoughts are in harmony with today's times.
When we talk about Saint Kabirdas ji, I remember one of his friends, he said, "Guru Govind Dou Ghare, Kake Apply.
There is such a great Guru, Jagatguru-Guru Nanakdev.
He has shown the way to crores of people, he has been inspiring for generations.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is to serve the god.
Wherever he went, he worked for the betterment of the society.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji started the langar system in which a person from any caste, creed and sect can come and eat in such kitchens that are free from social discrimination.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
The catastrophic catastrophe in Jallianwala Bagh will be over 100 years in 2019, when the event was blackmailing the entire humanity.
Peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice are always victorious.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on his Jayanti and in today's programme, I will pay tributes to Dr.
During 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee had contributed a lot.
He was very enthusiastic and dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Let's go, let's go to Dr.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video calls.
It will be said that they have got the opportunity to go beyond the files and know about the changes in the lives of the people.
In remote and remote villages, the youngsters are providing service facility through Common Service Centres (CSCs) to the elderly people in the villages from wages to paperlessness.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister collects Sitafall and does the business of making her ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing medicines at affordable rates in the nearby villages.
I am delighted to see that the success of the common man is greater than the success of the government in this entire programme.
In such a disappointing environment, I would like to share with you the hopes, new zeal and incidents that have taken place in the lives of the common man.
The incident of childhood in a small village in remote and remote areas will also inspire 1. 25 billion Indians.
For me, a moment spent with the help of technology, interacting with the beneficiaries through video bridge has become extremely pleasant and inspiring.
It gives new joy, new zeal and inspiration to lead a life for the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge programme and they gave me a new strength.
I would like to once again express my gratitude to everyone for this thing.
On the one hand there are professionals and technologists and on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters who work in the fields.
Now you must be wondering that agriculture and technology are two different businesses, what is their relationship
Plans were being formulated and successful efforts were made to increase the income of the farmers.
On the one hand, a chain has been created from the production of crops to its marketing, in which the role of the farmer brothers is important and on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the participation of the farmers in the profits.
Friends
This work that you have done in your youth is really inspiring youngsters.
One Nation, One Tax was the dream of the people of the country.
I would like to give the most credit to the states for bringing about One Nation, One Tax reforms.
GST Cooperative Federalism is a very good example in which all the states together decided for national interest and thereafter made tax reforms possible at such a massive level in the country.
Till date, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and the meeting is attended by people with different political views.
There were 17 different types of taxation systems in the country before the GST but now only one tax system has been implemented in the country in the new system.
GST is a victory of honesty and it is also a festival of honesty.
Earlier, there were complaints regarding Inspector Raj in tax cases.
GST may be the biggest tax reform in the world.
Generally, a period of 5-7 years would have been enforced to improve such a large number of public figures and to stabilize the entire scheme in a holistic manner.
Namaskar had recently organized 21st Commonwealth Games in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
Whenever there is an environment like passion, excitement, enthusiasm, hope, aspirations and aspirations, someone can remain untouched by it.
This was the time when people from all over the country wanted to think about which sportspersons would play today.
How many medals you won, how many medals you would have achieved India and all these were very natural.
Our sportspersons also made good strides by fulfilling the expectations of the countrymen and won a medal after one.
Whether it is neembazi, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton India has achieved the best.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze: India has earned a total of 66 Medals.
Every Indian is proud of this achievement.
Winning a medal is a matter of pride and happiness for every sportsperson.
This is a moment of great pride for all the countrymen.
Perhaps my words will be reduced to express that feeling.
But I want to tell you what I have heard from these players.
This is because there were many such things that happened for the first time.
Manika Batra won medals in all the competitions she took.
She is the first Indian female sportsperson to win Indias first gold medal in the individual table tennis event.
India won the highest number of medals.
The 15-year-old Indian cinematographer, AnishBharkar, became the youngest player to win the Gold in the Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary, who won the Commonwealth Games medal, is the only Indian Para Power Lifter.
This time the sports competition was also special because most of the medal winners were female players.
Whether it is squash or boxing or weightlifting or nambaji, women sportspersons have performed well.
Everyone was anxious about this fight, both medals would be received by India.
The sportspersons from different parts of the country had come from small towns.
His friends have also contributed, who have raised their morale in every situation.
Last month in Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen, especially our youth, to Fit India and I had invited everyone.
Participate in Fit India and represent Fit India.
And I am glad that people are joining it with great enthusiasm.
Many people have written letters and have sent letters, have shared their health mantra on social media - Fit India Gatha.
A household Shashikant Bhosale has written sharing his pictures in the water conservation pond: My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written: I feel happy and healthy because of the morning walk.
And further they say - Four me - fitness comes with a smiles and we should smile, who we are happy.
There is no doubt that Devnath ji is healthy in happiness.
While sharing his photograph of Mountaineering, Dhawal Prajapati wrote, For me, Travel and Mountaineering is the Fit India.
I am very happy to see that many renowned personalities are encouraging our youth in a very attractive manner for Fit India.
Film actor Akshay Kumar has shared a video on the Twitter.
Many more youngsters have shared their experiences in Fit India.
I believe that such movements are extremely beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
One more thing I will definitely say - 'Yoga' is the name of the Fit India Movement without spending any money.
21st June is the significance of International Day of Yoga.
You will also be ready from now on.
Your city, your village, your department, your school, your college, every individual of any age - be it a man or woman, should make an effort to participate in Yoga.
Today, I would like to invite you for a new work and I have seen that many youngsters are learning something new at this time.
My young friends, I urge you to participate in a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, sports, human resource development, drinking water sector, the three-four Ministries of the Government have come together to launch the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
Students from colleges, youngsters from NCC, youngsters from NSS, youth from Nehru Yuva Kendras, those who want to do anything, those who want to participate in bringing about change in the society, want to become a part of it.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will be happy to know that those who have been the best trainees, who have worked in the colleges, who have done excellent work in the universities, all of them will be given national awards.
Moreover, the UGC will provide two credit points to the trainees who will complete this.
I once again invite students, students and youth to take advantage of this internship.
You can register on MyGov for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope that our youth will certainly succeed in this movement of cleanliness.
Let us use these vacations as an opportunity to gain a new experience.
This group of youngsters has launched a massive campaign to educate children on roads and slums.
Initially, due to the circumstances of the children who asked for a road or those who did a big job, they gave up their lives in this work.
Starting from 15 children in the nearby slums of Gita Colony in Delhi, the campaign has now reached to 2,000 children in 12 locations in the capital.
Young teachers associated with this campaign have participated in this commendable effort to bring about social change by taking two hours out of their busy daily routine.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers from the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have been a source of inspiration for the farmers of the country.
They have changed the fate not only of their own but also of our region through collective efforts.
In Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, maize or barley is supplied mainly in Mandwa, Chowlait.
He started making biscuits from this farm crop and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative society in Munnar village and have opened a factory to produce biscuits there.
Taking into account the patience of the farmers, the administration has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being distributed not only to the fifty Anganwadi centers of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani .
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has not only reached Rs. 10-15 lakhs, but it has also reduced the migration from the districts due to the employment opportunities being provided to more than 900 families.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there will be war for water in the world in the future.
Everyone speaks of this thing but isn't it our responsibility
Do we not want water conservation to be a social responsibility
Every person should have the responsibility.
Over the centuries our ancestors have demonstrated this.
He has given priority to every drop of water.
They have found new ways to save every drop of water.
Perhaps those of you who have got the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu have written a lot about irrigation systems, water conservation systems and drought management in some temples of Tamil Nadu.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will see great inscriptions everywhere.
Even today, different giants are popular as tourist destinations, but we cannot forget that these are the living evidence of the water conservation campaign of our ancestors.
In Gujarat, the queen of Adlaj and Patan has a UNESCO world heritage and its magnificence is worth seeing.
In a way Vihiri is only a water temple .
If you go to Rajasthan then you must visit Chand Vihar in Jodhpur .
This is India's largest and most famous heritage and most importantly, it is located in the areas where there is water scarcity.
April, May, June and July are the best time to harvest rain water and if we prepare it beforehand then we will get the maximum benefit.
The MNREGA fund is also used for this water conservation work.
In the last three years, everyone has made their own efforts towards water conservation and water conservation.
In addition to the MNREGA fund every year, an expenditure of about Rs. 32,000 crore has been incurred on water conservation and water management.
In terms of 2017-18, 55 of the total outlay of Rs. 64 thousand crore has been spent on works like water conservation.
In the last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted by such water conservation and water management measures.
The District Administration under MGNREGA has taken up the responsibility of large scale land and water conservation.
With the help of people from about 40 to 45 villages, the dry rivers have been revived.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, agriculture or villages, this is a big success.
I would like to say that once again, April, May, June and July, we have to take some responsibilities for water conservation.
When Mann Ki Baat is there then I get messages, letters and phone calls from all around me.
Ian Kumar Banerjee of Devitola village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal has written on MyGov that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know the philosophy of living the life of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore peacefully, beautifully and honestly.
Please discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat programme so that people can get to know about it.
I express my gratitude to all my colleagues in Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was a man of wisdom and wisdom, whose writing has made a furore on everyone.
Rabindranath was a talented, multi-dimensional person, but he was a teacher every moment.
I had a habit of composing Rabindra Sangeet on the radio early in the morning. And when I got the opportunity to compose this poem Anandalok and Agunar and Poroshmani then I got a new inspiration.
You too must have influenced Rabindra Sangeet and his poetry.
I pay my homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
The holy month of Ramzan will start in a few days.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated with full devotion and respect all over the world.
The collective purpose of everyday is that when an individual is hungry, he also realizes the boundaries of others.
When he feels himself thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings and messages of Prophet Mohammed.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood like them.
Once an individual asked the Prophets: What is good in Islam
The Prophet Saheb said, Whether you recognize them or not, to provide food to the poor and the needy and to look after everyone with equanimity.
Mohammad believed in knowledge and compassion.
They were not arrogant about anything.
He used to say that egoism defeats knowledge.
The sentimental Mohammad believed that a person is not because of his wealth but because of his sacred soul.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showcased the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds Lord Buddha of the responsibility of following the path shown by him.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, unity and fraternity.
These are human values that need the most in today's world.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar used to assert that Lord Buddha had a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Baba Saheb empowered millions of people be it dalits, oppressed, exploited or deprived through the accident.
There cannot be a bigger example of compassion.
Mercy was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha to understand the grief of the people.
It is said that the Buddhist monks traveled to different countries, taking along with them the rich thoughts of Lord Buddha and it always happens.
Throughout Asia, the legacy of Lord Buddha's teachings has been obtained.
Many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar have deepened many Buddhist traditions and Buddhist teachings. And that is why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which will connect important Buddhist destinations in Southeast Asia to important Buddhist destinations in India.
I am glad that the Government of India is a partner in the revival of several Buddhist temples, which includes the beautiful Anand Temple of Bagan in Myanmar hundreds of years ago.
Today, everywhere in the world, conflicts and human misery are seen, the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to end evil.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all those who believe in the principles of compassion and devotion to Lord Buddha all over the world.
Lord Buddha seeks blessings for the entire world so that we can fulfill our obligation to build a peaceful and kind world based on his teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Laughing Buddha, it is believed that Laughing Buddha brings good fortune, but very few people know that Smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in Indias defence history.
Now you are wondering what is the relationship between smiling Buddha and the military power of India
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 1998, atomic tests were conducted at Pokhran, Rajasthan.
Twenty years are being completed and this test was conducted on the occasion of Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
India's test was successful and thus India showed its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked in the history of India as its military strength.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world that inner strength is essential for peace.
Similarly, when we become strong as a country, we walk peacefully with everyone.
Since nuclear tests were conducted in the month of May 1998, this month is not only important for the country but it is important for the country to do so.
This incident has shown to the whole world that India's land is the land of great scientists and India can scale new heights with a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan.
When we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of 11th May, 1998, we will imbibe the mantra of 'Jai Vigyan' that Atal ji had given us for India's strength and make a solemn pledge to contribute to building a modern India, a powerful India and a strong India.
Inculcate your strength in the strength of India.
We can also get a new pleasure and a new satisfaction to take the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, please visit the next episode of Mann Ki Baat and go ahead.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ram Navami .
A few days ago, on 26th January, when all the leaders of ASEAN countries had come here, the art gallery of that country had also come along with them.
And it is a matter of great pride that most of their countries presented the Ramayana to us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are as effective and inspiring not only in India but also in ASEAN countries.
I once again convey my best wishes to you all for Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, as usual, I have received your letters, emails, phone calls and responses in large numbers.
I read what Komal Thakkar has written about the launch of Sanskrit online section on MyGov.
I read the reaction written by Shri Dhanshyam Kumar ji of Barkar village in Nalanda district of Bihar on the Narendra Modi App.
The concern that you have expressed on the depletion of ground water is of course very important.
Sriyut Shakal Shastri ji from Karnataka used the words very carefully and wrote that Ayushman Bharat is possible only when it is the land of Ayushman Bharat.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji says that I will talk about the health of the youth.
According to him, if we compare with other Asian countries, Indian youth are physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I thought that this time I will discuss health issues in detail with everyone - Strong India.
Prashant ji, the Government of India shared all those photos and videos on the same day on social media and Narendra Modi app.
Now, please lick that photo and retweet it and send it to your friends.
From Chennai, Angha, Jayesh and many others have written to me what they have thought in their minds on the gratitude cards behind the book "Exam Warrior".
Angha, Jayesh and all the other children, I would like to tell you that your letters make me feel tired of my whole day.
So many letters, so many phone calls and reactions, all of which I could read, all of which I could hear, all of these things got into my mind.
Today, even if I decide to say the same thing, I will have to say the same thing for months or months.
More and more letters have been sent to the children on this occasion.
Your planes have told me on vacations.
Animals and birds are worried about not getting water in the summer.
Farmer brothers and sisters have sent letters to the farmers regarding farming fairs and agricultural activities in the country.
Some of the awakening citizens have suggested measures for water conservation.
Since the time we have started this Mann Ki Baat through radio, I have been feeling a way and since then more and more letters come to the topics related to summer.
Pre-examination letters come to the students regarding the examination.
It means that things of mind change according to the weather and perhaps it is true that these things of our minds change the weather in some other life and why not change the weather
When I get to read in your letters how Rescue Director Ahmed Ali of Karimganj in Assam has built nine schools for poor children with the strength of his will, then I can see the indomitable will power of our country.
When I got to hear about Dr. Akit Mohan Choudhary of Kanpur, he used to go to the pavement and feed the poor and also treat them free of cost then I get the opportunity to feel the brotherhood of the country.
Several travellers travelling in their cabs helped them a lot.
An engineer girl paid her first full salary.
This has succeeded in making the efforts of Shri Saidul Laskar ji after collecting the money for 12 years.
Today, due to his determination and hard work, he has built a sickle house with a provision of about 30 beds in Punari village near Kolkata.
Today, the vision of the entire world towards India has changed.
Today, when the name of India is taken with great pride, then it is for the sake of the sons and daughters of Mother India.
ASHA- a positive atmosphere of hope, self-confidence has developed.
This self-confidence, this positivity will fulfill our resolution of a New India.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for our farmer brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Science, Lohiaji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji or Chaudhari Devi Lal ji, agriculture and farmers all over consider both of them as an integral part of the economy and common life.
At the same time, Lal Bahadur Shastri also emphasized on the protection of trees, plants and plants and better agricultural infrastructure.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh urged the farmers to use new technologies and innovations and stressed upon the need for it.
This state, which has a very small area, has achieved a great deal.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have achieved record production during 2015-16 over the last five years.
When the goals are fixed, there are determinations and the will to achieve them, they can fulfil them with their experiences.
Brothers and sisters, A major decision has been taken in this year's budget so that the farmers get the right price.
It has been decided that in the Notification, the crops will be guaranteed at least one and a half times higher than their production cost.
Once details are made, the cost of production that will be taken into account for the humidity, the wages of the labourers who work on the farm, the labour and expenses of the animals, the equipment, equipment or animals, the price of the seeds, the value of all the fertilizers used by the state government, the land revenue paid to the state government, the interest paid on the capital, the farmland is not only on the lease but also on the lease of the farmer himself or if someone works in the field then the value of his labour will also be included in the cost of production.
Besides, the work of improving the agricultural markets across the country is also going on at a comprehensive level to ensure that the farmers get proper marketing.
Efforts are being made to bring together local mandis, wholesale markets and global markets in the villages.
In order to ensure that farmers do not have to go far away from selling their produce, they are being modernized by providing the necessary infrastructure to 22,000 rural markets in the country and thereafter they will be linked to the Agricultural Income Market Committee and e-NAM platform.
That is, arrangements are being made to connect agriculture with any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is not only our pledge but also how can we bring together 125 crore citizens to pay our best wishes to Gandhiji
How should Gandhi 150 be the logo of the theme
All of you must pay a commemorative tribute to Bapu and take inspiration from him and take our country to a new height.
Today, the country has moved ahead with a traditional approach in the field of health.
Earlier it was considered that the health ministry alone had the responsibility of doing all the work related to health in the country.
But now all the Ministries and Departments, be it the Ministry of Cleanliness, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Department of Chemicals Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments, all the departments are working together for a healthy India.
Preventive health care is the cheapest and easiest solution.
This will benefit the individuals, family and society as much as we are aware of healthcare.
Besides, work is going on at a comprehensive level to set up healthcare centres across the country.
Yoga has created a new identity in the world today in the field of preventive healthcare.
The body remains healthy and strong by yoga .
Due to the commitment of all of us towards Yoga, today Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
The International Day of Yoga this year i. e.
In the last three years, people participated enthusiastically everywhere in the country and around the world in the International Day of Yoga.
This year too, we will do Yoga ourselves and inspire our entire family, friends and others to do Yoga.
We need to make Yoga more popular with new, attractive methods to children, youth and senior citizens and to women and men of every age group.
However, through the medium of television and electronic media in the country, Yoga programmes are being organised throughout the year.
But can we do some programmes that create awareness about Yoga from today to Yoga as a campaign
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga practitioner but a Yoga practitioner.
However, some people have made me a Yoga practitioner by using their innovations and have made some of the 3D animated videos of my Yoga.
I will be able to share with you this video powder that we can practice asanas and pranayama.
Today, more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country and more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
Work is underway to set up more new centres.
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to ensure that the information of these Jan Aushadhi Kendras is delivered to the needy, that is, the cost of their medicines will be greatly reduced and it will be a great service to them.
The cost of stents required for heart patients has been reduced by 85.
The prices of knee implants have been regulated to 50-70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, nearly 10 crore households, i. e.
The total number of seats in the existing 479 Medical Colleges in the country has been increased to 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being opened in different states to provide better treatment and better healthcare facilities to the people across the country.
A new Medical College will be set up for each of the three districts.
We aim to make the entire country TB-free by 2025.
This is a very big task.
There is a need to create awareness for every person and you need your help for that.
To get rid of tuberculosis, all of us will have to work together.
My dear countrymen, on 14th April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Many years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had called for industrialization in the country.
They believe that due to industries, the poorest of the poor can also be provided employment.
Today, the Make in India campaign is going on successfully in the country.
In such a scenario, the dream that Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt of becoming an industrial power is inspiring us.
Today, India has emerged as a bright spot in the world's economy, the world's largest foreign direct investment is being made in India today.
The entire world is looking at India as a hub for investment, research and development.
In his vision, Smart City Mission and Urban Mission have been launched to provide facilities like good roads, water supply, healthcare, education and digital connectivity in big cities and small towns of the country.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance.
It was not acceptable for someone to lead a life in poverty.
Besides, he also believed that the poor would not be able to get rid of their poverty by providing them with some brilliant facilities.
Today, initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Start Up India, Stand Up India are also being taken up by young researchers and young entrepreneurs in the country.
He had seen Jal Shakti as a nation power.
It was Babasahebs vision to recognise the importance of waterways in the development of the country and to set up a separate water-related commission.
Today, historic efforts are being made to develop waterways and ports in the country.
Ports are being developed on different sea shores of India and infrastructure is being strengthened in old ports.
During the forty decades, there were major issues of discussion, other great wars, cool wars and challenges.
In a way, Dr. Ambedkar had laid the foundation of the spirit of 'Team India'.
He spoke of the importance of federalism and emphasized the need of the Union and States to work together for the development of the country.
Today, we have taken the mantra of cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism in every department of the government.
And most importantly, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is a source of inspiration for crores of backward classes like me.
He showed us that there is no need to be born in a reputed family or a privileged family to move forward in life. He also showed us that those who are born in a poor family in India can dream big, they can make efforts to fulfil those dreams and they can succeed in that.
Sometimes people attacked Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This is an India that belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the backward classes.
The Gram-Swarajya Abhiyan will be organised from 14th April to 5th May, 2018, to mark the birth anniversary of Dr.
It will have a wide range of programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across the country.
I urge all of you to participate in this programme in large numbers.
My dear countrymen, in the coming days, several festivals like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi are coming up.
Lord Mahavir Jayanti is a day to learn from his sacrifice and penance.
The life and teachings of Lord Mahavir, who gave the message of non-violence, are inspiring for all of us.
Greetings to all fellow citizens on Mahavir Jayanti.
The Easter said that Lord remembers the inspirational teachings of Jesus and gave the message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion to the people of mankind.
In April the festival of Baisakhi is celebrated in Punjab and West India .
Thanks a lot
We have seen that the sea looks blue but in everyday life we feel that water is colorless, it does not have color.
Have we ever thought of the river or the sea or the water in it
This question was raised in the minds of a young man in the 1920s.
A great scientist of modern India emerged from this question.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light scattering.
He is known as Raman Effect.
On 28th February, Raman was believed to have discovered light scattering and therefore, we celebrate 28th February every year as National Science Day, he received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
This country has given several great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand, there was a tradition of great mathematicians Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta, on the other hand, Surat and Charaka are our places of pride in healthcare.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Har Gobind Khurna and Satyendra Nath Bose are Indias pride.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose is also known as Boson Kundu.
Recently, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme of the Wadhwani Artificial Intelligence Institute in Mumbai.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles in science.
Artificial intelligence helps in manufacturing robots and machines.
Nowadays, machines are smartening their own intellect by self-scheduling.
This technology can be used to make the lives of the poor, the deprived and the needy easier.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I had appealed to the scientific community to use artificial intelligence to make the lives of differently abled brothers and sisters easier.
Can we imagine the natural calamities through artificial intelligence
A few days ago, with the Israeli Prime Minister, I got the opportunity to inaugurate the I-Create in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young man who developed a digital tool that could not be spoken by such a silent person who wrote that his voice was transformed and he could interact with this person just as he used to speak to a person.
I believe that in many such places we can use artificial intelligence.
Machines work as you wish.
But what we want to do from the system depends on us.
The human objective here is important, the use of science for human welfare, the use of science for attaining the highest levels of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who has discovered the light of electricity, has often been deprived of his experiments.
When asked about this, he told them that I have discovered ten thousand methods of electric lamps, that is, Adison made his own imagination strong.
Today, I am in Auroville, the workplace of Maharishi Aurobindo.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and asked for responsibilities against their rule.
As a great sage, he raised questions about every aspect of his life.
He showed the path to humanity by looking at the answer.
The spirit of repeated questions is important to understand the truth.
Behind the scientific discovery this true diet is also the inspiration .
Why shouldn't we stay healthy unless the answers are solved
On the occasion of National Science Day, I convey my best wishes to all those associated with our scientific and scientific field.
May our younger generation inspire for the discovery of truth and knowledge and inspire us to serve the society with the help of science.
Friends, During the scourge of dysentery, during the time of crisis, several messages come to me about safety and disasters.
From Pune, Shri Rabindra Singh has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App on the subject of Professional Safety.
He writes that the quality of safety at factories and construction sites in our country is not that good.
On the occasion of Indias National Safety Day on 4th March, the Prime Minister in his Mann Ki Baat address said that Safety should be the theme, which will increase awareness among the people about safety.
When we talk about public safety, two things are important, readiness and preparation.
Safety is of two types one that is essential during disasters and the other is essential in daily life.
We were not aware of safety in our daily lives but it was difficult to achieve safety during disasters.
If we are conscious, if we follow the required rules then we can save our society from the worst accidents besides protecting our lives.
We see that several things have been written about safety at work place but there is no compliance.
The municipal corporations who have fire engines should drive a mock drill in front of the students by going to different schools in a week or a month.
It will have two benefits, the Fire Services will also have a habit of staying alert and the new generation will get education in this regard. And it will not be necessary to spend separately.
India has geographically diversified itself in terms of disasters and disasters.
This country has witnessed some natural, man-made, disaster and chemical and industrial accidents.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) focuses on disaster management in the country.
NDMAs are running rapidly in disasters such as earthquakes, floods, plains and landslides.
Training and awareness have an important role to play.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives in the heat wave every year. NDMA launched a campaign to create awareness about it and organised workshops.
This shows that if we give priority to security then we can achieve safety.
Fire Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Armed Forces, Armed Forces, Ex-Servicemen, do not sacrifice their lives in times of distress, help the people.
NCCs and scouts also assist in this work and provide training.
This was the first and most comprehensive endeavour in the joint disaster management exercise of BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Nepal.
These values should become an integral part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, in this period of budget, under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the emphasis has been given to the villages through biogas to generate energy from waste and waste.
Initiatives have been initiated and renamed as Gobar Dhan, Galvanizing Organic Bio Agro Resources.
In some European countries and China, energy is generated from poultry and biological fertilizers but it was not used in India with full potential.
We are moving forward in this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen.
The target is to utilise livestock dung, farm waste and kitchen waste to generate biogas based energy.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, the farmers and brothers and sisters of rural India will be encouraged to look at the dung and waste as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in keeping the villages clean.
It will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
Garbage collection, transportation and sale of biogas will increase employment opportunities.
An on-line platform will be created for proper implementation of the Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect the farmers with the consumer and will give them fair price for pulses and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially the sisters living in rural India, to take the initiative and take advantage of this opportunity by creating a Self Help Group, by creating a cooperative society.
I invite you to become a partner in this movement for clean energy and green employment and take the initiative to convert the waste of our villages into wealth and convert sewerage into wealth.
Different artworks were developed using waste.
Workshops were organized to train people on all aspects of waste management.
Everyone put forth innovative ideas about cleanliness, charted, presented poetry.
Cleanliness was a festival.
Particularly schoolchildren participated in it.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation and Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which the festival was celebrated.
Every year 8th March is celebrated as International Women's Day.
Several programmes are organized in the country and around the world.
Women who have done remarkable work in different fields are being honoured this day.
Today, the country is moving ahead with the development of women under the leadership of women.
On this occasion, I recall Swami Vivekananda's thoughts, he had said, Ideal women's concept is complete freedom.
Twenty-five hundred years ago, Swamijis thoughts about women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life.
We are a part of a tradition where men are recognized by women, the sons of success, the sons of skills, the sons of Gandhi.
Women are empowered, empowered and are equal partners in the development of the country. This is the dream of New India.
A few days ago, an individual had suggested a good thing to me. He said that on 8th March many programmes are being organized on Women's Day.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahi 50 thousand Raj Mistry.
You can imagine what a big event is.
Women of Jharkhand have demonstrated that women power, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is such a power that will transform the Swachhta Abhiyan into a public mood in normal life.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I first reported that electricity had reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and after that it had spread its joy.
You know, this island is 10 kilometers away from Mumbai.
For 70 years in Elephanta, there was darkness in the lives of people in three villages like Rajbandar, Morbandar and Set Port.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and people there.
I am glad that the villages and caves of Elephanta are now brightened.
This is not just a power but a new beginning.
What can be a matter of greater joy than to enjoy the lives of the people of the country and to enjoy their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, we have just celebrated Maha Shivratri.
The unique feature of the month of March is the glimpse of the cooks and ammunition.
We love this month for the festival of Holi.
Holi will be celebrated across the country on 2nd March.
Holi is equally important as Holika Dahan is also important. It is a day to burn the evil trends.
May this festival bring joy in the lives of our people.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2018
This is the first time that Mann Ki Baat has interacted with us in 2018.
Two days ago, we celebrated Republic Day with great enthusiasm.
The event was attended by the honourable guests from ten countries, for the first time in history.
My dear countrymen, today I will mention the letter of Prakash Tripathy.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that today women are progressing in every sector in India, they are moving forward and the values of the country are rising.
It is a matter of great pride for the women of our country since ancient times and their contribution to the society.
There is a great tradition of great wise men in India.
Several adversaries in India have made significant contributions in the creation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi and many other names can be taken.
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society and her family in the bonds of unity.
Whether it is a great scholar like Lopadumra, Gargi and Maitreyi of the Vedic times or a saint of great scholars like Akka Mahadevi and Meerabai, or a saint in the path of devotion like Ahilyabai Kalah or a brave woman like Rani Lakshmibai, women power is always inspiring us.
Prakash Tripathy has mentioned several examples in his letter.
He has written that the journey of our brave Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman from the Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft will inspire him.
Mohna Singh and Avni Chaturvedi are the three brave women fighters who are now undergoing training in Sukhoi-30.
A few days ago, the Honble President had started a new thing.
A group of women who have made extraordinary strides in their respective fields have met the President of India.
Our women power has done extraordinary work to bridge the traditions of society and established a new record.
He demonstrated that hard work, hard work and determination can lead to a new path by crossing the barriers.
Now this path inspires not only our contemporary people but also generations to come.
The book is available in the form of e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, the women power of this country has a very important role in the positive transformation in the country and the society.
Today, when we talk about women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station here.
Now we must have thought about the relationship between a railway station and women empowerment.
The first railway station in India is Matunga Railway Station in Mumbai which has all the women employees.
The station has women employees in all the departments.
Several people wrote on the Twitter and other social media after seeing the portals of the Republic Day that all women had participated in the BSF Bikar Continent.
These women used to be very adventurous and they also surprised the guests who came from abroad.
Both words empowerment and self-reliance are the same.
Today, our women are leading.
They are becoming self-reliant.
But our tribal women and women of Chhattisgarh have created a new image before the country.
The area of Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh is under the influence of Maoism.
At the brink of violence, atrocities, bombs, guns and pistols, the Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere here.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant in such a critical area by driving e-rickshaws.
Whether the introduction of any social life has been developed or not, whether it has changed its own way or not
Continuous efforts are being made at the individual and social level in our country against social evils and evils and practices.
Just a few days back, a good effort was made in Bihar.
More than 13,000 kilometres long human chains were created in the state to eliminate social evils, which was the longest human chain in the world.
In this campaign, people have created awareness among the society against evil practices like child marriage, hoonda etc.
The entire state made a solemn pledge to fight against evils such as hoonda and child marriage.
Youth, mothers and sisters, all of you have participated in this campaign.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patan, this human chain was connected unbreakablely to the border of the state.
Our society should be free from such evils so that all the people of the society need the benefits of development in the true sense.
Let us take a pledge to wipe out such evils from the society and create a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration of the state and every person involved in the human chain.
But after getting information about Janaushadhi Kendra, he started buying medicines from there and now his father's medicines have been reduced by 75.
It provides huge financial assistance to the common man, especially the senior citizens who take medicines every day.
The Generic medicines being procured are similar to the standards set by the WHO.
This is the reason why good quality medicines can be made available at cheaper rates.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
It not only provides cheaper medicines but also provides new employment opportunities to the individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and at Amrit Stores of Hospitals.
The only aim of these schemes is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country and to build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh has sent a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App from Maharashtra.
My attention will be drawn to him in the absence of this photograph.
In this photo, a grandson along with his brothers had participated in the Clean Morana River Cleanliness campaign.
I was told that the people of Akola have started a programme to clean the 'Morna River' in the Swachh Bharat Mission.
One more difficult thing is that wild grass and hydroelectricity had flown in the river bowl.
Waste and dirt were also being thrown on the river and its slopes.
The villagers prepared an action plan and on 13th January, before the Makar Sankranti, on the 13th of January, Swachh Morna Mohim, in the first phase, cleaned the two stretches of Morana at four kilometres in the first phase.
I have been told that the Akolkar campaign will continue every Saturday morning till the Mona River is completely cleaned.
One can see that if a person decides to do something then something is impossible.
It can bring about a transformation through mass movement.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of discussion about the Padma Awards.
Every year there is a tradition of awarding Padma Awards but for the last three years, the entire process of this award has been changed.
Now any citizen can give a name for the award.
The entire process has become transparent due to online process.
Now the importance of the work done by the individual is being taken into account and it is being introduced to the awardees.
You must have heard that you would be happy to know the work done by Arvind Gupta ji.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has saved his life for making toys for children.
They are making constant efforts so that the children can use scientific experiments in waste materials and pesticides.
For this, he went to three thousand schools across the country and showcased them in 18 different languages and inspired children.
This is the story of Sitava Joddatti of Karnataka.
They are not called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades, Sitava has played a major role in transforming the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi.
She had dedicated herself to Devdasi at the age of seven years, but Sitava spent her entire life for the welfare of Devdasis.
Not only this, he has also done great work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard a lot about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh and Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor, tribal family.
He used to do a simple job in order to grow, but he had the rhythm of colouring traditional tribal paintings.
It is because of this metre that he has received respect not only in India but also in the entire world.
His pictures have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
He has been awarded the Padma Shri by recognizing the talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who has named India abroad.
He has built more than five hundred medicinal plants based on his memories.
He has been honoured with the Padma Shri Award for his outstanding social work in discovering such illustrious personalities.
Today, I would like to mention another name here and the 75-year-old sister-in-law of West Bengal, Mistri, has also been selected for the Padma Awards.
The sister-in-law, Mistri, sold utensils and vegetables in the houses of others to build hospitals.
He was inspired to build hospitals for the poor due to this crisis in his life.
Today thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in the hospitals created by their hard work.
I would like to tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who work for the society around us, those who work for the society, those who dedicate their lives for the society, those who work for the welfare of the society, those who work for the welfare of the people, those who work for the welfare of the people, those who work for the welfare of the society, those who work for the welfare of the people, those who work for the welfare of the people, those who work for the welfare of the society, those who dedicate their lives, those who work for the welfare of the people, those who work for the welfare of the people, those who work for the welfare of the people, those who work for the welfare of the society, those who work for the welfare of the people, those who work for the welfare of the people, those who work for the welfare of the people, those who work for the welfare of the society
Such people dont work at all for dignity.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas every year on 9th January.
Revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa on 9th January.
On this day, we are celebrating the festival of unbreakable bonds between Indians living in India and around the world.
You will be pleased to know that the Mayor, Parliamentarian and Lok Delegates of Indian Origin were participating in Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, UK, Suriname, South Africa and USA and many other countries.
I would like to thank the European Union for doing a remarkable job, creating the identity of the people of the original Indian origin and giving this information to the people of the entire world through direction.
Those who showed us a new path, the day of revered Bapu is on the 30th of January.
The path of peace and non-violence is the path of Bapu, be it India or the world or be it the individual or the family or society.
Namaskar
This is the last episode of Mann Ki Baat in the year and Yoga is the last day of the year 2017.
Throughout this year, we talked about a lot of things and shared a lot of things.
The innumerable letters and reactions that you have received for Mann Ki Baat, the exchange of ideas, all these would always give me new energy.
Now this year is going to change after a few hours but let us talk about this thing, let us talk about it and let us talk about it.
In the coming year too, we will discuss new topics and share new experiences.
My best wishes to you all for 2018.
Just a few days ago, on 25th December, the Christmas Festival was celebrated with great enthusiasm all over the world.
We also see the essence of the spirit of service in the Bible.
The Sun of Man Haj Kamal, Not to Be Served, But to Serveh, And to Give Hij Life, Age Blassingto All Humankind.
In these beliefs, it is evident that what is the importance of service, the importance of service.
Whether there is any caste, religion, tradition or character in this world, the invaluable form of humanity comes from service.
In our country, we are talking about Niskam Karma, Niskam Karma does not have any expectation and service.
We are also called 'Seva Parmo Dharma'.
Life-service is Shiva-Seva and Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans has said that life-service should be done with emotions.
My dear countrymen, this year was the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The bravery of Guru Gobind Singh ji and his extraordinary life are a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values of life and he lived on the basis of those values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji inspired people from all such roles as a guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior.
He fought against tyranny and injustice.
He taught people to sacrifice their lives for the cause of caste and religion.
In all these efforts, they had a lot to do with individuals.
But he never possessed the spirit of compassion.
Every moment in his life he continued to preach the message of love, sacrifice and peace.
This shows how great and special his personality was.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to participate in the light festival organised in Patna Sahib on the occasion of 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
January 1, 2018.
You will also be surprised to know that the new year will come and January will also come every year.
But when I say - 'specific' then that thing is really special.
And I urge all of you to register your names as voters.
The whole of India is keen to welcome itself as a voter in the 21st century.
Being a voter in the 21st century, you must have felt that you too are receiving some respect.
Our opinion is the basis of New India.
The power of vote in democracy is the biggest strength.
Vote is the most effective tool for bringing about a positive change in the lives of millions.
We don't have the right to vote.
So, what kind of India should we have in the 21st century and what kind of dreams should we have in the 21st century India
You will also be able to become the builder of the 21st century India and it will start with a special beginning from January 1.
I am confident that the dream of 'New India' will be realised by the strength of the skills of this vibrant youth.
When we talk about New India, it should be free from toxicities like casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
He should be free from unhygienic and poverty.
Peace, unity and harmony in New India should be our guiding force.
Let us deliberate on how the youth of New India will come forward and make a New India.
They should also set a path for us, those who have been associated with it will become such a massive group.
We should keep moving ahead and the country will move forward in the same manner.
When I was just talking to you, I got an idea in my mind that can we organise a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Can the youth of the age group of 18-25 years come together to deliberate upon the issue of 'New India' and find ways to make them youngsters
How can we make a solemn pledge before 2022
What can we do to build an India of the dreams of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi gave the freedom movement the shape of a mass movement.
My young friends, today the need of the hour is that we too should create a mass movement for a grand and divine India in the 21st century.
Today, innumerable new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are moving forward and succeeding.
I believe that an independent and robust system should be created so that the youngsters of New India can get information about these schemes in one place.
My dear countrymen, the last time I had talked about the importance of "political" in Mann Ki Baat.
Positiveness and zeal are easily achieved by those who have zeal.
In English, it is said that in the previous episode Mann Ki Baat, I had requested the countrymen to share the positive moments you experienced in the year 2017 and welcome the same positive atmosphere in 2018.
People gave a very positive response on social media platforms, MyGov and Narendra Modi App and shared their experiences.
Some people have also shared some special achievements in their personal lives.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
a.
I can get these loans very easily and my daughter can continue to be educated.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I would like to speak from Bodal here.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
Our villages have been working on National Highways in 2017.
And that is why the roads have become very good and the business is getting faster.
My name is Dipanshu Ahuja.
I live in Mohalla Sadatganj in Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bevani.
Our area had a very serious problem of water and for the past 40 years we were dependent on the waterways of Armi.
Now we have an independent climate.
Let us enter the New Year with the joy that comes from such small things, let us take decisive steps to move from a positive India to a progressive India in the beginning of the New Year.
Now all of us are discussing positively, so I am also trying to tell you one thing here.
Recently, I am very enthusiastic about Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak, who has been ranked top in the Civil Services Examination in Kashmir.
He was the first to emerge from the atmosphere of terrorism and radicalization in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
He wrote the story of success with his own hands.
Today Anjum has become an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Anjumana has proved that however evil the situation may be, the disappointment and disappointment of disappointment can be done through positive work.
Recently, I got the opportunity to meet some of the daughters of Jammu and Kashmir in the last week.
I used to get to know about the desire, the enthusiasm and the dreams that they had in them.
They used to say that in what field they want to progress in their lives, they used to say that they had a lot of hope in their minds.
I used to feel that there is no disappointment in them.
They had enthusiasm, joy, humor, energy, great dreams and solemn pledges.
I was also inspired by the time I spent with these Kashmiri daughters.
This is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to talk about the temple of Sabarimala in Kerala when it was discussed not only in our country but also in the famous religious places of the world.
Every year crores of devotees come to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami in this world famous temple.
P.
No one is big or small in this campaign.
Every pilgrim considers a part of the worship of God and does something or the other clean.
Now no matter how big a celebrity it is, no matter how rich it is, no matter how big it is, no matter how big it is, everybody is joining this programme like a common pilgrim.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
At the same time, a solid resolution of cleanliness is also taken along with strict ventilation.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October, 2014, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, all of you have made a solemn pledge to make a 'Swachh Bharat' and 'Open India from Untouchability.'
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level across the country towards cleanliness.
Peoples participation in rural as well as urban areas is also showing change.
The worlds largest Swachh Survekshan 2018 is scheduled to be held from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the extent of sanitation levels in the urban areas and achievements in the sanitation drive.
Such surveys will be conducted in more than four thousand cities of the country and about 40 crore people of the country.
Whether it is an open defecation free in cities, waste collection, waste-driven vehicle system, scientific waste management or efforts to change the habits of the people, people's participation in this work, to build capacities and to use some innovations for sanitation
During the period of the survey, various teams will be inspecting the cities.
They will interact with the citizens and understand their responses.
How the Swachhata App is being used and analysed to improve various types of services.
Its not just the government but also the government.
It is also a big responsibility for every citizen and civil society to maintain cleanliness.
And I urge every citizen to join the Swachhta Survekshan in large numbers.
And make a solemn pledge that you dont fall prey to cleanliness in the city.
I am sure you must have felt the habit of classifying Gharamdhala dry waste and wet waste and you would be using different waste hats like blue and green waste.
Reduce, Reuse and Re-cycle principles are very effective for waste.
Clean cities will be ranked on the basis of this survey and if the population of our city is more than one lakh then it should be our dream that if there are less than one lakh population in the country then it should be the top rank in the regional order.
And we should also make efforts.
And all of us should have a dream of 'Our City-Our Efforts', 'Our Progress and Country's Progress.
Let us make such a solemn pledge that once again we should commemorate the revered Bapu and fulfil the resolution of a Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that look very small but if we look at them as a society then we become familiar.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you.
I was told that if a Muslim woman wants to visit Haj pilgrimage then she cannot go to Mehram alone or to her male pool.
Especially, there are no such bonds, rules and regulations in Islamic countries.
But in India, only Muslim women did not get this right.
And I am very happy to mention here that our governments should take care of it.
I have full faith and I firmly believe that the journey of India's development will continue to move forward on the strength of our women power, on the beliefs of their talent.
And that is why our efforts should be made to ensure that our women also have equal rights and equal opportunities with the men and we need to move forward on the path of progress with women and men.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for us.
This year, 26th January, 2018 will be remembered specially.
This year, leaders of all the ten ASEAN countries will be visiting India as Chief Guests at the Republic Day Celebrations.
This year, on Republic Day, there will be not only one but 10 Chief Guests.
2017 was a special year for both ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2017 and completed 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us to join these great leaders of the 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, the festival festivals are going on in a way and our country is a country of festivals.
Perhaps no such day will be concluded that no festival is celebrated that day.
May the coming year bring joy, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
You all should move ahead with new zeal, new zeal, new joy and new resolve.
In the month of January, the festival of Makar Sankranti is being celebrated in Uttarayan, which is associated with nature.
In Rajasthan, it is called Sankranti, in Assam it is Magha-Bihu and in Tamil Nadu it is Pongal and this is our special significance.
All these festivals are usually celebrated on 13th 17th January.
Thank you very much, dear countrymen.
Now you will say this again in 2018.
Indians will not be able to discover that there is no respect for them.
At that age, they are much bigger than all of us and are witnesses to different phases of the country.
I had the privilege of interacting with Didin on telephone before my departure for a foreign trip.
It was a lovely conversation between us and our elder sisters in a small sense.
I don't really speak much about this kind of personal conversation.
Listen, even at this juncture of life, Latadi is keen and ready for everything related to the country.
The feeling of satisfaction in his life is associated with India's progress, with changing India and with India that has scaled new heights of progress.
Modi ji: Latadi Namaskar
I am speaking to Shri Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: I used to travel by plane.
Lata ji: Good, good.
What should be celebrated on the Great Day
And the accomplishment that we have achieved has been achieved through the medium of instruments and penance.
I don't really have anything.
Lata ji: Ho
I also keep getting your letters and I also keep getting your gifts.
I don't want to bother you so much because I see how much work you are doing and how much work you have to think about.
Modi ji: My mother is very happy with your affection.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: but I will soon be there.
Festivals will continue throughout the country for several weeks.
Your homes will be filled with joy.
But you must have seen that there are many people around you who are deprived of the joy of these festivals.
It is called Divya Lee Andhar.
Most of these words are not just a few words but a mandate, a philosophy and an inspiration for us.
When we come to our houses with sweets, clothes and gifts then we should go out for a moment.
Definitely do the work of giving outside items that are more than required in our homes, which are not used by us.
In many cities, many such institutions work with the start-ups of young friends.
They collect clothes, cereals, food etc. from the households of the people and discover the needs and deliver them to them.
Laughter on the faces of many poor families will double our joy of the festival, it will illuminate our faces, it will illuminate our lamps and lighten our lamps.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi is welcomed in the traditional form of laxmi in the form of good fortune and prosperity in Diwali.
Can we welcome Laxmi in a new way this year
In our culture, daughters have been considered as Lakshmi because daughters bring good fortune and prosperity.
Can we organize programmes for the honour of girls in our societies, villages and cities this year
Can we do this programme on Diwali this year in honor of these laxmis of India
There will be a lot of girls around us who are doing extraordinary work.
Whether it is the work of educating the poor children, whether it is the work of creating awareness about cleanliness and health, whether it is a doctor or an engineer or a social worker or a lawyer or a lawyer, he will be trying to provide justice to someone.
Our society should recognize such people, honour them and take pride in them.
Such an honour programme should be organized across the country.
One more thing can be done.
Share more information about the success of these daughters through social media and use Bharat Ki Laxmi Hashtag.
We had launched the Selfie with Daughter and it was spread all over the world. Similarly, we should also launch the mission of 'Bharat Ki Laxmi'.
Promoting India's Lakshmi initiative means empowering the path of prosperity for the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had just said that Mann Ki Baat programme has a huge advantage that I am fortunate to have a direct or indirect interaction with many familiar and unique persons.
A few days ago, Alina Tayang, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, has sent me a leaflet and she has written in it.
I live in Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This year, when I got the result of my examination, some people asked me if you read the book Exam Warriors.
I told them that I have not read this book.
But again I bought this book and read it two-three times.
My experience after that was very good.
I felt that if I had read this book before the examination then I would have benefited from it.
I believe that if you think about the new version of this book then you must include some more mantras for parents and teachers and some other labourers.
Thank you for reading the book of Exam Warriors twice or thrice. Thank you very much for telling me what is the deficiency in it.
This small friend of mine has entrusted me with a task and has instructed me to do something.
I will certainly follow our orders.
You have said that when a new version of this book comes, I will definitely try to write something for the parents and teachers in it.
But I would urge you all to help me in this task.
What are your experiences in everyday life
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend and student Alina Tayang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, through newspapers and television, you are getting information about the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of India.
But you know that I am an ordinary person like you, an ordinary citizen. And that is why the impact of an ordinary life that is affecting me too in my life, because I am also one among you.
Then I also heard that speech and also saw the confrontation.
Just a short while ago, he was defeated by the Grand Slam winner and Emperor Rafael Nadal of the tennis world.
The audience present there enthusiastically welcomed their speeches.
He also praised the Donald Livelihoods Act, which has inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis.
Even after being defeated in the face of adversity, he praised his competing role and set an example of sportspersonship in front of the world.
At the same time, on the other hand, the winner Nadal also praised Danish sports.
There is a lot that every class and person of every age can learn.
These are moments, they are beyond winning or defeat, when victory or defeat does not mean much.
The thoughts of our ancestors were really commendable.
Student Vinay Upayer Hartin Nursi Kasya Man. Mani Kanchan Sammelan: The Janati Loksya Lochan Andam means that when a person simultaneously possesses qualifications and humility, then who cannot imagine
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of all the people around the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I will say now is really going to tell you for your good.
The debate will continue, the differences between the parties will persist, but if some things stop before they are spreading at a rapid pace then it will be of great benefit.
It becomes difficult to stop those things which are growing at a rapid pace.
But in the beginning, if we stop awakening then a lot can be saved.
With this feeling, I feel that today I want to talk to my dear youngsters.
You all are aware that tobacco addiction is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit alcohol.
Because of the nicotine present in tobacco the quantity of intoxication is more in it .
By its consumption in adolescence there is adverse effect on the development of brain .
But today I want to talk about a new topic with you.
You must be aware that restrictions on e-cigarettes have been imposed in India recently.
E cigarette is a different electronic appliance than regular cigarettes .
In cigarettes because of hot nicotine rich fluid a kind of chemical smoke is produced , through which nicotine is consumed .
We may be aware of the dangers of regular cigarettes, but an illusion has been made about e-cigarettes that there is no danger due to e-cigarettes.
Aromatic chemicals are used in this so that its odour does not spread like other cigarettes .
You have seen around you that in many houses people are chainsmokers but they prevent others from smoking at home.
The issue of e-cigarettes is different.
If someone smokes surrounding us then he understands it from his habitation.
If there is a cigarette packet in someone's pocket then also he gets to know from the slope only.
However, it is not like this that many adolescents and youngsters can be seen roaming around in their books, in their pockets, in their pockets and in their pockets with e-cigarettes and then intoxicants.
Young generation is the future of the country.
This kind of intoxication should not be an extermination for our youth, therefore cigarettes have been imposed on them.
These restrictions have been imposed so that the dreams of the family can be saved from getting damaged, the lives of children should not go to the country, the habit of drug addiction should not spread to the society.
I urge all of you to quit this intoxication of tobacco and do not make any mistake about e-cigarettes.
Let us together build a healthy India.
You remember Fit India, don't you
Fit India does not mean that we should go to the gym for two hours in the morning and evening.
Fit India will have to stay away from all these addictions.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is indeed a good fortune for us that our India has been the birthplace and workplace of many exceptional people who have spent their lives for the welfare of the country and others.
India is the birthplace of many exceptional people, it is the land of karmabhoomi and these are the people who dedicated their lives not only for themselves but also for the welfare of others.
One such great person will be honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will declare Mary threshold as a saint on 13th October.
The work that Mr. Mariam Thresia did for the welfare of humanity in the short life of fifty years is a unique example for the entire world.
He was very keen on social service and education.
He built several schools, accommodations and orphanages.
He established the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Family, which is still fulfilling his lifestyle and mission.
Once again I pay my homage to Mr. Miam Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for the entire India but also for the world that while we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians have resolved to be free from single use plastic.
Seeing the leadership that India has played in the direction of environmental protection, the vision of countries across the globe has been rolled out to India.
I am confident that all of you will participate in the mission to get rid of single-use plastics on 2nd October.
People are contributing in this campaign in their own way. However, a youth of our country has started a mission in a unique way.
When I noticed their work, I interacted with them on telephone and tried to understand their new experiments.
Perhaps the interaction with them will be useful for some other people of the country.
Shri Ripudaman Belvi ji is making a unique effort.
When I first heard the word 'plogging', it was also new to me.
You are implementing this programme in an innovative manner and especially in a way that the youth will like.
I congratulate you from the bottom of my heart.
Friends, The Sports Ministry is also organizing Fit India Plogging Run on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Honble Bapu this year.
Two kilometers of plugging on October 2.
This programme will be held across the country.
We have heard from the experiences of the people about how to do this programme, what should be there in the programme.
Through this campaign, awareness about cleanliness is also increasing along with public awareness about health.
I am sure that 130 crore Indians have taken a step to get rid of single use plastic and India will take 130 crore steps together.
Rupudman ji, once again thank you very much.
My best wishes to you, your team and your innovation.
I would like to tell you a little bit about one thing.
Though I would like to tell you in detail about the next episode of Mann Ki Baat but today I am telling you that we should get the opportunity to prepare.
You might remember that on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is being celebrated.
So we have to start preparations for that right now.
I will talk about it in detail but it is still time.
Some people can start the exercise and some other schemes can be formulated.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August, I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022 we should visit 15 places in India.
Programme for at least fifteen places and one or two nights .
Let us look at India, understand it, experience it.
We have so many diversities.
And when people come on vacations on the occasion of Diwali then they definitely go for a walk. Therefore, I once again urge you to visit any fifteen places in India.
My dear countrymen, the World Tourism Day was celebrated on 27th September and some of the responsibilities of the world present the tourism scenario and you will be happy to know that India has improved its place in the tourism competitive index.
And all this has become possible because of your cooperation, especially because of the importance of tourism.
If we do more, we will certainly be able to get top of the world's main tourist destinations when we complete 75 years of our independence.
There should be happiness and enthusiasm too.
Our festivals are celebrated together and celebrated together. This collectiveness also brings a new strength to collective life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to interact with the children of Karnataka.
The Times Group's Vijay Karnataka newspaper launched an initiative, in which he urged the children to send a letter to the Prime Minister.
He has also written that if he gives more information about nature to children, it will be useful in the future for protecting the environment.
A daughter named Rida Nadaf from Laxmeshwara has written that she is the daughter of a soldier in the army and she feels proud of it.
Wouldn't any Indian feel proud of the army personnel
And you are the daughter of that soldier, it is quite natural for you to feel proud.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has said that her school is 5 kilometres away from her village, so she has to leave home early and she is also late to return home.
He said that he cannot play with his friends for a long time and he should have a school near his house.
My dear countrymen, a newspaper has initiated this kind of initiative and that is why I got the opportunity to save those letters.
Sudha was a great experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
In 1949, the Constituent Assembly had accepted the event of India today.
The Constitution came into force on 26th January, 1950 and therefore we celebrate 26th January as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked hard for nearly three years to create the Constitution.
No field of life, no subject of nature has changed into it.
Equality for all and sensitivity towards all is the identity of our Constitution.
It is our duty to follow our Constitution through letters.
Be it citizen or administrator, everyone should behave in accordance with the Constitution.
This is the message of the Rajya Sabha that no one should be harmed.
The Dasuda Committee was one of the most important committees.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Committee.
He was playing a very big role.
He asserted that welfare of every section of the society will be ensured.
On the 6th of December, we remember him on his Mahaparinirvana.
Baba Saheb has contributed immensely to the nations prosperity and empowerment.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 15th December.
Sardar Patel, who made the identity of the farmer from his son to the iron male, also did an extraordinary job of binding the country in a common thread.
Sardar Patel was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
However, the country cannot forget that the terrorist attack on Mumbai was on 2611 this day nine years ago.
Today, I remember and salute those brave citizens, police and security personnel who lost their lives.
The country will never forget their sacrifices.
It has become ready to wipe out human power.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world should unite and defeat terrorism.
Born on this land, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi have given the world the message of non-violence and love.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to eradicate and weaken our social structure.
And that is why the need of the hour is to be more conscious of the humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Navy Day on 4th December.
The Indian Navy protects our maritime shores.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You must be aware that our cultures have developed along the banks of the rivers.
Be it the Indus river or the Ganges or the Yamuna or the Saraswati, our rivers and seas are both economic and strategic.
These are the gateways for the entire world.
This country, our land has an unbreakable relationship with the oceans.
When we look at history, 800-900 years ago, the navy of the king was counted among the most capable ships during the Raksha Bandhan.
In the expansion of the Rudra empire, the empire was part of his navy's contribution to rename the empire as the economic superintendent at that time.
Several examples of the Rashtriya Navy's missions and research journeys are still available in Sangam literature.
Most of the navies around the world have been allowed to join women in the long run.
However, Raksha Bandhan had also played the role of women in the Navy and 800-900 years ago.
The women were also involved in the war.
The Rudra rulers had the latest knowledge of shipbuilding.
How can we forget the capabilities of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his navy when the Navy is mentioned
The territory of Konkan, a marine world, was included in the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud-Janjira, Swarnadurg, associated with Shivaji Maharaj were either in the coastal areas or in the sea.
The Marathas navy was protecting these forts .
The Marathas Arm included large and small boats.
Their naval personnel were capable of attacking any enemy and defending themselves from the attack.
It is impossible to discuss Maratha Armaan and not mention Kanhoji Angre.
He gave a new grandeur to the Marathas Armaans, and laid the foundations of Maratha Sainiks at many places.
Even after independence, the Indian Navy has gained valour several times.
Whether it is the Goa Freedom War or the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971.
The Indian Navy's INS Sumitra assisted in the immediate rescue and delivered many fishermen safely out of the water to Bangladesh.
This year, when a huge flood broke out in Sri Lanka in May-June this year, three boats of our navy reached there immediately and they helped the government and the people there.
Our naval naval INS Katiyal has assisted humanitarian assistance in the matter of Rohingya in Bangladesh.
In June, the Papua New Guinea Government gave us the SOS message and assisted our Navy to save the fishermen on their fishing boats.
The INS Tricolour of our Navy also rushed to the warships at the time of a merchant ship in West Galf on 21 November.
This year, the Ministry of Defence has decided to launch a special drive from 1st to 7th December, 2018 to express pride and respect for the security forces of the country.
Children, elderly people, all of them put a national flag throughout the week.
There should be a movement to pay homage to the soldiers across the country.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flag of the Armed Forces.
Anyone in your surroundings can post their experiences, their courageous actions, photographs and photographs related to them in armedforcesflagday.
Invite people from schools and colleges to enable them to learn more about the army's work.
This is a great opportunity for our new generation to learn more about the army.
This is also an opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all our Defence Forces.
The fund is being utilised by the Sainik Welfare Board for the families of martyred soldiers, for the welfare of the injured soldiers and their rehabilitation.
Let us also contribute to uplifting the morale of our Armed Forces on this occasion.
Let us also put in our hands for their welfare.
My dear countrymen, the 5th of December is World Soil Day.
I want to tell my farmer brothers and sisters too.
Soil is an important component of earth.
Everything we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is connected to the soil.
Imagine what happens if there is no nutritious soil in the world
How are the living stagnant dams
This was discussed long ago in our culture and that is why we have been aware of the importance of soil since time immemorial.
In our culture, the feeling of devotion and respect towards agriculture and soil would be natural in the minds of the people. And at the same time, soil was nurtured due to the use of many scientific methods.
Two things are very important in the lives of the farmers of this country. They will take care of our soil with devotion and scientific perspective.
We all are proud that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and are also conscious of modern sciences and use them in agriculture.
I have heard about Tohu village, Bhoranj block and the farmers of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The farmers there used chemical fertilizers in a imbalanced manner and therefore the soil quality was lower.
Production declined, thereby reducing the income of the farmers and also reducing the productivity of soil.
Some of the awakened farmers of the village recognized the seriousness of the situation and thereafter, the farmers of the village tested their soil and recognised the amount of fertilizers, nutritional elements and organic fertilizers that they were advised to use.
As a result, you will be surprised to know that the information provided to the farmers through soil health cards, the implementation of the guidance provided to the farmers has had a positive effect.
In Rabi 2016-17, the production of cow has increased by three to four times and the income has also increased by four to six thousand rupees.
If we take care of the crops then we should take care of the soil and if we take care of the mother dam then it will take care of ourselves.
More than 10 crore farmers across the country have prepared Soil Health Cards so that they can get better information about their soil and sow their crops accordingly.
We devote ourselves to the goddess of the goddess, however, did we think that urea-like fertilizers are very dangerous for the health of this dam
It has been proved by many scientific experiments that more than necessary urea causes damage to the ground.
The farmer is the son of this dam Maa, how can he make his mother sick
It is the need of the hour to revive this relationship between mother and son.
Can our farmers make a solemn pledge to minimize the use of urea for our farming till 2022, when India will complete 75 years of its independence
Once the sons and daughters of the Mother Dam have made a solemn pledge that the health of the land will improve at a rapid pace and the production will also increase.
The life of the farmer will be transformed in a true sense.
Now we have started to feel that the global temperature is rising and the climate change is changing.
There was a time when winters started before Diwali.
Now it has come to a standstill in December and it is getting very cold.
It is our experience that the winter does not seem to come out of the breeze.
However, even in such a weather, the people of awareness work effectively and their examples inspire all of us.
But determination and determination were greater than all of them.
The eight-year-old son could not speak, but he took the support of the rock.
At 5 a.m., this son used to go to the village house and ask him not to defecate in the open.
This potter village became Open Defecation Free due to the efforts of the child who taught cleanliness at least 30-40 households everyday.
Every moment we get to learn something new.
Today, they are performing well in every field.
Be it sports, competitions or social initiatives, our Divyangjans are not lagging behind in any case.
You might remember that in the Rio Olympics, our disabled players had won 4 medals and they also won the World Cup of the Blind T-Twenty cricket.
There are several types of competitions going on across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Para Water Contest was organised in Udaipur.
Their body does not have meat in 80 percent of their body but look at their courage, determination and hard work.
He also won a gold medal at the 70th National Para Water Championship, which led to his selection by the Sports Authority of India for 20-20 Paralympics.
They are among 32 Para Water Conservationists and will be trained at the Centre of Excellence in Gujarat.
I salute and convey my best wishes to young Jigar Thakkar.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
On this day, Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my countrymen and hope that this festival of Eid will inspire you all to enhance peace and harmony in the society and will give you new energy, new energy and new resolutions.
(Phone Call) Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am talking to Neeraj Singh from Kanpur.
I would like to urge you to once again tell us the best of the 10 things that you have talked about through Mann Ki Baat throughout the year so that we can recall those things and we can learn more new things.
You have made a very good suggestion.
After listening to your speech, I want to put more emphasis on it and change it.
The old-age minds in our villages always tell us, forget the sorrows and do not forget the happiness.
Whether it is photography, small stories, things or small television, I invite you to welcome 2018 in a good environment, to do it with good memories, to do it with positive thoughts.
Come, share positive things with Positive India (Hashtag Positive India) on NarendraModi App, MyGov or social media.
Give a glimpse of the incidents that inspire others.
We all see the strength of these collective efforts and the impact of it.
I am sure that in the next chapter of Mann Ki Baat, I will endeavour to take the experience of Positive India (Hashtag Positive India) to the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I will once again interact with all of you for Mann Ki Baat next month.
There will be a lot of opportunity to speak.
Many thanks
Six days after Diwali, Chhath Parv is one of the most sincere celebrations of our country.
In which traditional rules ranging from food to dresses are followed.
The unique festival of Chhath Puja is completely associated with the worship of nature and nature.
Sun and water, these great festivals are at the centre of sixth sermons, while bamboo and earthen utensils and earthen pots are useful materials in this ritual.
Dunia worships Ugwati but in Chhathpuja, she also gives us the version of worshipping Ugwati.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also included in this festival.
Cleanliness of the entire house before Chhathpuja, along with the cleanliness of the rivers, ponds, shores and shores, all the people are enthusiastic.
Suryavandana or Chhath Puja is the festival of migration protection, disease prevention and discipline.
Normally, they are considered to be inferiority complex.
But in Chhathupujha, after half of the morning, after eating prasad, this is a special tradition.
This is the reason that the ego gets destroyed and the ego is such a feeling that it becomes a hindrance in the progress of the person.
It is very natural for the people to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am convinced that Mann Ki Baat has been tied to 100 per cent sensitivity with the people of the country.
Take Khadi and Handloom examples.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I always urge for handloom, khadi and you will be happy to know what is the result.
I was told that on the 17th of October this month, on the day of Dhantriyadashi, a record sale of Rs. 1 crore 20 lakh was registered at Khadi Village Industries Building Store in Delhi.
You might be happy to know that Khadi and Handloom are being sold at such a large scale in the same store.
During Deepawali, the sales in Khadi's Gift Kupan have grown by nearly 680.
The sale of Khadi and Handicrafts products has also increased by nearly 90 percent this year as compared to last year.
Today, the youth, the elderly, the women, the people of every age group like Khadi and handloom.
I can imagine how much benefit this business will benefit the weavers, the poor families and the families working on handlooms.
But, from the experience of the past few years, I can say that Khadi has replaced Khadi for Transformation after Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion.
Khadi becomes a tool for the poorest of the poor by transforming the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is a big role for the village industry.
Shri Rajan Bhatt wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he would like to know about the experience of insolvency with my security forces and to know how our security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shri Tejas Gaikwad has also asked on the Narendra Modi App whether there can be arrangements for our sweet security forces.
We also remember our brave security forces.
We feel that the sweetness of our house should reach the soldiers of the country.
You must have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
This Diwali also brought a special experience for me.
I respect every soldier of the security forces along with all the countrymen for their struggle, dedication and sacrifice while fighting the borders with difficult and odd conditions.
When we get time, when we get time, we should understand the experiences of the soldiers and listen to their glory.
Many of you are unaware that our soldiers are not only protecting our borders but also taking important roles in world peace.
Everyone is familiar with the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace across the world and their positive landscape.
And we believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is my family in the world.
With this belief, India has been active in various UN initiatives since its inception.
You all are well aware that the proposal for India's Ghat and the UN Charter was started in both words Woody the Pipal.
India has always emphasized on womens equality and the UN declaration on human rights is a living example of that.
The proposals made in his Initial Frame, i. e. All Main R. Borne Free and Equal, were replaced by the efforts of Indias representative Laughter Mehta and later accepted the All-Human Bingz R Borne Free and Equal.
If you look at it then it is a small change, but a powerful thought was seen in it.
Indias role in UN Peacekeeping Operations is what India has contributed through UN embraces.
More than eighteen thousand Indian security forces have served in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
Presently, seven thousand soldiers have been added to UN Peacekeeping and this is the third highest in the world.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served at least 50 operations in 71 Peacekeeping.
This peace effort was made in some countries like Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan, 20,000 patients were treated in the Indian Army's hospital and saved the countless people.
Indian security forces have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts.
Indian women have also played an important role in making peace.
India is the only country that very few people know that India will send women police units to Liberia under the Shanti Abhiyan Mission.
And this step of India is an inspiration for the countries of the world.
After this, all the countries started sending their women police units.
We will be proud to know that India is playing its role not only in peacekeeping but also in 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and harmony throughout the world.
Peace Campaign, this is not an easy task.
Our security guards have to do this work in remote areas.
Their memories blossom the glory of every countryman.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, a brave man who was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji made a special recognition in Cyprus.
In 1989, he was appointed as a Force Commander for Operation in Namibia in the 72nd year and he served for the cause of freedom of that country.
General Thimayya, who was the Chief of the Army Staff, also led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and joined the peacekeeping exercise.
As a peace ambassador, India always conveyed the message of peace, unity and harmony.
We believe that everyone should move ahead with the vision of a peaceful, harmonious world and a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our sacred land has been decorated with such great personalities who have served humanity with selflessness.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Sister Nivedita, is one of these extraordinary people.
Margaret Elizabeth Nobel was born in Ireland but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of Nivedita.
Pendit means complete dedication
Later, he proved himself to be a favourite worker.
Yesterday marked the 150th birth anniversary of Shri Nivedita.
Swami Vivekananda's cars were so impressed that he sacrificed his happy life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was deeply distressed by the atrocities in the British Raj.
Not only did the British make our country a rose, but they also tried to make us a rose psychologically.
Our culture has been decreasingly inferior and inferior.
Sister Nivedita ji re-established the pride of Indian culture.
He wanted people to be united by awakening the national consciousness.
He went to various countries across the globe and raised his voice against the anti-democratic practices of Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
Renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati, his revolutionary poem Pudumarie Penn, New Woman and women empowerment are well known.
It was believed that his inspiration was sister Nivedita.
Sister Nivedita Ji also assisted the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
Basu helped in innovation and dissemination through his writings and conferences.
It is a beautiful feature of India that spirituality and science are helpful in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are the best examples.
In 1899, there were plagues in Kolkata and hundreds of people lost their lives.
Sister Nivedita did not take care of her own health and started the work on road sanitation.
She was such a woman who could lead a comfortable life but she was associated with the service of the poor.
People took inspiration from their sacrifices and helped them in the service.
He taught people the lessons of cleanliness and service through his work.
On his commemoration, he said, "Hear Repositions Sir Nivedita Hu Give Hall to India" - Sir Nivedita is relaxing here, who gave her all to India.
Undoubtedly, they have done this.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
They are the heroes of building a New India.
Our anxiety is correct when the diseases are older and they are now seen in small kids as well as in the last stage of their life.
Even youngsters had this kind of disease with exception.
But now our lifestyle has changed.
Such diseases are now known as lifestyle disorders .
Such diseases should occur in young age that are less physical activity and changes in food habits.
There is a need for the society and families to pay attention to these things.
When we think about it then we will realize that there is no need to move forward.
There is only a need to change our habits by routinely changing our habits.
Instead of going to Lifton, you should get the habit of climbing the jinna.
After dinner, the entire family should try to walk with the children.
Yoga for Young India
This Yoga, especially our young friends, will be helpful in embracing a lifestyle and protecting from lifestyle disorders.
The specialty of Yoga for 30 minutes before school is that Yoga is easy and universal.
And I would like to say that Yoga can easily be done by a person of any age group.
They can learn simple methods and they can do anything for the sake of accomplishing it.
There is no need for special resources or fields for this.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there has been good news in the field of sports in the last few days.
Our sportspersons have brought laurels for the country in various fields.
India won the Asia Cup hockey trophy in Hockey.
Our sportspersons performed the best and with this, India became the Asia Cup Champion after 10 years.
Earlier, India had become the Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2007.
I convey my best wishes to this hockey team and all of them from across the country.
There is a news report in Badminton after Hockey.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth won the Denmark Open Trophy and gave a fillip to the countrys pride.
This is his third Super Series Premiere Award after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
Friends, FIFA Under Seventeen World Cup was organized this month.
Many confederations from across the globe came to India and showcased their skills on the football field.
I also got the opportunity to see a confrontation.
Sportspersons were enthusiastic.
This big event of the World Cup, the whole world was watching us.
I was glad to see such a big fight and the energy, enthusiasm and enthusiasm of young sportspersons.
The World Cup event was successful and all the teams exhibited the best.
Even though India did not get a tear, Indian sportspersons won the hearts of all.
Enjoying the sports festival with India, the entire competition became thrilling and entertaining for football lovers.
There are indications that the future of football is bright.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, all the people who have written about Swachh Bharat, I have to do the Mann Ki Baat programme everyday to give justice to their feelings.
Some young children send photos of their efforts and some youngsters have a role in it.
If there is a story of new initiatives related to cleanliness, then there is a news of change in the mindset due to the zeal of an officer.
Just a few days ago, I received a detailed report, which narrates the legislation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
At the same time, a voluntary organization called the Ecological Protection Organization (EPO) launched the Swachhta Abhiyan at the Chandrapur Fort.
In this campaign that lasted for two hundred days, people did not stop, they did not get tired, they did the work of cleaning the fort.
I was enchanted to see the photographs and those who saw this photo, who had been disappointed with the surrounding uncleanness in their minds, they might also feel that how the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled.
It will change our disappointment into confidence.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
Guru Nanak Devji is not only the first Guru of Sikhs but also the Jagadguru.
He spoke of the well-being of the entire humanity, and addressed the gathering.
He emphasized on women empowerment and womens dignity.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled 28 thousand kilometers and during this journey, he taught the teachings of truthful humanity.
He interacted with the people and showed the path of truth, sacrifice and devotion.
He gave the message of social equality and this teaching was not only spoken but also demonstrated in his work.
He started anchor, which created a sense of service for the people.
The essence of unity and equality in the people was awakened by the consumption of food sitting together.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages of meaningful life - Remember God, labour, work and help in times of need.
Guru Nanak Devji had created Gurbani to tell his elements.
In the coming year 2019, we will celebrate the 55th Prakash Year of Guru Nanak Devji.
Let us try to walk on the path of his message and teachings.
My dear countrymen, two days later on 31st October we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji.
We are aware that he had laid the foundation of a modern India.
Today we can learn a lot from this great saintly life of Mother India.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is that he not only gave transformative ideas but also sought practical solutions from complex problems to achieve them.
He was an efficient expert in realizing his thoughts.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had made India a hub.
It is ensured that crores of Indians can be brought under the umbrella of a nation and a Constitution.
He empowered them to overcome all odds in their decision-making.
He respected wherever he needed to be respected.
Wherever there was a need to use force, they used force.
He set a target and with that goal, he was guided by a determination.
It was only possible to keep the country together.
He dreamt of a nation where all the people would be equal.
I believe that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels ideas are always inspiring.
He had said, "No discrimination of caste can stop us, all are the daughters and daughters of India, we should love the country and make a future of mutual love and harmony.
These ideas of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring and integrated for our Vision of a New India.
And his birthday was celebrated as National Unity Day.
I urge all of you to participate in this festival of Run for Unity.
Dear countrymen, after Diwali holidays, with a new resolve and with a new resolve, all of you have come to your daily lives.
My best wishes to all my countrymen for fulfilling their dreams.
Thanks a lot.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat through All India Radio.
Today it is 36th.
Most of them are inspiring to me.
Many things are required to reform the government.
There are also some personal grievances.
I take half an hour every month but people send their words on Mann Ki Baat for thirty days.
As a result, the government has also got sensitivity.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is an incomplete journey of the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
Perhaps in such a short span of time I have got the opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of the common man of the country.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Acharya Vinoba always used to say, "Non-governmental, non-governmental" mushrooms are effective.
This thing has been kept away from the political colors and instead of being distracted in the subject that has been distracted at that time, we have tried to connect with us with a stable mind instead of being distracted.
Now after three years, social researchers, universities, researchers, intellectuals and media experts will definitely analyze this.
And I believe that this idea will be more useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future.
Once I had said in Mann Ki Baat that we should not go out while eating, we need to take as much food as we need.
After this I saw that letters from every corner of the country came to me in large numbers.
Many social organisations, many youngsters have already been working on this thing.
I came to know that there are a lot of people who are working to bring together the food that is supplied in the plate and how it can be utilised.
Once I saw the Selfie with Daughter of a Sarpanch of Haryana and I told them in Mann Ki Baat.
However, not only in India but also in the whole world, a big campaign like Selfie with Daughter has started.
This is not just the issue of social media.
This event made every daughter a new self-confidence, a new pride.
A few days ago, I was interacting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
I told the people who are going to visit outside that wherever you go on the theme of Incredible India, you sent photographs of lakhs of photographs.
In a way, it has come from every nook and corner of India and it is a big step for the people working in the tourism sector.
I have experienced this thing because of Mann Ki Baat that how a small event can create a big movement.
Today, I was thinking that Mann Ki Baat had started for three years. During the last three years, several incidents touched my heart.
The country is thinking every moment to go through the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the betterment of the society, for the progress of the country.
I have understood, understood and learnt from the countrymen in my three-year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
I salute the countrymen from the bottom of my heart.
Once I had talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, I had said that Khadi is not a textile but a thought.
Once again I would like to urge you to continue with the Khadi campaign that has started.
If we buy Khadi then we should work with this feeling that we will burn the lamps in the houses of the poor.
This work will give strength to the poor of our country and that is why we should do this thing.
How to introduce new technologies, how to increase productivity and how to handle solar energy
The idea is to revive the system which has been closed for 20-20, 25-25 and 30-30 years.
Now the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri in Varanasi Sevapur in Uttar Pradesh has been closed for 26 years but now it has been revived.
It has also been linked to several organizations.
Many people were provided new employment opportunities.
In Pampore, Kashmir, Khadi and Village Industries have started their training centres once again and there is a lot to contribute to the Kashmir region.
Now with the resumption of this training centre, it is going to help in modernising the new generation, weaving cloth and inclusion of new things. I believe that when a large corporate house offers gifts, they have recently started providing Khadi products.
People have also started giving Khadi goods while visiting each other.
Cleanliness will connect people to people.
Your Honble President started this work and the entire nation participated in it.
Everyone, be it the elderly, the men or women or the cities or the villages, has become a part of this cleanliness drive.
When I say that Sankalp se Siddhi is now moving towards a solemn pledge, we all are witnessing it.
Everyone accepts, cooperates and contributes something or the other to realize this movement.
I thank the Honble President.
But at the same time, every section of the country has accepted it as its work.
And it is a matter of great pleasure for me that in the first four days, more than 75 lakh people have participated in more than 40 thousand programmes in the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign.
One thing is that we have to do cleanliness somewhere, the other thing is that we dont want to do cleanliness by being aware, but if we want to make cleanliness a habit then we also need a ideological movement.
The Swachhata Hi Seva campaign has been accompanied by several competitions.
More than 2. 5 crore children participated in the essay competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children took out pictures.
Using his ideas, he took out pictures on the subject of cleanliness.
Many people wrote poetry and during these days, the pictures that my child friends and young boys have sent are posted in social media.
Whenever I come to the topic of cleanliness, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
These people have taken this movement forward in a very good manner.
They are also leading the Swachhta movement in their own way.
We can observe this Swachhata Hi Seva Movement in our country that how much electronic media and print media can serve the country.
Just a few days ago, some of my friends had taken note of the 18-year-old young Bill Dar of Srinagar.
No, there is nothing like that.
Bill Dar has been doing the work of cleanliness for five to sixty years since the age of 12-13 years.
The largest lake in Asia is near Srinagar, be it plastic, polyethylene, polythene or waste or waste or clean the lake.
Bill Dar is younger than the age, but it has become an inspiration for everyone who loves cleanliness.
I congratulate Bill Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that future history is born out of the womb of history and when it comes to history, it is natural to remember great men.
This month of October is a month to remember many of our great men.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri is on the 11th of October, the birth anniversary of Jayprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh and on 25th of September it is the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.
This is the birth centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
What was the center of all these great men
Nanaji Deshmukh left his political career and was engaged in the work of Gramodaya. And it is quite natural to have respect for the work of his village when his centenary year is being celebrated.
Abdul Kalam ji used to talk about Nanaji Deshmukhs rural development during his interaction with the youngsters.
He used to mention Nanajis work with great respect and he himself went to the villages to see Nanajis work.
Deendayal Upadhyay ji, like Mahatma Gandhi, spoke of the last person in the society.
Sardar Saheb had united the entire country.
Now we should also run for unity and take forward the mantra of unity.
We can say with great ease, naturally, "Ekta in diversity-India's specialty".
We respect diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I would like to reiterate to my countrymen that especially to my younger generation, we are awakening.
Summer vacations are there, Diwali is there, we have to go out somewhere in our country.
People go out as tourists and it is very natural .
But sometimes it is a matter of concern that our people are not able to see our country, they are not able to understand the diversity of the country.
You must go out of the country, I don't oppose it, but should you ever visit any place in our country
Looking at the life of Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, one more thing is that whenever he visited India, he was inspired to see India and at the same time he was inspired to live for this country and to sacrifice his life for this country.
All these great men had made extensive visits to India.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to understand and understand India.
The value addition in tourism will be such that when we do not just go to the top of our childhood, we become a student and we try to understand his life.
I have got the opportunity to spend the night in more than 4. 500 districts. And today, when I take this great responsibility in India, I am feeling immensely benefitted.
It does not take time at all.
I urge all of you that in this vast India, there is not just a declaration of unity in diversity, it is a repository of our unconventional strength.
There are many types of food habits in our country .
Even if we keep eating a new item throughout our life, there are so many types that the first item will not come again.
Now, this is a big strength of our tourism.
I believe that if you go out somewhere this time too, you will carry forward my first mission.
You must send photographs on Hash Tag Incredible India.
If you meet the people there, send them photographs.
I have an idea in my mind that what can be the seven best tourist destinations in our state to promote tourism in India, every Indian should know about those seven special places in our state.
If possible go to seven places .
Can we provide some information about these places
Can we provide this information on the Narendra Modi App
Can we give this information on Hashtag Incredible India
Just imagine, if all the people in a state start giving such good information then I will tell the government that they should snatch the information that has come from every state and prepare the literature about the seven things that have come from every state.
This means in a way how can tourist destinations be encouraged by the people's intentions
The Government of India will work on it.
Come, join me.
You can also become a major and important partner in promoting tourism in the country from October to March.
I invite you for that.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch my heart.
There is a rift in my mind.
Something in my mind gets overwhelmed.
In the end, I am a human being like you.
The Indian Army has been awarded two brave as Lieutenant Swati and Fund.
Extraordinary for this, the husband of both Swati and Nidhi had become martyrs serving Mother India.
You can imagine that if we lose wealth at such a young age then how will we have a mindset
However, Swati Mahadik, wife of Shaheed Karnal Santosh Mahadik, decided to face this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months to fulfil the dreams of his husband.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, his husband Mukesh Dubey was a hero in the army and became a martyr in the motherland.
His wife Nidhi decided that we should be recruited in the army and he has fulfilled his determination.
It is natural for every countrymen to have a sense of respect for our mothers and sisters.
I congratulate both of these sisters from the bottom of my heart.
My dear countrymen, during the festival of Navratri and Diwali, there has been a great opportunity for the youth of the country.
This year, the FIFA World Cup is being held in our country under 17 years.
I am confident that I will have to hear the soccer announcement all around.
Generations of every age group will have an interest in football.
Your youngsters are not seen playing in schools and colleges in India.
Come, the whole world is going to play on the soil of India, so that we can make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
There is a time of worship of Mother Durga.
How the entire atmosphere has been filled with sacred aroma.
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, when the whole country celebrates festivals, on the other hand, there is a news of violence from any part of India then it is natural for the country to worry about it, this is the country of Buddha and Gandhi Ji.
Sardar Patel's country is a country that brings laurels for the betterment of the country.
Our ancestors of generations have accepted the values of public life, non-violence and equal respect in our non-violence.
Ahimsa Parmo Dharma has been heard since childhood.
Even from the Red Fort, I had said that violence will not be carried out in the name of faith, whether it is communal belief or belief in political ideology, be it faith in the person or belief in the tradition or belief in the name of faith, nobody has the right to take the law.
I would like to assure the countrymen that the laws are being taken, those people who suppress the path of violence or groups will never tolerate this country and no government will tolerate it.
Everyone will have to face the law.
Thousands of years of cultural traditions, because of cultural traditions, social traditions, historical events and events, perhaps in 365 days there should not be a single day in which there will be no peace.
Now you must have seen that our festivals are going on according to the nature cycle.
There is a simple relationship with nature .
Most of our festivals are associated with the farmers.
First of all, I would like to call you "Manchami Dukkadam".
Yesterday, the festival of Sansadri was celebrated in the Jain community.
In Jain society, a festival is organized in the month of Bhadrama.
The last day of the auspicious festival is the sanskari day.
This is a unique tradition.
The day of Samvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way it also turns into a day of forgiveness and on this day it has a tradition of calling one another a bit of forgiveness .
We have heard this thing and Mahatma Gandhi used to say that forgiveness is the specialty of a strong man.
Shakespeare has written in his drama the importance of compassion in The Marchant of Venice, "Marcy is Two Blest, Wit Blesset with him gives and him That Takes. And whoever has been forgiven, both are blessed with the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great joy in every corner of the country.
When the subject of Ganesh Chaturthi comes to the fore then it is natural to speak on the Ganesh festival .
The festival of Ganesh-Chaturthi is going on for ten days.
It is regarded as a symbol of unity, equality and goodwill.
Ganesh Festival greetings to all the countrymen.
Recently, the festival of Onam was celebrated in Kerala.
An Onam in the various festivals of India is the main festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for our social and cultural significance.
Currently this festival is seen to be the reason for attraction of tourism.
I would like to tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal has become an attraction for tourism in a way.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think about what we can do in that direction.
In the series of festivals, Id-ul-uha will be celebrated across the country on the same day.
Id-ul-uha greetings to all my countrymen.
The festivals are a symbol of faith and belief for us.
The sanctuaries of our New India have to be a symbol of cleanliness.
In family life, festivals are associated with cleanliness.
Preparation of a festival means cleanliness is not a new thing for us.
But there is a need to become a social nature.
Cleanliness should become an integral part of our country, not only in our homes but in the entire village, in the entire city, in our entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country.
My dear countrymen, the interpretation of modernisation is changing.
Eco-Friendly Ganapati is a big campaign.
If you look at the YouTube, you are making the Maul Ganpati of every household, you are making it Ganapati by bringing the soil.
Somebody is colouring vegetables, somebody is sliding on paper.
Different types of experiments are being conducted in every family.
And it is rare that when we experience new experiments.
Three years ago, when Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will take three years on 2nd October.
Its positive results are visible.
Toilets have reached nearly 67 per cent from 39 per cent.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
A few days ago, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water of the flood was less then dirt had spread everywhere.
On the occasion, activists of Ulema-e-Hind at Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat performed sequential cleaning of 22 temples and 3 mosques in a sequential manner.
Automatic sweat disappeared, all the people came out.
Excellent example of unity for cleanliness, inspiring examples of everyone, were given by all the activists of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.
We have dedicated ourselves towards cleanliness and if it becomes a permanent emotion then where can our country go
My dear countrymen, I call upon all of you that once again 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, I used to say 'Swachhta Hi Seva', 'Swachhta Hi Seva' and 'Swachhta Hi Seva'.
Make the environment of cleanliness in the whole country.
We should look for opportunities whenever we get the opportunity.
But we all come together.
On holidays or Sundays we will come together and work together.
We will go to the neighbourhoods but we will work with a movement.
I urge all the NGOs, schools, colleges, social and cultural political leaders, government officials, collectors and Sarpanches to create an atmosphere of unprecedented cleanliness for 15 days before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation MyGov.
In an in-house, a department has been created where after the construction of toilets you can write your name and the name of the family that you have helped.
My friends of social media can run some constructive campaigns and actually work on the lines of the world.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is organising the Swachh Siddhi Competition of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan with essay competitions, short film making competitions and painting competitions.
In this, you can write essays in different languages and there is no bond of age in them.
You can make short films with your mobile phone.
You can make a 2-3-minute film that will inspire cleanliness.
It can be in any language.
I invite everyone to join this cleanliness mission.
Once again, I would like to reiterate that on 2nd October, we should take a pledge to commemorate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October and that is why Swachhta Hi Seva will reach every household from 15th September.
Some steps have been taken for cleanliness.
Make it part of yourself by working hard.
You see how the theme of Gandhi Jayanti will shine on 2nd October.
You can imagine that after this 15-day Swachhta Abhiyan, on 2nd October, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti, we will be happy to pay homage to the true venerable Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to particularly accept my loan.
I express my gratitude to you all from the bottom of my heart that we have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for a long time and I want to express my gratitude to you all for accepting the loan that millions of people of the country are getting connected with Mann Ki Baat through Mann Ki Baat programme.
I get the opportunity to understand the feelings of the people of the country.
The more eagerly you look forward to Mann Ki Baat, the more I look forward to our message.
I am impossible because I get to learn something from all of you.
I express my gratitude to all of you for your contribution.
We are connecting with our mobile phones and we are becoming a part of these wrong habits.
Prime Minister, I speak Aparna from Pune.
I would like to tell you about my friendship that she always tried to help the people but I was tired of seeing her habit.
Once I had gone to the shopping mall with him.
We make payments at a very large place, but we dont trust our hardworking brothers.
Do we not think that some of the goods that are sold at home, some of the goods that are sold at a pass ferry, sometimes some of the shopkeepers who sell vegetables, sometimes they are connected to the Otto Reservoirs, when they are connected to the people who are suffering from problems, then we express our feelings with them.
Not only this, he wants to reduce the amount by Rs. 2-5. And he used to go to a big hotel and even if he does not see the bill then he pays the money.
The question for him is not of rupee but of how much trouble his heart may have been.
He is poor and hence he has doubted his honesty that there will not be any difference in your life for two to five rupees.
Madam, I am grateful to you all for giving me a message by calling the heart-touching phone.
I believe that even my countrymen will leave such behavior with the poor.
My dear young friends, on 29th August the entire country is celebrating National Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to hockey is incomparable.
I would like to recall this thing that I believe that the new generation of our country should be associated with sports.
Sports should become a part of our lives.
If we are young countries of the world then the youth of our country should be seen in the field of sports.
Sports is physical well-being, intellectual readiness, emotional co-existence.
I understand what more is needed than this
In a way, sports is a burden that connects the heart.
Our young generation should come forward in the field of sports. Today, in the age of computers, I want to tell you that sports is more important than sports stations.
Playing FIFA on the computer but showcasing some performance on the outer field.
The joy of playing cricket on the open ground is different from the cricket on the computer .
There was a time when the kids of the family used to go out and they used to ask you that you would do it at home.
Today the situation is such that as soon as the children come home they watch games or cartoons on the mobile and ask the mother to ask if you are going out for some time.
There was a time when mother said to the child , Have you ever come to know that you are going to come out with such a time
Our youngsters are happy to note that the FIFA Global Cup is being organised under the 17th year of October 6-28.
Today, when I was talking about sports, I would like to tell the people that the event that touched the heart last week has happened.
I got the opportunity to meet a young girl. Some of them were born in the Himalayas.
Sometimes he spent 30-30 days in water and this is the first time in the world that this is the first incident of snow in the waves of the sea.
Who would be an Indian who would not feel proud of the daughters of Asia
I salute the daughters of these daughters and I exhorted them to share this experience with all the countrymen.
I will also provide a separate place for Narendra Modi's experience.
Because we must read their experiences because it is an adventurous story, it is a story of adventure and I am glad that if these daughters have reached us then my best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
It is the birth anniversary of former President of our country Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
Teachers are important qualities to enjoy creative emotions and knowledge amongst our students.
Can we make a solemn pledge when we celebrate Teachers Day this time
I would like to show you the path of achieving this goal for five years. And after five years you will be happy to enjoy yourself with your resolutions.
There is such an incident in the life of every teacher that his efforts will have transformed the lives of somebody.
If we make collective efforts then we can play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
I work for the Indian Research Centre at Harvard University, Mumbai.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is a matter of discussion not only of India but also of the pundits of the entire world.
The scheme was launched on 28th August, 2014 with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, the scheme will be completed by 3 years.
30 crore new families have been connected and bank accounts have been disbursed.
Today, I am glad that the poor people of the society have been made a part of the economy of the country.
Now an atmosphere of restraint has been created.
He feels that money will be used for children.
Some good work can be done in the future.
Moreover, if a poor person sees RuPay card in his pocket then he feels like a sweetheart, this is a credit card in his pocket, there is RuPay card in my pocket.
He experiences a gentle experience.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Rs. 65 thousand crore is being deposited in the bank.
This is their strength in the coming years and the insurance for the accounts that have been opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has also been removed.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) is one rupee and thirty rupees.
If something happens to the mainstream of the family due to the insurance of one rupee per family then its family will get Rs. 2 lakhs.
Today it is not so long but I will tell the people of the bank to upload it to my gov. in.
My dear countrymen, once again I express my heartfelt condolences.
Thank you very much.
The heart of the person is such that he feels very charming in the rainy season.
Animals, birds, trees, nature all are pleased with the arrival of monsoons.
But this rain sometimes takes the form of a record and then it becomes clear that there is a huge power to destroy the water.
Nature gives us life, nurtures us, but sometimes it becomes terrible and devastating due to natural calamities like floods and earthquakes.
Whatever changes are taking place in the changing weather and environment, they are also having a very negative impact.
In the last few days, some parts of India, particularly Assam, North-Eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, are facing natural calamities due to heavy rainfall.
Full monitoring is being done in the flood affected areas.
Whether it is the Indian government's army, the air force, the people of NDRF, the expedition teams, all of them dedicate themselves to the service of the disaster victims in such times.
Farming, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electrification and connectivity are all affected.
People are also talking about their problems.
Gradually, we can manufacture timelines for our work as per the weather forecasts, which will help in avoiding possible losses.
When I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I can see the citizens of the country preparing for it more than me.
I have received a lot of letters on the subject of GST, a lot of phone calls have been received and people are still enjoying the GST and also expressing their gratitude.
One of these phone calls will also tell you: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I would like to speak to Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard the address of your Chartered Accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, GST was launched in our country on the same date last month.
The way the government had expected this decision and whether the results are being received after a month or not, what can we say
I want to hear your thoughts about this.
Approximately a month has passed since the introduction of GST and its benefits have also started becoming visible.
When a poor person writes letters to me about how the prices of essential commodities of the poor have come down due to GST then I feel extremely satisfied and happy.
What was the reason for not knowing that GST was initially apprehensive, but now it is learnt about it and so it seems that it is easier to work in the remote mountains of Ishaan.
These facilities are not only available but they are also getting support for the economic momentum of the hinterland.
The speed at which this change has taken place smoothly, the speed at which this change has been made, the speed at which it has been re-registered, has created an atmosphere of trust in the entire country.
Scholars in the field of economics, scholars in the field of management, scholars in the field of technologies and innovations, Indias experiments in the experiments of GST will sometimes be presented to the world as an ideal system.
It will become a hair study for many universities of the world.
This is because there has been such a massive change in the country and it is a big step to successfully implement this tax in such a vast country with the participation of millions of people.
All decisions have been taken unanimously by the States and the Centre.
As a result, every government has prioritized that due to GST, there should not be any excessive burden on the expenditure on the food grains of the poor.
You are well aware of the fact that what was the price of a thing before the GST, what would be the price of a new situation, all the information is available on the GST App on the mobile.
I sincerely congratulate all the Ministries, all the departments, all the Central and State Government employees for this work.
GST is an excellent example of the victory of India's collective powers.
This is a new historic victory.
And this is not just a concept but a system that strengthens a new authentic culture.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again I offer my heartfelt congratulations to millions and millions of countrymen for the smooth completion of such a big work.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
In a way, several such incidents have taken place in the month of August that are associated with the history of freedom.
This year we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
However, very few people would be aware that Dr.
Yusuf Meher Ali.
Your new generation should know what happened on 9th August, 1942.
What could be a bigger inspiration than this
The uit India Movement was an important struggle in the Indian freedom struggle.
This movement had made the country free from the British rule.
This was the time when India had become a part of the uit India Movement against the British monarchy, in every corner of India, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, be it
Responsing to Mahatma Gandhi's call, millions of Indians had laid down their lives in struggle with the mantra of 'Karo die'.
Millions of youngsters of the country had given up their education and had switched to books.
The great men like Lohia and Jayprakash Narayan played a key role.
Gandhijis two different forms are visible in both the collaboration movement and the uit India Movement - 1920 and 1942.
The format of the Cooperation Movement was different and in 42 years there was such a situation that the intensity increased so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karo or Die'.
It was the peoples support, the peoples capabilities, the peoples resolve and the peoples struggle behind all these successes.
The entire country was fighting together.
Sometimes I believe that if we look at the pages of history then India's first freedom struggle was established in 1857.
This freedom struggle, which began in 1857, was going on in some or the other parts of the country till 1942.
This lengthy period awakened the spirit of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone is committed to doing something or the other in that direction.
Generations changed but the resolutions did not go down.
People used to come, they were connected, they used to go away, new people used to come and the country was making every effort to thwart the British rule.
Only five years would have been decisive.
Now I want to connect you with this math.
We became independent in 1947.
Today, the year 2017 is going on.
The incident took about 70 years.
Governments came in the middle of the year.
Arrangements have been made, changed, changed and increased.
Everyone has made their own efforts to make the country problem-free.
Efforts have been made to increase employment in the country so that poverty is overcome and development is achieved.
Difficulties were also raised in their own way.
And it was a success.
He added that heights have also been achieved.
For example, from 1942 to 1947, it was five years of resolution.
Similarly, from 2017 to 2022, I see that the period of five years in the journey of Sankalp se Siddhi is now before you.
We should celebrate this 15th of August 2017 as a solemn pledge and when we complete 75 years of our independence in 2022 then we will fulfill that solemn pledge.
Today, it is not the announcement of 'Karenge Maarenge', it is not the solemn pledge of getting connected with this resolution of a New India.
We want to live and fight with this resolution.
On August 9, this year, I will run a grand campaign from the resolution to its achievement.
Every Indian, social institutions, local systems, schools, colleges, different organisations - everyone should make a new resolution for New India.
And a resolution that will be proved in the next five years.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
We will become a part of this solemn pledge and we will definitely be online wherever we may be.
Therefore, I invite my young friends, especially those who are coming online, to come forward to contribute in their innovative ways in the creation of a New India.
Using technology, we should take up all these things like video, post, blog, eyes and innovative ideas.
May this mission become a mass movement.
uit India uiz will be launched for young friends on the NarendraModiApp.
This question on uit India is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you will spread it on a wider scale.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as a Prime Servant of the country, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort.
I am only on the occasion.
You must send your thoughts on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
I read it myself and I will try to get this idea in the amount of time I get on 15th August.
During the last three years, I have received a complaint about my 15th August address that my speech is a little longer.
I will complete it in more than 40-45-50 minutes.
There is a socio-economics in the economy of India.
And that economics can never be underscored.
Our festivals are not just a matter of joy and joy.
Our festivals are also the medium of social reform.
But at the same time, every festival of yours is directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
In a few days, Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, Ganesh Festival after that, the fourth moon after that, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Diwali will be held together and this is the time when the poor get the opportunity to connect with their economy.
And a natural joy mixes in these festivals.
And if we talk about the economy then hundreds of families start making reservoirs through small household industries several months before the festival of Rakhi.
From Khadi to silk treasures, how many types of reserves are produced and now people have become more fond of homemade and household reserves.
Thousands and millions of people are associated with the business of making surpluses, sellers, sweets.
It is directly related to those poor families who make small lamps of soil.
But today, I want to take up the issue of environment while talking about the economy of the poor people associated with festivals and festivals.
And they have urged me to talk about eco-friendly Ganesh idols in the context of Ganesh Festival so that people can imagine the idol of soil from now on.
At the outset, I am grateful to these aware citizens.
He urged me to take up this topic beforehand.
This year's Ganesh Mahotsav has a special significance.
And I am sure that you all will be associated with this solemn pledge.
And it will provide employment to the poor artisans and poor artists who have built these statues.
Let us connect our festivals with the poor, let us connect our festivals with the economy of the poor, let us enjoy our festivals with the economic benefits of the poorest of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the various festivals and festivals.
We feel proud and proud of our daughters.
Just a few days ago, our daughters performed brilliantly in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players this week.
I felt very nice to speak to them, but I realized that the world wrestler was not able to win.
Her face was stretched with this stroke.
I told them a different analysis.
I said, "Look, today there is such a period of fame that expectations are increased in it.
They are increased so much that when success is not achieved then the same aspirations change in the shock.
We have seen many such games in which the sportspersons of India get angry with the sportspersons.
Some people leave their limits and talk about things that are extremely painful in writing.
But it was for the first time that even though our daughters did not win the World Cup, 125 crore Indians took the burden of defeat on their shoulders.
Indeed, the young generation of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to brighten the country.
Once again I congratulate the young generation of the country, especially our daughters from the bottom of my heart.
Every citizen of the country should make a solemn pledge and every citizen of the country should make a solemn pledge in the next five years.
Let us move forward together, let us do something or the other.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
The weather is changing.
Summer was also very strong this year.
However, due to heavy rains, the rainy season has reached its peak and its next phase is going on smoothly.
In many parts of the country, there is a hazardous atmosphere due to heavy rains.
After the rains, the caravans have been relieved from the scorching heat of the last few days.
And all of you have seen that no matter how rushing life, no matter how tense it is, be it personal life or be it public life, the arrival of monsoon changes our mindset.
Today the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great reverence and enthusiasm in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated.
The poor people of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath ji.
The people whom Dr . . .
Babasaheb Ambedkar has been studied and he must have seen that he should admire the temples and traditions of Lord Jagannath as it involves social justice and social harmony.
The holy month of Ramadan was celebrated with a sacred spirit of reverence.
Now it is the festival of Eid.
My best wishes to you all on the occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is the month of donating Pune.
It is a month of enjoyment and the more joyous it is, the more enjoyable it is.
Let us all come together and take inspiration from these sacred festivals and take the country forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, an extremely inspiring event of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
The families of about three and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in those small villages. In a way, the population of the brothers and sisters of our Muslim families is more there.
During this Ramzan, the villagers have decided to construct toilets together.
The government also provides assistance to these individual toilets and assisted them with an estimated cost of Rs. 17 lakhs.
You spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villages of Mubarakpur for transforming this holy day into an opportunity for the welfare of the society.
One of his stories is very inspiring.
And most importantly, he made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
You are aware that three states of Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana will also be declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration of these five states, the government and the people for completing this work.
Then somewhere that organ of the body or the mind falls.
This is also the subject of cleanliness.
These evil habits have become a part of our nature.
We have become a part of our habits.
We have to make regular efforts to get rid of this.
Everyone will have to pay attention.
We will have to recall the good inspirational events again and again.
And I am glad that cleanliness is no longer a government programme.
It is becoming a movement of the society, of the common man.
And when the people sitting in the government take this work forward with the participation of the people then its strength increases several times.
Recently, a great event came to my notice that I would like to tell you.
This is the incident in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration of this place has taken up a major task from the peoples participation.
100 hours of tireless campaign.
And what is the goal
Construction of toilets in 10,000 houses in 71 Gram Panchayats within 100 hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be glad to hear that people and administrations have successfully completed 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages became Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate the people of the government, government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district. They have set an inspiring example with relentless hard work.
Prakash Tripathys awareness towards democracy is commendable.
And democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
Internal awareness is the price of liberation.
Regular awareness about democracy was essential and therefore we used to remember those things that were inflicting on democracy and move forward towards good things of democracy.
June 1975-25 was such a period that no democratic lover could forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was transformed into turbans.
The opponent tunes were pressed.
Distinguished leaders of the country, including Shri Jayprakash Narayan, were present at the venue.
Even the judiciary could not escape the shadow of the crisis.
Newspapers were made completely unemployed.
Students from today's journalism, the people working in the democracy are constantly trying to raise awareness about democracy by reminding them of the dark period.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in Turunga.
When Aribani completed one year, Atal ji wrote a poem and described the mood of that time in his poem.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is proud of the world today.
21st June, 2017, the entire world was serving Yoga.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the sun rays in the morning through Yoga.
An Indian who would not be proud of it.
It is not possible that Yoga was not practiced earlier but today it has become the reason for connecting the world with Yoga.
Most of the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga.
While people practiced Yoga in The Great Wall of China, people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 meters from the sea level, the world heritage site of Machu-Pichu in Peru.
People practiced Yoga in the shadow of the Imphal Tower in France.
In Afghanistan, in Herat, India gave a unique dimension to India's friendship by practicing Yoga on the Afghan Friendship Dam i. e.
Yoga classes were organised with Yoga Masters at UN Headquarters.
Nearly 55 thousand people from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, together performed Yoga and created a new world record.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
And for the first time I will be fortunate to do Yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers performed Yoga in Siachen where they had a temperature of 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Our Armed Forces, Border Security Forces, ITBPs, CRPFs, all have made Yoga our heritage with their work.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this is the third International Day of Yoga. I had said that I should send a photograph of the three generations of my family while doing Yoga together.
Some television channels also took up this issue.
Several photographs have been sent to me and some of them have been collected on the NarendraModiApp.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to attend my favourite programme.
In Kerala, for the past few years, P.
N.
Panikar prestigiously organises a very good event and reading day and reading month is celebrated to make people aware about the habit of keeping books and reading public books.
Now I also remember the fact that I had disposed off my mind.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a tradition in the government that if we do not want to offer floral tributes then we should give a book or welcome it by hand.
That too is the handloom of Khadi so that Khadi can be encouraged.
When I was in Gujarat, we all had a habit, but after coming here I had a habit.
However, he went to Kerala and once again that habit became aware.
And now I have started informing the lower classes in the government.
We can also gradually become a nature.
The lives of floral wreaths were very low.
Once I took my hand and I kept it.
But if a book is given then it becomes a part of the household, it becomes a part of the family.
When I am talking about this thing then how historical values were there for such things .
Last year when I had gone to England, ueen Elizabeth had invited me to dinner in London.
Lotley for many years, but ueen Elizabeth has maintained the handkerchief given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I visited, I was happy to see that.
And when I was watching it, he was urging me to touch it and see it.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I am sure these habits do not change at all and whenever they say so, the vaccine becomes wealthy.
However, we have to say these things, we have to make efforts.
Now I cant say that if I go anywhere and if someone offers me a flower glass then I will refuse it.
My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are many things to do.
However, I have developed a habit for me that I read a few letters from the letters that come to me everyday and that gives me the opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various kinds of letters come in, different kinds of letters are written in different ways.
I want to tell you about that. I want to tell you about that.
Arulmozhi Sarwan, a housewife from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, afar off South India, sent me a letter.
And what was happening, he wrote that he thought of taking some financial initiatives keeping in mind the education of children in his family so that the family could get some financial help.
I took money from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started working towards supplying some goods from the market.
Some people were asked, I have registered it myself. I would like to tell the countrymen that you too should get such an opportunity.
There is a new kind of arrangement to visit GeM.
Those who want to provide goods to the government, who want to sell the trees, who want to sell it, who want to send the table, they can register it after their name.
The people who register under EEGM, all the departments of the government are watching it.
With no agents, most of the goods are available at cheap rates.
The Arulmozhi Madmani registered the goods that the Government can provide on this website.
And it is interesting that the letters he has written to me are very interesting.
He has written that once he got the money under the Mudra Yojana, his business started, I wrote about what I could do on E-GEM and I received orders from the Prime Minister's Office.
It was a new news for me that what would be the demand of the Prime Minister's Office.
This is an opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
If Arulmozhi didn't write to me, I wouldn't have noticed that in the E-GEM system, a housewife is working far and wide, it can be purchased from the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country.
It has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
Government e-Marketplace-GeM
I would like that those who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way they should associate themselves with it.
I believe that the minimum government and the maximum administration is a good example of this and what is the goal of this thing - Minimum Prices and Maximum Accessibility, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we take pride in Yoga and on the other we can take pride in our achievements in space sciences.
And this is the uniqueness of India that if our feet are on the ground for Yoga then our dreams are to overcome the horizons of the sky.
A few days ago, India has done a lot in the field of sports and science too.
Today, India is showing its address not only in the land but also in the space.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Small Satellites, including the Cartosat-2 Malike satellite.
And, in addition to India, satellites from nearly 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America were included.
And India's Small Satellite Mission will greatly help in the field of agriculture and natural calamities.
A few days ago, you would have noticed that ISRO had successfully launched the GSAT-19.
And it was the weightiest satellite that India has launched so far.
And the newspapers in our country compared it to the weight of the elephant.
You can imagine how great our scientists have done in the field of space.
On 19th June, the Mars mission completed 1,000 days.
You would be aware of the fact that when we had successfully secured space for the Mars expedition, the entire expedition was for a period of six months.
While sending photographs, informing, scientific information is being received, it has been working for longer than the fixed life.
Having completed a thousand days, it is important for our space travel to our scientific journey.
At present, we also see that the performance of our youth is improving in the field of sports.
Recently, Indian badminton actor Kidambi Srikanth won the Indonesia Open Competition and enhanced the countrys pride.
I heartily congratulate him and his coaches for this victory.
A few days ago, I was fond of playing P.
T.
Usha got the opportunity to participate in the inauguration of the Synthetic Track of Usha School of Athletics.
You will be able to encourage sports as well as sports.
Sports plays an important role in personality development.
The importance of sports in holistic personality development is uncommon.
There is no shortage of talented sportspersons in the country.
If the children of your family are interested in sports then they should be given opportunities.
They should not be moved out of the field and locked in the room for study.
And if they study, if they can showcase their excellent performances, but if they are fond of sports, then the schools, colleges, families and the surrounding people should be encouraged.
Everyone should have a dream for the next Olympics.
It is difficult to forget the summer of this year.
Just wait for the rain.
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the auspicious occasion of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and around the world, especially to the Muslim community.
Prayer , spirituality and charity are given a lot of importance in Ramzan .
India is very fortunate that our ancestors have created such traditions and today India can proudly proud that we can proud the fact that all the communities around the world are in India.
This is a country where there are people who believe in God and those who deny God.
There are people who worship the idol and people who oppose the statue.
There is a tradition of every kind of ideology, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition here and we have imbibed the art of living with each other.
And in the end, be it religion, sect, ideology or tradition, all these things give us the same message of peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan will certainly be helpful in taking forward this path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all.
I am very happy to say that many people have responded to it.
Individually, everyone showed me the zeal of telling me what is in your minds.
I have not been able to read anything, I have not been able to hear the message of everyone.
However, some people have tried to learn music, some have tried to put their hands on new words, some people are trying to learn new things by using YouTube and they are learning new languages.
Some people are learning art, some are learning dance, some are learning drama.
Some people have written that we have started writing poetry now.
Some people are making efforts to understand nature and live with nature.
I am very happy that I would like to make a phone call to you as well.
"I speak Daksha Katyal.
When I started to fight against the freedom struggle, I realised how much struggle and sacrifices were being made for India's independence.
I was inspired by Bhagat Singh, who had achieved a lot in his young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some message to the new generation about this.
I am glad that the younger generation is keen to know about our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men spent their lives for freedom in Turanga, several youngsters climbed on the threshold of Fashi.
And that is why today we are breathing in independent India.
You must have seen that those great men who had spent their time in the freedom movement did a great job of writing and studying and their writings also strengthened India's independence.
I had gone to Andaman and Nicobar a long time ago.
I had also visited the Cellular Jail there.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote the book My Birthday in Turunga.
He used to write poems, write on walls.
They were closed in small rooms.
What kind of torture were the people who had taken up the freedom struggle
When I read Savarkar's book My Birthday, it inspired me to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a sound lighting programme which is very inspiring.
There will not be any such state in India, there will not be a single language group in India, of which no one will have to spend his life in the Cellular Turunga in Andaman Nicobar Islands.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
My dear countrymen, 5th June is the first Monday of the month.
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say - One must care about a world one will not see.
It is our duty to take care of the world that we have not seen.
If you are tired then open the window of the room, open the door, breathe in the fresh air, you get a new consciousness.
When we get in touch with those five great personalities who have formed our body then there is a new consciousness in our body and a new energy is manifested.
We all have experienced this, but we never take care of it, we dont bind it in a single thread.
You must observe that when we get in touch with our natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge within us.
And, therefore, the global mission of connecting with the nature of June 5 should become our own mission.
We are getting some benefit from our ancestors who protected the environment.
Now if we protect the environment then it will benefit the future generations.
And if we look at Atharvaveda then it is the biggest guiding composition of the environment and it was written thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth: Sono Ahm Prithviva.
It is said in the Vedas that the purity that we have in us is due to the Earth.
Earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha then one thing can be clearly seen that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the attainment of his knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana were underground.
But it needs to be pursued in modern words and with modern logic.
Through Yoga, we have connected the world with a formula.
Just as Yoga connects the body, mind, intellect and soul, it unites today.
Todays lifestyle is becoming difficult due to race and increasing responsibilities.
From a very young age also this tense mind is being seen to be suffering from psychological disorders.
In this period, Yoga has played an important role in leading a stress-free life.
Yoga is a way of ensuring health and well-being.
Yoga is not just exercise .
It is possible through yoga if we want to experience an intermediate journey with the health of the body and mind and the ethics.
Just two days ago, I have written letters to all the governments and leaders of the world.
Last year, I had announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some lakhs.
Gradually, work will be done in that direction.
I have received an instruction and I congratulate all those who have made this valuable idea.
There is a lot of psychological information.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga, and on this occasion, you should urge the three generations of the family to do Yoga together.
Aaji-azoba, i-baba, son-in-law - three generations should do yogasana together and upload their photographs.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow will have such a beautiful breakthrough that will give Yoga a new dimension.
And Im grateful to you for giving me this idea. And I believe that just as we had run a selfie with daughter's campaign and had got a very interesting experience, similarly these three generations will be able to commend Yoga in the country and the world.
Where three generations are doing Yoga, you must send a collective picture of those three generations of people on NarendraModiApp and MyGov.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow will be the photo that will guarantee the golden future.
I invite you.
The International Day of Yoga is still a three-week drive.
In a way, this prevention is a movement for health promotion.
I invite all of you to participate in it.
When you assigned me the responsibility of your Chief Servant, when I got the opportunity to speak for the first time from the Red Fort on 15th August in my tenure, I had spoken about cleanliness.
Since then, my journey has been going on from different parts of India and I have realized that Modi has been taking a close look at what Modi has done.
This is because I had received a very careful telephone call and I might have thought the way they said.
But I am grateful to them for taking this thing into consideration.
Listen to this telephone too.
Namaskar Modi ji, I am speaking Naina from Mumbai.
On Modi ji TV and social media, I often see that wherever you go, cleanliness is given a lot.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission as per your call.
Not only are the elderly participants, but there has been awareness about cleanliness in children too.
Small kids are often seen preventing the elderly from dirty roads.
The cleanliness drive that you have started from the ghats of Kashi has taken the form of a movement with your inspiration.
You are really saying that wherever I go, the government machinery does the work of cleanliness but recently there is a festival of cleanliness in the society.
Five days before I reached there, a massive cleanliness drive was launched seven days ago, ten days ago.
Just a few days ago, I had visited Kutch in Gujarat.
A massive cleanliness drive is underway there.
But I didn't know about these two things.
But after this telephone call, I thought it was true.
You can imagine how pleased I might have been by remembering this thing and the country too is taking this thing in such a way.
What else would be a matter of joy for me than being associated with cleanliness with my visitors
There is a habit of preparing for the rest for the welcome of the Prime Minister, but cleanliness has become a key factor in it.
It is also a matter of joy and inspiration for anyone who loves cleanliness.
Imagine is very good but I have to think about it.
However, it is true that this movement should continue and instead of of offering some goods and memorials, it is good to get rid of the amazing tons of garbage coming out of the cleanliness drive.
It will be such a great humanity.
Once we started treating this waste as a wealth, several innovative methods of waste management will come up for us.
Youth associated with start-ups will also come up with new schemes and new instruments.
Government of India has decided to open a massive mission of waste management with the help of governments and representatives of cities.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, about 4,000 cities will have similar tools for collection of solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of waste will be made available, one of which will be of green color and the other of blue color.
Two types of waste are produced - one is dirty and the other is dry waste .
These wastes will be stored in 4,000 cities and we will put dry waste in blue waste and wet waste in green waste.
For example, the garbage that comes out of the kitchen, be it vegetable salad, raw food, egg garment, papayachala or cooked potato, this is the entire waste and put it in green waste.
Other types of wastes include waste papers, lips, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, polythene, broken dung, rubber, metal etc.
I am sure that we will develop such a culture and we will have to take a new step in the direction of cleanliness, then we will be able to fulfil the dream of cleanliness that Gandhiji saw.
Today, I want to mention one thing with pride that even if a person decides his mind then he can create a mass movement.
Cleanliness is one such task.
For nearly 80-90 weeks, the people of Versova sea coast have been tortured and thousands of tons of waste have been wasted and today Versova beach has become clean and beautiful.
The entire responsibility of this work was taken by Versova Residence Volunteer (VRV).
Brothers and sisters, today, I have been told with great pleasure that under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Riyasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate all the citizens of the Reasi Block, its administrators and Jammu and Kashmir for setting an example.
And I have also been told that the leadership of this entire movement was women living in those areas of Jammu and Kashmir.
He took a torch morch there to create awareness and inspired people by visiting their homes and cattle.
I congratulate those mothers and sisters from the bottom of my heart, I congratulate the administrators of that place who have started a good start by making a Block Hackathon free on the land of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, three years of the present government are being acknowledged from the newspapers, TV channels and social media since last month-Pandhara.
I see this process as a very positive sign.
The tenure of these three years has been kept on every criterion.
People from every section of the society have analyzed it.
I consider all these things important, wherever there is a lot of compassion, who has supported it, where there are some errors.
I also express my gratitude to those who have given critical and important responses.
If there is light on errors and deficiencies then there is an opportunity to improve them.
It is essential for a conscious nation and a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and a good White has the same effect on me as it will be on the minds of a common man.
It seems as if I am interested in the household, the family and the household.
And there are hundreds of such families who have written to me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, when we meet again, every corner of the country would have received rains, the weather would have changed, the results of the examinations would have come, the start of a new student life would have started and along with the arrival of rains a new joy and a new fragrance would have come.
Come, let us all move ahead in such an environment that we love nature.
My best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Like a seeker, the numerous contributions of the people who have lost their lives for the society, on the other hand, the government is often overlooked.
The number of information that comes from time to time for Mann Ki Baat was analysed in detail in the government.
What are the types of information, what are the complaints, what are the experiences of the people
Normally, it has been found that man has a tendency to advise others.
If someone coughs while traveling by bus in the railways then immediately tell him to do this.
Advice , advice , as if something is in our nature .
Most of the informers are those people who are trying to reach me who really do something or the other in their lives.
They are trying their best to improve something according to their intellect, strength, capability and circumstances. And when I came to know about this, I felt that these are not general information.
Some people also do this because they feel that if the idea is that wherever they are working, if the other people listen to it and it gets a comprehensive form then it can benefit many people.
And that is why his natural desire to mention this thing in Mann Ki Baat is very positive in my view.
At the outset, I express my gratitude to the people who are mostly informants, who are doing something or the other for the society.
Moreover, whenever I mention something, I feel very happy to see such things.
Last time some people in Mann Ki Baat had informed me about food was being washed away and I had mentioned that.
And when we mentioned this thing then how many people from every corner of the country used to use innovative ideas on the NarendraModiApp and MyGov to avoid the waste of food.
I had never thought that today, especially the younger generation in our country has been doing this thing for several years.
We have heard that some social institutions have been doing it for the past few years. However, the youth of my country have been involved in this work.
Many have sent me videos.
There are several places where there is a banking system.
People store their garments, collect vegetables and take away the required people from the bank.
Those who give satisfaction also dont feel humiliated.
This is an example of how the work is being done with the cooperation of the society.
Today is the last day of April.
The States of Gujarat and Maharashtra are going to be established on 1st May.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have consistently tried to scale new heights of development.
He has contributed to the progress of the country and his life continues to inspire us in the unbroken wealth of the great men of both the states and in every sphere of the society. Remembering these great men, we should make a solemn pledge that we will take our state, our country, our society, our city, our family on the foundation day of 2022.
We should make plans to take that resolution forward and move forward with the participation of all the citizens.
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports.
The summer of May-June in our country has taken a glimpse of its experience in March-April.
And when I was asking people about Mann Ki Baat, most of the people have informed me about what to do during these summer days.
s.
Many such friends have expressed concern about birds.
They have said that water should be placed on the stove, on the stove and I have seen that small children from the family do this thing.
Once they came to know that why they used to fill this water with 10 times a day so that they can see whether the water is available in the utensils that have been stored or not.
We feel that this game is going on, but it is really a wonderful experience in the minds of children.
You too have seen that a little bit of flora and fauna makes you feel a new joy.
Just a few days ago, Shri Jagat Bhai had sent me a book from Gujarat, Save the Sparrows and he had expressed concern about the reduction in the number of specimens in it.
In our country, animals and birds, nature has coloured us with them but it is important that we should collectively strengthen such efforts.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I had completed a hundred years for the Dharmaguru Syedna Saheb of the Dawoodi Bohra Samaj.
He lived 103 years.
And on his 100th anniversary, the Bohra community had launched a massive campaign to save the spark through evil establishments.
I got the opportunity to inaugurate it.
He distributed approximately 52 thousand Bird Feeders to every corner of the world.
He has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, we are so busy with the newspapers, the supplier of milk, the vegetable holder, the postman and somebody else comes to our household.
Young friends, I have to make some mistakes with you.
I sometimes care that many of our younger generations are enjoying living a comfortable life.
Mothers and sisters also keep following them in a protective condition.
Some others are also at other ends, but most of the comfortable conditions are visible.
Now the exams are over and plans to enjoy holidays have been made.
Summer vacations, even though it is hot, may feel better.
However, as a friend, I would like to say something about your vacation.
I am sure some people will experiment and tell me.
I offer you three proposals for the use of these vacations but if you do those three then it is a very good thing but try to do one of the three.
New space, new experience, new skills.
At times there is a difference between watching something on television or reading in books or listening to it by familiars and feeling it by oneself .
The experiment should be positive, it should be beyond comfort.
We belong to a middle class family, we belong to a happy family.
Sometimes experience it, I don't say that do it again, do it once again.
In the evening, take your football, take a volleyball or take any sports literature, go to a poor village.
You will find that you should play with those poor kids yourself, you must have seen that sometimes you would have had the pleasure of sports in your life.
Whenever the children living such a life in the society get an opportunity to play with you, you people have thought that how a big change will be brought about in their lives.
And I am sure once again, I will feel like going back and forth.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many voluntary organisations work serving.
Sometimes there are very summer camps .
Personality is of development, it is of several types of development and can be a part of it.
But at the same time, you also feel that you have done such a summer exercise, you have done a course of personality development without any change, you reach out to those people of the society who have not got such a chance and those who have been taught you should teach them.
You can teach them how to do it.
I was also worried about the fact that technology came to reduce the gap and technology came to an end.
Every demographic technologies have set in place on the other hand.
Today is the era of competition.
Friends, The dream of becoming a lot in life is a good thing and the idea of doing something is good.
However, please see that the human element within us is no longer trembling, we are not going anywhere far away from human qualities.
Whether it can be a little filled up in skill development.
Efforts are being made to spend time with you, away from technology.
Be it Tamil or Telugu or Assamese or Bengali or be it Malayalam or Gujarati or Marathi or Punjabi.
And if we look closely at the diversity of our country then we can find somebody who teaches us.
If you don't swim, learn to swim, draw pictures, don't get a good picture but try to swim on some papers.
The sensitivity within you will have to appear.
Sometimes we call small things that we dont want to learn.
You will see that all these new experiments, this skill is such that you will also be happy and you will be able to get rid of the fact that life has been built in a framework.
Do something outside Chakori, friends.
This is the opportunity to make life.
And you people are wondering if all the exams are over, if you go on a new line of work then that opportunity will not come.
And that is why I tell you that if you have the rhythm of learning magic then learn the magic of the mothers.
Keep showing magic to your friends and friends.
You must try to know something that you don't know, it will definitely benefit you.
Your inner strength will be conscious and there will be a great opportunity for development.
I tell you from my experience that we get to know how much we can learn from the world that we cannot imagine.
New places, new cities, new towns, new villages, new campuses.
After going to one place stay for three days and four days.
Then go to another place and stay there for three days and four days.
This will give you a lot of learning.
When you go, you must send me a photo of that place.
Have you seen what new
Where do you go
You can share your experiences using hash tag incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you immense opportunity.
The new generation is getting almost free from cash transactions.
You also do it but you can also earn from this scheme.
The Government of India has a scheme.
If you are downloading the BHIM App, you are also using it.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you do it by 20 people in a day, you can earn 200 rupees by the evening.
Businessmen can also earn and students can earn.
And this scheme is till 14th October.
You will be contributing to making Digital India.
He was a symbol of VIP culture, but the experience showed that Red Insolvency was on the vehicle, it was on the vehicle, but gradually it was on the head and this VIP culture is deeply rooted in the head.
Now only red insolvency has gone, so no one can claim that the red insolvency might have come out.
I have received an interesting telephone.
He has expressed his courage in this telephone, but this time the telephone shows that the common man does not like it.
He feels a kind of inadequacy in it.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shiva Choubey, Jabalpur from Madhya Pradesh.
I was very proud to hear that the Veerry India is a VIP on a road written in the newspaper. And I was happy that today my time is equally important.
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic jam and I don't have to stop for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this decision.
Going to red light through government decisions is a part of the system.
But we have to remove it from our minds.
If we all make concerted efforts then we will be able to get rid of it.
Our concept of New India is to increase the importance of EPI in place of VIPs in the country and when I say EPI instead of VIP, my feeling is clear - Everi Person is Important.
Every individual has a significance, every person has a great importance.
If we accept the importance of 125 crore Indians, if we accept the importance of 125 crore Indians then how powerful it will be to fulfil the great dreams.
We all have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that we should recall our history, our culture and traditions.
It gives us energy and inspiration.
This year we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of 125 crore countrymen, Sant Ramanujacharya.
Because of some reason, we were so tired that we were thinking about it for centuries.
For other countries of the world, centuries will be of great importance.
But India is such an ancient country that we have got the opportunity to commemorate thousands of years and thousands of years old memories.
Just imagine it.
Even today, there is a lot of difficulty in solving social conventional practices.
How can it be done a thousand years ago
He himself had done his behaviour to the society whom he considered untouchables.
Thousands of years ago, he had organised a movement to enter his temple and had successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that in every age, great men have been born out of our society to wipe out the evils of our society.
On the occasion of one thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya ji, we should take inspiration from them to awaken the spirit of social harmony and organisation.
The Government of India will also publish a postage stamp to commemorate Saint Shri Ramanujacharya on 1st May.
I salute Saint Shri Ramanujacharya Ji and pay my respects.
My dear countrymen, May 1st, 2019 is another landmark.
It is also celebrated as Workers Day in many parts of the world.
And when the issue of Labour Day was discussed, labour was discussed and workers were discussed then it is natural for me to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar.
And very few people would be aware that today we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the kind of concessions that have been given to the workers.
The contribution made by Baba Saheb for the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb, I talk about Saint Shri Ramanujacharya ji, I also remember the great saint and social reformer of Karnataka, Guru Basweshwar ji in the 12th century.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to attend a function.
It was a programme to dedicate his pledge to the people.
In Kannada, he had said - "Kay Kave Kailas" means "You can get the calibre of Lord Shankar's house with your hard work, i. e.
In other words, labour is Shiva.
I talk about 'Shreshtha Jayate' again and again.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is quite natural to recall Thangdi after his death.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world.
The problems faced by the world today, the competition of violence, war, destruction and arms, whenever this kind of atmosphere is seen then the thoughts of Buddha are very relevant.
And in India, the life of Ashoka is an excellent symbol of the journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that Vesak Day is celebrated on the occasion of this great festival of Buddha Purnima by the United Nations.
This year it will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Their memories will get an opportunity to reflect.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And when we call 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' then it is not only in India but also in the global context.
Several projects are underway.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The capability and connectivity of this satellite will be very helpful in fulfilling South Asias economic and developmental priorities.
This is an excellent example of our commitment towards South Asia.
Most of the families in most parts of the country will be in the examination of their children.
Those whose examinations have been conducted, there will be a slightly stress-free environment and those whose examinations are still going on, there will be some tension in those houses.
But I would like to say this thing that during the last time I had told the students about Mann Ki Baat.
These things will certainly be useful for us during the examination.
Today is 26th March.
26 March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic fight against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of the Wang Brothers.
Today, on this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day. I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a supportive partner of Bangladesh.
And we will continue to participate in peace, security and development in this entire region by putting our shoulders together.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are our shared heritage.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the composition of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was not the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913, but the British had given him the title of Nighthood.
When the British killed the civilians in large numbers in the Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who raised their voice against the incident.
This was the period when this incident had a strange impact on the mind of a child of 12 years of age.
As a teenager, a smiling child in the fields, a gardener, a brutal genocide in the garden gave a new inspiration to life.
In 1919, he was a 12 year old boy, that is, the son of all of us, inspired by Shaheed Bhattasingh.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, Bhagsingh ji, his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British.
Bhagtsingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were at that time satisfied with the service of Mother India and there was no fear of death.
He had sacrificed all his dreams for the freedom of Mother India.
These three brave hearts are still an inspiration for us.
The saga of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru will be adorned with words.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit that place and I realized that there are special pomps in that land and I would like to tell the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity to visit Punjab then you must visit the places of Bhagsingh, Sukhdev, Rajguru and Bhagsingh's Matoshree and Budokeshwar Dutt.
This was the time when the pace of freedom and the pace of its expansion was increasing.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhattasingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for a strong revolution.
So, on 10th April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had embraced the Champaran Satyagraha a hundred years ago.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the Indian Freedom Struggle, Gandhian thoughts and Gandhian styles were reflected during the Champaran Satyagraha.
This was an important turning point in the entire journey of freedom struggle, particularly from the point of view of the methods of struggle.
This was the time, the end of the workers of Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, Ahmedabad and the deepest impact of the thoughts and work style of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917, in a small village in Bihar, he gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Gandhiji in our minds.
Imagine an individual returns to India in 1915 and his tenure of only two years.
The country was not familiar with them, it was not their impact.
You can imagine how much hardship they must have suffered at that time.
Champaran Satyagraha was an event in which Mahatma Gandhis organisational skills, Mahatma Gandhis ability to recognise the nerve of Indian society, Mahatma Gandhis vision of uniting, motivating and fighting the poorest of the poor, the illiterate people against the British rulers.
We can learn this from him and it was during that period that the big leaders you hear, Gandhiji, Rajendra Babu and Acharya Kripalani had sent everyone to the village.
And the British did not know what was the method of Gandhiji's work, the struggle was also going on and the new construction was going on.
On the one hand there was conflict and second creation.
On the one hand, we have to take up the duties and on the other we have to put ourselves together in constructive work.
This is the desire to transform the 125 crore Indians and to transform them. It is because of this that the foundation of a New India will be laid.
New India is not a government programme or a political party declaration.
New India is an appeal to 1. 25 billion Indians.
There are many people who often go to hospitals, they serve patients, there are many people who run for blood donation at the expense of their need.
Many people worry about the stomach of the hungry.
Our country is multi-dimensional.
The service of the people is divided into our nerves.
If we look at it in a collective manner, if we look at it in an organised manner then it is such a great power.
If every citizen makes a solemn pledge that I will follow the rules of transportation, if every citizen decides to fulfil his responsibilities honestly, if every citizen decides that he will not use petrol-diesel for a day in a week.
You will see that the dream of this country, the dream of a New India and 1. 25 billion Indians will be fulfilled before your eyes.
It means that every citizen should follow his civic religion, follow his duty.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to express my gratitude.
In the last few days, an environment has been created in our country that people have joined the Digital Payments and Digital Movement.
After demonetization, there has been an increase in different types of digital payments.
BHIM App has been launched only for two to two months but nearly 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it so far.
My dear countrymen, we have to move ahead with the fight against black money and corruption.
25 billion Indians will make a solemn pledge to make 2500 crore digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
125 crore Indians, if they do this thing on their minds then there is no need to wait for a year.
This work can be done in six months.
2,500 crore digital transactions, if we don't have to pay the school fees, if we don't pay the money in cash, if we don't pay digitally in the journey of railways and if we do it then we will pay digitally in the journey of air travel.
We can do this in everyday life.
In the last few days, several digitization fairs have been organized for public education and public awareness.
It is a solemn pledge to do 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been organized.
There was also a Bakshis scheme in it.
Nearly 1. 5 lakh people have got the benefits under the Lucky Consumer Scheme.
70 thousand traders have earned their livelihood .
On the occasion of the completion of 100 days, a grand event will be held at the end.
There is a big settlement in it.
I believe that we will propagate BHIM App in the number of days that are still in your hands for Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti.
We should also participate in the reduction in cash consumption and reduction in the usage of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to say that whenever I invite people for Mann Ki Baat, there are several different kinds of information.
Honble Prime Minister, my Namaskar, first of all, I congratulate you all for your victory in these elections.
I would like to tell you something in my mind.
I want to say that people should understand the need for cleanliness.
Everyday I go through that river where most people pollute the river by putting garbage in large quantities .
This river flows from the Rispna bridge and also reaches my house.
I want to say that we should bring this thing to light through a group or a new paper.
Brothers and sisters, how difficult is the daughter who has learnt eleven.
On seeing the sand dust in the river it feels very angry .
I consider this as a good sign.
This is what I want that 125 crore countrymen should get rid of dirt.
Since the Swachhta movement has started, awareness has come to the people.
Everyone has been connected with it positively.
Now this campaign has become a movement.
There is an increase in hatred about uncleanness.
Awareness and active participation has a different significance.
But cleanliness is more related to habits than the movement.
This movement is a movement to change the habit of cleanliness and it is a movement to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can be in a collective manner.
The work is difficult but it has to be done.
I believe that the spirit of awakening among the new generation, children, students and youth of the country is indicative of the good results.
Today, I would like to tell the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be the message of everyone.
Have you ever imagined how much we do in the food we give up
Have you ever imagined that this was not a mess or a waste of food then how many poor people could be filled in it
This is not a subject that needs to be explained.
When the food increases in the mother's household, she says that the child should be as much as he wants.
Attempts are being made but the sadness about it is a social treachery.
This is an injustice to the poor.
The second issue is that if savings are done then the family will get economic benefits.
I don't want to say much about this, but I believe that awareness should increase.
I am aware that some youngsters who run such missions.
He has created a mobile app.
Wherever such food is consumed or consumed, they communicate with other people and utilize that food.
The youngsters of our country are making such efforts.
You will find such people in every state of India.
Their lives also inspire us not to waste food but also to increase food as much as you want.
See, there are ways to change, those who are aware of health are often saying that the stomach should remain a little empty.
I would like to tell the countrymen that depression is not an incurable disease.
A psychological environment has to be created and treatment starts.
The first mantra of this thing is that instead of pressing sadness, it should be open.
Tell your colleagues, friends, parents, feelings and teachers in an open manner.
Sometimes the problem of loneliness is more in the students living in the hostels.
They don't come near the food table.
Have you ever noticed why he does that
This is the first step towards depression.
If he avoids staying with the entire family, if he goes to a single coach then it will not happen.
Look at those people with whom he lives openly.
Make fun of laughing and inspire him to become a man, open the knot in his mind.
This is an excellent solution.
Depression can become the cause of mental and physical disorders .
The way diabetes invites all diseases the same way it invites , adventure , ability to decide and eliminates this ability .
Your friends, your family, your environment can keep you away from getting sad and if you are sad then you can get out of that mindset.
There is one more solution.
If we cannot open up to the people near us then do one thing, where the work is being done with the help of service, go to such a place.
If we try to understand their grief with the spirit of service then a new confidence will be created in our minds.
By connecting with others, serving someone and serving individuals with selflessness, the stress on the mind becomes easier.
As such Yoga is also a good way of keeping mind healthy .
Yoga is very useful to get rid of stress, to get rid of stress, to get rid of stress and to take pleasure.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
Prepare yourself from now and celebrate the collective yoga festival in the number of lakhs.
If you want to make some suggestions on Yoga Day, then you should reach me through my mobile application.
You can compose songs and poems about Yoga so that this topic can easily reach the people.
However, in the last few days, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
It is a matter of great gratitude that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
He takes care of the responsibility of the family, he has a hand in the financial responsibility of the house, which sometimes causes injustice to the newborn.
The Government of India has taken a major decision in this regard.
Maternity Raaja, who used to get 12 weeks before, will now be given 26 weeks at the time of delivery.
In this regard, two or three countries are ahead of us in the world.
India has taken an important decision for our sisters.
Its root cause should be the care of a newborn child who is the future citizen of India.
If he gets the love of his mother in his childhood then this child will be the glory of the country tomorrow.
This will also improve the health of mothers and hence the benefit of this important decision will be about 18 lakh women.
May we get inspiration from the lives of all these great men, may we get the strength to make a solemn pledge for a New India.
After two days, Chaitra is a Shukal competition, the year is a new year of Pratipada, a new year.
It is time for the farmers to get the crop ready after the monsoon season and the fruits of their hard work .
The New Year is welcomed in different parts of our country in different ways.
Gudipadwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmir Navreh in Awadh province, Santsar Puja in Bihar, Jud-Shital in the Mithila region of Bihar, Satuwani in the province of Magadha.
India is a country with numerous diversities.
I convey my best wishes to you all for this New Year.
Thank you very much.
Winter is now over.
The weather has entered the lives of all of us .
Fruits of summer season are seen in the hypnotising mood of the unparalleled ambience .
At the same time, yellow flowers of peacock in the fields renew the minds of the farmers.
The dried flowers of rice indicate the rise of Holi.
Amir Khusro has made a very interesting description of the moment of change that takes place in nature.
Amir Khusro wrote, "Fool Rahi Sarson becomes gross, Ambawa Foot, Tesu Phule, Coal Bole, Dar-Dar.
Whenever nature is happy, whenever the environment is happy, man also enjoys this season.
The festival of Basma Panchami, Maha Shivratri and Holi fills the colour of joy in human life.
In an atmosphere filled with love, brotherhood and humanity, we will satisfy the last month of Falgun and we are decorated for the reception of the coming Chaitra month.
The season of monsoon is the confluence of these two months.
First of all, I express my gratitude to the millions and millions of people of the country for the fact that whenever I ask for your suggestions and suggestions before Mann Ki Baat, I receive a lot of information.
Excellency, I thank you for recalling Indias immense pride.
Be it poverty alleviation or prevention of diseases or be it attachment to the world or be it attachment to knowledge or be it attachment to information, technology and science have underlined our importance.
February 15, 2017 is a glorious day for Indias lives.
Our scientists have raised Indias head in front of the world with pride and you all are aware that ISRO has successfully completed several missions in the last few years.
ISRO has established a global record in the space sector in the last few days after its successful launch of the Mars mission on Mars.
This success will not only be historic for ISRO but also for the entire country.
This Cost Effective Efficient Space Programme of ISRO is a wonder for the entire world and the world has openly appreciated the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 satellites is Cartosat 2D. It is India's satellite. And Mola will be used for photographs, information, mapping, infrastructure, development information and urban development planning.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how many water bodies are there in the country and how can they be utilised
It is also a matter of happiness for us that our young scientists and women scientists have led this campaign.
This huge participation of youth and women is a part of ISROs pride in its success.
On behalf of the entire countrymen, I congratulate ISRO scientists.
These scientists have retained the aim of using space science for the service of the nation to the common man and are recording new records.
No matter how much we congratulate our scientists and their entire team, it will be less.
India's scientists have done this.
The capability of this missile is that even if there is a missile to attack India from a distance of 2000 kilometers, our missile will destroy it in space.
We are happy when we see some new technologies and some new scientific discovery.
Those who do not get the same answer, they do not stay healthy.
And if we observe the journey of thousands of years of human evolution then we can say that this journey of development is not complete.
New science, new technologies are generated and every technologies, every new science, every new era is born.
My dear young friends, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, several times I have said this in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should increase the attraction of science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Today's scientific temperament can be a cause of sustainable change in the lives of future generations.
A few days ago, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had organised a very different competition on the occasion of the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Social useful discoveries were invited.
Sometimes the problem underscores the importance of science in finding answers.
Mumbai received heavy rainfall in 2005, flooded Mahapura, sea conditions and several hurdles.
Whenever there is a natural calamity, one can see the most crisis on the poor.
Two people worked very enthusiastically and developed such a system of housing that will save the households, save the people living in the house, save water from coming home and save the diseases that happen due to polluted water.
The system is also becoming technologically vibrant.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the last few days, there has been an increase in the emphasis on DG-funds.
Especially the younger generation has a habit of making digital payments through their mobile phones.
I believe this is a good symptom.
In our country, in the last few days, there has been a lot of support for the Bhagwan Buyer Scheme and the Digi-Dhan Business Scheme.
It has been nearly two months and everyday 15 thousand people are getting Rs. 1,000 per day.
Through these two schemes, the goal of making the digital payments system a mass movement in India has been welcomed across the country.
It is a matter of great pleasure that under the DG-Dhan Yojana, 10 lakh people have been saved, more than 50 thousand traders have been given the rewards and more than Rs.
There are more than 100 consumers in this scheme who have received Rs. 1 lakh per annum.
There are four thousand traders who have received Rs. 50-55 thousand rupees.
Shri Santosh from Mysore expressed his happiness and wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he received a reward of Rs. 1,000 under the fortunate consumer scheme.
But I believe that he has written an important thing to you.
He has written that when he got a thousand rupees, he realized that a poor woman's house was set on fire and all the goods were burnt in that fire.
Santosh ji is satisfying all of us.
You have done a very inspiring job.
Twenty-twenty-two-year-old driver of Delhi, Bhai Sabir, has now been associated with digital transactions and he has got one lakh rupees in the government's lucky consumer scheme.
A young student from Maharashtra performs Pooja Namade, Postgraduate Courses and also enjoys the pleasure of using RuPay cards and e-wallet in his family.
One lakh rupees prize is important for him, but he has taken up this work as a curtain and is also connecting others with it.
This movement has played a very important role in the fight against justice, corruption and black money.
Every person associated with this work, for me, the country's Anti-Corruption Cadre is a shield against corruption.
In a way, you are a good soldier.
On 14th April, a huge settlement of Rs.
There are approximately forty-five days.
Remembering him, we should teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
Teach me how to translate from it.
Particularly teach those who are small and medium traders around us.
Babasaheb Ambedkars Jayanti and BHIM App will give special importance to it.
And that is why I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation stone of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The BHIM App has to be installed in every household to reach out to 125 crore households.
The movement that has started in the last two-three months has resulted in a lot of success in several urban settlements, several villages and several cities.
My dear countrymen, the agriculture sector has contributed immensely to the root cause of the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village strengthens the economic pace of the country.
Today, I would like to share a very happy thing with you.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have made stringent efforts to fill the grain warehouses.
This year's record production is due to the hardships of the farmers of our country.
All the records are telling us that our farmers have made a record in the past.
This year there has been such a cultivation in the fields that everyday it seems that Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than 2,700 lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
It is more than eight percent more than the previous record in the name of our farmers.
This is an unprecedented success in itself.
I especially thank the farmers of the country.
Thanks to the fact that along with traditional crops, the poor of the country should take the production of pulses because the poor get the maximum protein from the pulses.
I am glad that the farmers of my country listened to the voices of the poor and brought different pulses to the land of nearly two hundred thousand ninety five lakh hectares.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is a great service to the poor of my country by the farmers.
My request is that my farmer brothers and sisters deserve special gratitude for the way my farmers have worked hard and produced record production of pulses.
My dear countrymen, in our country, the government has taken several initiatives in the field of cleanliness from the society, from the institutions and from the organizations.
In a way, everyone seems to be aware of cleanliness in some way or the other.
The government is also making constant efforts.
A few days ago, a programme of senior officials of 23 State Governments under the leadership of our Secretaries of our Government of India, the Drinking Water and Sanitation Department, was organised in Telangana.
What is the significance of not only communicating in the closed rooms in the heritage of the state of Telangana but also of direct cleanliness
Using it on 17th and 18th February toilet pitting exercises were organised in Hyderabad .
The toilets of six houses were cleaned by emptying the pits and the authorities themselves showed that the stones used by the Twin Pit toilets can be used again by emptying them.
He also demonstrated how convenient toilets are being constructed using these new technologies and there is no difficulty in cleaning the toilets.
As we clean others, we can clean the rocks of a toilet.
And if we look at the fertilizer as a fertilizer then it is black gold in a way.
We can see how waste to wealth is generated and this has been proved.
A Standard Twin Pit Toilet for a family of six people, which will be filled in about five years.
After that, it can be easily removed and moved into another cord.
The waste collected in potholes was dissolved in six to twelve months.
Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium are full of nutrients and it is considered a very good fertilizer in the agriculture sector.
The way the government has taken this initiative, others have also taken initiatives to make such experiments.
Now a special programme has been started on Doordarshan.
The more these things will be broadcast, the more it will be beneficial.
The Swachhta Pakhwada is being organized regularly by different departments of the Government.
In the second phase of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will take forward two more Swachhta Abhiyans.
You are aware that whenever any citizen of our country does something good then the entire country experiences a new energy and confidence increases.
We welcomed the performance of our Divyangjans at the Rio Para Olympics.
The country is proud of the success of these Divyang friends.
I often believe that brothers and sisters with disabilities are capable, determined, courageous and determined.
Every moment, we can learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anyone.
They have moved forward by stepping up and brightening the country with their success. Just a few days ago, our women's team won the Silver Medal in the Asian Rabby Savens Trophy Games.
I convey my best wishes to all these players.
Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March in the entire world.
In India too, there should be greater awareness and sensitivity in the family and in the society to give importance to the daughters.
The campaign of 'Mulgi Bachao-Mulgi Shikshawa' is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today it is not just a government programme.
Today it has become a movement of social sensitivity and public education.
In the last two years, the common man has been associated with this initiative.
This initiative has played a crucial role in every corner of the country.
The old customs that have been going on for years have changed the mindset of the people.
I am very happy when I get a news that a festival was celebrated after the birth of a daughter.
In a way, positive thoughts about daughters are becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that in the state of Tamil Nadu, Cuddalore district has imposed a ban on child marriage under a special campaign.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked with the scheme 'Mulgi Bachao-Mulgi Shikshawa' and efforts are being made by the district administration to ensure that the orphan girls get their education along with organizing Gram Sabhas.
In Madhya Pradesh, Har Ghar Ghar Dak (HGDK) initiative is underway to provide education to every household and every household girl.
Apna Bachcha, Apna Vidyalaya campaign in Rajasthan is underway to motivate the girls left out of school to re-school and educate them.
New ideas are being linked to it.
It has changed according to local needs.
When we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we will have the same feeling: Woman, Woman, Power, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman of India, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, My dear countrymen, all of you get the opportunity to interact with something from Mann Ki Baat.
We were also actively involved.
I am extremely grateful to you for your participation.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
Recalling the Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens and their commitment to democracy, this festival is a celebration of the responsibility of eradicating democracy over generations to come.
But the more widespread discussions about the rights and duties of the citizens in our country, the more widespread discussions are going on, the more it does not happen.
I hope that the more important functionaries are given at every level, the more important the rights are given.
I pay my homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country at 11 a.m.
On the 30th of January, at 11 a.m. these two minute silences must become a society, a country.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the families of those brave soldiers who have been awarded different gallantry awards.
The awards include a wide range of categories such as Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medals, Specific Service Medals etc.
I especially urge the youth of the country that you are very active on social media.
Can you do one thing Can you find out about the heroes who have received this honour at this time and write two good words about them and reach out to their friends
When we talk deeply about the courage, valour and valour of these heroes then we are surprised, proud and inspired.
On the one hand, we were happy to read the news of the 26th of January being celebrated with enthusiasm. At the same time, soldiers in Kashmir had to lose their lives due to avalanches.
I pay homage to all those brave soldiers, I salute them.
My young friends, you are aware of the fact that I continuously tell you about Mann Ki Baat.
The month of January, February, March and April is a period of great difficulty in every family.
Almost every household has one or two children's exams, but the entire family was buried under the burden of that exam.
Then I felt that this time is appropriate to interact with my student friends, their parents and teachers, because for many years, wherever I go, the exams of those whom I meet are very important reasons for children's care.
A very strange mental condition is being created in every household that is concerned about the family, the students are careful and the teachers are desperate.
When I was told that I was going to speak on this topic, several teachers, parents and students sent me messages, sent questions, sent some suggestions, they mentioned the difficulties and difficulties faced by us.
I would like to share with you the ideas that have come to my mind by reading them all.
I received a telephone message from the universe.
Sir, let me tell you that in the days of exams, our households, neighbours and our society had a very nervous atmosphere.
It doesn't mean that the minds of the students should be filled up, but we are disappointed.
I want to ask you whether this environment cannot be happy
"The question is true but it will be in the mind of all of us.
There are very few people who see pleasures in the examination.
Most of the people used to have a pressure.
It is a pressure that you people have to decide the pleasure.
The person who faces this test as a pleasure, joy, will get the same fun and the person who takes the pressure will get the time of regret.
Therefore, I believe that you should face the tests as if something is a festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
The entire family should enthusiastically fulfil the role of taking the festival to its full potential.
The picture will change when seen.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there are only three or four months of examination.
For these three-four months, follow your traditions and traditions, change your family environment and change it during festivals.
And that is why I will tell you, Smile More, Score More.
In a stressful situation, all the doors are closed, no one can enter from outside and can not come out inside.
The thought process stops and these things get overwhelmed.
And you don't have knowledge, lack of information, lack of hard work, where is it
But if there is tension then your knowledge, your knowledge, your information is suppressed under it and stress is there on it.
It is important to keep in mind that A happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes I feel that we do not look at the exams from the right perspective.
We have a mindset that it should be a question of life and death.
Whatever study you have done during the year is just about that.
Your entire life will not be blamed there.
This is not a test of what kind of life you have lived, what kind of life you have lived ahead.
Apart from the examination given by the businessmen in the classroom, you must have gone through several cases of fraud.
Let us be free from such evils, let us all know that the former President of India, Dr.
J.
The biggest challenge before education in today's era is that of education.
Marks are getting a lot of importance.
This has not only increased the competition but also increased the pressure on the minds of the students.
I want to know your thoughts about the current trend of education system and its future.
Though he has answered in his own question, he wants me to say something about this topic.
There is a limited use of merits and merits.
If you believe in these things then you will be left behind and you will never need to run behind them.
You will be able to leverage your knowledge in life, your ideas will be useful for you, you will be able to leverage your self-confidence and determination.
Would you like to see a mark sheet when you go to a lawyer to fight your big problem
Its experience, knowledge and a successful journey in the field of lawyers can be seen there.
That is why Markanch's stance sometimes stops us from moving in the right direction.
Richa ji has also taken up the issue of continuous competition with others.
This is a huge mental battle.
I tell you that it is easy to understand the examples of sports.
Most of the successful sportspersons have a unique feature that they compete with themselves.
Let us take the example of this by tendulkar.
Twenty years have been a journey of ourselves, of our own accomplishments, of defeating ourselves.
It should be wonderful because they have followed the path of self-competitiveness rather than competing with others.
In every field of AYUSH, you should ask yourself the question of studying in the field of AYUSH and I could study peacefully for two hours before, should I study for three hours now
It was too late to get up early in the morning, should we get up early
Whether it is possible to get sleep because of the stress of exams or not
He added, My mother was not very much educated.
Yet she was sitting with me and she had to leave my mathematics.
I would only like to tell the parents that they should focus on three things, acceptance, teach and give time.
Parents would have experienced that the expectations of their teachers and their children are the root cause of many problems.
The burden on you will also be removed.
I was present there and I saw that he did not ask a single question regarding the health of that person.
When he came here, he started listening to Vinodi Chuckle.
In just four-five minutes, the entire atmosphere was saved.
They keep getting scared only by talking about the diseases that are going to meet the patient .
I would like to tell the parents that sometimes we are very nice to the children.
Have we ever thought of providing a happy, smiling environment to the children during examinations
Do that, the environment will change.
I have got one more bigger Kamali phone call.
He says, "Namaskar Prime Minister, I cannot call myself the name because my childhood work is done by me.
Once I had tried to copy my childhood.
And when I tried to copy it directly then I was caught in it and I had a lot of trouble with my close friends.
These short-cut roads become the reason for copying.
You must have heard this many times.
I will say the same again.
Even if you look at it, you will see the ill effects of copying.
The same creativity, if the time is spent on the exams then perhaps it will not be necessary to copy.
A phone call has come to me, she says, Namaskar Prime Minister, my name is Monica and I am a 12th student, so I want to ask you a few questions related to the board exams.
My first question is about the increasing tension during these examinations, how can it be reduced
"If I talk about sports during the examination days, your teachers, your parents will live on me.
The Prime Minister said that during the exams, how can we tell children to play games
Because in sports, we generally understand that the focus on studies is being reduced.
This idea is fundamentally wrong.
The root cause of the problem is there.
Watch the sky a few moments out of your studies, look at the trees of virginity, make your mind a little bit lighter and then study in your room.
Whether it is for five minutes but give it yourself for rest .
You will see that the work was going on even further.
Whether everyone likes this or not, but my experience tells me the same.
For this there is no need to sit in the room.
Go to the chair, breathe for five minutes and then study.
Some people understand that if you wake up late at night then it will be a lot of practice.
But not.
Definitely take as much sleep as is necessary in the body .
Your efficiency will only increase.
Whenever I go to the polling booths, sometimes my voice is raised.
At one such meeting, I had come to visit a folk singer.
They asked me, "How many hours do you sleep
But this does not mean that you keep sleeping continuously.
As long as it is, your household mankind will live on me.
It is a very big medicine to keep mind , intelligence , body alert .
Young friends, you are busy preparing for exams and I am stuck in my minds.
Kunas Thok, perhaps this speech of mine will help in removing the stress on your mind.
But at the same time, I would also like to say that do not take the brunt of those things that I have told you.
If you are accumulating then do it or dont do it or else it will become a burden.
I am also sure that I have told your parents not to impose the burden of expectations on children.
Keeping your faith in yourself, your determination to face the tests should be fulfilled.
My best wishes are with you.
Give the form of a festival to cross every penalties.
There will be no examination.
You should move ahead with this mantra.
Dear Countrymen, on 1st February, 2017, we are completing 40 years of Indian Coast Guard.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the officers of the Task Force and the jawans for their service to the nation.
Indian Coast Guard, including 126 self-made ships and 62 aircraft, is the fourth largest coast Guard in the world.
As per our ideals, the Armed Forces personnel are adamant to safeguard the maritime boundary and maritime domains of the country.
Last year, the people of Takshak forces took pride in making the coastal areas clean along with their responsibilities.
Thousands of people participated in it.
He truly congratulated them for taking care of the hygiene of these coasts along the coastal security.
Very few people would be aware of the fact that not only the men in our country's Takshak forces, but the women are also working with their shoulders in the same manner and they are successfully fulfilling their responsibilities.
Our women officers of the Task Force are aeronautical, observers and are also managing the responsibilities of Howardcraft.
On his 40th anniversary, I salute the Indian Coast Guard, who is keeping Indias coastline safe, as it becomes a question of global coastal security.
On 1st February, 2019, the 55th anniversary will be celebrated.
It is considered to be the day of the worship of the university.
Not only this, it is an inspirational period for the heroes.
The song "Mera Rang De Basanti Chola" shows the same inspiration.
I convey my best wishes to all my countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Panchami.
My dear countrymen, while broadcasting Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio also fills it with its innovations.
Mann Ki Baat gives you a huge opportunity to connect with you.
My best wishes.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, I convey my best wishes to all of you.
Today is a day to give importance to service, sacrifice and action in our lives.
Jesus Christ has said that the poor should not be neglected and we should accept it.
St. Luke has written in Ganspell that it has not only served the poor but has also appreciated the service done by the poor and in the true sense it is empowerment.
A story related to it is very popular.
It is said in that story that Jesus was standing near the treasure of a temple.
Many Sreemans came and donated a lot.
Thereafter, a poor widow came and she kept two copper coins in it.
Now if we go to see what is the value of two copper coins .
The devotees standing there were surprised.
Yessoon said that the widow has donated the most and the others have donated a lot, but this woman has donated everything to her.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development projects in Varanasi, which was the land of Malviya ji.
I laid the foundation stone of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at BHU in Varanasi.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Our country will never forget the contributions made by Atal ji.
He also elevated the countrys pride in the field of nuclear energy under his leadership.
Whether it is a party leader, a parliamentarian or a minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji has created an ideal in every field.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray for his good health.
As an activist, I was fortunate to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are awake to my eyes today.
I also shared an old painting this morning when I tweeted that how Atal ji's affection as a small worker would be benefitted.
Today, on the day of bathing, the citizens of the country will get the benefit of two schemes.
In a sense, two new schemes are being launched.
Everyone has to learn and understand from each other.
In order to promote this, the Central Governments Promotion Scheme for Consumers and Small Businesses (CBSBs) has been launched from today to enable the process to become a habit of e-payment.
The Fateful Consumer Scheme is an incentive to the consumers and the Digi Dhan Business Scheme is an incentive to the traders.
The scheme will start from today and will continue for the next 100 days.
Each day, 15,000 people will get an amount of Rs. 1000 per day.
At the same time, a day long discount will be issued for the customers with a discount of lakhs of rupees and a discount of Rs.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary will be on that day in a grand code wherein crores of rupees will be given.
Digi Dhan Business Scheme is mainly for traders.
Businessmen should join this scheme themselves and also involve consumers to stop their transactions.
Independent deposits will also be provided for such traders and these deposits will also be in thousands.
Businesses will continue to be self-employed and they will also get the opportunity to win Buxixis.
This scheme has been formulated keeping all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class citizens at the centre.
The benefits of these deposits will not be available to those who buy more than 3000 rupees.
The poorest of the poor can also buy goods through a feature phone or a simple phone using USSD, sell goods and also provide money and they can become beneficiaries of this scheme.
In rural areas, they can also sell and sell through AEPS.
30 crore people can join the BACCIS scheme shortly.
It is very simple that the easier it is to send messages from Whatsapp.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to see that awareness about how to use technology in our country, how to make e-payments and how to make online payments is increasing at a fast pace.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased by 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a very big decision to promote this.
The traders will certainly be able to guess how big this decision is.
Exemption from Income Tax has been granted to traders who will exchange digital transactions, who will facilitate online payments instead of cash in their cargo.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
A committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Shri Chandrababu Naidu.
At the same time, I have seen that the state governments have started several schemes and their implementation has started.
Someone told me that the government of Assam has decided to give 10 percent concession on payment of goods tax and trading licenses through digital mode.
The branches of rural banks, which will be able to handle at least two digital transactions during January-March, will receive a discount of Rs. 50,000 by the Government.
He also announced that 100 Digital Payments will be given a bond of Rs. 5 lakh under the Goods and Services Panchayat by the Government till 31st March, 2017.
The Government of Assam has announced to disbursal Rs. 5000 to the first ten farmers who are fully digitally purchasing seeds and fertilizers under Digital Farmer Shiromani Yojana for the farmers.
I congratulate the government of Assam and congratulate all the governments who have taken such initiatives.
Several organisations have successfully undertaken several experiments to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in Suddha villages.
Someone told me that in just a few days, 35,000 farmers have purchased and purchased 5 lakh fertilizer seeds through digital mode in just two weeks, wherever fertilizers are sold for the benefit of the farmers.
Fertilizer sales of the company increased by 27 percent this year as compared to the previous year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, the coverage of the informal sector has increased in our lifestyle. And most of the time these people are given wages or wages by paying wages or by paying cash and therefore the labourers are being exploited.
80 per quintal where 100 is required.
At the same time, they are also getting the benefits of other benefits.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technologies are easy for us.
Countries like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have also made great strides in the field of start-ups.
These are golden days of the digital movement.
Our youngsters can empower this sector with new ideas, new technologies and new methods.
At the same time, we should also participate in the drive to free the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, every month I urge people to give their advice and express their thoughts before Mann Ki Baat.
80 to 90 per cent of the suggestions made on MyGov and Shri Narendra Modi Power are in the context of the fight against corruption and black money.
When I saw all these things, I was able to divide them into three parts.
It has been written in detail about the difficulties faced by the people and the neglect of the people in the advice given to me.
People of other types have written that despite the fact that this kind of good work is being done for the welfare of the country, no matter how sacred work is going on, no one is being misbehaved and how new paths of corruption are being explored.
Third kind of people have written invocatively that this fight should continue to be fought with the support of what happened.
The number of citizens who urge corruption and black money to be completely eradicated and strict action should also be taken if necessary.
I express my gratitude to all the countrymen who have helped me by sending me such letters.
Shri Guru Nanak Deveering, Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitely stated that this step taken to prevent transactions of timelines is commendable.
We are fighting against corruption and black money like the armed forces.
The words written on the notes are wrong, the rates of sweets have increased, the notes of two thousand will be cancelled, the notes of 500 and 100 rupees will be cancelled.
However, the people of this country were stunned to hear all these rumors.
Moreover, many people landed in the plains, they brought out the true face of the people who spread the evil through their skills and wisdom, they proved that Afwa was wrong and brought the truth to everyone.
My heartfelt condolences to this power of the people.
My dear countrymen, today I feel that when 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with us then nothing is impossible.
Jan Janadan is the form of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for the people of this great vision of corruption and black money.
I felt that there should be widespread discussion in the House regarding the fight against corruption and black money.
Had it been the work of the House, there would have been a good discussion.
Some people are spreading the rumors of all kinds of concessions to political parties.
The law is the same for all.
Whether it is an individual or an organization or a political party, everyone should follow the law and everyone has to do it.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and black money spend time in search of government errors.
There is a question of repeated changes in the rules.
This government is for the people.
Whose power has been involved in this period of dishonesty and corruption for 70 years
When I decided to fight these people, they started a new effort every day to defeat the government.
On the other hand, several citizens have also written letters to discuss non-professional issues and various migrations.
The common man is giving more information than the information that comes from the government system.
The success we achieve is due to the awareness of the common citizens.
The Government has prepared an e-mail address for providing such information and can send this information.
I express my gratitude to all those who write such letters, their letters have faith and blessings.
This is not a complete break.
This is the beginning.
There is no question of fatigue, there is no question of stoppage. And there is no question of getting rid of the work for which 125 crore people are blessed.
You must be aware of the law relating to Benami Property in our country, which was enacted in 1988.
He was kept bullied in the posture.
We took it out and implemented the Effective Anonymous Wealth Act.
In the coming days, this law will have to show its impact.
Our topmost priority has been to do whatever is required for the welfare of the country and for the welfare of the people.
Indias ranking in the World Bank Industry Report has improved.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have jumped 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and have jumped 19 places in 2016 in the World Bank Domestic Performance Index.
The evaluation of several reports is guiding such a direction that India is progressing at a fast pace.
My dear countrymen, this time the people of the country were disappointed with the session of Parliament.
Everyone expressed his anger at the passing away of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also openly expressed dissatisfaction over it.
However, in such a situation, sometimes good things happen and mind gets satisfaction.
A good work was undertaken in the Parliament but the country did not notice it.
Brothers and sisters, I am proud to say that my government has been moving ahead with the campaign for the Divyangjans.
I express my gratitude to all the MPs of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this thing. I express my gratitude to them on behalf of crores of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is also committed towards the Divyangjans.
I have tried to expedite the individual 'Suddha' campaign.
I wanted the persons with disabilities to get their rights and to get their due respect.
By winning four medals at the Paralympics, our Divyang brothers and sisters have reinforced our efforts and beliefs.
He elevated the values of the country and also surprised the people with his ability.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have an invaluable legacy and power like every citizen of the country.
I am glad that after the passage of this Bill for the benefit of the persons with disabilities, they will get more employment opportunities.
Reservation limit has also been increased to 4 in Government jobs.
The Government has enacted a new legislation in accordance with the UN Convention.
Out of these, 14 categories have been added.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we have been proud of the fields of sports.
The Cricket Team of India has won 4-0 against the United Kingdom.
Some young sportspersons were commendable.
If our young sportsperson Karun Nayar trinityes then K.
L.
Rahail played 199 games.
Virat Kohli, the captain of the Kasauti team, also led the team with a good leadership.
Indian Cricket Association of Spinner Roundtable
Ashwin has been declared as the Cricketter of the Year of 2016 and the Best Cricket Maker by ICC.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all of you.
Even in the field of hockey, a good news has been published after 15 years.
The Junior Hockey Team has won the World Cup.
After 15 years of Tabbal, the Junior Hockey Association has named the World Cup.
Congratulations to the young sportspersons for this achievement.
This achievement is auspicious for the future of the Indian Hockey Team.
Last month, our women sportspersons also performed well.
Indian Womens Hockey Team won the Asian Championships and recently Indian womens contingent earned bronze medals in the Asian Championships below 18 years ago.
I sincerely congratulate all the sportspersons of Cricket and Hockey Team.
My dear countrymen, the year 2017 will be a year of new joy and enthusiasm, let all our resolves be fulfilled and we will scale new heights of development.
This New Year should also provide an opportunity to the poorest of the poor to lead a life of happiness.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for the year 2017.
Thank you very much
Like every year, I had gone to India-China Seapore to celebrate Diwali with our Indian soldiers.
I celebrated Diwali in the high altitude of the Himalayas along with the soldiers of ITBP, the soldiers of the Armed Forces.
Every time, but the experience of this Diwali was very different.
125 crore citizens of the country who had dedicated this unique Diwali to the soldiers and dedicated it to the security forces had reflected the spirit of every soldier.
Some poetry, some pictures, some cartoons, some people made a video.
I was surprised to know that every household was lying in a military post and when I read these letters then I was surprised.
These letters are full of emotions.
At the same time, an information was received on MyGov. Whether the coffee table book can be created by collecting the selected things in it
A soldier from our armed forces has written to me: Prime Minister, our soldiers, Holi, Diwali and every festival is on the border.
It seems as if we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, the spirit that you have expressed in this Diwali about your Armed Forces will be limited to just a few occasions.
I urge you that as a society, as a nation, we should adopt this habit, be it a festival or be it a festival, we should keep in mind the soldiers of our country in some way or the other.
When the nation stands with the armed forces then the strength of our armed forces increases by 1. 25 billion times.
A few days ago, the Sarpanches of Jammu and Kashmir state had come to meet me.
He was a member of the JK Panchayat Sammelan.
He had come from different parts of the Kashmir valley and there were about 40-50 people.
I got the opportunity to talk to them for a long time.
He had come up with issues related to the development of his village.
They had some demands and when our dialogue started then the issue of environment in the Kashmir valley, law and order situation, the future of the children came up.
There was a time when schools used to be set up in Kashmir, there was a time when I saw that all the people of our country faced the same pain as they were.
He says that the future of the children is not a school.
I urged them to pay attention to the future of these children.
Just a few days ago, there was a board examination and about 95 percent of the students and students of Kashmir had tested the board.
I would like to congratulate him for his enthusiasm but I sincerely thank his parents, relatives, teachers and Sarpanches of all Gram Panchayats.
My dear brothers and sisters, whenever I asked you for your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat then I can say that everyone has sent information on the same topic.
Everyone had to say that we should talk in detail about 500 and 1000 notes.
I was also aware of the fact that we will have to face many new challenges in our daily life.
There cannot be a way to get rid of the diseases that we have been facing for 70 years.
I can understand the difficulties faced by us.
Such a huge country, such a big country, such a bustle of currency, a billion notes and this decision.
The entire world is watching Barkain, every economist is doing this intense analysis.
In the entire country, the central government, the state government, the departments of local bodies, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh banks, friends and friends have been working day and night with the spirit of dedication.
Despite all kinds of tensions, all of them are working very quietly, considering this work as a sacrifice of service to the nation and as an attempt to transform it.
They start in the morning, when will the night be completed
Suddenly there was a need for money.
Several such incidents emerge from television, newspapers and discussions everyday.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those colleagues who have worked hard in this great world, who have proved their talent.
The strengths were recognized only when success was achieved after the slaughter.
I remember Changla when the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was started and the bank employees had taken the burden on their shoulders and the work they had done in 70 years.
Today, once again he has accepted that challenge and I believe that the resolve of 1. 25 billion Indians, the collective endeavour of all will give a new strength to this nation.
But evil habits have spread so much that even today many people do not have those bad habits.
Some people still feel that this money of corruption, this money of black money, this unaccounted money, benami money, some of them will be brought back to the system.
They are finding unlawful ways to save our money.
Sadly, he has chosen the path of using the poor.
They are trying to save money by misleading the poor by displaying temptations or temptations.
Today, I would like to tell such people that whether it is our will or not to reform or not to follow the law or not, what will we do to see the law
But do not play with the lives of the poor by making warmth.
And the government doesn't want our countrymen to face difficulties.
I am an ordinary citizen of Tirali village, Talka Tirali, J. Hadra and Madhya Pradesh.
It is commendable that we have stopped the notes of 5000 and thousand.
I wish that many such examples of Mann Ki Baat bring to the people that people welcomed this tough step towards nations progress even after having lost their lives.
Because you might say that good days will come but nobody thought that we would take such a big step.
The black money and the corrupt people have received a good deal after seeing the notes of 500 thousand rupees.
It will never be a better day for every Indian.
I am so glad that I feel so proud that the common man of my country has a unique strength.
People go there, eat there, and after 2-4-6 days they go back to that place then they pay the money.
This is the strength of my country, in which there is a sense of service, a sense of sacrifice and honesty.
During the elections, I had launched the 'Chai Pe Charcha' programme and it was spread all over the world.
But I don't know that we are linked to 'Chai Pe Charcha'.
In Gujarat, a girl from Surat gave only tea to the people who were married to her.
Once I saw news on TV, when I came to Ushira at night then I saw that there is a small village named Dhekiyazuli in Assam.
What did they do when they got a vote of 2000 rupees
Four neighbouring women came together and they went to the market and bought it together and paid the amount of Rs. 2000 by using a note.
See how changes are taking place in the village life too.
Some people immediately benefited from this mission.
When I got to know what happened, I got to know about the small towns.
This information was received from about 40-50 cities that due to the closure of these notes, the people who were left behind were not paying the money.
We are aware of the fact that poor people dont pay the money two days back.
These big people, those who are familiar with it, those who knew that no one would ever ask them, they would not pay the money and that is why they are very tired.
Fifty percent of the GST rates are credited to every municipality.
However, the decision dated the 8th of this year has enabled everyone to submit their old notes.
Last year, about three-and-a-half thousand crore rupees were deposited in 47 urban areas.
You will be surprised to know that in this week, Rs. 13,000 crore has been deposited with them.
But today I congratulate the farmers of my country.
I have already figured out the crop production in this season.
The farmers have found ways even after facing difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority.
Small traders of our country send jobs and help in increasing the economy.
We have taken an important decision in the previous budget, just like the big malls, the small shopkeepers of the village will be able to do their business for 24 hours and no law will be restrained from them.
Initiatives were taken to provide loans to them through Mudra Yojana.
However, it was natural for them to face problems due to this decision.
I would like to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is an opportunity to enter the digital world.
You should also download bank accounts on your mobile phones. You should also keep POS machines for credit cards.
We should learn how business can be done without using notes.
You see, the way big malls and technologies enhance our trade, a small trader can enhance our trade with the common "User Friendly Technology".
There is no possibility of anything going wrong and there is a possibility of increasing it.
I invite you that you can contribute a lot to the creation of a cashless society.
Technology roads are safe, trustworthy and fast.
I believe that I would like to convey my best wishes to the labourers and the hardworking brothers and sisters that you people have suffered a lot.
But Friends, you are my true soldiers, my dear friends.
There is an unprecedented opportunity for serving Mother India and for taking the country to economic heights.
The world is not as old as we have experienced.
We are aware of the fact that the previous generation did not know what was the case.
You are aware of the kind of online banking and online ticket booking.
There is nothing special about it.
However, today the country wants to do the great work, its a dream, its a Cashless Society, it is true that we will not succeed 100 but we have not started it.
If we cover the Cashless Society then the goal is not far away.
Wallet means e-packet.
Various types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families in India have RuPay cards.
However, the poor have also started using RuPay cards after the 8th of December, which has increased by nearly 300.
The way prepaid cards are available for mobile phones and prepaid cards are available for spending in bank accounts.
This work is so simple that just as you send a Whatsapp, it is equally easy.
We are well aware of the fact that the uneducated people should forward the Whatsapp.
Not only this, technology is getting easier so that there is no need for smart phones for this purpose.
Whether it is a washerman, a vegetable seller, a milk seller or a current card or a tea seller, everyone can use it.
I have put emphasis on making this system easier.
All banks are working on it.
You must have read in the current letter of the last two-four days when the burden of loading has been lifted on usage of such cards.
The technology that is required to spend online will be in your mobile phone.
Moreover, after spending half an hour or two hours everyday, you can tell at least ten families what technology is and how technology is being used and how our banks can download their choices.
We have to lead this campaign to make the country free of corruption, to liberate the country from black money, to liberate people from problems and problems.
I believe that if the common man learns this system then he will get rid of the thinking of work. And if all the youth of India take it to their own end then it will not take much time.
Within a month, we can stand as a modern India in the world.
And you can do this thing through mobile phones and you can do it everyday by visiting 10 houses.
I invite you, not just to stop with your support but we will be a force of change and we will bring about change.
Let us take this fight forward to free the country from corruption and black money.
And there are many countries in the world where the youngsters of the country have changed the lives of the nation, the revolution took place by the youth.
The country of Kenya has formulated a mobile system called M-PESA, using technology, named M-PESA.
This country has brought about a big revolution.
My young friends, I urge you to take this campaign forward.
I invite you to work individually in schools, colleges, universities, NCC, NSS, collectively and individually.
The most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji, is taking forward the cleanliness drive.
I believe that cleanliness is inherent in their nostrils and that is why they remember the cleanliness of their fathers birthdays.
He writes in a poem by Harivansh Raiji, one of them is Oil, the soil of the soil, the life of Masti, my introduction to Harivansh Raiharivansh Rai.
My dear countrymen, today through Mann Ki Baat, I have always been associated with you in my thoughts, feelings, letters and letters.
The Mann Ki Baat programme is broadcast at 11 a.m. but you will soon be able to hear the translation from the regional languages.
In every corner of India, Diwali is celebrated with joy and enthusiasm.
India is a country where 365 days of the year are celebrated somewhere or the other.
This festival is the second name of the life of the people of India. Anyone who watches it will feel that it is natural.
The tradition of festivals in India has changed over time since Vedas.
However, one thing can be seen in all these journeys is that this entire journey of festivals in India, its scope, its accomplishment, its impact on the masses, its impact on the masses, has been linked to the masses.
The main objective behind this is to expand the individual and personality, to expand the scope of our limited ideas from society to universe and to achieve all this through festivals.
Our ancestors have participated in scientific events in the festivals that are being held in India in the form of festivals and festivals in which the weather is included, what kind of food should be eaten, what kind of crops should be taken by the farmers, what kind of crops should be added in the festivals, what kind of culture should be there in the health sector.
Today the whole world is discussing the environment.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
The tradition of festivals in India is to enhance love for nature, to enhance the feeling of love for nature, to enrich everyone from children to adults.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, we celebrate the festival of creating a sense of charity towards everyone.
We take Sunday vacations, but the older generation of labourers, the Koli Bandhav used to take vacations on new moons and dawns.
This darkness is not the darkness occurring due to the deficiency of light but it is also the darkness of darkness.
On the occasion of Diwali, it is an attempt to illuminate the illuminated darkness of the society, to remove the ill-fated darkness of the individuals and to illuminate the light of positiveness on the occasion of Diwali.
Although the households of the poor are utensils of soil, they appear clean and shiny during the days of Diwali.
In this context, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is a mission.
But this is the need of the hour not only in the house but also in the entire area, cleanliness in the streets and cleanliness of the entire village.
In that context, we should expand this tradition of cleanliness.
This festival of Diwali is no longer confined to India's borders.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different ways across the world.
Many governments around the world, parliament and administrators there want to participate in the Diwali celebrations.
Perhaps you would be aware of the fact that the postal service of the United States has issued a postage stamp on Diwali this year.
The Canadian Prime Minister has also shared his photos of lights on Diwali on Twitter.
The UK Prime Minister organized a grand event to bring together all the societies on Diwali in London and participated in it.
There is not a single city in Britain that does not celebrate Diwali with great enthusiasm.
What is the image of the Singapore Prime Minister who has put on Instagram and shared it with the whole world with pride
The 16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament from the Indian side.
He told me that the Prime Minister of New ealand had just come here, and that he would like to return to New ealand soon to participate in the Diwali celebrations.
On this occasion, I would like to say that this festival of light of Deepawali is also a festival of inspiration for the global community to move from darkness to light.
In the festival of Deepawali along with new clothes and various tasty food items , crackers are played with great interest .
Small kids and youngsters like to fly cracks.
Sometimes children don't get bored with excitement, sometimes they don't get bored with excitement, sometimes they try to make a big noise at one go and sometimes they invite a big crisis.
Sometimes we don't know what is happening around us, what is the possibility of a fire
The news of such accidents, the news of fire and the news of abusive deaths is a matter of concern in the days of Diwali.
In the days of Diwali, many doctors and families are very happy to celebrate Diwali with their families.
In our country, the festival of Diwali is going on for a long time.
While celebrating Diwali, we also prepare for Chhath Puja.
In the eastern part of India, the festival of Chhath Puja is celebrated with great fanfare. This festival is celebrated as a festival for four days.
This festival gives a very meaningful message to the society.
Whatever Surya Devata gives us, it is difficult to recognise what we get from direct and indirect Surya Devata.
Chhath Puja is a festival of worship of Surya .
People worship the rising sun in the world.
But Chhath Puja is such a festival in which the sun is also worshipped.
A massive social message is also given through it.
My feeling of gratitude for the sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the security forces of my future forces has always been there in my mind that this Diwali of this year should be dedicated to these security forces.
I invited the countrymen for the mission of Message to Soldiers.
Today I would like to bow down to the people of India that there is no feeling of love, pride and respect for the people of the country.
The way this spirit has been expressed, it has given every citizen a different strength.
Through your message, the soldiers of our security forces have got a new patience and a new strength.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, poor, traders, shopkeepers, political leaders, sportspersons or actresses, all of them have expressed their feelings.
The media has recognized Suddha as an opportunity to express gratitude towards the Armed Forces.
Today, when we celebrate Diwali, at the same time somebody is standing in the desert, somebody is at the top of the Himalayas, somebody is protecting the industries and somebody is watching the safety of the airport, all these soldiers are performing innumerable responsibilities.
I can imagine this moment of pride for the soldiers of my country.
Message to Soldiers has shown innumerable emotions in a comprehensive way.
Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has sent a poem to me.
I am talking about Shivani Mohan.
Our army brothers are getting a big boost with the mission of 'Mondage to Soldiers' that you have launched on this Diwali.
My Vadil and Sasare were also officers in the military.
Our entire family is full of soldiers.
There are several officers in the Armi Circle on the border of the country who are receiving very good messages and they are getting a lot of encouragement.
I would like to urge myself that along with the army officers and jawans, their entire family and their wives also sacrifice a lot.
Through our messages, the entire army community is getting a very good message and I would like to offer you Diwali greetings.
Whether it is natural calamities, laws and order, whether it is a problem in deteriorating the laws and order, whether it is handling the enemies or the courageous actions to bring the youth back on the wrong path, our soldiers continue to be inspired by the nation in every front of their lives.
I was told about one incident, I would like to tell you that what things can inspire me to achieve success.
We have an ITBP trooper in the security forces, it is a resident of Chhotasha village in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The name of his village is Badhana.
Our ITBP jawans had gone to their villages on vacations.
Therefore, Himachal Pradesh became an open defecation free state in true sense.
Very few people go to those villages.
The engineering students of the city, who were far away from that village, had no toilets at this place.
The students of NCC, members of NSS and engineering have decided to construct toilets in the village.
All the materials, bricks, cement and other requirements that were required for the construction of toilets were carried on their shoulders and piped the entire day to that village.
They worked hard and built toilets in that village and they demonstrated a small village in the remotest part of the jungle, open defecation free.
That is why Kerala will soon become an open defecation free state.
Gujarat has declared that most of the 150 Open Defecation Free (ODF) places are all municipal corporations and municipalities.
10 districts have been made Open Defecation Free.
Haryana is going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on 1st November and it has decided to make our state Open Defecation Free within a few months.
So far, seven districts have become Open Defecation Free.
Work is going on at a rapid pace in all the states.
I have mentioned only a few states.
I sincerely congratulate the citizens of all these states for their participation in this campaign and for their contribution in removing the blindness of the country in the form of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, there are several schemes of the government and after the first scheme, they have to stop the first scheme after presenting such a second scheme.
But most of the time nobody notices this thing.
While the old schemes are in progress, the new schemes are also in progress, the upcoming schemes are being waited upon and this is going on continuously.
In our country, those households where gas is used for cooking, those households that have electricity, those households do not need kerosene.
He has taken a major decision to free kerosene from Haryana.
I believe that Haryana will soon get rid of kerosene.
Only arbitrators and parties will be hit by this.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always been the guide for all of us.
The need of the hour is to take care of the ambitions that have been created in the minds of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step by one to get out of trouble.
Whatever our old thinking is, the difference between sons and daughters should be eliminated in society.
In schools, Sudha is now an independent resource for children and girls.
This is the opportunity to give our daughters an experience of a distinct India.
It is not right that after the 21st century was destroyed, there should be darkness in the villages.
In order to make such villages free of darkness at the earliest, the mission of electrifying them is going on successfully.
Successful efforts are being made to provide smoke-free life to 5 crore such families.
Small traders, entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, small shopkeepers, all used to get stuck in the evil cycle of public interest.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Accounts, have liberated many from this evil cycle of interest.
Direct payments are made to the banks through Aadhaar so that they reach the beneficiaries directly.
This is an opportunity to free the lives of the common man from the middlemen and the parties.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is 31st October, the birth anniversary of the great Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who dedicated his life for the unity of India.
You would be surprised to know that Sardar Patel's birth anniversary is on 31st December.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to connecting the country and he was successful in his mission and he brought everyone together.
At the same time, Durgadeva said that Indira Gandhiji was assassinated the same day.
We are well aware of the events that took place in the country after their death.
Sir, I would like to ask you what can be done to prevent such evils
My dear countrymen, this is not the sadness of a single person.
After Chanakya, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job of uniting the country.
This injustice done to Sardar ji on the birthday of that great man who leads his life for unity is painful for all of us.
However, we need to take into account all these difficulties and we need to move forward by chanting the mantra of unity.
The unity in diversity is the strength of the country.
Whether it is in many languages, in many species, in many diets or in many diets, the unity in diversity is the strength of India, its the specialty of India, it is the responsibility of every generation.
It is the responsibility of every government to explore and establish unity in every corner of the country.
It is important to save the country from the thoughts and tendencies that spread separatism.
It is our responsibility to make Sardar Saheb a Shreshtha Bharat.
The basic mantra of unity is the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
The life of Sardar Saheb had begun to see the struggle of the farmers.
But Sardar Saheb took the initiative not only for struggle but also for constructive work.
I pay my homage to Sardar Saheb and urge you to remember Sardar Saheb wherever you may be on the 31st of October, to take a pledge of unity.
My dear countrymen, this is a festival of light on the occasion of Kartik Purnima in this episode of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev and his teachings are guiding not only for the entire human race but also for the entire human race.
Service, Reality and Sarbat da Bhala was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peaceful unity and goodwill were his core mantra.
Through every teaching of Guru Nanak Dev, a campaign to free the society from discrimination, superstition and evils was carried out.
Guru Nanak Dev had chosen Bhai Lalo as his co-worker when he had reached the extreme boundary of the spectacular, untouchables, caste systems and hierarchy.
Let us move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', which inspires us to discriminate and work against discrimination, just like the great Guru Nanak Devji.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to all of you on this Diwali dedicated in the name of the soldiers of the country.
My best wishes to you all for fulfilling your dreams, for fulfilling your resolutions and for enjoying your lives in peace and prosperity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
We have defeated the eighteen brave soldiers of our country in the recent terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our armed forces.
He will wipe out every such issue and he will lay the foundation stone for the effort to make the 1. 25 billion Indians live happily.
But the army does not speak.
Today, I would like to specially speak to the people of Kashmir.
Anti-national forces are now being recognized by the citizens of Kashmir.
And as the truth is being understood by them, they have started moving on the path of peace by separating themselves from these ideas.
Every mother-father feels that schools and colleges should be re-developed at the earliest.
The farmers feel that the products produced in the fields and fruits should go to the markets across India.
It seems that economic activity should be smooth.
And for the past few days, this process has started smoothly.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we can find solutions to every problem and find ways and pave the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the people of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
In order to maintain law and order, the government has to take some steps.
I get a lot of opportunity to know about the attack through social media.
It provides an opportunity to understand, understand and understand the emotions of every section of the country and it strengthens democracy.
The young man named Harsh Vardhan, who has learnt about the eleventh century, has just given me a different idea.
Then I made a solemn pledge that I would study for three hours a day.
I would like to be a citizen of the country.
Harsh Vardhan Bhai, I am glad that you can calmly think this thing at such a young age when you are growing up in the atmosphere.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would like to say that the emergence of the citizens across the country has a huge value.
It is a symbol of national consciousness.
This shows the determination to do something.
Everyone felt that something should be done and everyone felt that something should be done.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri had tried to touch this spirit of the country in an excellent manner.
And Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan Mantra inspired the common man to work for the country.
Every citizen has another way of expressing patriotism in the voices of Bombay and the gunmen, which was demonstrated by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
My dear countrymen, Mr.
Kartik has written on the Narendra Modi Power that he has created his history for the Paralympics. And the game he has shown is the victory of human consciousness.
Mr. Varun Vishwanathan has written on Narendra Modi Power that he has done a very good job and we should mention it in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only do we both, but every person in the country has been associated with our sportspersons in the paralysis.
Beyond sports, these paralysis and the achievements of our sportspersons have transformed the vision of humanity and the approach of the disabled.
And I cannot forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik Hin has said.
When she won the medal, she said that this medal has defeated the disability.
There is immense strength in this bend.
At this time 19 athletes participated in the Paralympics competition with three women of our country .
In comparison to other sports, when people with disabilities play, physical capabilities and sports skills are more important than that.
You will be pleasantly surprised to know that our sportspersons have achieved the best performance of today, have won four medals, two gold, one silver and one bronze medal.
Shri Devendra Jhajriya, who won the Gold Medal, won the second gold medal in the Bhalafak event.
And he was not born disabled, he had to lose his hand because of the shock of electricity.
Just imagine, what kind of tools have you done in life when a person won the first gold medal in the thirteenth year of his life and won the second gold medal in the twenty-first year
Mariyappan Thangvelu won the Gold Medal in the Udi Victims.
He does not live in a big city or even in a middle class Sreeman's house.
In the twenty-first year of age, despite physical obstacles, he made the country a medal with determination.
Thalit Deepa Malik has done a great job in hoisting the flag of victory.
Varun C.
Bhati won a bronze medal in a high flying manner.
Very few people would be aware of the valour that these Divyangjans have done during the Paralympics event.
No, I was surprised when I came to know that the players who won the fourth position in the Divyangjans event did not get the medal, but they completed the run in less time than the players who won the gold medal in the Sabal Championships.
I congratulate all these sportspersons and India is moving forward in the direction of formulating a convenient scheme for the Paralympics and its development in the coming days.
My dear countrymen, last week I got a lot of surprise in the Navsari of Gujarat.
It was an emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mahashibir for Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan).
This world cannot see, Gauri Shardul and that Nanga district had come from the inaccessible jungles, the entire Ramayana is composed in its poetry.
And when I heard it, people were surprised.
On that day, I got the opportunity to dedicate a book and the success stories of the lives of persons with disabilities were compiled in it.
This experiment was registered in the Guinness Book of World Records .
It is a matter of great pride for all of our countrymen to have three world-class programmes with disabilities on the same day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago on October 2, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapuji.
And on the same day I had said that cleanliness should become a habit and every citizen should have this duty and an atmosphere of treachery should be created for cleanliness.
Now when two years will be completed on 2nd October then I can assure you that awareness about cleanliness has increased among 125 crore countrymen.
And I had said - one step towards cleanliness and today all of you can say that everyone has certainly tried to move forward one pool.
And that is why every citizen, be it general public or government offices or roads, bus stations or railway stations, schools or colleges, religious places or hospitals, be it children or senior citizens or be it rural poor or farmer women, every citizen is contributing to cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role.
I want you to move forward.
This is also important. And that is why if we talk about rural India then we have constructed two crore thirty two lakh toilets, that is, about two and a half crore toilets.
A healthy competition has been started in the states, districts and villages.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will be successful in Open Defecation Free Village Mission.
Congratulations to those who have done this thing and best wishes to those who are making efforts for it.
And I would like to urge the countrymen to free the country from this problem for the dignity of mothers and sisters and for the health of children.
Let us move ahead with this pledge.
Especially my young friends, I would like to present a scheme for those who use this technology in a big way.
By calling this number in 1969, we will not only be able to understand the condition of constructing toilets in our city, but will also be able to apply for toilets.
You should take advantage of it, especially for the younger generation to take advantage of it.
The Government of India has also urged the corporate sector to come forward.
They should give sponsorship to young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
He will be sent to the district as a representative of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
The Fertilizer Producer Companies have been asked to purchase the fertilizer produced from the waste.
The farmers who do organic farming have been asked to provide that fertilizer.
Those who want to improve the health of our soil, those who care for the health of the soil, those who have suffered losses due to the use of chemical fertilizers, should be provided with this fertilizer as per the requirement.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing immensely in this work as a good lucky ambassador.
I am inviting youngsters to start new start-ups in the area of waste to wealth and waste to wealth, develop the machinery material and develop technology.
This is certainly a work to do.
A special programme Indonesian, India Sanitation Conference is being organized from 25th September to 3rd October this year.
The Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors and Commissioners from all over the country will meet and deliberate on Swachhta and Swachhata alone.
What could be the technology
What could be the economic policy
How can peoples participation be achieved
How can this create employment opportunities
All these topics will be discussed.
I see that new reports about cleanliness are continuously coming up.
Recently, I read in the newspapers that students from Gujarat Technical University went to seven villages and started awareness campaigns for the construction of toilets.
He himself suffered and contributed to the construction of nearly 900 toilets.
Recently, you must have seen that under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramvir Singh, a team of Ganga swimmed from Devprayag to Gangasagar, 2800 kilometers away and gave a message of cleanliness.
Different departments of the Government of India have prepared their own directory.
Every department focuses on cleanliness for fifteen days.
In October, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayati Raj and Department of Rural Development will jointly formulate a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And in the last two weeks of October, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing and Ministry of Consumer Affairs will launch Swachhta Abhiyan in their respective areas during 16th to 31st October.
I urge the citizens to join the department in which we have a respectable relationship.
You must have seen that the survey of cleanliness is done.
Earlier, a survey was conducted in 73 cities and it was presented to the people of the country that what was the situation of cleanliness there.
Now this work will be done in nearly 500 cities with more than one lakh population.
Because the citizens of every city feel that we are lagging behind in this regard.
A competitive environment has been created for cleanliness.
I hope all of you will contribute to this.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri is being celebrated.
I have been urging you to buy Khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
Even at this time, I would like to tell you that there should be only one thing for Khadi in your family so that the insolvency bill can be applied to the poor household.
As a citizen, can we become a part of our Swachhta Abhiyan
For two hours, four hours, you take part in the cleanliness drive and I will tell you that take a photo of it and share it on the Narendra Modi Power.
If there is a video then share the video.
Look, your efforts will give a new boost to this movement across the country.
Recalling Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, the joy of living in life is different, nobody should register it or not.
And the response that he received will be called a very inspiring event in the national life of India.
Many young, small and big institutions of our country, people from the corporate sector, students and entrepreneurs are going to celebrate the Joy of Giving Wikes in several cities of the country from 2nd October to 8th October.
It is a mission to bring all food items and clothes together to the needy.
It was a pleasure to see the toys on the faces of those poor children.
I believe that those cities where this joy of guiding is going to be celebrated, we should encourage those youth, we should help them.
My dear countrymen, today is the 25th of September, the birth anniversary of Deendayal Upadhyay, and today is the beginning of his birth centenary year.
Millions of workers like me have deliberated on the political ideologies with which they are working.
He reiterated Indias root-related diplomacy, which supports Indias cultural traditions.
The birth centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya is being celebrated today.
The principle of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' is the principle of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the interests of every person at the grassroots.
How can the fruits of development reach the poorest of the poor
He presented a milestone in terms of work for every hand and water for every farm.
My dear countrymen, I have started Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashami.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the listeners for the way we have praised and blessed this programme when two years have passed.
I also express my gratitude to All India Radio because they not only broadcast the Mann Ki Baat but also worked hard to reach the audience in all the regional languages.
I am also grateful to the listeners who have written letters after Mann Ki Baat, who have shut the doors of the government, who have shown the flaws in the work of the government, I am grateful to the All India Radio and the All India Radio has made available the platform to solve the problems of the people by communicating with such letters and government officials.
And that is why Mann Ki Baat is not just a fifteen-twenty-minute conversation but also an opportunity for social transformation.
What could be a bigger pleasure for anyone.
How will it be a festival that connects people and people
And that power will become a tool for true power and then we will celebrate the festival of victory together.
Let us instill this strength, let us take the mantra of unity.
Let us celebrate Navratri and Durga Puja with peace, unity and goodwill to take the nation to new heights. Let us celebrate the victory of Vijayadashmi.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat address on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, the 29th of August is the birth anniversary of Dhyan Chand, a jeweller of hockey.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay my homage to Dhyanchand ji and also recall his contribution towards this thing.
He played an important role in winning Indias Hockey Gold in the Olympic Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
Your cricketers know the name of Bradman.
My dear countrymen, as the time of Mann Ki Baat comes closer, there is a lot of information on My Governance or Narendra Modi Power.
Apart from cricket, Indians are so keen on other sports as well as awareness.
It was a source of inspiration for me to give this message.
Sachin says, I must talk about Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in this episode of Mann Ki Baat.
The medals you received were given to the girls.
Our daughters have proved that we are not less than anybody.
One of these daughters is from North India, one from South India, another from East India and another from India.
Therefore, it seems that just like these daughters of the entire country have taken up a lot of initiatives to brighten the name of India.
My Governance Summit Thakur writes that we have been able to achieve even better in Olympics.
He says, "Congratulations to Honble Modi sir for winning two medals in Rio
But I want to draw my attention to this thing that was really good for our achievements.
And the answer is, no
We need to take a long way in the field of sports.
Our parents focus on today's study.
Societies also believe that sports is a snack of time.
We cannot ignore the fact that we have not been able to achieve as per our expectations.
Something has happened that the players who performed well in India, those who performed well in the sports here did not show them there and only two medals were received in the medal tally.
One more thing is that if you don't get medals or look at medals then you will realize that for the first time, Indian sportspersons have performed a lot in sports.
Look at this thing right now, our innovative Bindra ji was at the fourth position in Nembaji and he was a medal winner in a very short span of time.
This was the case with Tennis, Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar became eligible for the last round of the track field.
You will be happy to see that womens hockey team has reached the Olympics after 36 years.
In the last 36 years, for the first time, the men's hockey team had succeeded in reaching the nock out ferry.
Our team is strong and it is a part of the pride that Argentina - whoever won the gold medal, had lost the same fight in the entire competition, who was the one who defeated them.
Some sportspersons had a good performance, such as Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhojanal, Atanu Das...
My countrymen, we have a lot to do but if we continue to do whatever we have done so far, then we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
This committee of the Government of India will conduct a thorough study and examine what is being done about sports worldwide.
The committee will formulate a roadmap on what we can do.
We have to make plans with vision 2020, 2024, 2028.
I also urge the state governments to set up such committees, what can we do in the field of sports, what can we do in the field of sports
And I believe that we are a country with a population of 65 per cent of the 125 crore countrymen, we can achieve the best in the world of sports.
We have to move forward with this resolution.
Deshbandhan, 5th September Teachers Day
For a few years, on the occasion of Teachers Day, I spend my time with the students and I was spending my time as a student among them.
I was learning a lot from these students too.
For me, 5th September was Teachers Day and Education Day too.
Therefore, it is a thought in the mind that we should express my feelings in this conversation...
The place where Mother lives is also the place of teachers.
I have seen such teachers who are more concerned about their own people than themselves.
They lead their lives for their disciples, students.
At present, after the Rio Olympics, there is talk of Pullela Gopichand.
They are not only sportspersons but also an example of how excellent teachers are.
The contribution of teachers in the lives of all of us is always visible.
On 5th September, the birth anniversary of former President of India, Shri Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and the entire nation considers this day as a teacher day.
Even if he had reached any place in his life, he tried to live in the field of a teacher himself.
I have written this beautiful handwriting and my own letter is very bad.
And that is why I have seen good signatures that I have a lot of respect.
If you have a photo with your teachers on the Narendra Modi Power, a good memory, a motivation, then you must share it.
Keep in mind that it will be valuable for you to see the contribution of teachers from the point of view of students.
Brothers and sisters, Ganesh Festival will be held in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a disintegrator and all of us feel that our country, our society, our family, every individual, their lives should be indispensable.
When we think of the Ganesh Festival, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak.
The tradition of public Ganesh Festival is that of Lokmanya Tilak.
The programmes should be designed so that the society gets a new inspiration, new energy and the self-governance given by them is my birth right.
Today, not only in Maharashtra but also in every corner of India, Ganesh Festival has started.
Public issues are discussed, essay competitions, queue competitions are held.
The social topics are touched by the artistic rhythm.
Lokmanya Tilak has given us the mantra of 'Swaraj', 'Swaraj' is my birthright.
Now Suraj is our right, let us move towards Suraj and Suraj is our priority. Can we not convey the message of this mantra through the Ganesh Utsav
I am inviting you.
It is true that festivals are the strength of the society.
Festivals bring newness to individuals and society.
Life is impossible without festivals but it is expected to change as per the demands of time.
I have noticed this time that some people, especially the Ganesh Festival, have written a lot about Durga Puja and they are worried about the environment.
The idols made of PoPs are not suitable to the environment.
This pain has been intensified in the manner in which he has spoken to others.
I pray to all of you that you use the idols of Ganesha and Durga Mata as ancient times and do not follow your old tradition.
Safety of environment, conservation of our river ponds, protection of the survivors of pollution, is in a way a service to God.
I don't know what kind of emotions we will take these issues of mine, but I don't tell them alone, but this is the belief of many.
According to some, the sculptor of Pune, Abhijit Dhondphale, the founder of Kolhapur, Nisarg Mitra, science scholars
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
Durga Puja has a lot of time .
Ganesh Chaturthi greetings to all of you.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be honored with the title of Saint on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had dedicated her whole life to the service of the poor of India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when Mother Teresa, who served the poor of India throughout her life, gets a saintly title.
The event will be held on 4th September, which will be attended by a delegation of officials led by the Government of India and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then there is a big change.
Manpower is the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments, has successfully tried to bring people together for clean Ganga and Ganga.
On the 20th of this month, the village heads of Ganga coast were invited to Allahabad.
I convey my best wishes to all the Chief Ministers who have come from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand and West Bengal for coming here for this pledge.
I congratulate all the Ministries and Ministries of the Government of India who have fulfilled this idea.
I also congratulate the Chief Ministers of all the five states that they have taken a definite step in the cleanliness drive of Ganga by bringing together the people's power.
Somebody wrote from English and somebody wrote from Hindi and somebody wrote from Chhattisgarh that there should be toilet in our house.
He urged them to build toilets.
Some kids wrote that this year my birthday will not be celebrated but definitely make toilets.
These children of seven to seventy years have done this thing.
It was so impressive and emotional that the next day, when I went to school, my parents wrote letters to the teachers and I was convinced that we will build a toilet in the house till one date.
Congratulations to all those students who have tried for this thing and specially congratulated the parents and decided to make toilets with their children's letters seriously.
A sixteen year old Kanya Mallama from this district called Satyagraha against her family.
Look at the specialty of these village heads Mohammad Shafi
He deposited eighteen thousand rupees and built a toilet within a week.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has been the dream of every Indian.
This is the resolution of some Indians.
Some Indians have made their goals.
However, every person has been connected in that form or not, every person contributes something or the other.
Everyday news comes about what kind of efforts are being made
The Government of India has asked the people to make a two-three-minute cleanliness film and send it to the Government of India.
I would like to tell television channels that we should also make such competitions.
Ideas of innovation can also strengthen the cleanliness drive.
I invite you, my friends and friends, India has always wanted to have relations with neighbouring countries.
However, this is not the channel of ordinary radio, it is an important step.
Our neighbour is Bangladesh.
We are well aware that Bangladesh and West Bengal are today associated with the same cultural tradition.
They will interact with each other and exchange ideas and enjoy All India Radio.
All India Radio has contributed immensely to people-to-people contact.
The Channel was inaugurated by the President.
Thanks to Bangladesh for working with us for this programme.
I also convey my best wishes to all the friends of All India Radio that they are contributing to the foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you have assigned a smoke to me as Prime Minister but in the end I am a person like you.
Sometimes emotional events touch me a lot.
Some such emotional events inspire, inspire and inspire Indians to do something or the other.
He wrote to me a 84-year-old mother-G Pension Teacher.
Even though I was told not to mention my name, I would like to mention his name.
In a letter, he said that he had asked me to give up gas subsidy, he gave up subsidy and then I forgot it.
However, a few days ago someone of ours came and gave me a letter and thanked me for the Give it up.
For me, this letter from the Prime Minister of India is not less than Padma Shri.
My dear countrymen, those who have left the subsidy on cooking gas, they have tried to give them a letter and someone will give me a letter from my representative.
It is my endeavor to give letters to more than one crore people.
He has written to me that you are doing a good job, your mission to free the poor mothers from the smoke of smoke and I am a retired teacher and I will be a young man in a few years.
I am sending a donation of Rs. 50,000 so that the poor mothers can be saved from the smoke of chulli.
We are aware of the fact that a mother who is paying her salary to a common teacher, when she gives 50 thousand rupees to the poor mothers for gas connections, the question is not about 50 thousand rupees.
This is the blessing of millions and millions of mothers and sisters that strengthen the faith in the future of my country.
He wrote this letter not to me as the Prime Minister but also to me as a simple letter - Modi Bhai
There have been frequent floods in some parts of the country.
State governments, central governments, local bodies and social institutions have done as much as possible by the citizens.
In August 2016, all the political parties, including the opposition parties, who did not give any opportunity to oppose each other, jointly approved the GST Bill.
The credit goes to all political parties and if all parties start walking together then this is an example of how big it was.
Similarly, in relation to the situation in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country have come together to take up a single issue.
Those people who try to develop this kind of temperament by moving ahead with these small children, they will have to answer it sometime or the other to the destitute.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big, it is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen the unity and the future of the country will be brightened.
I have full faith in the power of 1. 25 billion people.
This morning, I got the opportunity to stay with the youth of Delhi for some time. And I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports will paint every young man in the country with enthusiasm and hope.
You all are aware that within a few days, the world is going to have a big sporting magnificence.
The name Rio is going to be repeated in our ears.
25 billion people of the country have a lot of hope, but the people of the country have accomplished the self-confidence of those sportspersons who have gone to Rio.
We should do something or the other to encourage our sportspersons from wherever we may be in the coming days.
The sportsperson who reaches the Olympics reaches there only after working hard.
This is a kind of tough penance.
Winning and defeating is important, but at the same time, it is even more important to reach that sport. And that is why we convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons of our country for the Rio Olympics.
Today, I am talking about the Rio Olympics, a poem lover - Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of Punjab Central University, has sent a poem.
Many of you may be poets who have written poems, maybe they will write poems, some people will do that in every language, but the poem that Suraj has sent me is sharing with you.
These youngsters have reminded me of the death anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam ji.
The whole country and the world paid homage to him. But when Abdul Kalamji comes to his name, the words of science, technology, missiles come to his fore and the picture of a prosperous India comes to his fore. And hence, Ankit has written that what is your government doing to realize the dream of Abdul Kalam Ji
Your point is that Ankita ji
And if we want to go with him or go ahead with him then we should do research and innovation and both these things are the souls of technology.
If research and innovation are not there then technology becomes a burden just as the stagnant water creates stink.
If we live without research and innovation in the backdrop of old technologies then the government has taken a few steps to create a sweetness of science, innovation and innovation in the new generation so that it becomes timeless in this changing age.
And I say "let us aim to innovate", so it means "AIM".
10 lakh will be given to those schools where such tinkering labs will be constructed and Rs. 10 lakh will be provided for their care for five years.
On the other hand, India is facing many problems.
We see problems and difficulties in everyday life.
Now we have to find technologically based answers.
We have called upon the young generation of the country through Atal Grand Challenges to explore, research, innovate and take it to us.
I am glad that the Government of India is giving a special prize to the researched technologies that deal with problems and difficulties and I am glad that people are interested in it when we talked about Tinkering Labs.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, My mother was also worried about the drought. These days we are enjoying the joy of rain and the news of floods is also being reported.
The State Government and the Central Government are working shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to help the affected people.
Mann Ki Baat was delighted even when there were difficulties due to the rains because our entire economic upheaval was at the centre of rains and the farming was there.
Sometimes such diseases occur that we have to repent throughout our life .
But if we remain aware, alert and striving hard then the ways to avoid them become easy.
He looks at the VS but sometimes we are a little sad in terms of action.
The government, the hospital, the doctors will not only do their job but I urge you to be aware of the fact that you dont have to enter dengue in your homes, in your departments and in your family so that there is no disease related to water.
Dear countrymen, I want to draw your attention towards another crisis.
Today, life has become very fast. We don't get time to think about ourselves.
If the patient falls sick then he feels that he will recover at the earliest and hence antibiotics are taken.
We should not walk on the shortcut.
Complete the course of those pills .
Even if it is left incomplete then it will benefit the bacteria, it will benefit the bacteria even if they take more than required hence it has become a course for taking pills in the number of days.
It is necessary to fulfil it, but it is necessary to complete the course.
In medical terms, it is called nibiotic resistance, it should be followed by the rules and regulations of using nibiotics.
There has been a decline in the mortality rate of mothers in the last decade but even today the lives of pregnant mothers cannot be saved in a big way.
Decrease in the amount of blood during pregnancy , infection during childbirth , high blood pressure , unknowingly complications suppress their lives .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign called Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Through this campaign free check-up of pregnant women will be done at the government health center on the 9th of every month .
In order to save the lives of both mothers and children, I appealed to gynecologists whether you cannot provide free services to the poor mothers on the 9th of this month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not provide 12 days of a year for the poor
There are thousands of such doctors, they accepted my call and wrote the same letters as they did.
There are thousands of such doctors who have accepted me.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worrying about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is being discussed in a collective manner in the country and the world.
Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman said, Nasti Bali Anushadhan is not a herb which does not have medicinal properties.
Those who donate trees, they also take care of them in the world like their own.
But even today there are some people who follow these ideals and bring them into practice.
In the Anushasan Parv of Mahabharata, it has been said that trees also fulfill the responsibility of the child in the world, as if gold has taken the lead not only to our parents but also to fulfill the wishes of the entire society.
Khandu Marathi Mahatre, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junnar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra, married his grandson Sonal in a different motivational way.
The temples should start the tradition of planting in the rainy season.
Plantation can easily become a mass movement.
I tell the farmers that we damage the land due to damaging on the edges of our farms. Can we do timber farming instead of dams
Today, in order to build houses and wooden goods in India, a building worth crores of rupees has to be brought from abroad.
If we plant such trees on our farms that are useful for the goods and the work of the house, then after fifteen-twenty years we can sell them by cutting them off and sell them with the permission of the government, we can provide them with new means of income and you can save India from importing wood.
During the last few days, a lot of campaigns were carried out in several states using climate change. The Government of India has recently amended a CAMPA Act and more than Rs.
I was told that the Government of Maharashtra had planted 1. 25 crore trees in the entire state on 1st July and had pledged to plant three crore trees next year.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Maru-Bhumi celebrated a huge forest festival and pledged to plant twenty five lakh trees.
25 lakh trees are not a small thing in Rajasthan.
Those who are familiar with the land of Rajasthan, they can know how much they have taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase the green cover of 50 by 2029.
Railways have also started this work in the Green India Mission launched by the central government.
Gujarat has a bright tradition of the Sudha Forest Festival.
This year, several projects like Amravan, Ekta Forest, Shaheed Forest in Gujarat have been taken up under the Van Mahotsav and have been running a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but everyone deserves praise.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa.
Whenever there is a foreign tour, there are discussions about international policy business, security related discussions, some MoUs will happen.
But for me, the journey of South Africa was like a pilgrimage.
South Africa said that it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness fall on the ears of the world then we face the faces of Gandhi and Mandela.
During my visit to South Africa, I had visited the Finnics Settlement. The residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I will always remember his meeting.
"Equality and Equal Opportunity" is not such a mantra for any society and government.
The two paths of equality and discrimination lead us to a bright future.
We all hope for a better life, we want a better future for the children, the needs of everybody differ, the fronts differ, but the roads are the same and that is development, equality, equal opportunity, equality, feelings.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have demonstrated this value of life in South Africa in our lives.
He briefed me about one incident, the Prime Minister, I am speaking from Bengaluru with artificial wire.
A few days ago, I had read an article in the newspaper that a woman had lost Rs. 11 lakhs and committed suicide due to false e-mails.
I am deeply saddened by this as a woman.
I want to know your thoughts about this.
Everyone knows this thing that if we know about the fascinating things on our mobile phones and e-mails then there is a message that you have been receiving such a huge amount of money, you pay such a lot of money and take such a lot of money.
Some people get entangled with greed.
These technologies are spread all over the world.
Sometimes we are in love.
I believe that we should be cautious about this mission, we should be cautious. If such a false news comes, we should tell them in our friends, we should make them aware.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to meet several people during the Parliament session.
Our MP brings people from his department, he meets people, he tells them about himself, he tells them about his problems.
But I have had a pleasant experience these days.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
You would have seen the enthusiasm of the children and the daughters, you would have brought a big album along with yourself.
Artistic pictures are drawn and painted at the station.
You must visit Aligarh and see this station for sure.
This is an example of a change that can be brought about by peoples participation.
Thanks to all those who have worked like this in the country, special congratulations to my colleagues in Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with the rainy season, festivals also take place in our country.
Festivals are held in temples and pilgrimage centres.
You are also associated with these festivals at home and outside the house.
Raksha Bandhan is a special festival of our links.
Just like last year, cannot we give the mothers and sisters of our country the 'Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana' or 'Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana' on the occasion of Rakshabandhan
Just imagine, let us make such a visit to the sister that will give her a real life safeguard.
Moreover, if there is a woman who makes a meal in her house, if there is a woman who cleanses her house, if there is a daughter of a poor mother then you can also offer a 'Suraksha Bima Yojana' or 'Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana' on the occasion of Rakshabandhan.
My dear countrymen, there are many of you who were born after independence and I am the first Prime Minister of this country who was born in an independent India.
The 75th year of Indias independence and 70 years of Indias independence can give us new inspiration, new zeal and hope.
Freedom Festival is not a government programme, it should be done by the people of the country.
It should be a festival like Diwali.
I hope that you too will do something good that connects with the inspiration of patriotism.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August I get the opportunity to interact with the people of the country from the Red Fort.
Whatever you have, whatever you want, whatever you want, that thing should be depicted from the Red Fort.
As a representative of yours, if you want to tell me from the ramparts of the Red Fort as your Principal Servant then you must write to me and give me some suggestions and suggestions.
Let us commemorate the brave hearts who laid down their lives for freedom, let us remember the great men who laid down their lives for India and let us move ahead with our resolve to do something for the country.
Once again I have got the opportunity to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
For me, Mann Ki Baat means there is no ritual.
I am keen to interact with you myself.
And I am happy that I can reach every nook and corner of India through Mann Ki Baat.
I thank All India Radio for the successful efforts made by All India Radio to broadcast Mann Ki Baat in regional languages at 8:00 pm.
And I am glad that those citizens who listen to my Mann Ki Baat programme, they bring their feelings to me through telephone and through MyGov website and through the Narendra Modi App.
Your suggestions will help me in running the government.
How active should governance be for the welfare of the people
How much priority should be given to the welfare of the people
For this, my interaction with you is very important.
5th June is World Environment Day.
Environmental issues are discussed and carefully discussed all over the world.
The main theme of Environment Day on this occasion is that the United Nations has decided to discuss the issue of ero Tolerance for Elligel Wildlife Trade (EWT) as a complete stop to wildlife trade but we should also talk about trees and water.
You must have seen that the Himalayan foothills of Uttarakhand, Himachal and Jammu and Kashmir had recently been swept away by the forests.
Therefore, saving the forests and saving the water becomes the responsibility of all of us.
Nearly two-and-a-half hours of discussions were held with the Chief Ministers of every state.
The barracks heard what they wanted to say.
Some states, particularly Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, have used technology in abundance.
We need to take these successful steps taken by the State Governments to other states of the country through NITI Aayog.
Public participation becomes the main reason for success in addressing such problems.
Therefore, water conservation is equally important.
Therefore, Drop More Crop - every drop - more production, micro-irrigation, micro-irrigation, micro-irrigation, micro-irrigation and micro-irrigation.
In many states, sugarcane farmers are now using micro-irrigation and micro-irrigation and some are using Tushar irrigation.
I also came to know from them that there are major targets in many states, particularly Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat, which have done a great job in terms of magnificent irrigation.
They have tried to bring 2-3 lakh hectares of land under micro irrigation every year.
If this campaign is implemented in all the states, it will not only benefit the agriculture but also increase the water conservation.
Our Bandhu Mision Bhagirathi project in Telangana has made efforts to utilise the water of Godavari and Krishna rivers in a better way.
Efforts are being made to recharge ground water with the help of technologies through the Niru PRAGATI Mission in Andhra Pradesh.
In the peoples movement in Maharashtra, people are also providing financial assistance along with labour.
I am sure that the Jalakshit Shivar Abhiyan will really be useful in protecting Maharashtra from future water conservation.
The State of Chhattisgarh has undertaken a massive state-of-the-art state-of-the-art drive.
A massive campaign has been launched to revive the pilgrimage sites of Rajasthan and Gujarat, where the pilgrimages of the ancient period have been revived.
However, there is a shortage of water in some parts of that state.
A big work is being done by constructing checkhams and small bundles there.
This is really a pleasant experience.
But there is plenty of water therefore we stayed quiet and after the end of monsoon there was no water therefore how would it go
And water is not limited to farmers alone.
This is related to the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban, the rural, the Sreemant-Garib.
Therefore, when it is about to rain, water should be our priority and when we celebrate Diwali, how much water we have saved during the rainy season this year
You will see that your joy will increase manifold.
And this is not just the government but also the political leader but it is the work of the common man.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a modern India.
Our India is about to be transparent.
Those who have been delivering India from one end to the other in a similar manner.
We will have to change our old habits to do this.
Today, I would like to touch upon such a topic that if we help me in that direction then we can go there successfully.
But now the time has changed.
The entire world is moving towards a cashless society.
We can earn money and send money through electronic technology.
There is no fear of stealing the pockets in your pockets.
So it'll be automatically registered.
Use of this method will be a bit difficult in the beginning but once it is a habit, it will become easier.
This is possible because in the last few days, the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country were opened in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
On the other hand, Aadhaar number was also received and mobile phones are now available to almost every Indian in India.
Therefore, Jan Dhan, Aadhaar-Mobile-JAM (JDM).
We can move forward towards cashless system, cashless society by synergy with it.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given along with the Jan Dhan account.
In the coming days, it will be useful for both card credit and debit.
And a small instrument has also been made available to the PSUs.
O.
It is called the Point of Cell, through this machine you can lend money to others using Aadhaar number, RuPay card.
One of the initiatives undertaken by the Government of India is how the money can be paid through POS.
The second initiative we have taken is the bank on mobile.
It will be very easy to exchange money through your mobile phones.
In a way, this is the step taken by the bank in this direction.
Movements are also underway to provide banking services to the post office.
If we learn to use this method in practice, if we make it a habit then there will not be any need for direct movement, it will not be necessary to take the amount in the pocket.
Transactions will continue to happen automatically and will lead to transparency.
Non-vegetarian behavior will stop the behavior of two numbers.
The impact of timelines will also be reduced.
Therefore, I would urge the countrymen to start this thing.
You see, once this system has started, we should move forward in a comfortable manner.
Twenty years ago, had anyone ever thought that such mobile phones would be in our hands
Gradually it becomes a habit now it is not possible to stay without it .
It is possible that the cashless society will be gradually shaped.
But it will be better if it comes in a short span of time.
We should encourage our sportspersons who participate in the Rio Olympics and their confidence should increase.
He was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra.
But he was also the Minister of the Government of India.
Do they get nutritious food according to requirement or not
Whether the trainees who should be trained for their physical well-being or not
I am glad to see that the results of the elections, the possibility of assigning new responsibilities as chief minister, are so awakening about our work as sports minister in such a cooperative environment.
When our sportspersons believe that the 125 crore Indians are standing with us then this power becomes stronger and their self-confidence reiterates.
Last time, I had given the topic of FIFA Under Saventin World Cup.
I have received information about it from all over the country and during this period I can see that the atmosphere of football has started spreading across the country.
Many people are taking initiatives and forming their own team.
I have received several suggestions on Narendra Modi Power.
It is possible that many of them would not be playing but I had a pleasant experience of sports in the hearts of thousands of youth of the country.
You know the relationship between cricket and India, however, I have seen so much faith in football.
Everything should not be measured in terms of victory and defeat.
With the spirit of sportsperson, India must make its mark in the world.
I urge my countrymen to do something to create an atmosphere of enthusiasm for our sportspersons.
New results are coming from somewhere or the other for the last eight-ten days.
I am not talking about election results. I talk about those students who have studied and examined throughout the year.
Now it has become clear that our daughter is singing the bravery of our daughters.
Its a matter of happiness.
We must move forward with confidence.
But I have come up with a new kind of question and I have never thought about it.
I was very fond of reading this.
He says that when I went home after getting 89. 33 marks, I felt that I would be grateful all around. It would be a rain of congratulations.
But I feel stiffness in my mind.
I believe that this pain can not be yours alone but millions and millions of students like you.
It is because the environment has been created so that the joy in it can be flawed rather than accepting it.
This is the second form of negativeness.
I would like to urge the people of the neighborhood to welcome and appreciate the results that your children bring.
Otherwise, a day will come when you will get 100 percent of the quality. And even then someone will say that it is true that you have got 100 percent of the quality but if you have done it then it would have been better.
Therefore, it is important to have a limitation on everything.
Santosh Giri Goswami of Jodhpur has also written a similar letter.
He says that people near him are not ready to accept his fate.
They have to say that something better could have been done, something better.
I would like to tell you that in such a situation do not let yourself balance.
Everyone expresses hope and listens.
Stay firm on your resolve and try to do something better.
But if we don't find satisfaction in what we have achieved then we will never be able to build a new architecture.
And that is why I would urge you to sing the songs of success that has been achieved.
Those who do not get good qualities in the periphery go ahead in sports, move forward in the field of music, move forward in the region of Kalakusari, move forward in the business.
God has given everyone some skills.
Just recognise your inner strength, focus on it, you will make progress in your lives.
There was a time when the saints used to be an integral part of the folklore of Kashmir.
But Pandit Shivakumar, who took the play and today became an important player in the field of global music.
In the Sanai-Indian music field, the player was limited to Sanai.
During the times of kings and emperors, there was a place of Saint at the entrance of Darbar.
But Ustad Bisimilla Khan took over this sentence and kept Saila Neon at this height of one of the best in the world.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I realize that the expenses incurred on the medicines in the poor families of our country will be beneficial for those families.
And it is true that the cost of not falling sick is very low, but after falling sick the health becomes the same as before, but it costs a lot.
Why shouldn't we keep our lifestyle so that we don't get sick and we don't have to bear financial burden on our families
One is, maintaining cleanliness is the most important way of escaping from disease.
If someone can do the biggest service of the poor then it is cleanliness.
And secondly, the subject for which I constantly appeal is Yoga.
Some people also call it Yoga.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
The whole world is an attraction, a reverence for Yoga and the world has embraced it.
This is an invaluable gift given by our ancestors to the world.
The stressed world gets the strength to lead a balanced life.
It is easy for the people associated with Yoga to be healthy, balanced, inclusive and concentrated in every work.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just a programme.
And sometimes a collective atmosphere can change the lives of a person.
I hope you will do something about it on June 21.
The culture of the entire office changes and the environment also changes.
Can we use this day on 21st June for Yoga in our lives
Can we do Yoga in our social life
I urge you not to stay behind.
Being healthy is very important for India to be healthy.
My dear countrymen, through Mann Ki Baat, I continue to be associated with you.
Several days ago, I had given you a mobile number and you could hear Mann Ki Baat by giving it a missed call.
But now it has been made easier.
Whenever you want to listen to Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call to this number, you can hear it in that language.
Greetings.
We decide to do a lot of things during vacations.
And during these vacations it is considered as a season when it is seasonal, it is considered that if you want to enjoy Amba then it will be a bit late in the afternoon.
But this time, the joy of the moment has been enjoyed by the severe heat.
It is natural to have a careful environment throughout the country.
And whenever there is continuous drought in it, the water stream starts flowing.
Sometimes, due to encroachment, sometimes due to narrowing of roads, disruptions, there is less water conservation in the reservoir than its capacity.
And this happening year after year, the water conservation capacity decreases.
Despite this, I have seen that even the citizens are making very good efforts for this.
Awareness is seen in many villages and the true value of water is the same as those who have faced the crisis of extremism.
And there is a sense of sensitivity towards water conservation and there is also the ability to do something about it.
Just a few days ago, I was told that the Hivare Bazar Gram Panchayat and the villagers of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra have handled the issue of water in a very sensitive manner.
They decided not to waste crops such as potatoes, potatoes and bananas.
It sounds very easy to hear but it is not as easy as it is.
Have you made a solemn pledge together
He took the initiative in Tushar Irrigation, Dhibak Irrigation, Water Conservation and Water Recharge and hence, today this village is on the verge of eradicating water scarcity.
I am telling you about this small village of Hiverbazar but I congratulate all the villagers and their best wishes.
He built about seventy-twenty-seven farms.
As a result, ground water level increased and water level improved.
He added that when crops need water, they received water and high data.
The income from farming increased by twenty percent.
Besides water conservation, water quality improves due to rising water level.
However, many such initiatives are being taken by the citizens who never come forward.
If the government has adopted a good mission then sometimes it gets fame but if we look around you then we will find out how innovative solutions to overcome this problem.
It is a human nature that whenever there is a great deal of calamity, the feeling of elimination of all the calamities arises.
It is very likely that there will be 106 to 110 rainfall in the rainy season this year.
There is still time for the rains but the news that it will shower a lot of rain has come up.
Can we take a mission from now on to save water in the villages
Farmers need soil and it becomes useful for the crops in the field.
If we take the village bottom and put it in the field then it will not only benefit the agriculture but it will also increase the ability to collect water in the bottom.
Our neighbours will get water.
Today there is a problem of water, there is a situation of drought, but the next month and a half months are in our hands.
Their anxiety is social because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments came and several schemes were formulated so that a lot of money was spent on them.
Ganga gives us a blessing, it gives us employment, it gives us a new strength to live through the Ganges.
The way Ganga flows, it gives a new impetus to the economic activities of the country.
A bhagirath brought us the Ganges but it requires crores of bhagiraths to save it.
This campaign will never succeed without peoples participation.
Several efforts are being made in this regard at the government level.
Efforts are being made to obtain cooperation from the states that have been working on the Ganga.
Efforts are being made to involve social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have been taken to keep the flow of Ganga clean and to stop the industrial pollution in the waters of Ganga.
Everyday solid waste is supplied from the drains and drains of the Ganga.
In order to clean the waste, the work of cleaning water waste in Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna is done with the help of a trash skimmer.
It has been made available to all local administration agencies and they should use it to clean the waste.
And I was told recently that where these efforts are being made in a better way, 3 tons of waste is removed every day.
That is, it is true that the dirt that is being produced on such a large scale has stopped.
In the coming days, there has been a plan to set up a trash skimmer at some places and people living on the banks of river Ganga and Yamuna will soon experience it.
In order to prevent industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with paper-lagada industry, liquor manufacturing factories and sugar mills.
I still feel that it will have a good effect.
The exclusion of liquid waste from the paper factories is now almost on the way of closure.
This is the symptom of our steps in the right direction and in a way awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that if a person visits me in the southern part of the river then he will definitely say that the Ganga will be clean.
This confidence of the common man will succeed in the campaign for cleanliness of the Ganga.
Citizens are donating money for cleaning the Ganga.
This work is going on in a very good manner.
My dear countrymen, today 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
The Panchayati Raj system was started in our country on this very day.
And gradually the Panchayati Raj system spread all over the country has been successfully working as an important component of our democratic governance system.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Mhow, the birthplace of Dr. Ambedkar on 14th April.
I got the opportunity to bow down to that holy land and today on 24th December I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Day in the state of Jharkhand where our tribal brothers and sisters live in large numbers.
At 3 pm, he interacted with all Panchayats across the country.
This campaign has done a great job in creating awareness.
How empowered the democratic institutions at the village level in every corner of India
How will the village be self-reliant
Foodgrain initiatives have been taken in some villages.
The awareness that has come from the villages is that of India-UDAY.
Gram Uday is the basis of India-UDAY.
Therefore, if we focus on Gram Uday then we will not be able to achieve the desired results.
Shermila Gharpure called from Mumbai and expressed her concern.
I am speaking Gharpure from Mumbai to Sharma.
I have a question about school and college education.
There is a need for reforms in the education sector over the last several years.
Not getting proper schools or colleges or the quality of education .
Even after completing their education, they don't know many basic things, so that their children remain behind in the world.
What are our thoughts about this
Today, the biggest dream of mothers and sisters in every family is education for children.
And I believe that the results of this awareness among the families are visible in the school.
Every government in our country has emphasized on the issue of education and every government has made efforts for it in its own way.
But the more important it is now, the more it is about reforms in our education system.
You have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
uality Education should now be our priority through literacy missions.
As a result, we have to pay attention to the formulations that have been formulated today.
Today, priorities have been seen how many children came to school.
Now we will have to focus on providing good education and proper education to the children who have come to school.
You must have seen that in the budget of this government, efforts have been made to provide good education.
In this budget, we will see 10 government universities and 10 private universities coming out of government control and coming to a challenging, competitive level.
Would you like to work for the best universities
This scheme has been launched with the aim of giving them complete freedom.
At the same time, education is equally important.
For the past few days, citizens have been asking me about one issue.
Writing on the web portal MyGov, some people write on my Narendra Modi Power, and many youngsters write in it.
Honble Prime Minister Namaskar, I am speaking from Bijnor to Mona Karnawal.
Along with education, sports is also important for the youth of today's times.
They should have a sense of compassion, they should have good leadership, which will lead to their overall development.
I would like to encourage more and more youngsters and the government should also encourage NCC, NSS and Bharat Scouts and Guides.
One day I had come to my mind that before talking to you, talk to all these boards.
And when I asked him that earlier such a meeting was held, his reply was that this is the first such meeting since independence.
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all the youngsters and the young friends who have appealed to me for all these things.
A lot of work is being done at your level but if our organisations work in a collective manner in an organised manner then what kind of impact can be achieved
Now it is true that I was the cadet of the NCC itself, the National Cadet Corps.
And I believe that a new consciousness should be filled up in such organisations.
In this meeting, I presented a few issues to them.
We had to talk to him on a lot of things.
There are several youth organisations in our country, what innovations can be brought about in their work culture and programmes
If you write it on my Narendra Modi Power then I will go to the right place and I believe that after this meeting all these things will get a boost.
And I believe that you will also feel that you should associate yourself with them.
My dear countrymen, I have to tell you one thing that you will run away to think.
I believe that this is an awakening thing for all of us.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is such that what kind of gas cylinders will be provided by the party during the last several elections
And every political party used to feel that if the middle class had to go on the polls then gas cylinders were a very important topic.
This is a universal experience.
But it has never been considered outside this chatti.
Today, my countrymen, I am delighted to seek my blessings before you.
I chose a different path, and that path was to believe in the peoples movement.
Sometimes we have to trust our people rather than trust ourselves.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
Grant in our country has been denied in the event of such a right equation.
I would particularly urge all the political classes to do at least one thing for trusting the people everywhere.
We will get the result that we have never thought.
We have to go in this direction.
And I always feel that as if I had come to my mind, why should I have a sonhood for third and fourth class jobs
Believe in those who have been tested and qualifications, who have been sent.
Sometimes I feel that we should declare that there will not be any ticket test on this single line of railways.
It comes to my mind that there cannot be any government rules but a trustworthy environment can be created.
And this environment is not a political leader but a million families of the country have created it.
Every breaking news on every newspaper and news channel is difficult.
Whether something good happens to us in this country with a population of 1. 25 billion people
Please change the situation.
Raviji has expressed his deep anguish, but I believe that this anger is not on me but on the situation of heavy rains.
You must remember that Dr. A.
I have seen that some of the television channels set a positive news time.
An atmosphere of positive news is being created in today's era.
Everyone feels that people should get accurate news and good news.
It is true that the greatest person, the best thing, the best words, the best words will be spoken in a better way, the better the results will be the better news of the positive news.
It is true that if we put more emphasis on goodness then we will not have enough space for evil.
The darkness will be removed if the lamp is pitched.
And that is why it is perhaps impossible for us that the government has started a website called Transforming India.
Not only the government but also the citizens.
And this is such a portal on which you can send a good news of yourself.
You can contribute.
Ravi ji, you have asked for good news but please don't listen to me.
The Kumbh Mela is the specialty of our country.
Kumbh fair can become a center of attraction for tourists .
Very few people around the world knew that crores of people came to the river bank for such a long time.
Silence is celebrated in peaceful , calm and peaceful environment .
In order to organize such events, new parameters are being set up for public participation in programme management.
For the last two days, I have seen that many people are uploading photos of the Kumbh Mela.
I believe that the tourism department of the state government of India should compete with such photographs and urge people to upload the best photographs.
Not only should there be cleanliness, but those who return from there will take this message of cleanliness.
I believe that Kumbh Mela is a religious, spiritual fair but we can transform it into a social festival.
I am glad that as usual, things in my mind have added an unbreakable bond to things in my mind.
Mann Ki Baat always waits for me and you too.
During this time, I have seen a lot of letters, responses, phones, information and inspiration. Everybody can see something or the other, I can see a feeling. And there is a lot that I want to involve, but there is a limit of time.
Yet, I would like to share your thoughts with you once again in the threshold of Mann Ki Baat.
You might remember that the last time I had discussed a few things about Premchand ji's book and some of the books that I read were decided to share with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
Some people have advised me to talk about some more books.
But I have to acknowledge that I cannot give time to save a book on a very large scale.
But there is only one advantage that I get the opportunity to know about the subjects of several books from whatever you write and write.
However, I believe that we have to take this initiative forward from the experience of the last one month.
You should make a corner of books on the Narendra Modi App permanently and when you read a new book, I will write it there, discuss it and you can suggest a good name for the copies of these books.
And I am feeling that today the Indians have lost their hearts on the subject of water.
Several effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods.
Media has started several innovative missions on water conservation.
Whether it is the government or the NGOs, they are doing something or the other on the battlefield.
The rural people have worked hard to give a definite direction to the waterfall that flows from the mountains.
And that is the pure indigenous method.
This has not only prevented the loss of soil smoke and crops but also provided water to the farmers.
You will be glad to know that Meghalaya is the first state in the country to formulate a water policy in the North-East.
I congratulate the government there.
Farming of such crops is being encouraged in Haryana and the farmers are not suffering from any kind of loss.
Many fairs are held on the occasion of festivals .
Won't these fairs be used for water conservation
People from every corner of the society go to the fairs.
In these fairs, we can deliver the message of water conservation very effectively, fill the exhibitions, perform street drama. With festivals, we can convey the message of water conservation very easily.
In fact, the World Children Winners Sports Competition was held in Moscow this month.
This is a sportspersonship in which the youngsters who have survived from cancer are those who have emerged from cancer in their lives.
Football and Table Tennis were organised at the event.
All these 10 winners of our country won the medal.
Some of them have won more than one medal.
Sanjiv Haripura of Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Dada of Kolkata, P.
Several people from different parts of the country have written to me on Narendra Modi App and My Govt. And have urged me to discuss Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, this year 2019, the vision of Space Progress has been very vibrant for India.
Our scientists left ASAT in March and followed by Chandrayaan-2.
But there was not much discussion on the big and important events like ASAT in the polls.
With the help of ASAT missile, we have achieved the capability of launching satellites at a distance of 300 kilometers in just three minutes.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve unprecedented success and now, on 22nd July, the entire country will be proud to have taken steps in space from Chandrayaan 2 to Sriharikota.
The photographs of Chandrayaan 2 have filled the country with dignity and zeal and zeal.
Chandrayaan-2, this mission is special in many ways.
Chandrayaan-2 will further clarify our understanding of the Moon.
This will give us more detailed information about the moon. But if you ask me what two major things I have learnt from Chandrayaan 2 then I will tell you, these two things are Faith and Fearlessness means trust and fearlessness.
We must believe in our talent and capabilities. We must believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan 2 is completely Indian.
He is an Indian in both heart and attitude.
It is a campaign for the entire indigenous system.
When there was talk of innovation and innovation in new fields then our scientists are excellent, they are world class, this campaign has proved once again.
The second important factor is that there is no need to fear any crisis.
This work is unprecedented in the manner in which our scientists can solve all the technical questions in the Chandrayaan-2 space by record time, by day and night.
The world has seen this great penance of scientists.
It should be a matter of pride for all of us and the time has not changed due to difficulty.
We often have to face temporary setbacks in our lives but we always have the power to overcome them.
I am confident that the Chandrayaan-2 mission will inspire science and innovation to the youth of the country.
In the end, science is the path of development.
Now we are waiting for the month of September when Lander-Vikram and Rover-Technology will land on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I invite the youth and youth of the country by informing them about a very entertaining competition - a quiz competition
I urge the young friends and students to take part in this quiz competition and make the competition more entertaining and unforgettable.
I specially urge the schoolchildren, the enthusiastic headmasters and the teachers to make a lot of effort to win their schools.
The most thrilling thing is that the government of India will take its own expenses to Sriharikota and when it will land on the lunar surface in September it will get the opportunity to witness the moment.
This will be a historic event for these victorious students. You will have to participate in the quiz competition, get the maximum qualities and you will have to win it.
My dear countrymen, you must have done an inspection.
Mann Ki Baat has always been inspired by the efforts being made towards cleanliness.
The journey that started five years ago today is setting new benchmarks of cleanliness with the participation of several people.
We have achieved an ideal condition in terms of cleanliness. But the success that we have achieved in terms of cleanliness from the open defecation free villages to the public places is the strength of the resolve of a hundred thirty crore countrymen, but we will not stop here.
Now this campaign has moved from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I had seen the story of Yogesh Sainik and his team in the media.
Yogesh Sainik is an engineer and has left his job in America and returned to India to serve Mother India.
He had taken the initiative to make Delhi clean and beautiful just a while ago.
He started with his team from the garbage dung of Lodhi Garden .
Beautiful paintings are provided to many parts of Delhi through street arts.
When he started displaying his art from the walls of overbridge and school to the slums then people also got support from him and in a way this silsila started.
You might remember that during the Kumbh Mela, Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings.
I understand that Yogesh Saini and his team had played a very big role in it.
The colours and fibres cannot be heard, however, the message of the rainbow that is produced by them is more effective than thousands of words and we also experience it in the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us to develop a culture of waste to wealth in our society.
If we talk about it then we have to move forward towards making gold from waste.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting response to MyGov.
This was the reaction of Bhai Mahmood Aslam, who lived in Shapian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote, I like listening to Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to say that I have played an active role in organizing the Community Mobilization Programme Bank to Village in Jammu and Kashmir in my state.
At the same time, there should be an online monitoring system for the programme.
I believe that this was the first such programme in which people had a direct interaction with the government.
Bhai Mahmood Aslam ji sent me this message and after reading it my eagerness to know about the bank to village programme increased and when I got a detailed account of it, the entire country should be aware of it.
This programme envisages how the people of Kashmir are eager to connect with the mainstream of development and how enthusiastic they are.
uestions on literacy, gender quality, health, sanitation, water conservation, electricity, water, grassroots education, senior citizens were discussed.
Friends, This programme was not just a formality of the government but the officers returned to the village throughout the day, but this time the officers took a two-day stay in the Panchayat and they got the opportunity to stay in the village.
Under Khelo India, children were sportspersons.
Sports literature, job cards of MNREGA and certificates of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were also shared.
The people of Kashmir participated openly in this festival of development.
It is a matter of great pleasure that the Bank to Village programme was organised in such remote areas where government officials had to pave the way for a day and a half after climbing the mountains.
The officers also went to border Panchayats where there is constant fear of cross-border firing, and not only did the officers go fearlessly in the highly sensitive areas of Shapian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts.
Some officials were so much enthusiastic that they stayed in the village for more than two days.
It is extremely pleasant that there should be a large number of Gram Sabhas in these areas and people should take part in it and prepare plans for themselves.
It is also clear that people are watching evils in the path of development, they are watching ruthless merchandise and they cannot succeed in their cottage goals.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, the recipient of the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented the glory of the month of Shravan in one of his poems.
In this poem, he has said, "Wodige Madige Agyed Danna, underground magnificence... i.e. the shadow of rain and the stream of water are tied and the earth is enchanted by its beauty.
Throughout India, Alag culture and speaking people celebrate Shravan month their own methods.
In this situation, when we look around, it appears as if the earth has envisaged a shawl of greenery.
Everywhere a new energy is transmitted.
In this holy month, many devotees visit Kavad and Amarnath Yatra, while some regularly fast and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nagapanchami.
During this period, the festival of Rakhi Purnima, a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters, is also celebrated.
You will be happy to know that the most emotional participants have participated in the Amarnath Yatra for the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave since 1st July.
More than the devotees who participated in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, the devotees have participated in it in just 28 days.
I especially commend the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey carry the feelings of love and affection of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I have been told that more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham in a month and a half since the Chardham Yatra has started in Uttarakhand this year.
For the first time, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there after the epidemic disaster in 2013.
I appeal to all of you that you must go to those areas where the natural beauty was visible during Mansoon.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage is not a big teacher.
I convey my best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and auspicious month of Shravan will bring a new energy, new hope and new hope amongst you.
Similarly, the month of August brings memories of uit India Movement.
I would like you to make some special preparations for the 15th of August and find a new way to celebrate this festival of freedom.
When we watch TV, we can see only one aspect of the rains - floods, sewage water, traffic drizzles, Mansoon and other paintings. We will have to go out with our family if we see the farmers, the birds, the flowing waterfalls, the shales of the valley.
Rain, freshness and joy both bring freshness and happiness with you.
My dear countrymen, where to start Mann Ki Baat, where to stop, there is a difficult task but there is a limit of time.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My young friends, you must be staying in the examination.
Today, you are often waiting for the conflict between India and Australia.
India has fought against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
It is time to bring about a new revolution in the world of sports.
And you will see that like cricket in India, an environment is also being created for football, hockey, tennis and kabaddi.
Perhaps you would be aware that India is hosting the FIFA World Football Championship next year in 2017.
Twenty-four confederations from across the globe will be participating in India.
And on the other hand, I see that the attraction of football is increasing among the youth, be it EPL, Spanish League or Indian Superlig.
Young friends take time to know about these conflicts, to watch them on a face-to-face television.
How will there be a competition between governance, educational institutions and social organizations to connect themselves with sports
We see that all this has happened in terms of cricket.
But we have to create this environment for other sports as well.
This is a golden opportunity for India to be recognized.
My dear students, you must have decided on tourism during these holidays.
And I came to know that the work that we did not get accumulated in our tourism department, our cultural department was not possible, the state governments were not able to do it and the government of India was not able to do it, crores of tourists of the country did it.
India is full of diversity.
Perhaps there will not be a single district in India where I have not visited.
I specially congratulate Coal India.
And I am glad that nearly ten thousand people have visited the coal mines of Sawaner near Nagpur as tourists.
Some attempts are being made by both tourists and tourists .
All efforts are being made not only in a scientific manner but also in a way.
Would you like to pay special attention to this
I am sure my young friends will help me in this work.
It is possible to generate massive employment through tourism sector.
India is far behind in terms of tourism as compared to the world .
But if 1. 25 billion Indians decide to focus on tourism then we can attract the world towards India.
Our country can create employment opportunities for millions and millions of youngsters by attracting the larger share of tourism worldwide to our country.
Whether it is governance, institution, society or citizens, all of us have to do this together.
Let us strive towards this thing.
My young friends, I don't think that bets have come and they have gone like this.
If you are not able to swim, you should decide to learn to swim in these beds.
If a bicycle cannot be driven by these bettings then it cannot be cycle driven.
Even today, while typing on computer, I do with two fingers. Why shouldn't I learn to typing a cleaner
There are many skills for our personality development.
It will increase so much that after the start of the school after the vacation, when the college starts, you will go back to it and tell your friend that Dosta, I have learnt this vacation, if I don't learn anything then he will say.
My time was over but you have learnt new things.
Friends, there will be mutual discussions on this.
Many suggestions have been received on MyGov in Mann Ki Baat.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi, Namaskar, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji.
In the summer holidays we had said that the spectacles also have the problem of sunlight , for this keep water filled in a vessel in your balcony or glass for snacks .
I did the same and I was glad to tell you that it was my friendship with Chimanyas.
He called me and reminded me of a handicraft work .
Last time I remembered and I had said that during the summer season, keep water filled with earthen pots for the parties.
The actress told me that she does this throughout the year and she has been friends with many people.
Mahadevi Varma, the great poet in the field of Hindi literature, had a great love for the birds.
He had written in his poem, "Do not let you go away, will fill the courtyard with donations and will fill the hood with hum salt and sweet cool."
Let us also do this thing that Mahadevi ji had said.
I congratulate and thank you for taking into consideration a very important issue.
Have we ever given them water during summer days
I express my gratitude to you all for the craftsmanship and for the sensitivity of you people in a very simple manner.
Yes, it is a habit in India.
But I express my gratitude to you for seeing this sculpture.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, You must have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people believe that Digital India is the world of the youth of the city.
But this is not the case.
You will be happy to know that a Kisan facility has been prepared for your service.
If we download the Kisan Suvidha App in our mobile phones then we will be able to handle a lot of information about agriculture and climate.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download these facilities on their mobile phones.
My farmer brothers and sisters, For others, summer is the time of vacation but summer is the time for farmers to sweat.
It waits for the rain.
The period before the start of the direct farming season is very important for the farmers.
But our countrymen should also think about what will happen to us with water.
Lakes, water-driven drains, water-driven ponds, water-driven pathways, sewage-driven waste-driven areas, water-driven drains, water-driven drains, and thus water-logging gradually reduces.
In the first rainy season, if water was saved, if the ponds were filled, if the rivers were filled then it would not have rained but it would have caused less damage.
You must have seen that we have decided to construct 5 lakh farms.
Emphasis has been laid on water conservation through MNREGA.
There will be several such villages across the country, many progressive farmers, many more aware people who have done this thing.
However, there is a need to do more today.
My farmer brothers and sisters, today I would like to tell you one more thing that the Government of India had recently organised a grand exhibition on agriculture.
I have seen in it how modern technology has come up in agriculture.
But it still remains to be refined directly to the fields.
Now it has become a farmer to reduce the fertilizer consumption.
This mantra should be followed and our agriculture sector should move forward using scientific methods.
I hope that we will complete the task of water conservation in the next one or two months.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
Victory on Diabetes is the announcement of World Health Day this year.
It is said that in 2014, the institution of diabetes patients in India was about 1. 5 crore.
3 of the deaths due to deaths have been reported as diabetes.
As the whole world is concerned about diabetes, the theme of Victory on Diabetes is on 7th April, the World Health Day.
We all know that our lifestyle is the main cause of type 2 diabetes.
If you like Yoga, then do Yoga asana.
Otherwise do minimum walking , running and exercise .
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we are hesitant to conduct health check-ups.
And when it gets very bad then it becomes clear that diabetes has already shrinked in our body.
This means that it is a disease which can be tested promptly.
My dear countrymen, we are doing a lot of work in this regard.
I would like to inspire you to do your best to eradicate tuberculosis or diabetes.
And that is why I urge all my countrymen to get rid of tuberculosis to overcome diabetes.
Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
His 150th Birth Anniversary was celebrated across the country.
One Panchteerth - his birthplace in Mhow.
Landon, where he took higher education, Nagpur, where he learnt.
I am fortunate to visit Mhow at the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to become an excellent citizen.
Being a good citizen, we can pay a great tribute to him by following his path.
In the last few days, a record commencement will start and a new record commence.
They are celebrated in different states in different ways.
You can hear it on your mobile phone.
We just want to give a missed call.
Make a missed call according to your convenience.
If you want to listen to the previous programme of Mann Ki Baat then you can listen to it in your language.
I would be glad to be with you through this.
My dear countrymen, many congratulations to you all.
How can this World Cup enhance the interest of sports among the youth of India
You should also participate in it.
He sent photographs of some such places and uploaded Photo that he was really happy to see them.
If you want to see something like hobby-e-didar hai nigga, you can see it beforehand.
He should have the desire to reach wherever no one has gone before.
Western Coal Fields Limited, Sawaner Sthal near Nagpur, where there are coal mines.
When tourists go then they buy something or the other .
Even if he is poor, he will take something and if he is a lord, he will spend more.
I ask you a question before me.
Would you like to imbibe a new art in these bettings, a skill in your personality for achieving something new
Why not increase your strength
You like paintings but you do not know .
We will start and we will start.
Definitely use vacations for personality development, learning new arts and skill development.
There are countless sectors.
The craftsman Kuke of Mysore has put forth a sensitive issue in front of us.
If you ask them a question then they answer it and explain it to us.
And once you use it then see what is your usefulness in it
And even then if you feel a little bit of alienation then you should complain to me about it.
Save water in villages and villages.
How can we save the drops of water in the coming years
How can the water of the village remain in the village
I welcome this idea.
We have sickened our landscape due to excessive use of fertilizers.
But if the best spices are used by the basumar then would they like to eat food
You will not like the same food.
But today we have become ineffective in terms of TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, you are listening to my Mann Ki Baat on radio.
Now the ideas of exams will start in your minds.
I would also like to join you in this journey.
I feel as much care as you are concerned about your children's exams.
But if we change our perspective of examining then we can become anxious.
I had told you in the background of my Mann Ki Baat programme that send me your experiences and suggestions on the Narendra Modi Power.
I am glad that the teachers, the students who have achieved great success in their lives and the interests of the society have written a lot on this page and sent it to me.
Today, I would like to talk to my parents, students and teachers especially in my Mann Ki Baat programme.
I will tell you something about what I have heard, what I have read and what I have been told, I will also tell you what I feel for myself.
But I believe that this 25-30 minute interaction will certainly be beneficial for the students who are going to face the examination.
My dear student friends, if I start the Mann Ki Baat today by a well-known opener then what will be useful to them while attaining the heights of success in life
Their experience will certainly be useful to you.
I know that the examinations will start in a few days.
Some of you will be under stress.
I have only one message.
Your parents will keep expectations from you, keep your teachers, keep other members of your family and keep your friends.
Wherever you go, how is your preparation going on
How much qualities will you get
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
In the last 24 years, several difficult moments have come and several good moments have also come.
However, the expectation of the people used to go up and as the time went on, the expectation also increased.
And I needed to find a solution for that.
Then I thought that I had kept my hopes for myself and had set my own goals.
My focus was on consciousness and then all the goals were achieved by you.
Friends, what was Tendulkar saying
Do not go under the weight of expectations .
Your future needs to be shaped.
Should we spend our time competing with others
You will see that no one will be able to stop you from going ahead and if you succeed even more than what you have achieved earlier then you will not need to depend on others to enjoy your happiness.
You will experience self-sacrifice.
Friends, Do not consider examination as a game of qualities and figures.
Where did you go, how much did you get
Or don't stubbornly stumble.
This is known through these tests, is our speed right
And that is why if your dream is immense, it will be a festival of joy.
And that is why what will happen this year and what will happen in this scenario
Do not keep yourself limited at all .
Walk ahead with a great goal and even if there is less success than expected, it will not be disappointed. It will inspire you to do more with zeal and energy.
Thousands of citizens have written small issues on my power and their mobile phones.
In fact, the entire year, 365 days should be suitable for our daily routine, our dreams and ideas.
Shri Prabhakar Reddy slept on time and urged me to lit up early in the morning to light the study.
Shri Prabhakar Reddy says that timely access to examination centres, including entrance papers and other necessary things.
Perhaps I did not have the courage to say this because I am not serious about sleeping.
And there is a complaint of my many friends that I don't take enough sleep.
During the examination, I would like to talk about sleeping so that you can examine in a stress-free condition.
Will you not do this or not
I am sure you will not.
Being disciplined in life is one of the main reasons behind the foundation of success.
Not only this, daily routine also causes disorder.
And that is why don't understand anything small or small.
Decide, do it.
The negative impact of the stresses under these tensions is on their outcome.
And on the basis of the study that I have done, I go to any question paper solving with confidence.
Let us know from them the way to achieve success by giving a befitting reply to this milestone.
Namaskar Me Vishwanathan Anand.
Let me begin by wishing you all the best for your exams.
I would like to share my experience on how I should go for my examination.
Exams, I have realized that these problems are similar to the problems that will come after you.
You should rest properly, have a quiet sleep at night, you should eat all your stomach, you must not be hungry and the most important thing is that you should stay calm.
All this is like the left of the intellect .
When you are playing, you don't know what kind of pairs are going to come up, you don't even know in the classroom what kind of question is going to come up in the examination.
Therefore if you remain calm and you have eaten food throughout the stomach , if you have sleeped properly then you will know that your brain is reminded of the correct answer at the right time .
That's why it was quiet.
Do not put too much pressure on yourself , do not expect too much .
Look at this as a challenge. Can I appeal to me what I have taught me in the year
Recall the most important thing in the last minute, remember those things that you do not remember. When you are examining, you will probably remember some issues with the teachers or with the students and this will help you to remember a lot about that topic.
If you illuminate the difficult questions then you will realise that these are new questions for you and then you will be able to solve them better when you examine them.
Therefore, be quiet, take a good night's sleep, don't be very confident, but don't be disappointed at the same time.
I have often seen that this examination is better than you were afraid.
And while playing with international intellectual power, you must have seen them how they sit very fondly.
Its true that it is difficult to say this thing but we should make efforts.
You don't talk to friends, you go alone, you stay like a commodity, if you keep on washing the book for the last moment then your mind won't be calm.
If the water is calm then it is very deep but if the water falls then there is nothing below .
At that time it feels like inner tension.
Then I feel that if you rest a little then it will be better.
I myself have developed a system for this.
I breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe three times or five times deeply.
It takes 30 seconds, 40 seconds or 50 seconds for all these things, but after that my mind was calm and I was prepared to understand the subject.
It is also possible that my experience will be useful to you.
Silver Agrawal has said a good thing.
You must spend at least half of your time with your friends and family in happiness in writing on my pages.
And what do you do
Friends, don't do that.
If you have ever visited a place with your parents then recall it for at least half an hour after getting out of the study and examination.
Rajat ji said that it is necessary to understand the issue.
Friends, Can I tell you about Shanti
Today, before you are tested, a person who has sent a message of taxation that is basically a teacher and has become an economist today.
Ramcharit Manasa is linking this great scripture with the present time and he is trying to embrace these values across the country and around the world.
The revered Murari Bapu has spoken of a clue about the students.
Friends, I want to tell you one more thing today.
G.
But one thing is certain that in the journey of development of the second half of life, in the journey of development of inner life, Yoga is like Gurukuli.
You must pay attention to it.
But I have full faith in it.
My young friends, do you feel that you have the greatest need to go to the examination centre to go to Patna and sit on your back
Otherwise tension arises in the mind .
If you understand those suggestions then you will not have the time to repent.
I have also seen that the form of uestion Paper has changed.
In his message, Shri Rao underlined the issue of patience.
In a few words, Rao Saheb has sent a beautiful message of Kamali. You must listen to me from Bangalore.
R.
Rao speaks.
I am fully aware of the fact that the examinations can restrain it from competitive examinations.
Don't care.
Give me the best, I tell you all my young friends.
But at the same time, keep in mind that there are many other opportunities available in this country.
Decide what you want to do in life and don't quit it, you will succeed.
Do not forget that you are the labourers of this world. Like trees and mountains, you also have the right to live here.
You need that letter of dedication and dedication.
Because of these qualities, you will succeed in examining and other efforts.
I convey my best wishes to you all for what you have to do.
Many blessings.
"How does a scientific method of discussing the issue in the forefront
Whatever I take half an hour to say, they tell me in three minutes.
This is the power of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
He spoke of dedication, determination and diligence.
Friends standing firmly.
If you are standing firmly then fear will also be there.
And the golden future will wait for you to be accomplished with your hands.
Ruchika Dabbs has conveyed my message to me.
And it is true that Sachin ji also said that a positive attitude, a positive state of mind, a positive energy.
Sometimes a lot of things that inspire us, do not think that inspiration comes only to the students.
Any moment of life, every moment of life, every moment of life, every moment of life, every moment of life, every moment of life, every moment of truth gives us immense inspiration, every moment of life gives us immense strength.
We read about Thomas Alva Edison, the father of Electricity Division.
Friends, Have you ever thought that how many years have they spent on this discovery
Although he did not have any special education on mathematics, Ramanujan added heavily to various sectors such as mathematical classification and uncertainty.
K.
Rolling himself had said that this power was important for him.
In today's era, this test is not only for students, but also for all families, schools and teachers.
Vijay Jindal has said that the parents should not impose their expectations on their children.
And after seeing this, we not only go to Deepawali but we like to take hands with them.
We also feel that we should progress at the pace of science.
This is the reason that today is the National Science Day.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
And as a reminder, we celebrate 28th February as National Science Day across the country.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Every generation has to pay attention to new innovations in the field of scientific thoughts, science and science.
New research is not possible without the involvement of science and technology.
Today, on the occasion of National Science Day, new innovations across the country should be encouraged.
"I am Sir C.
Friends, sometimes it takes a lot of time to achieve success and when success comes, our attitude towards the world also changes.
You must have heard that in the last few days science has found a big and important discovery in the world.
Scientists from all over the world have worked hard, many generations have come, they have added a lot.
The discovery of Einstein's theory of the great scientist of the last century has not only strengthened it, it has also proved to be a great discovery in the field of physics.
It is a matter of fact that the entire humanity will be beneficial to the entire world.
It is a matter of great pride and joy for us as an Indian that the sons of our country and the skilled scientists of our country were also involved in this research process.
Our scientists will make efforts to further this new discovery in the times to come.
India will be a part of international efforts.
And my countrymen, a significant decision has been taken recently in this regard.
The Government of India has decided to set up LIGO India as the Gravitational Wave Observatory of Laser Interface.
There are two such centres in the world, the third will be in India.
Indias participation will give a new energy, new momentum to the process.
India will actively participate in this great scientific discovery of human welfare through limited resources.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you one number, take it away.
By giving a missed call to this number, you can listen to me from tomorrow.
Let us also listen to our mother tongue.
81908-81908. I reiterate that 81908-81908.
Friends, I am going to examine tomorrow.
125 crore Indians will take my exams.
Yesterday I was tested that Parva will start with you.
And only then will the country succeed.
Friends, many congratulations to you.
Free from the stress of success and failure, move forward with a free mind.
I have said two things in the last episode Mann Ki Baat.
Recently we have celebrated the Christmas festival and now we have started preparations for the New Year's reception.
India is endowed with diversity.
Festivals are celebrated with great fanfare .
Sometimes it feels that India is a country based on its economy.
Whether the entire world is free from crisis or be it terrorism or be it global warming or be it natural crisis or be it human-made, all mankind live in happiness and peace
You are aware that I use technology to a great extent and I get ample information about various topics.
I always see MyGov portal.
People visit different places to celebrate Christmas holidays.
In the tourism sector, special attention is being paid to provide all the facilities to the tourists. However, it is said that wherever there are tourist spots, there are dharamshalas and religious places, there should be special focus on cleanliness.
And as you say, "Guest Devo Bhava", when guests will come to our house then you will clean the house and decorate the house.
Therefore, we should pay special attention to the cleanliness of our tourist places and religious places.
In Bhojpura village in Sihor district of Madhya Pradesh, Dilip Singh Malviya lives as a veteran artisan at an age.
I was saved and I felt that I should reach you.
Dilip Singh Malviya, who lives in Chhotayasia village, decided that if anybody provides the goods to construct toilets in the village, he will not get the construction wages, he will make toilets free.
Assuming that construction of toilets is a sacred task, Dilip Singh built 100 toilets in Bhojpura village.
I convey my heartfelt regards to Dilip Singh Malviya.
This country is progressing at a rapid pace due to the untiring efforts of several people.
Whenever every Indian knows that Saray Jan Yoga has been attracted towards it, and when the whole world celebrated International Yoga Day and when the whole world was connected, then there is a belief in our mind that this is our India.
This belief, this feeling is created in your mind only when we see a vast form.
The topic of cleanliness is now being discussed in a way at home.
The participation of citizens will increase among them.
The biggest benefit of this thing is that those government employees who have been working to provide electricity to the villages will be satisfied with this thing that they have done the work of transforming the lives of a village into a massive change. You will be pleased to know that the farmers, the poor, the women and the youth should be able to deliver these things to them.
It is their right to ensure that no government has done any work and no government has done any work so that they dont lose it.
We have to make every effort so that the right thing, good things, things that are useful for the common man can reach them.
Doing so is a service in a way.
I have made a small effort on my behalf.
I can't do this alone, but when I tell you, I don't want to do anything.
We have to reach out to 125 crore Indians.
How can I reach without your help
Let us reach them in the language of the common man and inspire them to get their rights.
My young friends, in the address delivered from the Red Fort on 15th August, I had made a preliminary discussion on the theme Startup India Stand up India.
After that the work started in every department of the government, in every department.
Can India become the world capital in terms of start-ups
In a new way, with new innovations, start-ups will be an excellent opportunity for the youth of our states, be it manufacturing sector or be it the services sector or be it the agriculture sector.
In every case, new ideas, new experiments and innovations need to be innovated.
Start-up India, Stand-up India scheme is a big opportunity for our youth.
My young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India will unveil a plaque to mark the launch of the Start-up India Stand-up India scheme.
But not at all, we have to change it as per the requirements of India.
Our young friends are expected to explore something that will reduce the hardships and hardships of a poor person.
I urge the state governments to take initiative in this regard.
On 16th January, I will talk to you more in detail.
I will always welcome your suggestions.
Dear young friends, 12th January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Like me, millions and millions of people of this country have taken inspiration from Swami Vivekananda.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as the National Youth Festival from 12th January, 1995.
This year, the event will be held in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
I am aware that this year's theme is Indian Youth of Development, Skill and Honey.
He commemorated the ease of doing business in his school, Excellent India Day, and expressed his sense of telephone.
When Yoga comes to meet those people who work in the society then there are many ideas in their minds.
Now it is true that every word has a different significance.
The Government of India had launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan this year but I was unable to attend the Accessible Bharat Abhiyan programme in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai.
But I used to feel like going to that programme.
For example, I felt that in our country we should use the term 'Divyangjan' instead of 'Divyangjan'.
These are the people with whom there are more or less such parts that have divine power, which are not associated with people like us.
I liked this word very much.
Why would the people of my country now use the word 'Divyang' instead of 'Divyangjan'
I hope that we will take this idea forward.
We have started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan that day.
These infrastructure reforms need to be implemented directly and indirectly to make these Divyangjans accessible to the people.
Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, ramps in railway stations, accessible parking, accessible transportation, Braillepiece etc.
They like this.
You should also participate in it in your own way.
My dear countrymen, government schemes are going on continuously but this scheme is not only artificial intelligence but also a spirit of consciousness.
It must reach the last mile in a better way.
Their breath should not be inhaled in the files .
The government of India has made an effort a few days ago to provide the benefits of the scheme to the common man, to the poor and the needy.
Grants are given to LPG cylinders in our country.
This amount is of crores of rupees but we did not have the system to ensure that it did not reach the beneficiaries in the right time.
The government has made some changes in it.
Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme (DBT) has been implemented in the world with the help of Jan Dhan Bank Account and Aadhaar Card and the amount of grants has been deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
I would like to say with pride that this initiative has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records as the worlds largest and most successful Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
The scheme is known as Pahal.
By the end of November, nearly 15 crore LPG holders have become beneficiaries of Pahal scheme.
This grant is being directly credited to the bank accounts of 15 crore people.
There is no need for anybody's recommendations, there is no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, Aadhar card and Jan Dhan accounts are being opened on the other and on the third hand, the state government and central government are working together to create liabilities for the beneficiaries and link them to Aadhaar number and account number.
A few days back, MNREGA will create employment opportunities in the villages.
There were several complaints about this.
My belief is that about 35-40 schemes are now being included under Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a golden moment of Indian Republic Day.
It is the centenary year of the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The Constitution was specifically discussed in Parliament for two days and it was done in a very good manner.
All the parties have discussed the importance of deciding, the importance of deciding, the root cause of the deciding.
Can people do the work of connecting people with power and power with the people on the occasion of Republic Day
There should have been discussions and discussions about the events that gave us a lot of rights.
It is our sacred duty to ensure that there is a lot of publicity around the time of elections, it is written on the walls that it is our sacred duty to vote.
"Why doesn't it happen in every life just as we discussed our duties at the time of voting
Babasaheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary was celebrated on 26th January, when he had organised essay competitions, poetry competitions and essay competitions in schools, colleges, villages and societies in the cities.
If 1. 25 billion Indians move ahead with one step after the other with duties then it will be a great history.
I want to know your thoughts.
Send your writing on MyGov.
I would like to know what the younger generation of my country thinks about it.
And I am not speaking at the government level.
We build the effigies of great men with great devotion but afterwards we are disappointed with Kamali.
On the other hand, preparations for consumption have also started.
Festivals are an important factor in the society.
Sometimes these festivals blossom sadly and sometimes create new ones.
But sometimes during these festivals if a crisis arises then it is very painful .
There are reports of natural calamities from every corner of the world.
There are reports of natural calamities that we have never heard or have not thought of.
We are now experiencing the rapid impact of climate change.
The way in which there has been heavy rainfall in our country in the last few days and the way in which Tamil Nadu has suffered losses and other states have also been affected.
Many people died.
I convey my heartfelt condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
The State Governments are doing rescue and relief work with full force.
The central government also works shoulder to shoulder.
At present, a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I am confident that even after this crisis in Tamil Nadu, he will again start moving forward with confidence and the role played by him in the development of the country will be fulfilled.
But when we look at the crisis around us, we need to make several changes in it.
15 years ago, natural calamities were part of the Department of Agriculture as the natural calamities were confined to these areas.
Today its form is changing.
We need to enhance our capabilities at every level.
For this, the government, the society, the citizens, all the small and big institutions will have to work with the approach of science.
After the Nepal earthquake, I interacted with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and suggested that SAARC countries should come together to conduct a joint exercise to combat disasters.
I am glad that the workshop on discussions and best practices of SAARC countries was held in Delhi.
A good beginning has been made.
Lakhwinder Singh telephoned me from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
Mr. Lakhwinder Singh is speaking from Jalandhar district of Punjab.
We do organic farming here and guide many about this farming.
I have a question as to how those people who plant cattle or cows in the fields cannot understand how these microbes die and how they can be guided by the pollution in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
I am very happy to hear your question, Lakhwinder Singh.
The first thing to be happy is that you are an organic farming farmer and you not only do organic farming yourself but you also know the problems of the farmers very well.
Your concerns are correct but this is not just happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of people all over India and we burn the remains of crops like this in a traditional way.
But the pain you have expressed is correct .
First of all, we should educate our farmer brothers and sisters in this regard and inform them that if we burn the remains of crops then we will be able to save time and time for the next crops.
But this is not true.
We destroy it but if we do these ruins in small pieces then it will be a dry fodder for the animals.
Secondly, after burning it, the upper level of the land burns.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Just imagine for a while that our bones should be strong, our hearts should be strong, kidneys should be good, but if the skin of the body burns then what will happen
We cannot survive even if the heart is fit.
The way skin of our body burns it is difficult for us to stay alive , similarly skin of our ribs burn not only on the skin of our ribs but also on the burning of our skin of our mother .
Animals will not only be used as fodder but they will also be able to reap the fertilizer produced in that land.
The water in those pits is sufficient for that crop and today their pits have also been valued.
They are now getting income from these pits.
Earlier, those kitchens that had to be spent on cleaning the kitchens, today they have become a source of income and demand is increasing.
Dear Countrymen, the upcoming 3rd December is being celebrated as International Day of Persons with Disabilities across the world.
27 November was celebrated as India's Organ Donation Day.
Film actor Ravina Tandon and other eminent personalities participated in the event.
Many valuable lives can be saved by organ donation .
Organ donation provides immortality in a way.
When an organ from one body goes to the other body then that organ does get a new life but that person also gets a new life.
What could be better than this
A National Registration on Transplantation of Organs and Organs has been started on 27th November.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness in this area and in the true sense it will provide the best support to the needy because this help cannot be available till nobody donates organs.
As I have said earlier, December 3 is being celebrated as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally challenged persons are also adventurous and capable persons.
When such individuals are deprived of them then they suffer.
Sometimes grace is shown to them.
But if we change our vision of seeing them then we will know that these people can inspire us to lead our lives.
You can inspire to do something.
If we face a small crisis then we cry.
Then you can see that the crisis on me is very small.
How will it lead our lives
How do they work
And that is why all these are inspiring for us.
Their determination, their way of living and their capability to reverse the crisis is also very powerful.
Today, I would like to mention this thing that it is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, Jawad Ahmad was shot dead by terrorists in Kashmir.
A legacy of stomach and intestine was also lost.
Manakya was also seriously injured.
He always lost his power to stand on his feet, but Jawad Ahmad did not give up.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped persons
How can we develop facilities for persons with disabilities in public places and government offices
They are working on these things.
Is not the life of Javed enough to be inspiring in every corner of the country
On 3rd December, I remember the life of Shri Javed Ahmad, his penance and dedication.
Though I mention only Javad because the time is short, I am reminded of such inspiration in every corner of the country.
They are showing new ways and new ways of life.
Be it middle class, junior middle class, poor, dalit, distressed, exploited and deprived sections of the society, there is a constant bond between the government and the government system.
It is also true, but millions of people of this government do such good work with dedication and dedication that we never have a vision.
Last year, we had jointly awarded Padma Vibhushan to both Bill Gates and Milinda Gates.
They do a lot of social work in India.
Whatever he has done in his post-retirement time and throughout his life, he is spending time working for the poor.
When he comes to India, he appreciates those hopeful workers who have got the opportunity to work with him. He says how dedicated and distressed these ASHA workers are.
He tells us how much enthusiasm he has to learn innovation.
A few days ago, the Odisha government had specially honoured an ASHA activist on Independence Day.
And an ASHA worker from this village, Jamuna Manisingh, decided that I will not let anyone in Tedagaon die due to malaria.
Go to every household and get to know about some fever.
There will be many more such "Jamuna Mani".
There will be millions and millions of people around us.
We have received them with a little respect.
Such people become the strength of our country.
How do we become a big partner in the happiness and misery of the society
I salute all such ASHA activists through Jamuna Mani.
My dear young friends, I am particularly active on internet and social media for the younger generation.
Not only this, it can also show to others, it can happen that we can connect something with it.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
I invite you to join this nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is worried about climate change.
Climate change and global temperature rise are also being discussed and care is also being taken. And before every work is done, it has been approved as a standard.
The temperature of the earth should not rise further.
It is the responsibility of everyone and it is the responsibility of everyone.
And the first way of saving energy is to avoid temperature rise.
14th December is National Energy Savings Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
Once I had said that on the night of full moon, one should remain in the moonlight for hours by closing the lamps on the streets.
We should experience the light of that moon.
On seeing a woman named Noorjahan in Kanpur on TV it seemed that she did not get the opportunity to study much .
But she is doing such a thing that perhaps no one has thought about it.
It is illuminating the lives of the poor by using solar energy.
She is fighting with darkness and igniting her forehead.
She has set up a committee of women and started a solar-powered factory, which leases 100 rupees per month.
What kind of assistance are being provided to entrepreneurs like us
Industry, earnings, equity.
However, the speed at which I have to go is still going to accelerate.
But the beginning has been good.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am glad that out of 66 lakh women, there are 24 lakh women and the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes who are trying to live up to their feet with dignity.
The conscience itself has spoken of our enthusiasm.
There are several news reports to me too.
Someone has just told me that someone in Mumbai is Shailesh Bhosale.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new entrepreneurs and that Shailesh Bhosale has done it.
And I have been told that in such a short span of time they have returned two lakh rupees to the bank.
It is working to make potatoes.
All our banks should be more sensitive and they should help the poor as much as possible.
Indeed, these are the people who run the economy of the country.
People who are small and medium enterprises are the economic power of the country's economy.
We want to give it more strength.
But we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had discussed Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
These are the things that should lead to consistent awareness in social life.
Efficiency is the prize for freedom under the National Jagriam Vyam.
What should be the plan for the programme
I had told you about sending such information.
I was told that a lot of information was received.
But I need more information.
I expect a very special scheme.
There can be many such things.
I believe that your information will definitely be useful.
But I would like to urge you to exercise.
In order to keep the body healthy certainly use some time of this good season for exercise -LRB- yoga -RRB- .
If there is a dense weather then we should also make a habit of dense shade.
Once again my best wishes to my countrymen.
Once again I am meeting you with Mann Ki Baat.
The 5th one-day cricket match between India and South Africa is being played.
The Cricket Malike is called Gandhi-Mandela series.
Both sides have won each other two faces, and hence the importance of the last fight has increased significantly.
My best wishes to all my sportspersons.
Today, I would like to convey my best wishes to the friends of Kannur All India Radio.
I would like to convey my best wishes to the people of Kerala that whenever I started Mann Ki Baat, many people visited that programme included Shraddha Thamban from Kerala.
Once again I would like to talk about Kerala.
Students from St. Mary Upper Primary School, Kochia Chittoor, Kerala have sent me a letter.
At the outset, I didn't know why these kids made me a map of India by thumbs.
When I read their letters, I realized that they had delivered such a massive symbolic message.
So that organ donation becomes a tendency and tendency.
Writing letters from those girls, I have written to them that they should challenge people about organ donation through their Mann Ki Baat programme.
The 80-year-old Vadodarao Sudke Guruji in Maharashtra has been continuously running a movement.
They say that organ donation should be a festival.
I also have a lot of messages from the telephone.
Debesh ji of Delhi has given me a message.
I believe that this is very important.
More than 1. 5 lakh people in our country need kidney, heart and liver every year.
But in our country with a population of 125 crore only five thousand transplants i . . organ transplants are operated .
Every year one lakh eyes are needed but only 25,000 people get eyes .
When there is a need of four eyes, we can only give one eye.
Efforts have been made to guide the states.
Some states have done a very good job in reducing the paperwork and intensifying the efforts of the organ donation.
Today I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the top of organ donation.
A lot of social institutions, a lot of NGOs have given a different direction by doing good work.
National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTO) has been set up to give importance to organ transplant.
The joy of abandoning Ten Taken Bhunjitha is the best.
Last month we had seen all of us on television.
Saved a life.
My dear countrymen, now we have celebrated Navratri and Vijaya Dashmi.
After a few days, we will celebrate Diwali.
Celebrated Eid and celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi.
But we will be proud to celebrate another festival amongst all of them that will make the country proud.
The India-Africa Forensic Summit will be held in New Delhi on October 26-29, 2019.
This will be the first such event in India.
54 African countries and UN Leaders have been invited.
The population of India is as much the population of Africans.
If both the populations come together then it will become one-third of the worlds population.
And it is said that millions of years ago the land of both the countries was united.
Later, the Indian Ocean split into two parts.
And it is our endeavour to see that people should also come together.
On this occasion, the Government of India has organized a massive HRD Ministry.
An essay competition was held among children in schools where CBSE has affiliated schools, poetry writing programmes and programmes were organized to enhance their participation.
Approximately 1600 schools participated.
It included schools from outside India and India and thousands of schoolchildren wrote about the desire to strengthen India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, Mahatma Gandhis birthplace, Porbandar to Memorial of Mahatma, which is a mobile exhibition, is travelling from Porbandar to Northern State and reaching Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of schoolchildren watched the exhibition and people from villages also witnessed the exhibition.
People knew and recognised how Mahatma Gandhi had played a great role in the relations between Africa and India, the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality on these two regions.
As such, Indo-Africa is a confluence, but I can see that this is the opportunity to connect people.
I congratulate the heat wave and the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and HRD ministry.
On 15th August, I had made a proposal in the context of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Last month, a workshop was organised in Bhopal where ideal villages are being constructed, the heads of the village, the collectors of that place, some of the parliamentarians of that place, the government of India, the state government and the state government together had deliberately discussed the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
What kind of new things have been noticed and some enthusiastic things have been noticed.
He has selected Parsi Gram Panchayats in Kunti district of Jharkhand for their ideal village.
In the Model Village, a successful effort was made to create awareness among the people about the infrastructure and system in this Parsi village of Jharkhand.
I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Kariya Mundanji.
And I got a news from Andhra.
The MP from Andhra Pradesh, Ashok Gajapati Rajuji, was very much involved in the Adarsh Gram Yojana and he chose Dwarpuri Gram Panchayat as an ideal village in Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
Nearly 550 adult illiterates were educated and literate.
See, there is no budget in the society, no circular, no special system, but what kind of changes are being brought about due to the will power of the country due to Gram Panchayat.
Our Honourable Member of Parliament, Shri C.
L. Ruwala, Member of Parliament of Mizoram.
He has chosen the village of Khwale disabled as an ideal village. He did a special job.
This village is very famous for the production of sugarcane and jaggery .
How can we make the village an economic centre, how can we market the village products
Ruvalaji, who tried to build a self-reliant village along with the ideal village, deserves to be praised.
My dear brothers and sisters, is Mann Ki Baat and will it ever happen that there is no talk of cleanliness
My dear countrymen, last year after Diwali, Midia had launched a special drive, all the things that had happened after Diwali had been shown on the channel to the common man.
Worrying that you don't get an accident before the festival, you should do it after the festival.
And for this, I would like to specially congratulate the Middle East of India.
On 2nd October, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I got the opportunity to participate in the Swachhta Sammelan through the India Today Group to mark one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
He was looking at the memories given by Clean India Awards. Some kind of efforts are being made by him.
How people are working for this thing like One Life, One Mission.
What kind of places are there in our country that have been kept clean.
Since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan has started, I have seen that the e-Nadu of Andhra Telangana and especially Mr. Ramuji Rao are very old but their enthusiasm is not less than the youth.
He has added about 51 lakh children in 55-56 schools to Andhra and Telangana.
In some places, public places, stations, religious places, parks and in many places, a massive campaign related to cleanliness has been started.
Now this news shows the power to realize this dream of a Swachh Bharat.
ABP News started this programme called Bharat Desh Hai Mera and people got cleanliness awareness and guided them to educate the countrymen.
NDTV drives Banega Swachh Bharat
In Meghalaya, where our Governor Shriman Shanmukh Nathan had written a letter to me and mentioned the village of Mavalaynong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the past few years, this village has taken up the issue of cleanliness.
Almost every generation is dedicated to this cleanliness, it is said that a few years ago, he had received the Client Village Award in Asia.
This is important that we want to believe in everyone that our country will be clean and it will be done by the efforts of the people of the country. If we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019 then we can proudly say that 100 crore Indians will be free from filth.
My dear countrymen, I had said this thing from the Red Fort on 15th August, there are some things that have been brought about by corruption and have done the house.
And that is why I felt the need for an interview for small jobs.
I have never heard such a thing. Is there a psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychologically that someone can fully recognize in a few minutes
And I had announced this thing that we will stop the tradition of kidnapkin for these jobs.
My dear young friends, today I would like to say with pride that the government has completed all these procedures and the posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government will no longer be invited on the occasion of Bharati.
The Rules will come into force from 1st January, 2016 and wherever the recruitment process is underway, we will not be able to avail the benefits but will be implemented from 1st January, 2016.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
I had announced an important scheme in the last budget.
In our country, gold has become an important part of social life.
Gold can become a power, gold can become an economic power.
And every Indian must contribute to it.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the bank and the bank will give you interest on it just as you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier they used to keep gold in the locker and also to pay the locker's rent.
Now keep it in the Gold Bank and the bank will give you interest.
Now the countrymen, can't gold become a snake charmer
The second thing is that in the Sovereign Gold Band, this bond is a paper, but the value of that paper is gold.
The day you return this paper, on the day of return you will get the amount of money that you will get back.
I am happy to say that we are bringing gold quin.
The gold quinine that brought the Ashok Chakra was about 70 years after independence, but till now we have been using the Foren Gold quin.
Gold Building Bonds are also used abroad.
We are also going to make it available to the common man in the coming weeks before Dhanteras, we are launching a golden coin of 5 grams and 10 grams of Ashok Chakra.
It will also be available for 20 grams of gold coins.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about a new transformation in the direction of economic development.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, Iron Man Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary is being celebrated.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel recalled that the map of India is emerging.
This great man has contributed immensely to the unity of India.
India is full of diversity.
India is full of many sects, sects, dialects, castes, numerous surroundings and diversity and this diversity is our splendour and beauty.
If there was no diversity then we could not take pride and pride in the beauty of this beauty.
Therefore, there is a mantra of unity in diversity.
Peace, goodwill and unity are the real burden of development.
Over the last few years, on 31st October, RAN-For-Unity programmes are being organized in every corner of the country.
The march of unity is also a journey of development in the true sense.
Pay tributes to Sardar Saheb.
Let us take forward the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, Now you must have been preparing for Diwali and cleanliness will be there in your house.
You are buying new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different forms in our country.
I convey my best wishes to you all on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
Bursting occurs due to bursting . Children suffer a lot from bursting .
I would like to tell every mother and father that if you loot the joy of Diwali then do not let the accident happen, the child of our family will not be harmed.
My dear countrymen, I will be visiting the United Kingdom on the second day of Diwali.
The government of India and the state government provide scholarships to those dalits, tribals and backward classes of the society who go abroad for study.
I believe that when our children will be taught in Britain, then Babasaheb's place will become an inspiration. He gave this message to Babasaheb for the country.
Now you can imagine the joy and joy of the people like me by connecting this building with the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar that will become the property of 1. 25 billion Indians.
I will get another opportunity in London and I would like to unveil the statue of Lord Vishweshwar Ji.
Several years ago, the work that Lord Visvesvara had done for democracy, for the Employment of Women, needs to be studied by the world.
The dedication of the Statue of Lord Visvesvara on the land of London is a good example of how the great men of India think and think in a vision several years ago.
My dear countrymen, you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat.
He was interacting with the government officials.
Some people try to solve the problems by writing their problems.
We should learn many languages in a country like India.
I got the opportunity to learn some languages but how can I learn so many languages
But I am grateful to All India Radio that this Mann Ki Baat will be broadcast in their regional language at 8 pm in every state.
Once again my best wishes to my beloved countrymen.
Jai Hind.
On 3rd October last year, for the first time I got the privilege of conveying my heart.
Democracy is of immense importance.
There is a fundamental idea in my life and therefore I have full faith in the peoples power.
But from what I learnt from Mann Ki Baat, from what I understood, I can say that the peoples power is more than what we want.
Our ancestors used to say that Jan Janadan is a part of God.
I can say from the experience of Mann Ki Baat that there is a great power in the thoughts of our ancestors because I have experienced this thing.
I have asked the people to invite them for Mann Ki Baat and I will see only two or four suggestions.
But lakhs of people actively sent information.
This is a big strength.
When people were watching this, they also felt that the feelings of depression and dilemma would have to be changed.
This was a silent revolution.
Keeping in view the tourism in India, I told the citizens, Incredible India, Incredible India, You will send a picture of your handicrafts to me on the path of tourism.
Millions of photographs were sent by people from every part of India.
Neither the tourism departments of the Government of India nor the State Government will ever think that we have such a rich legacy.
Everything came to a forum and the government did not spend one rupee in it.
People did all these things.
Today, I can say with great satisfaction that the sale of Khadi has doubled in the last one year.
When I used to say this thing through Mann Ki Baat, I used to say that the poor households are littered, the children are crying, their poor mothers are painted.
Why don't they get gas cylinders
If the government works in the hands of this society then the government can work as a catalyst for social transformation.
Every small thing was considered a small issue and tried to connect itself for the welfare of the country.
What can be more enjoyable than this
I have decided to do a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I urged the citizens of the country to reach out to me through telephone your question, your suggestions and suggestions.
I will pay attention to it in Mann Ki Baat.
I am glad that more than 5,500 telephone calls have been received from all over the country be it Sikin, Kutch, Kamrup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There is not a single region in India from where citizens have not telephoned.
It is a pleasant experience.
The people of all age groups asked him to say something.
I heard some of them myself. I thought I was working on the proposals on the other issues.
You might have taken a couple of minutes to telephone this telephone but the delivery, ideas and issues that I have received from it are important for me.
The entire government will certainly work on it.
I am aware of the importance of radio for such blind people.
I see from a new perspective and he said that many good things, good issues are enough to sensitize the government.
I would like to invite the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to urge the people of India to make maximum use of soil fertilizers in Diwali.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the Army.
The Naval Force and Air Force, which protects water, land and sky.
The 1965 war with Pakistan ended 50 years.
We just heard about the glory, pride and pride of the war, the courage and sacrifice of our soldiers. At that time photographing and cinema were not available at all, however, the moments and moments of those exhibitions can be realized through this exhibition.
Whether it is Hajifir or Northern or Chamid, the sight of the victory achieved near Hajipir Pass is thrilling on the organ and the pride of the Indian Army is engulfed.
If you want to make history then you will have to understand the smaller issues.
History has endured our bonds with our children.
Breaking the breasts of history gives a complete break to the possibility of history.
A little boy has given an order to the Prime Minister, but he forgot to mention the name of himself.
And I can tell you that for the first time since independence, there is a lot of discussion in the Parliament on Swachhta.
Our government was also critical.
I used to hear a lot that Modiji was talking about cleanliness but what did he do
I don't feel sad to hear this, but it shows me a good thing that there is talk of cleanliness of India in the Parliament of the country.
And on the other hand, on the one hand, when this small son of the country speaks about cleanliness then there cannot be any such thing for the country to run away from it.
This movement is going on. There is awareness about cleanliness and hygiene.
This will also make the government functional, it will be inevitable to work and work.
When we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in India in 2019, we should work in that direction to realise the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
You know what Mahatma Gandhi is saying
At one place, he said that when the time for elections between freedom and cleanliness came, I would give priority to cleanliness. After independence, cleanliness was even more important than independence.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi visited Mygov.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men continue to inspire us.
It is not your job to evaluate what kind of thought this great man would have believed.
All those who live for the country and those who die for the country will inspire us.
These days will provide an opportunity to remember all these great personalities.
On 25th September, Deendayal Upadhyay, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri on 2nd October, Jaiprakash Narayanji on 11th October and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
You can see any date, from the point of view of history, some great person will get the name associated with that date.
I would especially urge you once again for 2nd October.
On 2nd October is the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi.
The work that the government cannot do by giving a huge amount of money to the public, it is because of your misdeeds and help.
This is the strength of the people and I once again urge you to do this thing.
My dear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of one thing.
Chandra Bose had made all the arrangements with the statue of Subhash Babu.
Chanda Bose and his family took up this work and last week we received a strong message that 50 of Subhas Babu's family members will be coming to the Prime Minister's residence.
You can imagine how happy it will be for me.
They will often get the opportunity to visit the Prime Ministers residence, together with Sarai for the first time.
But I am delighted to know that this kind of hospitality that has never happened before in the Prime Minister's residence, I will be fortunate to do it in the month of October.
More than 50 grandchildren of Subhash Babu, family members of different countries, all the issues will be brought to the notice.
It would be a moment of joy for me.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to educate the younger generation about the registration of voters, which will increase the participation of the youth in the coming days and will help the younger generation in selecting and running the government in the future.
I hope that the youngsters who have not yet registered their names in the electoral rolls will definitely register and vote.
The seventh student of Kshitij Pandey, I met him at the Anaras Hindu University, at the Kendriya Vidyalaya in the seventh century.
Dandaga is confident with him.
At this young age, I would have read a lot about it in physics.
Sadwant Patel's daughter, who lives in Sundarpur in Varanasi.
Her husband said that if she takes up a book of mathematics, she opens all the lips and history in the evening, then she recites the essence.
We all are surprised to know that I was very impressed.
Sometimes these kids get reputed but I don't know about Sonam.
I believe that Devan has given me a power.
I got the opportunity to meet two children during my visit to Kashi.
Likewise, my visit to these two children will be remembered.
Through Mann Ki Baat, many people are ensuring my work.
Look at this thing, what does Sandeep of Haryana say Sir Mann Ki Baat once in a month, please do it every week because you get a lot of inspiration by listening to your speeches.
Sandeep ji, what can you do with me
Once a month, I have to do a lot of hard work, I have to plan time.
It is a matter of pride once a month.
Mann Ki Baat in a way completed one year.
Do you know how to use Subhash Babu radio
From Germany, he started his radio centre and he wanted to inform the citizens of India about the freedom movement from this radio centre.
He started the Azad Hind Radio with a weekly newspaper.
He used to broadcast this radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi and Parsi Urdu languages.
I too have been talking about All India Radio for a year.
Keep sending your information, ideas and proposals.
It also benefits the government.
Reforms begin.
Your contribution, your participation is precious and invaluable.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
The citizens of South India have painted on the occasion of Onam and yesterday they celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has started several new schemes for the common man keeping in mind the issue of social security.
I am glad that in a short span of time everyone has accepted this scheme.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, I had requested my sisters to visit these security schemes.
I have been told that 11 crore families have been linked to them since the launch of this scheme. And I have been told that the mothers and sisters have got the benefits of this scheme.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan.
Today, while talking to you people, it has been a year since the Jan Dhan Yojana was launched in a big way.
Banking sector is also an important part of the economy and this system has been strengthened so that it can reach the poorest of the poor.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Youngsters have also got employment.
You will be happy to know that in this year, 1 lakh 31 thousand Financial Literacy Camps have been organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
Only the accounts cannot be stopped.
Now thousands of citizens are eligible for overdraft facility under this Jan Dhan Yojana.
It is a belief that the poor can get money from the bank.
Once again I congratulate all of you and urge all those who have opened the bank accounts to the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters to keep their bank accounts intact.
This bank is yours, don't leave it.
I have brought the bank to you and now it is your job to keep it in mind.
Due to the recent developments in Gujarat, the entire country was restless due to the violence and it is natural that if something happens in the land of Gandhiji and Sardar then the entire country gets its shock first.
But in a very short span of time all my swollen brothers and sisters of Gujarat have brought the situation under control.
And once again Gujarat started walking on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and fraternity are the right path and the path of development and shoulder to shoulder.
Development is the answer to our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet scholars from the Sufi community.
I got the opportunity to hear their thoughts and tell you the truth, as if I should listen to some music.
I came here to talk to these scholars about their selective words, their way of speaking, their generosity in the Sufi tradition, the rhythm of music in which there is a rhythm of music.
I was very touched.
Often, there is a need to reach the true world of Islam.
The Sufi sect, which is linked to love and beauty, will spread this message far and wide, which will be good for humanity, it will be good for Islam as well. And I also tell others that we should understand the Sufi sect, the Sufi sect and the Sufi tradition.
I am fortunate that I will get another opportunity in the coming days and I will get this invitation.
Scholars from Buddhist traditions from across the globe are coming to Bodh Gaya in India to discuss the best interests of humanity, welfare and global issues.
I am glad that Bodh Gaya has been invited for this thing.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, had visited Bodh Gaya.
It is a moment of great pleasure for me that I will have the opportunity to visit Bodh Gaya along with such scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Once again I would like to give you an answer in my mind.
I had mentioned this topic in Mann Ki Baat earlier too.
You must have heard me from my speech in Parliament, from public meetings, from Mann Ki Baat.
Every time I have been telling you that the Government of India is open to those land acquisition laws.
This means that the situation before the formation of my government has been re-established.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to assure you that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just a declaration for us.
This mantra is the welfare of the villages, the poor and the farmers.
Therefore, on 15th August we had said that not only the agriculture department but also the agriculture and farmers welfare department will be set up.
We are implementing this decision promptly.
Twenty years ago, the 1965 war was over and when the 1965 war was over, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji remembered it.
I salute and bow down to all those who have won India in the war of 65 years.
Such events in history will always inspire us.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi sect last week, I had a pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to meet renowned scientists from all over the country and interact with them for hours.
I am glad to know that India has been doing excellent work in the field of science.
Our scientists are performing well.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that it was not only an inspiration for me but also a reflection of learning new things.
And I saw how many young scientists were enthusiastic about their dreams.
In Mann Ki Baat, I had said that students should turn to the field of science.
After this meeting I feel that there are immense possibilities.
I would like to reiterate that my young friends should look at science and our educational institutions should inspire students for it.
He has written about skill development.
Shri Prakash, Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, has stressed on the need for good teachers for primary education.
Emphasis has been laid on reforms in education sector.
I would especially like to tell my young friends one thing.
In a speech from the Red Fort on 15th August, I had said that this childhood for low-level jobs, what is this interview for
And when letters come for the childhood then every poor family, every widowed mother will be worried about who will get the recommendation and who will get this job with the help of someone
I don't know what words are used
There was a race for everyone and perhaps the reason for corruption at the grassroots level.
I had said in my speech on 15th August that the government has taken rapid steps in this direction that it has been 15 days in such a short span of time.
Notices are being sent and the decision not to put an end to childhood for smaller posts will now be implemented.
It is unfortunate that nearly 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children die every year after delivery and delivery.
It is worrisome and horrible .
Similarly, there has been a lot of improvement in this regard.
But now we have to save our mothers and newborn devotees.
We are watching and not paying attention to television but we are not watching it.
Along with pure water, it is important to keep small things clean at home.
Life is extremely valued.
It is not right to neglect unstoppable water, depression about sanitation is the cause of death.
Dengue testing is done at approximately 514 centres across the country.
The period from Rakshabandhan to Diwali is the period of several festivals in our country.
May every festival be connected with cleanliness. See, the quality of cleanliness will automatically come in your nature.
I often say that we will not get the fate of dedicating our lives for the country but the fate of our lives for the country is certain.
Two young brothers and sisters of our country, Nashik of Maharashtra, Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
Everyone is making every effort to take the country forward. And this is the reason that everybody is filled with pride.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth due to lack of understanding.
But my experience in the youth is different.
Sometimes we get to know and learn new things by talking to them.
I have met several youngsters who have said that I have taken the message of Sand On Cycle.
It is the decision of a few days a week to cycle day.
He added that happiness is being enjoyed to be the best for health and environment.
In our country, the number of cycles used in many households will increase and many people will be encouraged.
I am glad to mention that these efforts are good for saving the environment and health. And today, two youngsters of my country have flagged off Indias flag in the USA.
Today, I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra.
The monument will inspire us to work with the dalits, the oppressed, the oppressed and the deprived.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for these two initiatives that honour Dr. Ambedkar.
The country can be moved forward by putting a shoulder to shoulder.
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
It will definitely help our farmer brothers and sisters in the field of Kharif.
One more thing I remembered was to enjoy my heart.
Our country has always been devastated by cereals and oilseeds.
Poor people need bitter cereals, some oil is required for food and vegetables.
I am glad that the cereals that have been produced this year have increased by 50 and oilseeds production by nearly 33.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this thing.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of July is recorded in the history of our country as Vijay Diwas.
The country's land belongs to the farmers and also to the soldiers.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers fell on hundreds of enemies.
The war in Kargil was not just a war that was fought across the border but it was a part of every city and every village in India.
It was fought for those mothers and sisters whose young sons, brothers and sisters were fighting against the enemy in Kargil.
The youngsters who had not even touched their hands for the wedding, they fought this war, they fought against the brave young boys who had once again become young and had never learnt to walk with their fathers fingers.
It is because of the sacrifices made by them that today India can speak in front of the world with a strong sense.
In a few months after our government came to power in 2014, we launched the MyGov campaign on 26th July.
We have launched this website to enhance their participation in democracy to connect every citizen with development work.
And today, a year later, I am glad to say that nearly two crore citizens have visited the MyGov website.
Nearly 5. 5 lakh citizens have registered their responses, and more than 50,000 citizens have taken time to register their information on PMO APPLICATIONS.
Is it right that such people have difficulty in getting tickets for railways
Though this thing looks small on top of it, nobody thought that the government was not aware of it.
However, the government seriously considered the issue of Akhilesh ji and today a separate system for our disabled brothers and sisters has been implemented for reservation of tickets.
New logos are created, two lines are formed, programmes are formulated, MyGov has a lot of positive information.
There is a feeling of new heights in the system of governance.
A new consciousness is being realized.
MyGov suggestions have been initiated in my address on 15th August.
From Chennai, Smt. Raghavchary has given a lot of suggestions.
I believe that this is a good idea for the citizens of the country to come up with issues for what should be there in my speech on 15th August.
I am sure you will give good information.
I want to take care of one thing and I want to send it to you.
I don't want to preach to anyone. I don't intend to refrain from the responsibility of the central government, the state government or the local autonomous bodies.
Just two days ago, I saw a scene of an accident in Delhi and after the accident, that scooter driver was getting injured for about ten minutes.
Hoshakote Akshay from Bengaluru, Amay Joshi from Pune and Ananda Kakunje from Murubidri in Karnataka have expressed concern over this issue.
Every four minutes a person dies in a road accident.
But I appeal to the parents that be it the kids who run a two-wheeler, they will get the teachings of all the four wheelers and security guards from their homes and the parents should pay attention to it.
In this regard, the government has formulated a number of new policies and initiatives to train citizens for road safety, be it road safety or be it speedy relief to the accident victims.
We will introduce the Transport and Safety Bill keeping all these things in mind.
Our idea is to take several important steps in the coming days to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
The scheme is Cashless Treatment (Cashless Treatment) from Gurgaon, Jaipur, Baroda, Yeth to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondia.
This means that we will give priority to the immediate medical assistance of those injured in the accident in 50 hours after the accident. Whether it is nearly funded to take immediate care of the accident or not.
Toll-free telephone number 1033 will be available across the country for providing information about accidents.
There is a need to pay more attention to the fact that there will be no accident at the root, because the life of one or the other is even more important.
Sometimes I say that the workers should become Karmayogis.
During the last few days, I realized that I had to talk to you about it.
But how to bring about consciousness in the work done
Vijay Biswal has demonstrated how his favourite and artistic capabilities are in harmony with his work.
There is a possibility that he will be talking about his picture and I got another information.
In Madhya Pradesh, the entire team of government officials from Harda district, a different work started by the Sangh has touched my heart.
I liked their work and when these officers started listening to Operation Malayudha, you would feel that there is something different.
But it is important that he has given a new turn to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
There is a village named Kasherla near Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh .
The people of this village have constructed toilets by performing their missions.
Now no person in this village goes to the open for toilets and when the construction of toilets is completed then the village of Kasherla has celebrated the festival of happiness.
This is an excellent example of how the values of social life change, how the mindset of the people changes and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
From Guwahati, Bhavesh Deka has written about questions related to the North-Eastern region.
However, the people of North-Eastern Province are active.
He will visit the village and interact with the officials of the administration there, people will interact with the representatives and the citizens.
They will understand their difficulties and they will do whatever is possible with the central government to solve these problems.
A good effort, an effort to go a long way from Delhi to the east is the East Policy.
My dear countrymen, the success of the Mangal Mission is a matter of pride and happiness for all of us.
We know this news but we don't care about it.
I would like to urge the IAS officers of the government to go to a school, college, two or four hours a week and interact with the students there.
This work is difficult but it has to be done.
Do not fall into the study of children as there is no electricity during the examination period.
If we want to start a small business in the village, if we want to set up an industry then there will be electricity.
At some places, we have to move to other villages to charge mobile phones.
We will certainly do this, we have started it.
Today, I felt like talking to you about different topics from Mann Ki Baat.
My best wishes to all of you.
You must send your suggestions and new ideas for the 15th of August that will certainly be useful for me.
Mann Ki Baat on June 2019
I felt that there was nothing less.
We used to hear a lot of things in the form of a self-dependence among the families of 130 crore Indians, in a very small atmosphere.
Sometimes these things were inspiring for our people.
You can imagine how this mid-day holiday period would have been.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month - at 11 a.m.
Every moment I felt that I used to do 'Miss'.
And whenever I speak Mann Ki Baat, I speak alone, and perhaps that word is mine, the voice is mine, but that story is yours, it is yours, it is yours, it is yours, it is your valour.
I was using only my words and my speeches.
There was a sense of absolute vacancy in the mind.
Once the elections are over, let us talk about four things in our minds.
But later I thought it was not
It is our Sunday programme and it should continue.
But these reports brought us a lot of waiting.
Small, simple, simple and inexpensive things are also causing change in the lives of the society.
In a way, this sequence gives birth to a new energy, a pure consciousness and in a sense, we have to move forward by continuing this sequence by giving strength to the spirit of New India and energy.
In the last few months, many messages have been delivered and innumerable people have said that Mann Ki Baat is being missed.
Whenever I read this message, I feel sorry.
This is my journey from 'Aham' to 'Vayam'.
This silent dialogue with you for me was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked a lot about why I went to Kedarnath during the Dhammadhumi elections.
You have the right to ask such questions.
And I can understand that you will also be curious to know the answers to these questions.
The only thing I can say is that the compulsions given to Mann Ki Baat had created a feeling of slight vacancy in my mind, perhaps I would have got the opportunity to fill this pocket in the valleys of Kedar and in that single cave.
Just as many people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar's visit, I feel continually with your efforts to emphasize a positive thing.
The letters that come in for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are routine are different from that of the daily government.
Sometimes the letters you have sent are also inspiring for me.
Sometimes, some words tell you about my thought process.
The challenges faced by the country and the society make me understand from the people.
At the same time, people are saying that what is the answer to these problems.
I have seen that people ask for their problems in the papers and also what is the answer to them.
Answers to the synergy of questions, some or the other innovative ideas, directly or indirectly.
Mann Ki Baat is like an architect for the country and society.
Today, my heart is filled with joy.
Last time I had said this thing in the end that when we met in three-four months, some people had made a political meaning, they had said, Oh, Modi ji has so much confidence and he has so much confidence.
This self-confidence was not of Modi.
So this belief was the foundation of your belief.
It was you who took the form of trust.
And that is why in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said that I will come to talk to you after a few months.
You have left me here and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
If we move ahead with this feeling then we will start the sequence of Mann Ki Baat as before.
The movement was not restricted to the prison.
There was a heart attack in the minds of people.
Democracy seemed a kind of stir in the minds of the poor.
When we get food from time to time, we don't know what hunger is.
In the same way, they understand the importance of democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country used to feel that during the Emergency, he had taken away something.
Even if someone snatched away from the fact that we have never used it, it hurts them.
Some arrangements have been made in the event of India and democracy has come to an end.
There is also a need to drive the society.
Laws and regulations are also required, rights and duties are also discussed.
But the pride of India can say that for us there is a value of democracy that has been greater than the laws and regulations.
Democracy is our culture.
Democracy is our legacy and tradition.
And with this legacy, we have become a child.
Therefore, the country had sacrificed a complete election for the protection of democracy, not for our own good.
We have easily adopted the precious democracy that we have achieved.
More than 61 crore people cast their vote in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
But if the world's favorites are made, then I say that if one leaves China then more people than the population of any other country have the right to vote in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States, almost double.
There are more voters in India than the entire European population.
You can imagine how much resources and human resource would be required to complete this election.
Millions of teachers, officers and staff worked day and night to cross the polls.
Nearly three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces have fulfilled their responsibilities to make this great success of democracy.
At the same time, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also laboured.
You can imagine the vast scope of the total election.
He had done all this torture to ensure that no single voter remains deprived of his voting rights and the right to vote for all eligible voters.
In remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, we were setting up a polling station for a woman voter.
You will be surprised to know that the Election Commission officials had to travel for two days to reach the remotest places.
Besides, there was one thing that showed pride in this election.
I convey my best wishes to the Election Commission and everyone involved in this election process and bow down to the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, all of you must have listened to me several times, I urge you not to book but book.
We can welcome and replace flowers with books.
On hearing this, people have started welcoming books at many places.
Someone recently gifted me a book titled 'Premchand Ki Popular Kahaniyan'.
I liked this visit.
However, I could not get a lot of time but during the journey I got the opportunity to save some of his stories once again.
Premchand has made a real picture of the society in his stories and when he was reading it, the picture of that period was to be produced before us.
Every detail he wrote, every thing becomes alive.
Their stories reflect the emotions of the entire India.
He wrote that while reading the story of 'Nasha', my mind automatically ran the question of economic imbalance in the society.
I remembered my youth.
We used to debate over the economic flaws of the society overnight.
In this story, the sensitivity of a child, the immense sensitivity of his life, the maturity of his thoughts at such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes to our destination with a stick from the fair, the human sensitivity reaches the highest peak in the true sense, in this story, he will finally make the reader very emotional.
In this story, a lively picture of the life of a poor farmer can be read.
You will be surprised to know that this library is located in a village situated in the dense forest of Idukki.
Primary teacher P.
Murlidharan and P.
V.
Chinnathampi or both of them started the library with untiring hard work.
There was a time when these two books used to be made of books and they used to take books from their backs in our villages in the jungle.
Today, this library, along with the tribal children here, is working to give a new direction to everyone.
The mission of 'Vancha Gujarat' in Gujarat was a great success.
Millions of people from all age groups participated in the campaign and read books.
In today's digital era, during the time of Google Guru, I urge you to keep a few moments to save books in your daily routine.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of great pleasure for me that not only do the people of our country think of the present times but also think about the challenges of the future.
When I was reading your response to Narendra Modi App and MyGov, I remember that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belgaum, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Vijay Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related challenges.
He said that water is like a mother, and the blessings of the mother should be blessed and the grace of the mother should be upheld on us.
Due to the deficiency of water, every year there is drought in many parts of the country.
We save only eight per cent of the water and therefore now we need to solve this problem.
Just as you have solved many other problems with public participation, with the help of Jan Shakti, similarly one hundred and thirty crore countrymen will find solutions to the problem of water with all their capabilities, with all their co-operation and determination.
Keeping this in mind the importance of water is the highest, now the new Jal Shakti Ministry is setting up in the country.
This will enable faster decision making on all water related issues.
A few days ago, I tried to do something smoothly.
I have written letters to Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans across the country.
In order to save water, to store water, the drops of rain should not be wasted, the heads of the village should hold a meeting to save the rain water.
It has been resolved to save every drop of water in villages and villages and save rain water.
I would like to tell you about a Sarpanch in todays Mann Ki Baat programme.
The people of this place have once again proved to play an active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the Gram Pradhans and Sarpanches for their active participation in saving water.
Several institutions across the country have made such a solemn pledge for water conservation.
In a way, the entire village has got the opportunity to work.
The people of that village are now competing to build a Jal Mandir in their villages.
I have said beforehand that collective efforts will have very positive results.
There cannot be a single specific formula for water conservation across the country.
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this purpose.
But the goal is the same and it means water conservation.
Work is underway to improve the drainage lines in Punjab.
These works will solve the problem of water conservation.
The lives of the people of the village are changing as water ponds are being constructed at Thimpalli in Telangana.
Small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan have brought about a big change.
I had read about the collective efforts made in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women came together to revive the river Nag.
I also read that the women in Garhwal are working together in a very good manner in the field of rainwater harvesting.
I believe that it is impossible for all of us to work together and strengthen our efforts.
When everybody participates in the work of water conservation, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I have a request of three things to the countrymen.
My first appeal is that just as the people of the country took the shape of a movement for cleanliness, similarly, we should start a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us all resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that water is the prasad given by God.
Earlier they used to say that iron was made by the touches of Paris.
I say that water is a perennial, and the touch of water is creating a new life.
A awareness campaign should be started to save every drop of water.
We should make the society aware and connect the society.
I urge you all to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar on the birthplace of revered Bapu Ji then he would have seen this place and there is another house behind the house of revered Bapu.
That is why I always say that if someone goes to Kirti Mandir then he must see the storage of water.
Let us make a list of more and more methods related to water conservation and encourage people to take up water conservation.
You can share your information on JanshaktiForJalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude for one more thing.
The Presidents of many countries across the globe, the Prime Minister, the dignitaries and the common citizens, gave me information on how Yoga Day was celebrated in their own country.
On that day, the whole world looked like a happy family.
Therefore, the propagation of Yoga is a great work of social service.
Whether those who served such services should not be recognized and respected
The Prime Ministers Award for outstanding contribution in the promotion and development of Yoga was announced in 2019.
This thing is inspiring.
Now the subject of Yoga is going on, Indians are not lagging behind in this field.
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya and Munger were also honoured and dedicated to the cause of Yoga for the past few decades.
My dear countrymen, this journey of yours is taking place today, new feelings, new feelings, new resolutions, new energy, but I will keep waiting for your advice.
If you come, you will continue to meet you.
I listen to your feelings and keep in mind.
Sometimes I try to live that feeling.
Your blessings remain intact.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Once again I will meet at Mann Ki Baat next month.
Thank you very much to all of you
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in the terror attack in Pulwama, there has been an intense feeling of sadness in the hearts of the people of the country.
My thoughts are with the brave soldiers and their families who are martyred.
The feelings of intense anguish against such violent violence are in our hearts and minds. The same feelings are in the minds of every countrymen and of the humanity of the entire world.
I salute all the brave sons of our country who sacrificed their lives for the protection of Mother India.
Our Armed Forces have always displayed unique courage and valour.
He has demonstrated unprecedented capabilities for peace.
He had done a very good job to give a befitting reply to the attackers in their own language.
You must have seen how action was taken within a hundred hours.
The courage shown by Ram Niranjan ji, the father of Bhagalpur martyr Ratan Thakur in Bihar, is inspiring for all of us.
We will send our second son to fight against the enemy and if necessary we will fight ourselves, he added.
The entire nation salutes the indomitable courage of Meenaji, wife of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha's martyr Ananda Sahu.
He has also decided to recruit one of his integral children in the CRPF.
When Gumla village in Jharkhand, the martyr Vijay Shoren, who was wrapped in a tricolor, was killed by his innocent son, he said that he too would be recruited in the army.
The courage shown by these illegitimate boys is the feeling of every young child in India.
Such a feeling is seen in the houses of our heroes and brave martyrs.
There is no exception to any of our brave martyrs that their family is not an exception.
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya or the father of Kangra's martyr Tilakraj or the six year old son of a million martyr Hemraj, the story of every family of the martyred soldiers is inspiring.
We will not need to look at the ancient events of history to know what is sacrifice and penance.
These are the examples of the movement in front of our eyes.
These examples are a source of inspiration for Indias bright future.
My dear countrymen, we have been waiting for the National Military Memorial for several years.
Therefore, it is natural for the countrymen to have curiosity and curiosity about it.
Shri Onkar Shetty, a resident of Udupi, Karnataka on the Narendra Modi App, expressed happiness that the National War Memorial has been completed and completed.
It is a memorial that will preserve the saga of the great valour of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to build such an inspirational monument in the country.
We decided to set up a National Soldiers Memorial and started direct work.
Tomorrow, on 25 February, this National Soldier Memorial will be handed over to millions and millions of people of our country.
The country will do this simple job of repaying its debts.
This new memorial has been built near the India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyot Part where the heart of Delhi is called.
I am confident that the vision of the people of the country will be such a sacred task to visit this National Soldier Memorial.
The National Soldiers Memorial is a symbol of gratitude for the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice after Independence.
The construction of this memorial will showcase the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The concept of the National Soldiers Memorial is based on four central chakras, from the birth of a soldier to the martyrdom.
The glow of Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the martyrs.
The defence cycle that follows is reflecting security.
There are queues of dense trees in this cycle.
These trees are a symbol of the soldiers and they are giving a message of trust to the citizens of the country that every incident is on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Someone will come here to know the valour of these brave soldiers and they will be able to know about the sacrifices of the soldiers who laid down their lives for the country so that they can keep the country safe, keep alive and develop the country.
The great and invaluable contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country is not really possible.
I am very grateful to all the men and women police personnel who have been working continuously for our security.
I hope that all of you will visit the National Soldiers Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
This will inspire others to visit this holy place and they will also be eager to visit this holy place.
When I was reading the response from you people, I would like to convey my heartfelt condolences to the passionate response of Shri Ashish Mukhopadhyay Ji.
He writes that on 3rd March, 1900, the British had attacked Birsa Munda.
And it is a matter of Yoga that on 3rd March it is also the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata.
Both have come from different backgrounds but both of them have enriched the tradition, heritage and history of Jharkhand.
Tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat, in a way, to the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have brightened not only Jharkhand but the entire country.
The entire nation is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youngsters get the name of someone who is inspiring as a guide then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
When Birsa Munda lay asleep, the British hid and hid, showed him a very vision and caught him.
Do you know why the British had to accept the path of insurgency to catch Munda
Because the British who built such a huge empire were scared of Munda.
Lord Birsa Munda, with the help of his traditional blessings, had completely destroyed the British government, which was equipped with guns and guns.
In fact, if people get such an inspirational leadership, then collective will power becomes stronger than the armed forces of the opponents.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
He did everything in his life.
The dark life of the deprived and the exploited brought light like the sun rays .
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his 25th year of age.
Like Birsa Munda, the sons of Mother India have taken place in every part of the country.
But unfortunately, the stories of sacrifices, valour and sacrifices of these great people have not reached the new generation.
If a personality like Lord Birsa Munda has made us aware, then a person like Jamshedji Tata has created big institutions in the country.
Jamshedji Tata knew that India must become a hub of science, technology and industry for a bright future.
Moreover, he established several world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Once Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekanand Ji had met in the ship during their visit to America, there were discussions on various topics between them.
The foundation stone of the Indian Institute of Science was laid by these discussions.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarjibhai Desai was born on 29 February.
You all are well aware that this date comes once in four years.
Simple, peaceful personality Morarji Bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai is also the record of presenting the budget most often in the Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai led India during the difficult times when the country was in a crisis of democracy.
Morarjibhai Desai humbled himself in the movement against the imposition of democracy.
He had to measure a huge price in his old age.
At that time the government had put them in a hurry.
He became the Prime Minister of India in 1977, when the Janta Party won the elections.
Accordingly, the fundamental rights enjoyed under articles 20 and 21 of the Census shall not be abrogated either during the period of enforcement.
Morarji Bhai had amended the Emergency Lawns, 1975, to ensure that the revival of democracy does not happen again in the future.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, people were very excited about the Padma Awards.
We feel that the people who work at the grassroots with selflessness should be respected and respected for their work.
Many people have been making positive changes in the lives of people in different ways by working very hard.
The people who are working selflessly in public service, social service and in the service of the nation, above all, are Karmayogis.
He is a true activist and is far from the world of fame, and he does not have the privilege of getting his name or not.
He believes in work: Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam The message of Gita is in a way a direct world.
Today, I would like to talk to you about such people.
Friends, these rare painters are working to reach out to the new generation.
Abdul Ghafoor's "Tree of Life" artwork was gifted to former US President Barack Obama.
Among the standards of the Padma Awards, Shabbir Sayeed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gomati.
The way they have dedicated their lives to the service of the mother cow, their work is different from that.
Even at the age of 100, many people in the world are training Yoga.
Till now, he has made Yoga teachers for 1. 5,000 people and Jamuna Tundu, popularly known as Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, has done two dramatic tasks with the Timber Mafia and the Nuclears and saved 50 hectares of forests from devastation.
Due to the hard work of Jamuna Baiji, now the villagers in that area have planted 18 trees after the birth of every child in their homes.
They have worked towards women empowerment and how farming can be beneficial.
Kisan Chachain has inspired 300 women from our region to become self-sufficient by joining the Self Help Groups.
This change in the list of award winners is a new image of India that is transforming in a way.
My dear countrymen, I would like to tell you this thing that a heart-beat experience has come to me recently.
Today, wherever I go to the country, it is my endeavor that I get the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).
Brothers and sisters, Nearly 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme in the last five months.
I have noticed that this scheme is transforming the lives of the poor.
If a poor person cannot affordable medicines then you must inform him about this scheme.
This scheme is for such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the season of exams in schools will start now.
The 10th and 12th examinations of various Boards of Examinations across the country will start in the next few weeks.
My best wishes to the parents and teachers of all the students who have been examining.
A few days ago, a big programme called Pariksha Pe Charcha was organised in Delhi which was similar to the Town Hall programme.
The Pariksha Pe Charcha programme was a very interesting interaction on various topics related to exams.
This will definitely benefit the students.
All the students, their teachers, parents can see the full recording of this programme on YouTube and my best wishes to all the experimental warriors for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, there is talk of India and there is no talk of festivals or festivals.
This is because the thousands of years old culture and tradition that we have benefitted from it.
My dear countrymen, I had visited Kashi a few days ago and I had got the opportunity to spend some time with the Divyang brothers and sisters of Kashi.
And it was a pleasant surprise to hear a copy of what was new for me.
Youth with disabilities can imitate the way I speak in Mann Ki Baat.
It means that people just listen to Mann Ki Baat and leave it alone.
I was really impressed by the power of that young person with disabilities.
My dear countrymen, connecting with you all through Mann Ki Baat is a unique experience for me.
In a way, I interact with crores of families every month through radio.
Often, while talking to all of you, reading the letters you sent or on telephone, I feel that all of you have considered me as a member of your family.
This is a pleasant experience for me.
Friends, Election is one of the biggest festivals of democracy.
In the next two months, all of us will be present in the dustbin of elections.
I myself will be a candidate in this election.
Mann Ki Baat will be the last Sunday of the month of May, respecting a strong democratic tradition.
This means that the month of March, the month of April and the entire month of May will be three months.
After the election of all our emotions in this period, with a new belief and with the strength of your blessings, once again with the help of Mann Ki Baat, we will start a programme to interact with you people and for many years we will continue to talk to you.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to the service of the society.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us - 'Kayakave Kailas' means that while working hard, it is like living in the residence of Lord Shiva, in Kailashadham.
His fame was such a scholar who had wonders in English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He communicated his life to provide food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
I am fortunate to have got the blessings of revered Swamiji several times.
In 2007, for the birth centenary year celebrations of Shri Sri Shivakumar Swami ji, Dr.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for revered Swamiji.
This poem of In Giving, You Receive Happiness Alliance Will Blace, All Year Actions, Dr Kalam Saheb reflects the life of Shri Shivkumar Swami Ji and the mission of Siddhganga Math.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our democracy - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
The people of the world are surprised to see the massive level of elections being held in India and the efficiency that the Election Commission of India manages is a matter of pride for every countrymen.
Every citizen of India who is a registered voter in our country.
No one leaves any stone unturned to ensure that a registered voter gets an opportunity to cast his vote.
While we hear that polling stations are also being set up at a height of 15,000 feet from sea level in Himachal Pradesh, it is also being arranged in remote islands like Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Just imagine, for a voter.
When I hear these things, I feel proud of the Election Commission.
This is the beauty of our democracy that the Election Commission employees should go to far-flung areas and arrange for the voting to ensure that the voters get an opportunity to exercise their right to vote.
I appreciate the Election Commission which has consistently tried to strengthen our democracy.
I would urge the younger generation to register as voters if they are eligible to vote.
At the same time, it is my duty to ensure that there is a sense of emotion.
We must realize this responsibility.
This is our tendency, our tendency.
This should be our culture.
I call upon the renowned people of the country to make people aware by running a campaign to ensure that they either get voter registration or get voter turnout.
I hope that a large number of youth will be registered as voters and they will further strengthen our democracy with their participation.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done something amazing and unforgettable for humanity.
Our country is multi-purpose.
One of these great men was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On 23rd January, the entire nation celebrated her birth anniversary.
On the occasion of Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You are aware that several rooms and buildings were closed in the Red Fort since independence.
Closed rooms in the Red Fort have now been converted into a very beautiful museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army
The museum dedicated to Yaad-e-Jallian and 1857 Atin FIFTI consumption, India's First War of Independence and this entire complex has been dedicated to the nation as Kranti Mandir.
Every brick in this museum has a smell of our glorious history.
The museum inspires us to see the legends of the heroes of our freedom struggle in history.
At this very place, the British Rajvatin had launched a brave son of Mother India - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurubaksingh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was seeing the memories associated with Netaji in the Red Fort, in the Kranti Mandir, then the members of Netaji's family presented me a very special cap.
Netaji used to make those caps.
I gave it to the hat museum so that the people coming there can see the cap and take inspiration from it.
In fact, our heroism and patriotism need to continue to bring different forms of valour to the new generation.
A month ago, I had gone to Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December.
In a programme, the tricolor was thrown at the same place where Netaji Subhas Bose had fluttered the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the Tricolor broke out in the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because here is the tradition of 15th August.
On this occasion, 75 years of formation of Azad Hind Government were completed.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave Jawan and a skilled association.
A brave soldier who played a key role in the freedom struggle.
Delhi Chalo, you blend me, I will bless you. Netaji has made many brilliant announcements like this and made a place in the heart of every Indian.
For many years, there was a demand for bringing the files related to Netaji in front of everyone and I am glad that we could do this thing.
I remember that day when Netaji's family had come to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together, we all took a dig at several things related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy that several places related to the great heroes of India have been developed in Delhi.
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road, Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir related to Babasaheb Ambedkar.
If you come to Delhi then you must see these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that is Mann Ki Baat then I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered Radio connecting with people as an important medium. Likewise, Netaji too was very busy with radio and he had chosen this medium to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu started the Azad Hind Radio and used to interact with the soldiers and people of the Azad Hind Fauj through radio.
Subhash Babu had a different style of commencement of his address on radio.
First of all, he used to say, "Dhis is Subhash Chandra Bose Speaking to You Over the Azad Hind Radio and so on, a new zeal, a new energy was being created in the audience.
I was told that these radio stations used to broadcast weekly news which were given in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, West and Urdu languages.
The Radio Station is being run by the resident M.
Vyas played a very important role.
The programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programme gave a lot of strength to our freedom fighters.
A painting museum has been established in this Kranti Mandir.
Efforts have been made to showcase Indian art and culture in an extremely attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and there are over 450 paintings and art works of centuries old.
The museum has exhibited excellent artworks from great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravivarma, Avinindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jemini Rai, Saloj Mukherjee.
And I would specially urge you all to go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you are thinking that the discussion of art is going on here and I am telling you about the excellent artwork of Gurudev Tagore.
Till now, we have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and musician.
But I would like to say that Gurudev is not a painter.
He has made paintings on many topics.
He has also taken out pictures of animals and birds, he has taken out many beautiful pictures of nature and not only this, he has also done the work of drawing many human characters on Canvas through art.
And the special thing is that he did not give any name to most of his paintings.
He was convinced that his painter himself would understand the meaning of that painting and the meaning of his message from the paintings would be understood from his perspective.
Their painting exhibitions are also held in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope you will definitely visit the Kranti Mandir to see their paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of Saints.
Our saints have given the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Saint Ravidas ji used to give a big message in a very small manner.
He had said that whenever a person doesn't get accustomed to Hajo Ketan's ancestors, if he doesn't get accumulated, then there is nothing left beneath the leaflet, but the entire tree comes to an end, in the same way a person feels diverse and a person doesn't live.
He used to say that if God indeed belongs to every human being, then it is not right to share it on religious and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji, through his message, tried to understand the importance of labour and labour throughout his life.
It will not be wrong to say here that he has given the world the true meaning of labour prestige.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov to highlight Indias space programme and its future related aspects.
I would like to urge the students to take juice in the space programme and think of moving beyond the sky in a different way, I compliment Kiran ji for this idea and especially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad when I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai has made an important contribution to Indias space programme.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching the space.
On 24th January this Kalam-Set Launch was made by our students.
The sounding rockets built by the students of the university in Odisha have set many records.
The number of space missions that have been launched since independence till 2014, almost the same number of space missions have been started in the last four years.
We have also made a global record of launching 104 satellites from the same spacecraft.
We will soon showcase Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is using space technologies to protect lives and property.
Whether it is cyclone or rail or road safety, space technologies are helping better.
Our fishermen brothers have been given navy devices, which are helpful in economic upliftment along with their safety.
We are using space technologies to make government services delivery and accountability more sustainable.
Under the Housing for All scheme, about 40 lakh houses have been geo-tagged in 23 states.
Besides, Geo-Tags have also grown under MNREGA for nearly three and a half crore voters.
Our satellites have become a symbol of the country's growing power.
Our excellent relations with many countries of the world are immense.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has given our neighbouring friendly nations a gift of development.
Today, through our immensely competitive launch service, India is launching not only the developing country but also the satellites of developed countries.
The sky and stars for children are always very attractive.
Our space programme provides an opportunity to the children to move ahead with the limits that they seem to have been impossible till now.
Our vision is to inspire and inspire our children not only to keep up with the stars, but also to find new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that the one who plays will open it. And here in Khelo India, a lot of youngsters and young sportspersons have come forward.
In January, about 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
When the sportsperson performs best at the local level, he will do the best in the world.
In Khelo India, sportspersons from every state have performed well at their respective levels.
Many medal winners are inspiring for their lives.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
The captain of Maharashtra's 21-year-old Women's Cubbodies Association, Sonali Helvi, is a resident of Satara. She was married to a very young woman and encouraged her brother and her mother Sonali's skills.
It is often seen that girls are not encouraged in sports like kabaddi.
In spite of this, Sonalin chose cobblers and performed excellent.
Abhinav Shaw, 10 years old, is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshata Baswani, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, won a gold medal at Vatican Hind Weightlifting.
His elder brothers are farmers in Belgaum.
When we talk about building India then New India is not only the resolution of youth power but also the New India.
These tales of Khelo India are telling the contribution of not only big cities but also small towns, villages, youngsters and young sports talents for making a New India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot about the prestigious list of contests.
The event is called Swachh Sundar Shauchalaya.
People are cleaning their toilets and making some paintings and making them beautiful. We will get to see pictures of clean beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media.
I urge all the Sarpanches and village heads to lead this campaign in their Panchayats.
You must put a lot of pictures on your clean beautiful toilets on social media including Mylzzatghar.
Friends, On 2nd October, 2014, all of us have started a journey that will always be remembered for keeping the country clean and open defecation free.
Today, India is moving towards Open Defecation Free (ODF) long before 2nd October, 2019, so that I can pay my tributes to my fathers on their 150th birth anniversary.
Anshul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about testing and exam warriors.
Ankul ji, thank you for presenting this issue.
For many fairs, the first part of the year remains a testimony.
Students, from their parents to teachers, all are engaged in examination related work.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
Today, I would have liked to discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat, but you would be happy to know that after two days on 29th January at 11. 00 a.m., Pariksha Pe Charcha programme will interact with students from all over the country, along with students, parents and teachers.
And many foreign students will also participate in the event.
I will definitely put forward some of these ideas and suggestions in the Town Hall programme.
You can also see the same Live Broadcasting through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11 a.m. the entire nation pays homage to the martyrs.
You should also pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes.
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
The year 2018 will end.
And then it benefits the experiences and it also creates confidence in selecting.
What can we do, which will transform our lives and contribute to the development of the society and the country
My best wishes to you all in 2019.
You must have decided to remember the year 2018.
It is also important that the year 2018 will be remembered as a country as the strength of one hundred thirty crore people.
And it is also a matter of pride for all of us.
In 2018, the world's largest Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme was launched.
Electricity has reached every village of the country.
The world's prestigious institutions have recognized that India is working to eradicate poverty at a record pace.
With the unwavering resolve of the countrymen, the coverage of sanitation has gone up from 95 to 95.
For the first time since independence, the Tricolor was thrown at the Red Fort on the 75th Foundation Day of the Azad Hind Government.
The country has got the world's tallest statue of Staute of Unity in honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who laid the foundation of unity in the country.
The country's name was raised in the world.
The UN's highest environmental award, Champion of the Earth, was given to the nation.
India's efforts towards solar energy and climate change will get a place in the world.
The first meeting of the Global Solar Alliance was held in India.
Our collective efforts have led to an unprecedented growth in Indias trade facilitation.
The country's defence efficiency has become stronger.
This year our country has successfully completed the nuclear triangle i. e.
The country's daughters travelled the world through the sea circumnavigation and the height of the country was filled with pride.
Indias first climate began in Varanasi.
That is why revolution has started in the waterways sector .
The countrys longest rail-road bridge was inaugurated and the first and 100th Pakyong airport of Sikkim was inaugurated.
India also won the 19-year-old Cricket World Cup, Blind Cricket World Cup.
This year, India has earned a large number of medals in the Asian Games.
India has also made good strides in the Para Asian competition.
If I talk about our collective endeavours for the sake of every Indian then our Mann Ki Baat will be so long that 2019 will emerge.
This has been possible only through the relentless efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we have met some exceptional Indians in December this year.
On 19th December, Dr. Jayendran passed away in Chennai.
Doctor Jindran is known for providing the most cheap treatment to the poor.
People say that he was an expert in the service of the patient.
On this website, I have read a lot about the work that inspires his society.
Similarly, Sulagitinaras Mama of Karnataka passed away on 25th December.
He was honoured by Padmashri earlier this year.
There are several persons like Jayachandran and Sulagitti Narasamma who have dedicated their lives for the betterment of the society.
While we are talking about healthcare, I would like to talk about the social efforts undertaken by the doctors of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors in the city provide free treatment to poor patients by organizing camps.
This kind of shibir is taken every month through the Heart Lung Critical Care, which provides free treatment for various diseases in these camps.
Today hundreds of poor patients benefit from these camps every month .
The excitement of these young doctors who are serving patients with selflessness is truly remarkable.
Today, I am proud to say that it is because of collective efforts that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has succeeded.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh have launched the Swachhta Abhiyan.
I'm just Thebetterindia.
I am sure that this will provide information to more and more people about our neighbours who are bringing about change in society.
It is easy to spread negativity .
However, several good things are happening around us in the society.
And this is happening with the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports is an important part of every society.
When sports are played, those who watch it also get energy.
We see a lot of fame, identity and dignity of the players.
But sometimes there are many things that are bigger and bigger than the world.
I would like to tell you about Kashmir's daughter-in-law Nisar and she won a gold medal in the Karate won in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanayana studied and practiced karate with hard work and chicketty, learned the brakes in it and proved himself.
I pray for the bright future of this countrymen.
Many congratulations and blessings to Hanaya.
Likewise, there was a lot of discussion among the media about the daughter of Rajni, 16 years old.
Rajani said that his parents have sacrificed a lot, they have done a lot of hard work to reach here.
Jasmer Singh used to leave for work every morning before Rajni and his emotions arose.
When Rajani expressed his desire to learn against the problem, his father collected all the resources and increased his enthusiasm.
Rajni had to use old gloves to perform even a difficult task because the financial condition of his family was stagnant.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni did not go away and learnt Mutiny.
She has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajni and congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha Rani for helping Rajni and enhancing her enthusiasm.
In the same month, a 20 year old daughter of Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni, has become the fastest Asian migrating to the world.
She used to run around 300 km of cycles daily for 159 days.
You can imagine that 300 km cycling per day
Their stubbornness of cycling is truly analytical.
Whether we get inspiration from these achievements or not
Especially when my young friends hear about the phenomenon, they also get inspired to do something by crossing the barriers.
If you make a firm resolve, if you have the strength then all the problems will automatically disappear.
No problem can be obstructed .
When we hear about such examples, we also get an inspiration every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, there will be several festivals like Lodhi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi in January.
On the occasion of all these festivals, if we see the colors of traditional dances somewhere in the country of Sanoran then somewhere Irodi will be burnt in the joy of Sugi.
After this the day starts to grow gradually and winter season starts .
Many congratulations to our farmer brothers and sisters who feed us.
Ekta - Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is a part of our ethos.
You can see how similar our festivals have been to nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not different, individuals and communities are the same.
Excellent examples of our close relations with nature are festival-based calendars.
This includes not only the festival of the year but also the information about the planets and constellations.
This traditional calendar shows how old our relationship with natural and astronomical events is.
According to the moon and sun calendar the date of the feast is fixed according to the speed of the moon and the sun .
The calendar which calendar calculates depends on it .
Celebrations are also celebrated in many parts as per the status of stars.
Gudhikhowa, Chetichand and Ugadi are all celebrated as lunar calendars, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaisakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu are celebrated as calendars.
River and water conservation has a special significance in many of our festivals.
Chhath is a festival of worshipping the sun in rivers and ponds.
On Makar Sankranti also millions and millions of people take bath in the holy rivers.
Our festivals also teach us social values.
On the one hand they have archaeological significance, on the other hand, every festival is easily inspired by social brotherhood.
I convey my best wishes to all of you in 2019 and wish you the very best for the upcoming festival.
My dear countrymen, there are many such things in our culture that we can take pride in and show pride to the entire world and one of these things is our Kumbh Mela.
People from within the country and abroad come there and are always associated with the Kumbh Mela.
The ocean of faith and devotion lies in the Kumbh Mela.
Millions of people from within the country and abroad have come together in one place.
The tradition of Kumbh is imbibed and blossomed with our great cultural heritage.
This year, the world famous Kumbh Mela is being organised in Prayagraj from 15th January, which perhaps you all are eagerly waiting for.
Saint-Mahatma Prayagraj has started reaching for Kumbh Mela since now.
Last year, UNESCO has placed the Kumbh in the background of the magnificent cultural traditions of humanity.
A few days ago, Ambassador of several countries had come to see the preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
At that time, the flag of several countries was hoisted at one time.
The Kumbh Mela is being organized at Prayagraj, where people from more than 150 countries are expected to come.
The divinity of Kumbh will illuminate India's magnificence throughout the world.
The Kumbh Congregation is an effective medium for its own discovery and every person coming here feels differently.
This is a huge educational experience especially for the youth.
I myself had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I have seen that the preparations for the Kumbh Mela are going on at a rapid pace.
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited about the Kumbh Mela.
This year, emphasis is also being laid on cleanliness in Kumbh.
In the Kumbh event, cleanliness will not only focus on cleanliness but its good message will reach far and wide.
This year, the future Triveni will also be able to observe Akshayvat after the holy bath at Sangam.
This akshayvat, a symbol of the faith of the devotees, was shut down in a fort for many years, so that the emotional could not see it even when it was desired.
But now, the doors of the fort of Akshayvat have been opened for all.
I would like to urge you that when you visit Kumbh Mela, you must upload some of the photos of Kumbh Mela on social media that will inspire more people to visit this Kumbh Mela.
May this Kumbh of spirituality become the Mahakumbh of philosophy in India for Indians.
Become the Kumbh of artistry and the Mahakumbh of creative powers.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of curiosity in our countrymen about the 26th January Republic Day celebrations.
There is an unbreakable bond between revered Bapu and South Africa.
From South Africa, Mohn became Mahatma.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa and stood firm against casteism.
He also established Finnics and Tolstoy Farms and the voice for peace and justice was raised all over the world.
This year 2018, Nelson Mandela is also being celebrated as a centenary year and is also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela is considered to be an ideal in the fight against apartheid all over the world.
He was blessed with the valour and inspiration of Bapu for so many years.
He considered Bapu as his ideal.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not just a source of inspiration for the entire world, they always encourage us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, just a few days ago, there was a DGP Summit at Narmada in Gujarat where the world's tallest statue is the Statue of Unity.
Detailed discussions were held on how steps should be taken to empower the security of the country and the countrymen.
At the same time, I announced the launch of the Sardar Patel Award for National Integration in any way the award will be conferred on those who contribute to national integration.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He always tried to keep India's integrity uninterrupted.
Sardar Patel believed that India's true strength is united in its diversity.
Respecting their spirit and paying homage to them through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the holy day of Guru Gobind Singh jis birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna, a long time in his life, North India was his workplace and he laid down his life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and the end of life in Nanded.
Thus, in a sense, the whole of India received his blessings.
If we look at his life then we can see a reflection of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of Pita Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji gained the position of Guru in the nine-year-old Alphons.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice.
His personality was calm and straightforward, but whenever an attempt was made to smile the poor and the weak, when injustice was done to them, Guru Gobind Singh fought hard for the poor and the weak and therefore it is said that...
Twenty-two and a half lakhs of boys and girls, they used to say that it is not right to demonstrate our strength by fighting against the weak.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that this is the biggest service to alleviate human sufferings.
He was an excellent tricolor, as well as a master of many other languages including Gurumukhi, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, there are many good things in the country that are not discussed at large.
i. e. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).
I am working to promote safe and healthy food habits.
India will be prosperous only when India is clean and healthy.
Nutritive food is the most important thing for good health .
In this context, F. S.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him for this initiative taken by him.
I would like to urge you all to join this initiative.
I would like to say that you should also participate in it and especially showcase these things to the children.
It is important to get education which tells the importance of diet from childhood itself .
My dear countrymen, this is the last edition of 2018 and I will meet you once again in 2019.
Life, be it individuals, nations or societies, inspiration is the foundation of progress of that life.
Let us move ahead with this new inspiration, new zeal, new resolutions, new achievements and new heights and bring about a transformation in our country.
On 3rd October, 2014, through Mann Ki Baat on the holy occasion of Vijaya Dashami, we all started a journey together.
The only human being was a shieldist.
There was nothing clothing on the dhaba for depression.
He had constructed a tapari-like tapari on the road side.
There were discussions on radio at that time.
It should reach far-flung areas of the country, from the far-flung villages to the metro cities, from the farmers to the young professionals.
Recently, All India Radio has conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen the implications of that survey, some are different and observable.
Of the people who have been surveyed, about 70 are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat is a major contributor to increasing the positive spirit of the society.
This is a glimpse of the positive emotions that realizes in the minds of our countrymen.
Many people have also shared their experiences that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the spirit of Voluntaryism.
There has been a change in the way people are coming forward with great zeal for social service.
I am very happy to see that Mann Ki Baat has made radio more popular now.
But radio is not the only medium in this journey.
Thank you very much for phone calls.
The apprehension that you have made is absolutely correct.
But if a leader was given a mic and millions of people used to listen to him then what else would he have to do
He studied which words were used repeatedly.
Those studying have concluded that this programme is not related to politics, when I started the Mann Ki Baat programme, at the same time I had decided that there should not be politics in it, there should not be any government support in it.
I was inspired by all of you when you took up this great task of attaining Siddhis.
It is evident that in the letters published before every part of Mann Ki Baat, online telephone calls, the audience has a lot of expectations.
What will happen to Modi and what will happen to him, but this country will remain intact, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore countrymen will continue to live.
Anybody writes letters from a distant place in the country and tells me that people should not lose a lot of money with small shopkeepers like us, auto rickshaw drivers and vegetable sellers.
Now a campaign like Selfie with Daughter can be started in a small village in the state of Haryana and it can spread not only across the country but also abroad.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government word.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India.
If we want to answer the question that we have asked directly in a simple manner then we can say that nothing is being prepared.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy task for me.
Because every time I get letters from people before Mann Ki Baat.
By calling this number, people record their message in their voices.
It is my endeavor to keep the maximum number of letters and notes before every part of Mann Ki Baat.
Every moment my countrymen have lived in my heart. And that is why whenever I read a letter, the circumstances of that journalist and his feelings become a part of my thoughts.
In such a scenario, the letter is not just a piece of paper.
In fact, this is my voice in Mann Ki Baat, but all the examples, emotions and inspiration belong to my countrymen.
There are millions of people in Mann Ki Baat whom I have not been able to name till date, but they send their letters and letters.
Efforts are also made to ensure that all the letters which cannot get place in Mann Ki Baat and the concerned departments should take care of their suggestions.
Mann Ki Baat can reach the maximum number of people only because of their hard work.
Each team of All India Radio prepares for transmission in different languages.
Some people simply raise their voices with the voice of Modi and listen to Mann Ki Baat in the regional languages spoken in Shaili.
One by one, they become Narendra Modi for those 30 minutes.
I congratulate and thank them for their talent and skills.
I urge you all to listen to this program in your local language as well.
However, many of the topics discussed in Mann Ki Baat have also been taken up by the media.
On topics such as cleanliness, road safety, narcotics free India, selfie with Daughter, media innovated innovative ideas and made it a campaign and worked in the field.
Without our cooperation Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Sometimes our prejudice also continues to be a big threat to communication.
I give priority to understanding what the person in the front is saying without acceptance and reaction.
Generally, there was talk of Communication Gaps between the elderly, the elderly and the daughters of Kumar Vyottali.
In fact, most of the households have limited access to discussions with children and children.
In this discussions were held on the subjects of the study of children or their habits as well as their inner lifestyle .
I am always trying to ensure that what they are doing or how they think about it, whether they can learn something different from them or not.
At the end, this is the New India.
Some people have to say that the younger generation wants to do a lot of things together.
I tell you - what is wrong with this
These youngsters have shown the courage to ask questions and dream big, the same youth have brought about this change.
My dear countrymen, Vineeta ji from Gurugram has written on MyGov that I should talk about the Constitution Day tomorrow on 26th November in Mann Ki Baat.
He says that this day is very special because we have accepted the constitution and it has been 69 years since it is going to enter in the 70th year.
Just imagine, within three years, these great personalities have created such a massive and comprehensive event.
This is a great example of the way these great people have worked on such a fast-growing draft. It is still a good example of the management and productivity of the village.
The special feature of our Constitution is that rights and duties have been described in detail in detail in terms of rights and duties.
The combination of these two will take the country forward in the lives of the citizens.
If we respect and respect the rights of others then the protection of our rights will automatically take place. And similarly, if we follow our duties in the constitution then the protection of our rights will automatically take place.
I still remember that when India's democracy was 60 years old then in 2010, we had taken a grand tour by placing an elephant on the elephant in Gujarat.
We are reminded of the efforts made by the youth to create awareness about the Constitution and to incorporate them into the key aspects of the Constitution.
And let us ensure that Peace, Progress and Prosperity in our country is peace, progress and prosperity.
My dear countrymen, we can never forget the contribution of a great soul when it is discussed by the Rajya Sabha Committee.
He was a great man, a revered Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
6th December is his Mahaparinirvan Diwas.
Its not something new for India that what is democratic and how Parliamentary system is there.
He had said that this freedom that we have attained after so much struggle is precious and we have to protect it to the last drop of our blood.
India First Ha Dr.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and we will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv next year in 2019.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought of the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the society the path of truth, action, service, compassion and harmony.
All State Governments and Union Territories have also been directed to celebrate this event in a big way.
In this way, the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in all the countries of the world.
I remember Lakhpat Saheb Gurudev at that time.
This guerrilla was severely damaged during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat.
But the way the state government has worked with the help of the local people, the way it has done the work of renovation of this graveyard is still going to be an ideal.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to construct the Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit that holy place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
But this journey will continue.
The more people will be associated with all of us, the more our journey will be better and everyone will be happy.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people that what do I get from Mann Ki Baat
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On 31st October, our son Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is the birth anniversary of all of us. And every year, the youth of the country is ready to run for the Run for Unity.
I urge all of you to participate in this race to listen in such large numbers.
About six months before independence, on 27th January, 1947, the image of Sardar Patel was published on the page of the World's famous International Monthly Time.
This was the map of an India that was divided into several parts.
At that time, more than 550 institutions were in the country.
Even though the British juice of India had finished, they used to disintegrate this country in many parts and then leave the country.
The Time Months were writing that the threats like Paradise, Violence, Fiscal Deficit, Expenditure and Politics of the Sovereignty are engulfing India.
He further wrote the Time Monthly that if anyone has the ability to encircle the country and to fill the wounds then it will be Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This news of TIME was about to open several other aspects of the life of the Iron Man.
How he did the rescue operations after the floods in Ahmedabad in the 1920s and how he gave direction to the Bardoli Satyagraha.
He brought about merger of all institutions in India.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad or Travancore, the ideological maturity and strategic skills of Rajput Sardar Patel of Rajasthan, we can see India together today.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on seeing this nation and our Mother India bound by the bonds of unity.
The Statue of Unity will be dedicated to the nation by paying homage to Sardar Patel on the occasion of Sardar Patels birth anniversary on 31st October this year.
Built on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, the height of the statue is double the height of the Statue of Liberty statue in the USA.
This effigy is the world's highest skyscraper.
Every Indian will now feel proud that the world's tallest effigy is in India.
Sardar Patel, whose bonds were with the land, will now enhance the glory of the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, yesterday all of us have celebrated Infantry Day.
This is the day when the soldiers of Indian Army landed on the land of Kashmir and protected Khore from the fugitives.
This historic event is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old book by the great army officer of India, Sam Manikshaw.
Field Marshal Manikshaw was reminiscent of the period of his career.
The death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi on 31st October.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Indira Ji.
My dear countrymen, who does not like sports
Spirit, strength, skills, stamina are very important in the world of sports.
The youngsters of the country who have these qualities will not only make progress in sectors like economy, science and technology, but will also flag off the sports.
Our Para Athletes participated in the Asian Para Games 2018.
India has won a total of 72 medals in the competition, and added a new record and respect to India.
I am fortunate to meet all these talented Para Athletes personally and congratulate them.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina.
You will be happy to know that our youth have achieved the best ever in the Youth Olympics 2018.
In this competition, we won three more medals in Mix Types besides 13 medals.
You must have remembered that India's performance in the Asian Games of this year was also very good.
See how many times I have used the best, most glorious words to speak for minutes.
This is the story of Indian sports, which is reaching new heights day by day.
India is not only in sports but also in areas where it was never thought of.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who won the Gold Medal in Athletics for the Country at the 2018 Asian Para Games.
He is a person with disabilities since birth.
When he was eight years old, he had a legacy.
Then he took eight years to an orphanage.
After abandoning orphanage, he worked as a Veterinary Veterinary Vehicle on the roadsides in Delhi.
Today, Narayana is winning Indias Gold in International Competitions.
Not only this, look at India's excellent performance in sports, India has never won an Olympic medal in Judo.
But Tababi Devi won the Judot Silver medal in the Youth Olympics and created history.
Tababi Devi, a 16 year old sportsperson, lives in a village in Manipur.
Their widows are labourers and mothers do the work of selling fish.
Many a time came for his family that he had no money for food.
In such a situation, the morale of Goddess Tababi did not diminish.
And he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are innumerable such stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson and his stubbornness is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, you have successfully organised the FIFA 2017 World Cup under 17 years.
The entire world was commended for the successful conduct of sports.
A new record in the number of audiences was recorded in the FIFA Under Saventin World Cup.
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football in different stadiums of the country and encouraged young sportspersons.
This year, India is fortunate to host the Mens Hockey Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup is scheduled to begin in November 2018 and continues till December 16.
Every Indian, be it playing any game or be it juice or hockey, has an intimacy in his mind.
The history of India in Hockey has been written in gold.
In the past, India has won gold medals in several competitions and at one time India has also been a world champion.
India has also given hockey to many great sportspersons.
When there is talk of hockey in the world, the story of hockey will remain incomplete without these great sportspersons of India.
Hockey's magician Major Dhyan Chand is known all over the world.
He has travelled a long way from Balwinder Singh Sinier, Leslie Glodius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, the sportspersons of Team India are inspiring the new generation of hockey because of their hard work and dedication.
There is a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts to see a thrilling encounter.
He visited Bhubaneswar and encouraged not only Indians but other associations.
During this along with enjoying sports you can also see the Sun Temple of Konark , Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri and several world famous and sacred places including Chilka Lake .
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Mens Hockey Team for this competition and I assure you that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with them for their support.
I also convey my best wishes to all the teams coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the kind of people who are serving and serving themselves for social work, they are inspiring and enthusiastic for all the countrymen.
But in the new era, today we are moving ahead with new hopes, new zeal and new dreams in a new way.
A few days ago, I had gone to a programme where a portal has been launched, its name is Self Four Society, MyGov and the IT and electronic industry of the country have started this portal to encourag our employees to provide them this opportunity by encouraging them to take up social initiatives.
Every Indian will be proud to see the enthusiasm and intimacy he has for this work.
From IT to Society, we are not ego, we are not age, it is the aroma of the journey of the entire world.
If someone is teaching children then someone is teaching senior citizens, if someone is engaged in cleanliness then someone helps the farmers. And there is no desire to do all this but dedication and determination.
A young man himself learnt a wheelchair basketball to help the disabled wheelchair basketball team.
This spirit is dedication, this is a swift initiative for a specific task.
Wouldn't any Indian feel proud of it
My dear brothers and sisters, when I was watching the message of Mann Ki Baat then I got to see a charming tip of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on Mygov, Please tell us that in Mann Ki Baat, the customs and traditions of many tribes of India are the best examples of coexistence with nature.
We need to learn something from them about how we need to adopt their traditions in our lives.
Manish ji, I compliment you all for keeping this topic in mind.
This is the topic that inspires us to see our glorious history and culture and today the entire world, especially the West, is discussing environmental protection and finding new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Though our year has not been solved by this problem, but we only have to take our inner conscience, our rich history, traditions and especially the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
Our tribal culture has been part of our co-operation agreement with nature.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
In the Bhil tribal communities of central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship Pimpal and Arjun trees.
In a deserted land like Rajasthan, Vishnoi society has shown us the path of environmental protection.
They are supposed to sacrifice their lives especially for the conservation of trees, but they are not allowed to damage any single tree.
Arunachal Pradesh claims to have a relationship with Mishmi tigers.
They also consider them as brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland lions are seen as the protectors of forests .
People from the heritage communities of Maharashtra consider tiger as guests and for them the existence of tigers is prosperous.
The Coal community in central India believes that their own fate is linked to the tiger and if the tiger does not get food then the villagers will have to be hungry.
In the reproductive season of Gond tribal waters in central India, fishing is stopped in some parts of the river Ketan.
In southern India, on the Nilgiri mountains, a small buffalo community broke into remote areas, traditionally their habitations are made of locally available goods.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community is very peaceful and united, but if someone harms their natural resources then they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters belonged to the tribal community.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought hard against the British government to protect our wild land
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who have done something unique for the society.
This kind of work seems to be difficult but in reality it has a very deep impact on changing our mindset and changing the direction of the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother Gurbachan Singh of Punjab.
Gurbachan Singh ji's son was married to a common and troubled farmer.
Before marriage, Gurbachan ji had said that we are going to marry the bridegroom in a simple manner.
There is no need to spend much on top and other things.
We have to celebrate this occasion in a simple manner.
But he suddenly said, but I have a hindrance.
Today, when it comes to the topic of marriage, it feels as if something is going to be a big demand in front of the bride, it will be difficult for the bride's family.
However, you will be surprised to know that it was a simple farmer who was a brother Gurbachan Singh, who had said that the bond that he had placed before the bride's father is the true power of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji had said that we will never burn pollen in our fields.
You can imagine how big social power is there in it.
And we have seen that there are so many families in our society that transform the individual context into social interest.
The family of Shri Gurbachan Singh ji has given us such an example.
I have read about another village in Punjab, Kallar Majra, which is near NABH.
Kallar Majra is talking about the fact that instead of burning the cereals, they mix the soil with orange and for this the technologies that we need to use are used.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurbachan Singh ji
Congratulations to all those who are doing their best to keep the environment clean and to the people of Kallar Majra.
You are leading the Indian tradition of a strong lifestyle like a true heir.
Small activism and awareness and positive work play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it has been stated in our books: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peaceful Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Visvedeva: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peacefulness: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace be upon you.
Peace be established in every corner of the world, in my heart, in you, in every corner of the world.
Peace: Peace: Peace: Whenever there is a discussion of world peace, Indias name and contribution will be reflected in the golden letter.
The 11th November of this year has a special significance for India as the first major war ended 100 years ago on 11th November.
The event marks the completion of 100 years, which will mark the completion of one century of the massive destruction and human destruction that took place at that time.
The first major event for India was an important event.
In fact, we didn't have to give anything directly to that war.
Yet our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers demonstrated to the world that when there was a war, it was not less than anyone.
Our soldiers have showered valour in remote areas and in adverse situations.
Or the only purpose for all was to re-establish peace.
In the First World War, the world saw the supreme monarchy.
According to estimates, nearly one crore soldiers and the same number of people lost their lives.
This will give importance to peace in the entire world.
The interpretation of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today, peace and harmony are not meant to be a war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, all need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is the true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, the story of our Northeast is different.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is unique and the people here are very talented.
Our North East India is known for its best work.
Northeast is such a region that has made great progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the 2018 Future Policy Gold Award for promoting sustainable food systems.
The award is given on behalf of the United Nations Farming Organisation (FAO).
You will be glad to know that this award for making the best policy is in line with Oscars.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for winning this award in the backdrop of the 51 Nomination Policy of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, the end of October.
There is a huge change in the weather.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens.
I urge you to take care of yourself, take care of your health and take care of social interest during these festivals.
This festival is an opportunity to take a new decision.
We should move forward in a mission mode with this determination and make a solemn pledge in our lives.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The more progress you make, the more progress the country will progress.
