There is Panchar city near Bhuj , where many earthquakes took place and the entire city got destroyed .
Near Anchar the tomb of Jaisal - Toral is there .
The story of Jaisalmer is very interesting .
The way through whichever way we go back that way itself we take a month 's holiday and open the church in Bombay .
So what to do  Now for the rush buses of Gujarat one has to take a ride on train after taking a journey .
Small train of metre gauge reached Rajkot from Bhuj .
From there a small train of metre gauge reached Ahmadabad and from Ahmadabad a big train of broad gauge reached Mumbai .
Recognizing the economic status of Rajasthan , the tourism department is going through bad governance at this time .
There is a huge obstacle in the business of daily life in Vaishali Mandi and in South Asia .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan with the point of view of connecting the major countries of the country becomes almost less during these days .
According to a recent survey done by the Rajasthan government , the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 is less than ten percent as compared to 2008 .
As a result there was a decrease of 98 . percent in the number of tourists of the country and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 together in Rajasthan 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came , out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 are from the country and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists are included , because in 2009 together 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand and 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with the tourist area think this situation properly .
The director of Rajputana Holiday Makers Sanjay Kaushik has said that such horrific incidents like Baisik Mandir affect the tourism industry badly .
As compared to other countries of Asia we do not develop the strength and basic structure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that in comparison to last year the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent .
Maximum number of foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists in France is maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The concentration of tourism keeps on improving Rajasthan year after year .
This is the first time since 2002 that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
There is nothing new from the point of view of tourism .
Deserts , big buildings , forts , wells , forests , all these are old , to surprise the tourists .
For the purpose of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism all the governments come and go in the area of tourism , but do not do anything in this direction .
The facility of travellers coming to Rajasthan is available very less .
At the same time along with foreign lady tourists in Rajasthan the image of this country has been illustrated internationally in recent incidents of abduction and outrage .
Years before the government of Rajasthan there was a disturbance in the tourism department in the country , but it only got stuck in the newspapers .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of the Rajasthan government in terms of tourism .
With the aim of developing tourism and basic infrastructure of tourism in Rajasthan the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
Facilities of lodging , food , shipping , boating etc . are available for this corporation .
The houses of this corporation are 75 units .
Out of them 39 hotels , 22 motels , 8 cafteria , three pathways , one pocket only and two train palaces on hills , Royal Rajasthan on hills , but the condition of this hospital has been deteriorating for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC is 185 lakh and it is estimated that in the year 2009 - 10 it would be 63 lakh .
The condition of hotels in these hotels is this that in the last five years the rooms of their hotels are not filled even in fourty square kilometres .
Along with hotels other loneliness of hotels , which is a big loss .
Among these the main are the Royal Rajasthan of Hills .
Tourists do not get attracted towards this train .
Because of less rent this does not attract tourists .
In such a situation the interest of the travellers towards Pushkar Fair also starts decreasing .
In 2007 - 08 this fair was organised by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists stay , this year its number decreased to 217 .
In the midst of all this the pleasant thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth of tourists in the attraction of Palace on Wheels and Shahi Train .
This train brings immense benefit from it .
Last year from this train a profit of nine crore rupees was received to RTDC .
It is natural to see the waves of doubt in the tourist spot from this stretch on the tourist spot of Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economic situation of Rajasthan .
But if a human feels like doing something in his mind then he makes gold from the soil .
This is actually seen in the modern city Embo Valley in the mountain ranges of Sahyadri of Subradai Maharashtra .

The wind is cold .
Along with the cold chilling from the environment one also gets to know of the moisture .
Below the legs one gets to see the ice particles lying on the edge of the wood with a black sound .
There is silence all around because of the bright light coming in front of the sunrise we could not see much .
Eyes went towards the eastern Arunima .

Vandiperiyar is famous for grapes farming in Switzerland .
This is the main center of making wine of grapes .
37 percent land of the whole of the continent is the cultivation of grapes .
The grapes of grapes in the villages located on both the sides of the Rong Valley give a magnificent expanse to the beauty there .
Go to the area of grapes , take a stroll there , take a rest at night in the villages there and check the wine after going to the grapes factory , all these are the comprehensive part of the tourism industry here .
In a small town named Eagle there is a huge collection of grapes in a fort made in the 12th century to see which foreign tourists are booking beforehand .
Once again our people crossed that dense forest with forests .
The heart gets restless by the question of the lying on the ground of the child till three - four kilometres .
Suddenly a circular vision makes a dramatic and beautiful change .
Actually on the left side of the road on the outskirts of the deep valley a beautiful settlement of houses is settled .
People skiing on snow in a parallel area above the villages .
Above the skiing slopes the dense forest of cedar is spread till the peaks of the mountain .
Strong snow falls all around .
The roofs of houses are shining because of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reached the village .
Here also the same silence is shadowed .
From the peak of the mountains all around to the valley there is a mix of beautiful snow .
In the next five minutes we reached a big round in the middle of that small town .
The name of the small city is Lakshadweep .

It is said in Darjeeling that Sikkim 's taxis go only in Sikkim , therefore there is no test .
The journey continues , the area is different , but the mountain is the same .
The cold that makes the whole body shivering is that itself .
The black color of the rainy season is also of me .
When the plan for Darjeeling safari was fixed then the sight of Carsiang was seen first .
Carsiang is a small town in Darjeeling .
The tea gardens are full of dense forests .
It is famous for the production of excellent tea .
On reaching Darjeeling from Siligudi initially tea gardens are smiling and welcomed the people coming here .
On crossing the middle of the tea gardens the heart gets enchanted for the first time , which is one of the places conserved in the form of a treasure .
On one side the green mountain full of jungles on the other side is a deep green pit .
If there is forest in the middle then tea gardens can be seen in between .
All around there is a kingdom of greenery .
Once upon a time I was confused whether these natural jungles were visible or whether they were tea - trees planted by humans .
Both attract themselves .
The more beautiful wilderness is the more beautiful wilderness and tea gardens .
If the eyes go on the roads on the roads then the creation starts spectacular .
We crossed a serpentine and circular road .
Time passes by.
Forests and tea gardens are not finished .
Sometimes small huts are seen .
From far off places on a mountain one gets to see very comfortable with houses and buildings .
This is Carciang .
After staying at one place here we prepared a program to travel all day .
That is , taking a vehicle , leaving for Carsiang .
First of all, Dear Park.
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
Climbing up and downstairs the vehicle to reach the deer park is very low .
With the point of view of being rich with the beauty of Carcianic beauty it has not yet become famous in the form of a tourist spot .
Because the city is as clean and as clean .
The desire to reach the deer park surrounded by jungles in the wake of the departure of the road and the joy of climbing the path between the trees of the sun give us the courage .
The nearest place is Eagle Craig .
This is a point located at a height on the other side of the city .
This is called suicidal point .
In the time of the British the sages used to enjoy here .
Hilhal is attached with a park and a restaurant .
There is a fort of stairs here , on the top of which beautiful scenes can be seen after observing the entire city .
In the nearby tea gardens women come out in the large intestine and immediately press the tea garden with their hands .
There is a museum outside the Cariang city but that day we did not go there because it was necessary to travel through the open ambience of tea gardens .
Next day we decided to go to Darjeeling .
This was a thrilling experience for me , but if it was raining then how would it be
But the coincidence was very good that when we reached Rock Garden we enjoyed the sunrise on our way .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
As we descended a little from here we saw the Ganges surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst rocks a bird 's eye view of waterfalls can be seen .
In the Rock Garden we can see a marvellous world of waterfalls decorated with stones and rocks in the kingdom of Rock Garden .
These two places are located very low in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling .
On climbing upwards with the help of a vehicle we saw an unprecedented sight in Darjeeling .
The whole of the mountains of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of afar .
The condition of weather is clear till today .
But when we climbed on the monastery we could see the clouds standing .
Evening can be observed somewhere and shines .
During the journey of Darjeeling Tawai trains also give pleasure to travel .
Travellers especially attract from Darjeeling to Dhum , Dhum to Darjeeling .
Here boating in the Mirik lake and some rest in the garden are available .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar on the way , where sweaters etc . are made in the hands of Nepali artisans .
There is an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its shape and color are different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here because there is abundance of forests , waterfalls and waterfalls .
Kalimpong is the most popular tourist spot , Lava and Lolegram which is full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we did not go to Kalimpong this time .
If we had come to Darjeeling from Calcutta then for roaming Darjeeling in the shadow of winters while the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here connected me towards itself .
In my condition a small journey is very interesting and thrilling .
This journey is not from abroad but from outside Rajasthan because Jaipur is very near .
Tourism is an interesting subject for me in which a journey has drawn me , but sometimes some special place is a water ship or some royal train or some other flight like Gulab city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people get attracted .
The place where you went to do , that was prepared four and a half years ago , but along with that preparation this place came here that she really enjoyed .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
In my ears the voice of my guide Rambabu Meena was shouting , the master we had never thought before how we lived in the jungle .
50 percent workers are from this land area .
Suddenly I felt that people of such a place do not have to work in the heritage hotel .
The inhabitants of Ajabagarh Ram Babu had earlier worked in Jaipur , now this unique Amber palace is in the Amman garden .
He tells himself that he has changed a new color.
Master  Aman garden is very impressed .
There no one will call you English domination .
Aman Garden is actually a center of peace and comfort for all .
That garden has its own history , the biggest thing is that it introduces itself through the nearby landscapes .
How many people traveled to Danag of the messengers from the time of holidays in Amra Praveen of Rajasthan , why should they go far , some people from Jaipur residents sometimes spend the night in this area .
After the opening of the Amal garden large people from all over the world come here .
Shabana Azmi called me there very lovingly but I didn't go that night.
Its architecture is different which on its own reached Danag through Danag .
This time I came there in an unexpected invitation for the festivities of our foreign guests , but those people felt as if they had spent some time spending an unprecedented holiday there they should definitely go to the Aman Park .
This garden is a lone garden saved from those seven gardens where the king of Alawar settled for hunting .
Its construction was done in ten and twenty years .
Its ancient walls are the witnesses of those days .
Surrounded by mountains it is witness to strong trees .
The way you come inside , that way welcomes you , from that it feels that you have taken care of the incomplete peace here .
Along with closing the mattress in Manikarn the mantra of Mangalacharya should be celebrated actively .
We arrived at Ladakh in the evening and made a plan to roam around in the Egypt garden .
My guest Jackie is enjoying a mesmerising and mesmerising voice .
Everything is inspired by big buildings and palaces .
The most beautiful is its lighting .
Everything new and artistic is no wonder that the Amal garden has been renovated in its present times .
The manager prepared our program for the morning .
First of all a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey of Danag .
While walking on the way to Sankari we saw the fort of Ajabagh in which the sun rays spread gradually .
On seeing the dry lake farmers cultivate it .
This year it was not rainy season but for the first time we had seen a cultivation of tobacco .
The beauty of the rural life of Jackal is a unique experience .
After that we reached Dhangir in the jeep .
In the morning I kept looking at a tourist from Holland with great care .
This is a moment of invaluable amount of millennium dollars .
The way to salute the journey of Aman Garden is traditional , he told us to leave after giving glass and curd .
Now we realized why tourists come here spending so much money .
I have heard that there are picnics to see the life of the tribals .
Is this right
Basket is not that kind of one , but in many countries and tourists find it particularly interesting in it .
This tour is usually prepared from four days to two weeks and in the middle of this tourists get included in different places .
In these food and beverages are included from where one stays .
Such places try to explore such places where excessive development does not take place and where time does not affect the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time old tourist spots and other places are there .
Besides this it also keeps an eye on the distribution of traditional cuisines .
Actually the meaning of such tourism is to make the tourists aware of the ways and ways of living in that area .
Although it is a bit difficult to imagine , but such a tourism is charming and a different kind of experience .
It 's a fun to go on a bus .
In these many people stay with you because you get the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , if you take a book of your choice in this journey then you will get more time on being disturbed .
Yes , it is so important that along with giving less and full comfortable moments this journey definitely requires tolerance from you .
For enjoying this keep in mind some things especially if you are watching any foreign destination bus tour .
Before taking a ticket check whether it is a good deal .
Students , elderly people of the army , children etc . get benefit from it but also get relief from other people .
Although there is arrangement for ticketing in advance , therefore at the last minute it is very good to plan tours on bus , but plan is to be done a little earlier .
Although there is arrangement for ticketing in advance , therefore at the last minute it is very good to plan tours on bus , but plan is to be done a little earlier .
This is expensive .
The routine taking the bagge is very hard , therefore it is important to tell about the size and weight of the goods .
Sometimes it is not like this that you have to leave some of your things in the terminal or you have to pay more money later .
At the same time one should know the law of taking insurance or loss completely from the tour company .
Carry on bags should be kept sharp and should be taken out .
Because there is stiffness in the rock on the surface of the place .
Also keep in mind that while doing bus service in the middle of the tour the responsibility of the goods can be achieved .
Wherever you want to board a bus you must reach there an hour before .
During the time of smelling you should take special care of it .
Actually the sooner you reach the better place to choose will be with you .
While choosing the place keep in mind if there is a cuffer .
There is more swelling in the back side , but it is not a cafartable to read sitting on the front side .
If you want to frequently take the place of warmth then it would be better if you want to take the place of the sides but if you do n't like to bother you , then the place at the other side will be better for you .
So one thing of intelligence skills .
If you are both in a position to capture then first sit on the place and then keep a bag on your back .
If you are both in a position to capture then first sit on the place and then keep a bag on your back .
If the bus is very busy then the plan will be successful .
Importance of bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get enough information from them .
Everybody wants to go out while cleaning the bus .
At this time do not leave your things alone , because if they disappear then the bus do not take its responsibility .
Whenever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do n't come in time then you will get a place for a new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .

After that if you stay in the mountain then you will get hotel at a little lesser rate , but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be less .
Sea journey is useful here .
In the first week of December from Kochi to Louis Cruise island is the only ship in Colombo .
Louis Cruise is not only a European institution but also an important name for cruise and hotel business .
But because of some difficulties Louis Cruise has stopped its services but the possibility of its resumption from October to October remains .
At the lowest rate of the ship of Louis Cruise you can go to the edge of Maldives for at least 5850 rupees per person for three days every night .
That is , the expense of a person for three days is less than 18 , 000 rupees .
Not only this , if you are two people then the complete example of the child below the age of 15 years is the same .
What else do you want
In the expense of cruise tea - breakfast is included .
And full time fun.
On reaching the capital mall you can enjoy the fun and frolic accumulated on the Maldives according to the size of the pocket - from sea plane to lunch below the water .
If a plane comes in front of you all of a sudden while roaming around on big planes then you will feel that you are a toy .
But the twelve-fifteen-seater aircraft like Maldives is excellent in an unprecedented way for roaming in an island group .
When it flies in the air like a speedboat on the surface of the water , it can not be known .
On every flight you will not feel like normal airplane .
Your policies are always under the windows - on the various sides of Maldives in blue water on the resort islands and coral islands .
Everything is very clear.
There are two flight companies in Maldives .
Trams is one of them in Maldives , which has 20C flights .
If you want then you can take a flight of around Rs . 4000 -LRB- every person -RRB- for hours or you can hire the entire airplane throughout the day -LRB- if you have enough money -RRB- .
If you are going to any island from Maldives to any other island then it is necessary for aeroplanes to travel in different islands .
This journey will never stop you .
C - flights run on Maldives from 12 kms to 183 kms .
We were at the most ancient and glorious shop in the Ahmadi market of Mala .
Everyone taking luggage at the shop had tried very carefully by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed the language of the World Climate Conference held in Rapangan one day earlier .
Frankly speaking , I have not seen the language of a Hindustani , even the president or prime minister in such a cautious way .
But it is better to quietly imagine the question of the bone marrow of a remaining creation on this earth .
Many people call the conference being held in water by the Maldives cabinet in October but when going to Maldives it feels as if nature ' s wrath is taking it away from us then how impoverished will the earth be
There is also a speciality of its beauty .
So much beauty can not be enjoyed in that small country .
To return from that end of the market to your cruise do not turn in front of your cruise , so that people know how much beauty of this beauty can be felt by crossing the lines through the roads .
The water is so clean that under the bright light the deep swimming fish can be seen with all their colors .
This is a part of the sea connected with the city .
If you want to see a few kilometres fresh water in the sea or river along with any city of India then it will be worth seeing .
The evening spent two hours after returning to M . . . Akva Marine was not clear .
The corals are the life here .
Here you will find coral in the tombs till the rocks .
We had stayed outside his office some time before listening to the language of President Nasheed .
We did n't believe that we were in front of the house of the best person of a country .
With great interest we took pictures of gardens and anganbari of 50 metres surrounding Kainita Ekadash through the door of his Bengali .
Can you think this before the residence of any leader in India .
It has been understood that the President sometimes goes to his office two blocks beyond the road on foot .
Everything related to Maldives was moving towards one side .
That is why I am waiting for the next day .
I knew it would be a special day.
In the morning cruise took us to the airport .
From there we reached the place named Maldives by roaming through the railways .
Last evening when we arrived at the cruise mall , then the plane moving above turned off quickly .
Several pictures of it have been seen .
But we did n't know how to travel in the next minute .
We had to go to Rangoli Island 105 kilometres away by train , Mall , TV .
It is unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives through the C-Airways flying at a height of approximately 100 metres .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
It was a thrilling and exciting journey to breathe .
But when we got up at the Rangoli resort of the Hilton Hotel of Rangoli Island it felt as if we had reached a different world .
There's another world that has nothing to do with the outside world.
There was anxiety of such beauty and fun and whether it would be found anywhere outside .
Travelling in Konark can be done on foot and in a car running in a battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from the main island to the main island was marvellous .
Now we came to the place where we could endure ourselves from the natural beauty nearby , which was even beyond imagination .
With the help of stairs we descended a few metres below the sea and reached a mirror beneath the water .
That room was actually a hut .
On every side humans like small fishes , corals , snorkelling , scuba diving etc . filled with glass inside .
It 's adventurous to think about eating and drinking while sitting on the decorated table there .
The expense of one person is 47,000 rupees for seeing and drinking underwater lunch on this island by flight from Mala .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to wash our passport in water .
But I knew it was not possible .
If there is a fate with a heavy heart then it is believed that something can come here again .
A few days back a plan was made to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
Since childhood wildlife was an excitement , why should not this time go to Jim Corbett
In 2006 in Ladakh after bicycling till Pegong lake before cardamom glass this is the second bike tour .
In the morning of 27 December we left for Delhi with the aim of Jim Correspondent , but the joyride with which we had left , snow blocked our journey .
The journey between Hapurd and Gajauda was comfortable .
The snow covered from the top and the rod cut in front.
I felt it would have fallen several times .
In a way we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
We were in Dikuli near our resort park , whose booking was done before us .
There was nothing special about it but despite it being cold we went for a walk on the bank of Kosi .
After spending 2 . hours there we went to Corbett Museum .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
Ratri was very late when she came back .
While coming from Delhi definitely see the lion roaming around in the jungle and in dreams of the whole night there were lions all around me .
In the middle of the depth of the night suddenly I heard deep roar and after that till 2 pm the dogs kept quiet without stopping .
The first opinion was that Kalbhangi or Corbett waterfalls should be visited .
Kaalbhangi is 30 kilometres away but Corbett waterfall is on the way .
Several items related to his life have been kept in the museum of Corbett Saheb in Kalabhumgi .
Twelve.30 p.m. when I came back.
Kalbhangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett has begun to reach this village .
On reaching the resort Safari Gypsy was holding us .
He used to arrange sighting facilities in the top bedroom there .
Asked about the first number , because there was abundance of grasslands , the grass had reached here to protect it from the cold .
As soon as we reached Bijrani, we gave us a guide.
We prepared for the jungle inside .
We prepared for the jungle inside .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants, their horns were very big.
I took a lot of pictures .
The Tigers began to guide us.
The guide said that there are only 150 tigers in the park , some of them are dead recently .
At many places we saw the marks of their nails but we were sad because they could not see them .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my thought the entire tiger was riding .
Then I remembered an old friend of mine at Haldwani .
I just called him.
I told you I was in Corbett.
He asked me whether I could see a tiger or not .
These words of his fell like a fool .
I said it slowly, no
There was no permission to bring a bike in the park .
Someone advised me to take a ride inside.
