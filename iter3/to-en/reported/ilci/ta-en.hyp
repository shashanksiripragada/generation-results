This journey is very near not only in foreign but also outside Rajasthan to Jaipur .
Tourism interests in itself that whenever the journey draws towards itself then it is a special place , water ship or a rail or a rose garden or a city like Lake Palace of Udaipur .
People are getting attracted due to some special attraction .

Sakipah ' is the estimation of Aman Garden .
There nobody invites you to speak English .
Aman Garden is actually a peaceful place and a tourist place with all the facilities .
This garden is its history and the best thing is that it introduces its nearby areas .
To spend holidays in the best statistics of Rajasthan how many people are surrounding the gardens of flowers , why should one or the other people of Jaipur have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of Aman Garden maximum people of domestic and foreign countries reach there .
I remember that night when Sapna Ashmi had called me with interest but I could not go .
If they reached Pangtok finding out their own way then it is a different kind .
This time at the invitation of my foreign guests I realized that these people want to spend an excellent holiday in a short span of time so that there is a need to go to Aman Garden .
This garden is a separate garden conserved in those seven gardens where Alwar king had gone for hunting .
Its construction was done in the 19th - 20th century .

This is the priceless moment of millions of dollars .
From Aman Garden also the tradition of saying Alvita was valuable and curd gave us the answer .
Now it is known why tourists have come here to spend so much money .
I was told that a tourist group was formed to see the life of the tribe .
Is this right
Definitely this is found in some uninterrupted states and tourism is very interesting in this .
This tourism is generally organised from 4 days to 2 weeks and at this time the tourists are taken to different places .
How to stay there .
This way an attempt is made to do such explanations where there is not much development and there is no preservation of any kind in the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time there are old tourist spots also .
Besides this one also has to give attention to the tridental guidance .
In reality the lifestyle and genetics of that place is visible directly to the tourists who like such tourism .
Though it is a bit difficult to imagine , but such tourism is interesting and gives a different kind of experience .
It 's a lot of fun to travel in the bus .
You can enjoy yourself roaming alone even if you are seen crowded here .
Not only this , during this journey you can take too long to read your favorite book .
Yes , along with spending less and spending all the time , this journey definitely keeps us satisfied .
To celebrate this it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you will be able to see foreign destination buses .
Find a best telescope before taking a ticket .
There is an arrangement for both people to get tickets for stunts , militia , children etc .
Like this it is better to take a pre-packaged journey therefore if the arrangement of tourism is done on the last train then make arrangements for it beforehand .
Instead of traveling give information about routine trips .
The cost of the morning starts decreasing .
It is very important to carry things , therefore listen to the matter of obesity and weight .
You leave some of your things with termilk or you fill them with electromagnetic materials .
Immediately enjoy the pleasure of insurance or loss from the tourism department .
Take cake on packs with convenience .
Because it can be put in a rock above the seat .
During tourism while changing things from bus you should keep in mind that the responsibility of yourself is on your own .
Wherever you have a bus go take that time one hour before .
During the busy season you can keep this thing in the foremost time .
As a matter of fact the sooner you go the better seating system is near you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the convenience .
Take the back portion also more , but it is not easy to read in the front portion .
If you are going to urinate again and again then take a long urge , if you do not want to create much disturbance then it will be better for you to keep a circumstance near the door .
Now there is a tactical thing .
If you are both sitting in a seated seat then first sit in a corner seat and then keep your pack on the other side .
Therefore if there is not much crowd in the bus then your arrangement will be successful .
Therefore if there is facility of vasectomy in the bus then while choosing the ticket keep this thing in mind that it is difficult to sit there after a while .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get sufficient information .
Everybody gets out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not keep yourself on the pit because if it is lost then the people in the crowd will not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stands go for a while .
But if you do not go on time then you can see a new passenger at your place and you will have to wait for another bus terminus .

Every time you will see below the window , beneath the separate settlements of the Maldives , view the Rishenth Island and the Coral Islands in water .
All are so many that there are two blanket companies .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Transmal island is very good in it near which is sea plane .
If you want then you can roam around 4000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- in the air or the entire plane will be left on rent for you throughout the day .
But if you go from Maldives to Udaipur then it is necessary to travel in sea-blane because it is very common to travel between different islands .
And if this is a journey by mind then do not travel in it if there is fear of danger .
The journey of 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres from sea plane takes place in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the most Antique and Sovani markets of the capital of the Ahmadi market of Maldives .
All the salesmen are listening very carefully to the lectures given in the condition of world 's heat in a day before by the king of Maldives , Mr . Mohammad Nath .
I am convinced that no Hindustani has ever heard so much of the lectures of the President or the Prime Minister .
But when this planet gets challenged in the condition of a rare planet then it becomes so terrible .
Some people very well know the magnificence of the people reaching inside the water through the cabinet of Maldives in October because how impossible is the world to get rid of the anger of nature from us .
The beauty there is something like this .
There is no such beautiful monastery in that small country .
After roaming around in the market you can return back to the jetty to go to your guruj and then after paying a glimpse of the compulsory sight seeing in the seafood because the people here know this beautiful surprising boundary .
Below the bright light of Lamp Pongt the fishes swimming in a few metres deep enhance their beauty .
This was a part of the sea which was attached to the city once .
If you see a few centimetres in the water of the river or sea connected with any city of India then you will find happiness in yourself .
On returning to M . . Akvamerin while spending some time in Maldives roaming around in Jagannath for two hours in the evening .
Coral reef -LRB- coral reef -RRB- is the life here .
Till now you will get packed stones and packets of cooked pits .
We were standing outside after some government cabin to hear President Nasik 's speech .
We were in front of the best officer of a country 's residence , there was no security till far because we could not believe it .
Happily we were taking photographs of gardens and paths at a distance of about 50 metres as we stretched our hands inside the terrible gate .
Can you think this by taking home some ordinary head in India
It is said that the president had always come to his office two blocks before crossing the road .
In the matter of Maldives every thing is worth defeating .
That is why I was expecting restlessness the next day .
The day should have been specially fond of fun .
In the morning a boat from Guruji entered our airport to Jalland .
From there we reached the place of Trans Maldives by roaming around in Ranway .
Later in the evening when Guruji was coming out from Maldives then immediately we recognized the blanket moving above .
We were seeing so many maps of him .
But then there was no doubt that the next day there was a chance to pay attention to it .
We had to go to Rangali Island at a distance of 500 kilometres from the sea shore of Trans Maldives .
Canberra was unforgettable with the hundreds of rhinoceros and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the flying club of about 1000 metres .
This beautiful water is not found anywhere .
This is a journey of thrilling and exciting breathing .
But as soon as we reached Hilton Hotel Sin Corbett Resort in Ranchi Island it felt as if we have come to another world .
In such a world outside there was no relation with any other world .
It was difficult to get out of beauty or auspicious life there .
Walking can be done in Konark or can be reached by a battery drive .
On both the sides of the bridge while going from Jetty to the main island it was marvellous .
Now we have not been able to stay natural with the natural beauty of the nearby areas , we have come to an unimaginable place .
We entered a glass room entering the sea water several metres below the stairs which was in the water .
That half was actually a meal room .
All around through miraculous glasses we can see marvellous kinds of small fishes , corals , snow climbing and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on these decorated tables only makes you thrill .
The fare for this island from Malaysia to see and underwater food is 47 thousand rupees per person .
The heart is not able to return from there .
We were ready to float our passport in water .
We know that this is not possible .
We came back with the same belief in mind , sometimes luck comes back at some point .
For a long time there was a plan to go from Delhi to Olives but because of being busy in work this did not happen .
Because of being interested in the wildlife of the child why should not this time go to Jim Corbett
After trekking in Laddakh in 2006 and after trekking till Yegong lake some distance from Karthukala , this was the second packet .
In the early morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the cloak with which we had come out we decreased our speed .
The journey between Haboot and Kaziranga was really tired .
Snow from the top and road from the front .
Several times it appeared as if they were falling .
Once we reached Garjraula at 8 in the morning .
We had come to Ramnagar by 12 o'clock .
Corbett National Park is situated at a distance of 20 kilometres from Ramnagar .
Our resort was on the deck near the park , which we had already registered .
Today there is no special program therefore after getting cold we went to roam on the bank of Kosi .
After two - three hours we went to the Corbett Museum which was very difficult at a distance of two kilometres near the Corbett National Park .
From there we went to see Ramnagar for a long time .
It took us a long time to return .
We were moving ahead from Delhi i . . seeing an injury in the jungle , I got a tiger in a dream all night .
During the dark nights suddenly I heard a loud sound , after that the dogs started screaming and did not stand for two hours .
This is why Kaladungi and Corbett waterfalls first come on the way .
There was a museum of Jim Corbett II in Kala Tunnel , where some information related to personal life was kept .
Museum of Jim Corbett Island in Kaladungi .
It was half past three to return .
Kala Tungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village only .
On reaching the hotel Safari Jeepsy was waiting for our arrival .
He told us that there is arrangement of roaming around in the second site Bijrani there .
When we asked about the number one then because of the presence there the tigers used to come towards it for the protection of the cold .
On reaching Bijrauli we got a guide , which took hundred and fifty rupees to roam around for four hours .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
There many kinds of animals and monkeys were seen .
Inside we saw two tailed elephants , which had long teeth .
I picked up the film by standing.
In the meanwhile , the guide started dragging Phili .
There are about 150 tigers in the park among which some tigers have died in one year .
At many places we saw their footsteps , but I was sorry to see the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain there was a decrease in the number of tigers that was not visible .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I telephoned him.
I told him I had come to Corbett .
He asked me if I had seen the tiger .
His words ran like arrows .
I wasn't slow.
There is no permission to take a pack in the park .
One told us that take a chopper to go inside .
