Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side there is a mixture of both the directions and on the other side in Gujarati language as well .
This is called ' kachhi ' .
Though it is ' word ' , it does not have its own original form .
If you have to write something then you have to write in Gujarati tradition .

The tourism industry believed to be the main base of Rajasthan 's architecture is passing through these two worst distances .
Due to global recession and rising threats in South Asia the enterprise of tourism has deepened .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan from the major states of the country has been decreased significantly during these days .
Fresh statistics released recently by the Rajasthan government say that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than ten percent as compared to 2008 .
According to the statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 in Rajasthan a total of two crore 98 lakh 364 thousand 564 tourists came out of which two crore 83 thousand 918 thousand 918 thousand and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 thousand foreign tourists were included , whereas during 2009 a total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand and 105 thousand tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 25558691 national and 1073414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
The author of Rajputana - Haveli Mcleodganj , Sanjay Kushkosh , says that accidents of world recession and poverty have affected tourism badly .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we can not even prepare the strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decrease of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
The tourists of France are the most among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan .
After this the tourists of Britain , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism the present year is the best option for Rajasthan .
After the year 2000 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , havelis , forts , fences , jungles , all are the same old for attracting tourists .
In the area of tourism all governments do increase in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done on that side .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists the recent years of enjoyment and exile in Rajasthan has also kept the importance of this state on an international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in the state but it remained contiguous with papers only .
Rajasthan Tourism is an example of the success of Rajasthan government in terms of tourism -LRB- RTC -RRB- .
In order to encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the basic infrastructure of tourism Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides the facility of lodging , commuting , boating etc . for the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three dharamshalas , one dharamshala , one dharamshala and two dharamshalas on wheels and Royalrajsthana on wheels are made but the condition of this corporation has remained thin for many years .
In 2009 - 2008 the climate of RTDC was 185 lakh , whose year 2009 - 2009 is expected to be 632 lakh .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that even 40 percent of its hotels could not be filled in the last five years .
Along with the hotels other factories of the corporation are also bringing it in a big way .
Among these the major ones are the Royal Rajasthan of the Hills .
Tourists do not get attracted towards this train .
Despite losing their fares they did not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years a reduction has been seen in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 to 2007 in this fair where 398 uninterrupted national tourists stayed in the tourist villages made by RTDC this year the number decreased to 217 .
In the midst of all this the thing worth seeing for RTDC is that there is no dearth of tourists towards the Palace on Wheels i . . the royal train .
This train is continuously availing the benefits .
Last year from this train RTDC got a profit of Rs . 9 and a half crore .
Worries of anxiety are seen in the field of tourism from this fall in the area of tourism in Rajasthan under the category of tourism .
Tourism is the biggest base of the demands of Rajasthan .

During the reign of the Chetia kings in the mountains of north and south had accepted this goddess far and wide .
The tribes here used to worship the goddess .
Human sacrifice was also given here due to which later on King Guru Nath Singh had stopped .
Some other treasures have been found in the Loht district of Arunachal .

With their hard work the muscular people have made it their heaven .
Here there is abundance of rice cultivation .
This place is the treasure of rice .
Ten miles long this plateau is a living example of his labour and farming .
Its climate is very cold .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the slightest redness emerging in the sky on the summit just in the middle of the snow covered mountain ranges of the left hand .
It is very cold in the air .
Along with the cool breeze breeze breeze also gives the impression of moisture .
The sound of raw raw raw raw below the legs is seen on the layer of scalp on the wooden floor .
There is moisture in the atmosphere and nothing is visible because of the darkness before sunrise .
The sights remain on the redness of the east .
One feels like sitting on a bench lying in a balcony .
As soon as the hand touches the smooth layer of the spinal cord rubs with the sound of a mild crank and the hand separates from the shock of the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of the life of Switzerland to come and spend the night in this small village settled amidst these mountains .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this spent most of the time in Geneva or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both the sides of the thin and fertile river is spread till very high on the slopes .
This is the valley of the main river of Switzerland Rhone on both the sides of which several small and big cities are settled .
The perfect road of the Ron river and the Ringti vehicles have begun to be clearly visible on it .
Half an hour journey from a distance of 300 kilometres and a half an hour journey through car is found in the deserted and near the city named Rani river Montoro which is known as French -LRB- Lakulima -RRB- along with half the river of Geneva .
300 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide is situated Geneva city at the western end of this lake .
From there the lake then moves towards the west after becoming a river .
On the right side are the mountain ranges of Dhaul , Alps touching the sky .
Crossing the city through a beautiful valley named Leuk -LRB- Leuk -RRB- we leave this highway on the left side , reach the north side on the mountainous path .
Because of the slope of the mountain being towards the south the evening sun is giving complete sunshine to the corner .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less , almost equal .
Life moves towards height , amount of snow starts increasing .
There is no special cold in the air due to clear sky and bright sun on both the sides of the road despite having a good ice accumulated .
After covering a journey of about 20 kilometres on this roaming hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal .
Challet - slopy roofs are very large and many storied bungalows made of wood .
In the basement made of cement concrete of this bungalow of three storeys there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , londery etc . along with the parking of vehicles .
Wildlife is famous for grapes farming in Switzerland .
This is the main center of making wine -LRB- wine -RRB- .
On 37  land part of the entire cantonment there is cultivation of grapes .
The gardens of grapes in the village based on both the sides of the Ron Valley enhance the beauty there .
Take the gardens of grapes -LRB- lineards -RRB- , take them to rest in the village there at night and take them to the liquor shops -LRB- chewing -RRB- is an integral part of the tourist beauty here .
There is a very big museum of grapes built in the 12th century in a small town named Aizawl to see which foreign tourists have to first book the booking .
Once again we cross the midst of deserted jungle .
Mind gets worse by the pungent questions of children throughout the road up to three - four kilometres .
Suddenly a thrilling and charming change comes in sight on a turn .
Right in front , on the left side of the road on the slope of the deep valley a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in the snow on the slopes of the Spot from the top of the village .
The dense forest of cedar is spread till the peak of the Upper mountain from the skiing slope .
Snow is frozen all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are sparkling because of the fall of the direct sun rays .
In five minutes we reach Us village .
Here also the same crowd is spread .
All around from the top of the mountain till the bottom of the valley is the rule of slopy snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a large roundabout beach in the middle of this town .
The name of the town is Leukerbad .
The population of Laukarbad located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level is about 1500 .
It can be estimated from the number of tourists , acquaintances and treatment workers coming here can estimate that there are 1700 apartments of 6900 beds and 28 hotels for staying in Shellets -LRB- 1500 -RRB- , camping site of tents , 90 bed centres and 50 restaurants .

Reaching the village one gets the feeling of complete heat .
The thick layer of snow on the roof of house is sparkling in the bright bright sunshine .
Albenin -LRB- Albenin -RRB- is the name of this village .
Albanian village is one of the conserved places in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that in Sikkim the taxis of surf simultaneously can be run hence there is no checking .
The journey is on , but the hill is the same , the trees are the same , the herbs are same , the herbs are same .
The moisture present in the whole body is the same .
The season of rains is that very season .
As soon as the program of Darjeeling journey was completed the decision to take care of Kurseing was first taken .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
It was filled with tea gardens and was filled with the jungles of sun .
Famous for production of high tea .
Moving towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , at the beginning itself tea gardens welcome the adventurous people towards itself .
Passing through the road in the middle of the tea gardens attracts the heart in the very first time .
On one side green mountains lying filled with jungles , on the other side deep green trench .
Sometimes the jungles here and there sometimes tea gardens were visible .
On four sides was the reign of greenery .
Once upon a time greenery has grown , on seeing these natural forests and plants of tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful forest was , the more beautiful is the tea garden spread far and wide .
If one glances on the roads on the roads then one feels strange .
The movement of the snake was getting twisted and narrow .
Time was also passing .
It was not passing , then forest and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From far off a mountainous house - house etc . appeared very dense .
This was Kursingh .
After staying here at one place we made a program to roam around the whole day .
After taking a vehicle we set out on a tour of Kursing .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles on all the four sides .
Approximately to reach till the deer park the vehicle had to leave very low .
Despite being enchanted with the beauty of Karsingh I have not yet been able to develop as a tourist destination .
Although the city is very high and clean .
Despite the road being deserted the lure of reaching till the deer park surrounded by jungles and the chance of climbing the road between the sunshine trees was making us comfortable .
The next place was England Creek .
This is a point situated at the height of the other side of the city .
It is also called Swiss side point .
It is said that during the time of the British people used to live by jumping from here .
At present it is decorated with a garden and a restaurant .
There is a staircase here , with the height of which a beautiful view of the whole city comes in front .
In the tea gardens nearby women were busy breaking the tea gardens with very speed carrying sticks on their backs .
There is a museum outside of Kursing city , but that day we could not go there , because it was more necessary to tour the charming environment of tea gardens .
Next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
This was a charming experience in itself , but there was a lot of anxiety about it that how would we roam if it rained
But the thrill was very excited that on reaching Rock Garden we enjoyed playing sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The way to reach here is even more attractive than this .
On going a little further down from here we got ghera ghera ghera from the mountains .
Here amidst rocks the mirror of waterfalls is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we found that in the reign of pits and rocks the waterfalls are iron then in Gangamaya the reservoir of waterfalls is decorated with stones worldwide .
At both of these places the ruins of the mountains of Darjeeling are very low .
We saw Baisia loop in Darjeeling by climbing up with the help of a vehicle .
From here the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen through the medium of Durban .
The nature of the weather was till now conscious .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , where did the road come down and swinging .
In the evening program of roaming and shopping on the mall road was made .
In the tour of Darjeeling tourists get to spend their holidays in the tour .
The journey of tour from Darjeeling to Darjeeling and from Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
There is a bit of rest in boating and gardens in the Manak lake .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where sweaters etc . made by the hand of Nepali artisans are found .
The facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also there .
Kalimpong is the only city of Darjeeling district , but its shape is different .
Here not the greenery of tea gardens but the habitation of forests and waterfalls is happening .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Lava and Lolegaon , which is filled with jungle waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not find Kalimpong this time .
We had just come to Darjeeling from Kolkata , on a tour of Darjeeling in the shade of winter , but the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling tied me with itself .
A small journey of my recent past was very interesting and intimate .
This journey was of no foreign country and not of external Rajasthan but of very close proximity to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting fact in itself , in which sometimes it takes a journey towards itself , in which some special place , ship of water or some royal train or some city like Pink City or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people start pulling .
The place where I am going to talk , that is just prepared four and a half years ago , but with the plan with which this place has come here , it has really turned into a jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
In my ears my guide resonates with Rambabumana , but before that we could not even think that we could live like this in the jungle .
50 percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work in the heritage hotel as well .
Rambabu the resident of Kathgodam used to work in Jaipur before this and now in this magnificent royal garden .
He has embraced his own personality in a new color .
This is the style of the peaceful garden .
Nobody calls you English there .
Shanti Bagh in reality is a peaceful , peaceful and comfortable tourist place .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it will engulf you from the region nearby .
How many people among the people living in the royal style of Rajasthan will have to go for a tour of Bhangra . Go away , among the people of Jaipur perhaps one may have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of the peace garden large people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night as well when Afghan had called me with his heart there but I could not go there .
It is a different matter that he had himself gone after wandering in the path .
This time when suddenly I reached there at the invitation of my foreign guests , then it felt that those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Peace Garden .
This garden is a garden saved from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in sixteen hundred years .
Its old wall is witness of these days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of peace garden draws you .
As soon as you enter inside , the way you are adjusted , it seems that a lot of attention has been paid to the spiritual peace here .
Along with the tying of pearls in the pearls the pearls of Mangalore are kept alive .
We had reached the slope in the evening and we made a plan to plant this garden .
My wife J . . , who is a decorator , all of a sudden speaking , is interesting .
Everyone is impressed with havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . It was not surprising that Shanti Bagh had received a presentation as well .
The manager organised our program for getting ready in the morning .
First of all a stroll on foot with Rambabu and then a journey of the jeep of Bhangra .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Aurangabad on which the light of the sun was expanding gradually .
We saw dry lakes in which farmers were farming .
This year it did not rain but for the first time a farm of tobacco was seen .
For Jaiki there was such a unique experience of the life of the village .
After this we reached Bhangra from the jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist from Holland in deep meditation .
This is a valuable moment of millions of dollars .
The way to say goodbye to the peaceful gardens is also traditional thunder and by opening curd they made us bid .
Now I understood why the tourists come here after spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept for showing Tribal Life .
Is it right .
Not only this , but it happens in many states and tourists also show special interest in them .
Generally these tourists are prepared for two weeks from four days to two days and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In it stale , food etc . are also included .
This way an attempt is made to face such places , where there is not much development and where there is no significant effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this where old tourist sites etc . are also present .
Besides this paying attention is also given on doing tridental consciousness .
Actually the aim of such tourism is to make the tourists aware of the ways and means of living of this place .
Although it seems a bit difficult to think , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own joy .
Despite having a lot of people with it you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to destruct your favorite book .
Yes , it is very important that along with giving less expense and peaceful time this tour will definitely take pleasure from you .
This is the reason that for enjoying them it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching any other national destination bus terminus .
Find a best deal before taking a ticket .
Scientists , senior citizens of malaria , children etc get discount on them , then there is a range of discounts for two people as well .
However , buying tickets in advance is cheap , so it is better to take a bus tour in the last moments so that you can do a little while before drinking .
Instead of two wheelers get to know about round trips .
This falls cheap .
The processes taking bags are very tough , therefore ignore the size and weight of the goods .
It should not be such that you have to leave some of your things on the terminal or you have to pay a different fee .
Also enquire about the compensatory aspects of insurance or loss from tourism company .
Caribbean bags stay right , take them away .
Because they come properly in the rake above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of the luggage will be on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During adventurous season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better the choice will be with you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind comfortable .
If the shock is more on the seat then the seat on the front seat is not comfortable .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be overwhelmed , then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now there is a trick .
If you are both in the clutches of palm then sit on the edge of the corner and keep your bag on the other .
If there is not much crowd in bus then planning will be successful .
If there is convenience in bus , then while enjoying seat keep this thing in mind as well , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make identification by bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus all are asked to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its grave the bus drivers do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops go back on time .
If you do not come on time , then at your place you can find a new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

In the middle of Pampri industrial area and at a place named Wakkad situated on Pune - Bangalore highway the donor hotels built at a place named Wikad are equipped with all modern facilities .
The neighbouring state of Maharashtra Goa is laced with its beautiful sea shores and different water sports , which is like a heaven for tourists where from the tour of ancient church one gets to see the grandeur of ancient times .
Situated in the capital of Goa , Panijar Hotel , Ginger Hotel makes this journey of the western shore excellent .
Skiing on Goa ' s roads , river cruise , cold sea climate and enjoying the world famous Goan food is the best option to spend comfortable days here .
If seen in the history of today then the cheapest person for Maldives is Rs . 28 , 000 per person .
After this if you stay in Mala then you can find hotels on a little fare but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the actual beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be small .
Screens are proved to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Loui cruise from Kochi started the single series of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European company and is a very popular village in Cruise and Hotel Bepar .
Although because of some problems Louis cruise has stopped its services till now , but its coverage is expected to start from October .
At least 5850 rupees per person can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at the cost of every night at an upper ship of Lois Cruise .
That is , for three days the fare of a person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two years are old then the child below the age of 15 years is absolutely free .
And what should be done
Tea , food etc . are included in the cruise fares .
With the entertainment of all the time .
Reaching the capital Mall , you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Malldev according to your pocket - from seaplane riding to the international level .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly appears in front of you in a sapling then you will feel like toying .
But with 12 - 15 seats it is excellent for touring Archipeligue -LRB- Mall jewellery -RRB- like Tunotripline Maldeo .
Running like a speed boat on the surface of water it does not come to know when it gets up in the air .
In the entire flight you do not have the idea of the flight of ordinary aeroplanes .
Every time your shops keep floating on the windows - the blue waters of different shades of Maldives keeping an eye on the reserve islands and coral islands .
How clear everything looks .
There are only two sapling companies in Maldives .
Transplant goddess is one of them with 20 saplings .
If you want then you can take a flight of approximately a thousand rupees -LRB- every hour -RRB- or you can take the entire sea plane on rent for your day long -LRB- without charge pocket -RRB- .
If you go to any island away from Mala Island then a journey of sailion will be necessary because this is the only way to travel amidst various islands .
And that is such a journey whose desire to finish is probably not yours .
The journey from 12 k . . to 183 k . . -LRB- excellent Mavilivaro -RRB- of the islands of Maldives takes place .
We were in the biggest antique and square shop of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Malaysia .
All the salesmen were listening very carefully to the information given in Copenhagen -LRB- Copenhagen -RRB- by the chief minister of Maldives one day before .
Saying sincerely I have not seen any Indian listening to any president or chief minister with so much detail .
But when it was the question of the existence of a rare creation of that period then it was so essential .
Many people might have understood the destruction of the water collected inside by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but Maldives might have gone to know how bad the world would be if the natural disaster had taken it away from us .
There is something special in its beauty .
Such beauty does not absorb in this small country .
From this journey of the market going back to its cruise while moving towards Jetty , when suddenly the waves moved in the sea along with the road then it felt as if the people here understand the value of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of leopard fishes floating in depths of several metres were seen all along with their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely settled with the city .
If you can see some centimetres clean in the water of the sea or river attached to any city of India then you will be able to get yourself lucky .
The evening spent in Malaysia while returning to the EMV were roaming in meditation for two hours .
Coral reef -LRB- Mungachatnas -RRB- is the life here .
You will also find pearls on the stones attached to the graves here .
We were standing outside their official residence a few moments before listening to the wishes of President Nasser .
We did n't believe that far ahead of the excellent residence of any country there was no security worker .
Interestingly we were pulling the gardens and fountains merely 50 metres away by expanding our hands inside the gates of its bungalows .
Can you think this about the house of any magnificent leader of India
When we got to know that the chief minister sometimes crossing the road on foot and two blocks reach his office ahead .
Everything was surprising about Maldeo .
That is why I was waiting for the next day unnecessarily .
Alam was that day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat took us to Airport Island from Cruise .
From there we reached on the base of Maldevi while crossing the circuit of the ropeway .
Next evening when the cruise was reaching near the Mall , we immediately recognized the slippers passing from above .
Such a picture which was seen by him .
But then there was no guarantee that the next day there would be a chance of a ride in it .
We were about to go to Rangali Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the saplings of the Transplant Devon .
Seeing hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives was unforgettable .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a romantic and emotional breath-taking flight .
But on reaching Rangli Island by the corner of Hulton Hotel it felt as if we have reached in some other world .
In such a world , outside of which there was no dearth of any world .
It was not even like this that it was difficult to get the beauty out of there as well .
Whether a stroll can be done on foot on Konark or by a train running from a battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was unique .
Now we could not even preserve ourselves from the surrounding nature , had reached such a place , had become unimportant .
After getting down at sea water several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
Across all directions we could see strange kinds of small fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving people .
There the thought of eating while sitting on sweet mess was to give a lot of interest in itself .
The fare of visiting this island on the sea plane coming from Malaysia and doing underwater lunch is 47 thousand rupees for a person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to float in our passport water .
But they knew that it was not possible .
With a heavy heart we returned with such hope that at some time or the other we will surely take a turn here .
Since many days there were plans to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
Wildlife was fond of childhood then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 in Laddakh this was the second bike tour after the biking of Bagdoong lake ahead of Khurdungla pass .
In the morning of 27 December we set out for simple jammer beat , but the passion that had come out of the miracles , we communicated our speed .
The journey between Hapad and Gajraula was really tired .
From Upper to Kira and in front of bad roads .
Many times it felt that now it has fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula in the morning at 8 o'clock .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Near our reservoir park was in Dhakali , which we had already got booked .
This day there was no special program but despite being cold we went to roam on the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we left for Corbett Museum which was near Dhangdi Gate 2 kilometres away from difficulty .
From there we went to roam around Ramnagar .
It was late evening while returning .
I was stunned to see the lions roaming free in the jungle so that I could see the tiger in a dream all night .
Between the depths of the night suddenly I heard a lot of curse and after that which the dogs began to bury then they did not stop for two hours .
Therefore the advice of black pepper and carbonate foil was received first .
Kaladangi is 30 kilometres away while on the way to Corbett National Park it falls .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett National Park in Kaladangi , where some important items related to their life are kept .
Returning we went for 12 and a half hours .
Kaladangi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled in this village .
On reaching the resort Safari Jupsi was exhibiting us .
It was told that he has made an arrangement of sitting in the number one seat journal there .
Number one on asking said that Greeceland is more there and Tigers come towards it to prevent cold .
On reaching Bajrani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We set out for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we had two tusked elephant spears , which had long teeth .
I got stuck and photographed .
In this beach guide started trekking for tiger .
Guide told that in the park there are around 150 tigers , out of which only some have died .
At many places we also got to see the marks of their claws , but due to the lack of sight of the tiger we were excited .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain there was a guide of tiger .
Then Mughal Emperor Haldwani remembered his old friend .
I started calling him the same .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
He did n't see the tiger asking .
Its plateau was engraved like a sword .
I told you gradually .
There was no permission to take back bags in the park .
Somebody gave us a suggestion for the safari.
