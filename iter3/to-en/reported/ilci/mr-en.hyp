Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch is Sindh and on the other hand there is a mixture of both in Gujarat as well .
It is called ' kutchi ' .
As such this is a dialect , this is not its own script .
If Kutch is to be written then it has to be written in Gujarati script .
Anjar is just near Bhuj , where many times the earthquake has occurred and the entire city has collapsed .
Near Anjar only is the monument of Jaisalmer .
The talk of Jaisalmer is very interesting .
If you come to Maghari from the road ways on which you had come then you will have to take a full month 's holiday and there you will start school in Mumbai .
So what to do  Come now let us travel by train by making the fast trains of Gujarat Ram .
The small railway of metre gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there one more small railway of meter gauge reaches Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad to Broad gauge rail line reaches Mumbai .
Tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through bad situation these days .
Due to world recession and the danger of rising terror in South Asia tourism has become a serious blow to business .
With regard to tourism a special decrease has been registered in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan from the major states of the country these days .
According to the figures released recently by the Rajasthan government , the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent as compared to 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 26 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in 2008 in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas in 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 619 national and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , the director of Rajput Holiday Makers has said that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have adversely affected tourism business .
Compared to other countries of Asia we could not even develop the strong infrastructure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism the past few years have proved to be good for Rajasthan .
This is the first time after 2002 when there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert -LRB- desert -RRB- , havelis , forts , bawari forest all are old to see the tourists .
In the area of tourism all the governments do big things regarding rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism but nothing can be done in this regard .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time due to the incidents of the expulsion and expulsion of foreign lady tourists this state has been spotted internationally .
Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in this state for a long time but it was limited to papers only .
Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government in terms of tourism .
Rajasthan government had established RTDC in the year 1979 with the aim of increasing tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic form of tourism .
This institute provides facilities like residence , food , communication , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 divisions of this institute .
In which 29 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one communication component and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels , but for some years the situation of this institution has also worsened .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was 185 lakh which is expected to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels in this conglomerate is that even 40 percent of its hotels did not have rooms in the last five years .
Along with hotels other factors of the organization are also harming it .
The main among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not get attraction for this train .
Even after reducing the fare this was not able to attract tourists .
In the same way in the present year innumerable fairs have become popular among the tourists .
In 2007 - 08 the tourist village built by RTDC in this fair where 398 foreign tourists had stayed , this year it has reduced to 217 .
One thing that gives satisfaction to this RTDC was that there was no dearth of tourists in the attraction of Palace on Wheels i . . for royal fire .
This fire engine is beneficial .
Last year RTDC benefited from this train at a rate of nine and a half crores .
Coming in the area of tourism in Rajasthan the environment of anxiety in this slow environment of tourism is natural .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If a person has a desire to do something then he can bring gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has fulfilled this fact by establishing modern city Ambo ball in the range of Sahyadri mountains of Maharashtra .
The dreams that they had dreamt of seeing them progressing day by day are filled with joy in their eyes .
His joy was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley was successful in building its own place in the form of a unique city .
In this city spread in an area of more than 10 , 000 acres there are hotels , houses and other facilities on only 9  land .
91 percent land has been provided with trees , ponds , groundnuts and other facilities .
Several industrialists came forward to make their house in this city made for crores of rupees and today there are around 800 families in this city .
Initially the entrepreneurs and the Sri Lankans bought their Asia in the form of holiday homes but now they have made it their home and they also go to Mumbai for work .
Behind the Ambe Valley itself is the fort of Koyarigarh which enhances the beauty of this region .
The ruins of Likawali in West Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found while digging .
On the stone pillars of this temple the carvings of lotus and statues of gods - goddesses are engraved which is in very dilapidated condition .
Malini Thaan is an important place of this very part .
On this spot a decorated idol of Durga Devi is engraved .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet tales and ancient tales are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still present in the glorious saga of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamraeshwari goddess achieved in this ruin is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the glory of Goddess Tamreshwari is described .
During the reign of Chetia this goddess was far away in the mountains north - east .
The people of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
Humans were also killed here which was later stopped by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
They are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is situated in the middle of the Dibang and Divang rivers .
According to the popular scriptures here this place is only an old description , where once King Bhishmak ruled .
Brahmakund is in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of the Lohit district .
Diguru , Mishmi etc . here guide the travellers .
These people themselves have great faith in this Kunda .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kunda .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned relics mentioned in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal , the remains of roaming in Diwang - Glacier district are also historically important .
The ruins of the lakes of bricks near roaming are telling their story even today .
The ruins of bathing , being surrounded with pucca lives and other lakes all around and the remains of wide roads are still singing silent songs of our ancient grand legend .
We reach ero in four hours by jeep from the upper Assam city of North Lakhimpur .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
This pleasant mountain place at a height of approximately 4500 feet attracts the hearts of the travellers .
This is that charming place where people of Aptani community live .
It takes several days for the jeep to reach here before becoming a road .
On reaching here the views of high - high cedar trees , beautiful premrose , vaolet , wild current , strawberries and rasberries overwhelm the tourists .
Apple and aloe buffaloes are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the people of Apatani .
With its untiring hard work the Aptani people have made it their heaven .
Farming of rice is done a lot here .
This place is the treasure of rice .
Ten miles long this is a living example of the hard work and skill of the mountaineers .
The requirement of irrigation of black rivers is fulfilled .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the slight redness emanating from the sky on the horizon in the middle of the queues of the snow laden hill of the left hand .
It is very cold in the air .
Along with the cool breeze that touches the environment one also gets the feeling of wetness .
The sound of litter below the legs is seen on the layer of the leaves lying on the wooden floor .
There is dullness in the atmosphere and because of the spread of sunrise there was nothing more to be seen .
The vision is focussed on the redness of the east .
I felt like sitting in a bench in Balcony .
As soon as the handles falls , the layer of snow slides with a slight sound and the hands slide in a moment after feeling cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of the life of Switzerland coming in this small village settled amidst these mountains covered with snow .
This is my third trip to Swiss .
Before this a lot of time was spent in Geneva or around it .
Dat village based on both the sides of the Balakti river in the valley is spread on a slight slope .
This is the main river of Switzerland Rhone , on both the sides of which several small towns are settled .
The highways along the Ron river and the cars running on them are clearly visible .
300 kms away and a journey of two and a half hours in Karni a half way along the Jeneva lake and half a roan river coming from the east side near the city named Montreux which is called Lec Lemon in French -LRB- Lock Lemon -RRB- .
Geneva city is located at the western end of this 100 kms long and 10 kms wide lake .
From there the lake again becomes a river and moves westwards .
On the right side beyond the lake are mountain ranges of Dhawal , skyscrapers .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Leuke we left -LRB- exit -RRB- on this highway , comes on the northern hilly road .
Due to being the slope of the mountain in southern direction the sun is giving it a lot of thrill .
Amount of ice is less than the valley here - almost not with it .
As we move towards height , the density of snow has started increasing .
There is no special coolness in the air due to the clear sky and shining sun on both sides of the road even when good snow is frozen .
After covering a journey of about 20 kms on this circular hill juice in half an hour we reached a small village named Thel .
Chalet -LRB- Chalet -RRB- - Located roof , completely made of wood are big multi-storied bungalows .
In the basement built by the cement concrete of this three storey bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , laundry etc . along with the parking of cars .
Valaya is famous for grapes farming in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making grapes .
37 percent land of the whole of Cantonment is cultivated by grapes .
The gardens of grapes in the villages located on both the sides of the Ron Valley provide a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking the bundles of wineyards , roaming around them , resting in the night in the villages there and taking them to the grapes shopping in the wine testing are the integral parts of tourism business here .
In a small town named Aighle there is a big museum of wine made of grapes in a small fort built in 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to register .
Once again we people descend from the same forest deserted from Dawanal .
Mind becomes even more distressed by the question of reading children throughout the road up to three - four kms .
Suddenly dramatic and charming changes come in a sight at one turn .
Right in front , on the left side of the road on the slope of the deep gorge a beautiful group of houses is located .
People are skiing in the snow on the flat slopes situated in the upper part of the village .
The dense forest of cedar is spread till the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
There is frozen snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the village are shining because of the fall of the direct rays of the sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also the same peace is spread .
All around from the peak of the mountain till the valley there is the empire of white snow .
Within the next five minutes you reach a largeround RDF aboout in the middle of that pocket .
The name of Kasba is Leukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Luckerabad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and healthy people coming here can be estimated from this fact that there are 1700 bedded and chalets -LRB- 1500 bedded -RRB- , 28 hotels , camping site of tents , 90 bedded health center and 50 restaurants here .
65 sources of hot water have been found till now in Luckerabad .

A huge layer of snow is shining on the roofs of houses in the happy sun of Kovalam .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the places found in the form of national importance heritage in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim 's taxis , therefore checking is not done .
The journey is on , whether it is on the other side , but the mountain is the same , the trees are on the other side , the thrilling air is the same .
The weight of flying shivering on the whole body is that alone .
In the season of monsoon there is plenty of humidity .
As soon as the plan for Darjeeling journey was fixed it was decided to take a glimpse of Kurseong .
Kurseong is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea estates , full of smoke .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If we move ahead from Siliguri towards Darjeeling then the tea gardens spread in the beginning welcome the tourists coming here .
Going through the road going through the tea gardens charms the heart for the first time .
On one side is the green mountain filled with jungles , while on the other is a deep green valley .
Sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens are visible here .
There was an empire of greenery all around .
Once I went missing to see these natural jungles seeing tea plantations made by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful jungles the more beautiful are the tea gardens spread far and wide .
If there is an eye sight on the roads then the creation looks marvellous .
The path of circular and circular paths like the snake charmer was moving ahead .
Time was also spent .
If it was not finished then it was forest and tea garden .
At times small settlements were visible .
From a distance a mountainous house etc . appeared very dense from a distance .
This was Kurseong .
Staying here at one place we made a program to tour the whole day .
That is why we set out on a tour of Kurseong with a train .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests on all the four sides .
To reach up to the deer park the vehicle has to be left very low .
Even though Kurseong is full of beauty it has not been able to develop - become famous in the form of tourism .
While the city is very good and clean .
Despite the road being deserted the joy of reaching till the deer park surrounded by forests and the joy of climbing the road through the smoke trees was giving us the adventure .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
On the other side of this city located at a height is a Point .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to die by jumping from here .
At present there is a park and hotel here .
Here is a genetic dome , from whose height a beautiful view of the whole city is created by observing .
In the tea gardens around the lady 's back was immersed in tea gardens , dressing fast , dressing very fast .
There is a museum outside of Kurseong city but that day we could not go there because it was more necessary to roam around in the deserted environment of tea gardens .
The next day it is certain to roam Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself but it was a bigger concern than this that if it was raining then how would we roam .
But coincidence was very good that on reaching Rock Garden we enjoyed the bright enjoyment of the sun .
This park is a very attractive place with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
On going a little below from here we found the Ganges surrounded by mountains .
The beauty of the waterfalls located in the rocks here is worth seeing .
We found in Rock Garden that waterfalls are very beautiful in the empire of rocks and rocks here , while the queen of waterfalls in Ganga Maa is immersed in rocks .
Both of these places are located very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Batasia loop in Darjeeling rising up with the help of a train .
From here the whole of the hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen through binoculars .
The waves of the weather were clean till now .
But as we went towards the monastery we did n't know where it was and we started spooning .
In the evening plans were made for roaming and shopping on the mall road .
In the tour of Darjeeling toy train enhances the beauty of the journey .
The toy train from Darjeeling to Ghum and from Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in the Egyptian lakes and hustle-bustle in the park here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar on the same route , where sweaters etc . weaved by Nepali artisans are found .
There is also an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district though its shape - colour is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here , but there is abundance of forest - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Apo and Lolegaon , which is full of forest - waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had just come to Darjeeling from Kolkata . had to tour Darjeeling in the shadow of winters but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling have kept me tied here .
My present small journey was very attractive and thrilling .
This journey was neither of foreign nor of external Rajasthan but very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an attractive subject in itself in which sometimes the journey attracts towards itself , sometimes be it a special place , ship of water or some royal train or some city like a pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
People get attracted due to some special attraction .
The place I will talk about is only prepared four and a half years ago , but the preparation with which this place has come there has really done the welfare of the jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
My guide Ram Babu roams in my ears , Sahiba could not even imagine before this that we could stay in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work in heritage hotels as well .
Ajabgarh resident Ram Babu used to work in Jaipur before and now it is in the Aman Garden of this unique royal style .
He brought his words in a new color .
Sahiba ' is an ideal place for peace .
There nobody speaks to you in English instruction .
Aman garden is really a picnic spot with peaceful and comfortable comfort .
That garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduced us to the surrounding region as well .
In the royal style of Rajasthan , how many people must have traveled to Bhangarh of Bhutan .
After the opening of Aman Garden big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I still remember that night when Shabana Azmi had spoken to me there heartily but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he had himself gone to Bhangarh leaving behind .
This time when suddenly I reached there with the help of my foreign traveller then it felt as if people want to spend a good holiday in a short span of time then they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden of those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to hunt for hunting .
Its construction was done in the eighteenth century .
Its old wall is the witness of those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of peace garden attracts you .
The way you come in , the way you are welcomed , it feels that divine peace has been paid attention here .
Along with original buildings the Mangala Mantra is lively pronounced .
We had reached after evening and decided to kill that garden .
My host Jackie , who is an architect , said very easily , it is attractive .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . It was not surprising that Aman Bag has got the award as well .
The administrator fixed our program for the morning .
First of all walked with Ram Babu and then jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on the narrow roads we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the rays of the sun used to spread gradually .
We saw dry lakes in which the farmers were farming .
This year it did not rain but for the first time we saw the farming of tobacco .
Such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience for Jackie .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in meditation .
These are million dollars invaluable moments .
The way to clean Aman Garden was also traditional , by giving us rose and curd food they gave us a breakfast .
Now it has been seen why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard that bird sanctuary packages are kept on watching the life of tribes .
Is this right
Undoubtedly and not only this happens in many states and tourists also show special interest in it .
This tour is generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It includes staying there , food etc .
This way an attempt is made to discover such a place where there has not been much development and where there has not been any effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
On that very day where old tourist spots etc . are also present .
Besides this , attention is also given on doing all the tridial quizines .
Actually , the aim of such tours was to make the tourists aware of the ways and traditions of living in that place .
Although this idea looks a bit difficult but such tours are really attractive and give a different kind of experience .
The bus journey has its own fun .
With this you can also take the pleasure of roaming alone despite being with many people .
Not only this , in this journey you can give more time without interrupting your favorite book .
Yes , it is very important that along with giving less expense and comfortably a lot of time these tours definitely keep a desire for patience from you .
This is the reason that for enjoying these it is important to keep in mind some things , especially when you see a foreign place with the help of bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , militia senators , children and others get a suit on these , while there is arrangement of giving suit to two people as well .
As such buying advanced tickets is cheaper , therefore in the last moment do make plans for bus journey as soon as possible .
Instead of two wheelers get information about round trips .
These are cheap .
Rules regarding bagge are specially strict , therefore ponder over the shape and weight of the luggage .
Never happen that you will have to leave some of your things on the terminal or you will have to pay more .
Also understand the rules of insurance or damages compensation from the tourism company .
Carry on bags are appropriate , take them .
Because they sit together in the rack above this seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of luggage is on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During busy season you should pay special attention to these things .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better the option of seat will be with you .
Keep in mind whether it is comfortable while choosing the seat .
On the back seat if the heart will be more restless , then there will not be any conferment to the next seat .
If you have to go to the toilet continuously , then take the seat of the elbow and if you do not like excessive obstruction then the window seat will be good for you .
Now it is a matter of a quarter .
If you are both thinking of making a mistake then first sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other seat .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then the plan will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then while choosing the seat keep in mind this thing as well , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make the identity of bus driver and conductor .
So you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat , because they do not take the responsibility of sitting down .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come in time then you can get your place from another person and you will have to wait for the bus .

Situated in the capital of Goa , Panaji , Ginger Hotel excells in this journey of the western shore .
To spend a lot of enjoyment of cycling , river cruise , cold seashore and world famous Goan food on the way to Goa , the Ginger Hotel located here is an excellent option .
If seen on today 's day then for Maldives the fare of returning to every cheapest person from Delhi is 28 thousand rupees .
After that even if you stay in Malaysia you can get hotels at a little lesser rate but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then it will be very small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial .
In the first week of December Louis Cruise from Kochi started the only cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although because of some obstacles Louis Cruise has postponed his service now , but it is likely to start again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at a rate of at least Rs . 5850 per person on Louis Cruise ship M . . . Aquarine .
That is the fare of a person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two grow older then completely free for children less than 15 years of age .
What should be done more .
Tea , breakfast , food etc . are included in the cruise fares .
With the entertainment of every time .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives with the help of your pocket - from sea plane to underwater lunch .
While flying in big airplanes suddenly stand in front of you a sea plane then you will feel like playing .
But this twelve - fifteen seat plane Maldives is the best for roaming in the islands .
Walking like a speed boat from the surface of water he never understands that he is flying in the air .
In the entire journey we do n't feel the journey of the normal plane .
Keeping in mind the diverse blue waters of the Maldives , resort islands and Praval islands it keeps on roaming continuously below the window .
Everyone looks so clean .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of the only companies with 20 aircrafts .
If you want then you can travel in the air for an hour at a rate of around 4 thousand rupees -LRB- everyone -RRB- or you can take the entire plane on rent for a whole day -LRB- just as it is full -RRB- .
Incidentally if we go to a different island from Male island then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the only way to travel on different islands .
And this is such a journey which we do not want to end .
Sea aircrafts travel from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- north Mavilevaru -RRB- on the island of Maldives .
We were in the most ancient and sovereign shops of the capital in the Ahmadabadi market of Male .
All the sellers used to listen carefully to the address given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier .
To say honestly, I have not seen any Indian listening so carefully to the President or the Prime Minister.
But the question of the existence of a supernatural object on this planet was so serious that it was natural .
Many people might have understood the meeting of the cabinet of Maldives in October as well if it is going to Maldives then it feels that if nature ' s wrath drives away from you then the world will be overwhelmed .
There is something special in its beauty .
So much beauty is not included in that small country .
After that journey of the market while returning to the cruise after returning back to the port if you go to the sea then it feels as if the people here love beauty .
Water is so clean that the fish swimming in deep underneath the lamppost can be seen with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can see a few centimetres clearly in the sea or river water near any city of India then you will find yourself intoxicant .
While returning from the MV aquarium two hours of the evening spent in Malaysia gives a thrill in mind .
Praval stone -LRB- Munga stone -RRB- is the life here .
So much that we will get to see moong rocks on the rocks of graves .
On hearing the address of President Nasheed for some time we were standing outside his official residence .
Actually we did n't feel that we are standing beyond the supreme architecture of the country and there is no security guard on far and wide .
Interestingly we were taking photographs of only fifty metres long gardens and verandahs within the doors of their bungalows .
Can you think of a leader's house in India
It was also understood that the president sometimes walking on his own , roaming two houses ahead in his office .
Everything related to the Maldives was enhancing its curiosity .
That is why I waited the next day in a hurry .
It seemed that the day would have been special .
In the morning a name from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we turned around for runway on the base of Trans Maldives .
Last evening when the cruise reached near Malays then we immediately got to know the plane passing above .
So many photographs were seen .
But then it was not imagined that next day it would get a chance to roam around .
We had to go to Rangali Island one hundred five kilometres long by the sea plane of Tros Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and islands spread over the sea of Maldives by the sea plane flying at a height of approximately 1000 metres .
Such beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
With thrill and enthusiasm one gets to breathe .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hilton Hotel in the Rangali Island it felt as if we have reached in a different world .
In such a world which has nothing to do with any outside world .
There was no such relationship that it was not possible to get out of beauty and comfort like that .
The journey of Konark can also be done on foot or by a battery guide .
The view of water on both the sides of the bridge going from the port to the main island is unique .
Now we could not separate ourselves from the surrounding nature then we reached such a place which was unimaginable .
While descending in the water below the sea till several metres below the stairs we went to such a room of glass which was in the water .
Our room was barely a dining room .
Throughout the glass we were able to see unique types of small fish , coral , snorekelling and scuba diving malls .
The idea of eating sitting on tables there was totally thrilling .
The cost of seeing and taking lunch inside water from this island by sea plane from Malaysia is 47 thousand rupees .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to leave our passport in the water .
But it was known that it was not possible .
With a heavy heart we turned back in the hope that sometimes Nashib would come back to this place .
It was decided to go away from Delhi for several days but due to the busyness of work it was not possible .
From childhood wildlife was liked and thought that this time do not let go of Jim Corbett .
In 2006 this was the second bike journey after bikiing till Pegong pond near Khardungla in Ladakh .
On 27 noon we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the enthusiasm with which we had set out our speed was blown up .
The journey between Hapur to Gajraula was really tiring .
Washing through the way and ahead bad roads .
Sometimes it felt as if it has come .
How to reach Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
As such we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was frozen near the park which we had already registered .
That day there were no special programs , even after being cold we went for a walk on the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we left for seeing the Corbett Museum situated near Dhangdi Gate for a long time .
From there we went out to roam around Ramnagar below .
It was very late in the evening while returning .
While leaving Delhi we decided that the lion will definitely see the lion roaming free in the jungle so that I could see the lion in the dream of the whole night .
In the darkness of the night I suddenly heard a fierce roar and after that the dogs began to sneeze that did not stop for two hours .
Initially Kaladhungi and Corbett waterfalls were chosen to be seen .
Kalatungi is 30 kilometres away while Corbett Fall is on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kalatungi where some important items related to his personal life are kept .
Till return it was twelve and a half .
Kalatungi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled in this village itself .
On reaching the resort the safari zipsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they had arranged for signing in the site bearer of one number there .
On asking about one number we said that there is more greenery there and tigers come to the same place for safety from the cold .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
We saw two trunk elephants inside which had long teeth .
I did a lot of photography .
In the meantime the guide started trekking for the tiger .
Guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park some of which have died .
At some places we also saw the smell of their claws but I was disappointed because of not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
I had filled my head with tiger .
Then I remembered a friend of mine of Haldani .
I put that same phone on him .
I told him that I had come in the carpet .
Watching the tiger he asked .
His words are like arrows .
I said gradually , no .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone told us that you take safari to go inside .
