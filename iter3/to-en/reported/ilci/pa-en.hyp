Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
Sindhu on one side of Kutch and Gujarat on the other side therefore there is a mixture of both in language as well .
It is called ' kachhi ' .
Although it is ' Boli ' , it does not have its own script .
If you have to write text then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj only is that Anjar city where many times earthquake has occurred and the whole city has been devastated .
Near Anjar is the monument of Jessel-Torrhal .
The story of Jessel Torl is very interesting .
If we return from the path from where we had come then we will have to take a full month 's holiday and on the other hand the school will open in Mumbai .
So what to do  Now telling the fast buses of Gujarat to to tower you will be able to travel in the train .
A small train of metre gauge will reach Rajkot from Bhuj .
From there a small train towards meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through bad times these days .
Due to commercial recession and due to increasing terrorist threat in South Asia tourism has reached a deep impression .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan congregated in the major states of the country has registered a decline in cough during these days .
Statistics released recently by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of domestic tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came in Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 country and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 country and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are particularly concerned about this situation .
Rajputana gradually speaks of Makar 's director Sanjay Kaushik that pessimistic recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not even been able to develop the strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decline of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Tourists of France are most among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism the recent years have gone a long way for Rajasthan .
After the year of 2008 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism something new is happening .
Desert , havelis , forts , ponds , forests everything is that old for the tourists to enjoy .
In the area of tourism the matter of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism does the work of all the governments but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time in recent years incidents of rape and molestation in Rajasthan along with foreign palace tourists have also documented the image of this state at an international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of excitement in the state but it has remained confined to papers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of the Rajasthan government towards tourism .
With the aim of inviting tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides facilities of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are total 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motorways , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one transport unit and two train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the condition of this corporation has also remained lengthy for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the deficiency of RTDC was 185 lakh , which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is this that even in the last five years forty percent rooms of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with the hotels other units of the corporation are also causing huge losses .
Among these the main are the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not be attracted towards this train .
Despite reducing the fares this could not attract tourists .
This way in recent years there has been a decrease in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by the RTDC this number decreased to 217 .
In the midst of all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth of attraction for tourists towards Palace on Wheels or Royal Rocks .
This railway is continuously bringing benefits .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this train .
With this fall in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the heart of man then he can produce gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has fulfilled this by settling the modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain ranges of Sahadir of Maharashtra .
The taste that he had seen glimpses in his eyes while developing day by day .
His happiness was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has become successful in making its place as an excellent city .
In this city spread in more than 10 thousand acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been made available on only 9 percent land .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Several industrialists have come forward to build their houses in this city made for crores of people and today there are around families in this city .
At first the industrialists and queens bought their residence here in the form of a holiday home but now they have made it their first home and here they travel to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambe Valley itself is Korigarh Fort which provides the beauty of this area .
The ruins of Likkawali in western Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple are found in the excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple the excavation of the idols of Kamala and Goddesses has happened a lot which is mostly in a narrow state .
Malini Thana is an important place in this very area .
On this spot a decorated idol of Devi Durga is found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many beautiful stories and old stories are famous among the residents here .
The ruins of Devpalli are still singing the glorious songs of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi obtained from these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and ancient tales the description of the deity of Tamreshwari Devi is found .
During the time of the Chetia kings in the north - eastern hills this goddess was recognized far and wide .
The tribal people here used to worship Goddess .
Human sacrifice was offered here which was later stopped by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some more ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is located in the midst of the Dwang and Dwang rivers .
According to the stories published here this place is the old Virbha where at one time the king used to rule Bhishmak .
Brahmkund is located in the lower part of Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Tribal tribes like Digru , Mithi etc . guide the tourists here .
These people themselves also have great respect for this Kunda .
Near Brahmkund only is the famous Parashuram Kunda .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins mentioned in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal , the ruins of roaming in Divyang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The ruins of the lake of bricks near Roing are still telling their stories even today .
Lack of bathing , surrounded by pucca stairs and other ponds on all four sides and the relics of wide roads are still singing its ancient grandeur .
We reach ero from four hours to four hours through jeep from north - eastern Lakhimpur city of upper Assam .
This place is the main center of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this pleasant mountainous place hypnotise the hearts of the visitors .
This is that charming place where climate stays .
It takes several days for the jeep to reach here before becoming a path .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premrose , wild cat , strawberries and raspberries overwhelm the tourists .
Apples and sweets are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometers .
This beautiful valley is the residence of immigrants .
With their untiring hard work they have made it their heaven .
There is a lot of rice cultivation here .
This place is the store of rice .
This ten miles long rock is a living example of their hard work and the efficiency of farming .
Their need of irrigation gets fulfilled with the Kali Nadi .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley four folds .
In the middle of the chains laden with the snow of the left hand light redness emerging in the sky is felt .
The best cough in the air is cold .
Along with the chilling cold in the environment one also gets the feeling of moisture .
The sound of garbage below the legs is seen on the layer of the mesh spread on the floor of the wood .
There is dullness in the environment and much is not visible because of the blurredness before sunrise .
Pillars remain on the redness of the eyes east .
One feels like sitting on a bench lying in a balcony .
As soon as the hand touches the smooth layer of the ribs with the sound of the kirchen and the hand gets separated from the jerk by the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in the life of the people living in this small village settled amidst these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this spend most of the time in geneba or nearby .
On both the sides of the thin Balkhondi river dense population settled in the valley is spread very high on the slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland , Rohn valley on both the sides of which several small and big cities are settled .
On the equivalent highway of the Ron river and the rushing cars on it have begun to clear .
At a distance of 300 kms and a journey of two and a half hours from the car the Jeneva lake coming from the east side along the Jeneva lake and half the Ron river coming from the east side meets the Jeneva lake which is called Lake in Fretch -LRB- Lake Lakes -RRB- .
Geneva city is settled at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake moves towards west after becoming a river again .
On the right side across the lake are mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gangtok , Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke on the left side leaving this highway we reach the northern side on the hilly path .
Because of the slope of the mountain being southern the sun of the crime is giving a lot of sunshine to the entire watch .
The amount of snow as compared to the valley is less here - approximately not .
The life moves towards a height , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite good cough on both the sides of the road being frozen , there is no special kind of coolness in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
After covering a journey of approximately 20 k . . in half an hour on this circular mountainous road we reach a small village named Thal .
Shillong with slopy roofs , completely made of wood are big multi-storied bungalows .
In the basement made from the cement concrete of this bungalow of three storeys there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , lodge etc . along with parking of vehicles .
Valiya is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine grapes are the main centres of making liquor .
Grapes are cultivated in 37  land area of the entire cantonment .
In the villages settled on both sides of the Ron Valley the grapes gardens give a unique dimension to the beauty there .
To take herbs of grapes , to take her stroll , to rest in the villages there at night and to swallow wine in the grapes shops is an inseparable part of the tourism business here .
In a small colony named Aga there is a huge collection of grapes in a cave made in the 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to make an adventurous booking .
Once again we crossed the same jungle while descending from Dawanal .
Mind becomes even more distressed by the pricking questions of three - four kms of children throughout the way .
Suddenly dramatic and charming changes come in the sight on one turn .
Right in front , on the left side of the road on the top of a deep valley a beautiful group of houses is settled .
On sloping above the village people are skiing in the snow .
On the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope a dense jungle of cedar is spread .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the colony are sparkling because of the direct rays of the sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also silence is spread .
All around from the peak of the mountain to the valley the empire of the slopy Himalayas .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round chakra from the middle of that colony .
The name of colony is Lukarabad .
The population of Laukarbad located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level is about 1500 .
The number of tourists , players and health workers coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments with the capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels for a stay of 1500 , camping seat of tents , health center and 50 restaurants here .
Sixty six socks of hot water have been found in Lukorbad till now .
40 lakh litres out of these everyday in the whole of the colony of water are brought to the thermal pools made at various places , some pools are inside the five star hotels and according to the pockets of people coming to different classes .
On reaching the village one feels very hot .
In the open sunshine above the roof of the house a thick layer of snow is sparkling .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the protected places in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only be texed to Sikkim hence there is no checking .
The journey is on , the area is on the second , but the mountain is the same , the trees are there , the ethereal winds are there .
The moisture present on the whole body is same .
There is a thrilling light in the rainy season .
The plan for Darjeeling safari is fixed , first of all the decisions were taken for Karsiyang .
Karsyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunny jungles .
Famous for producing excellent tea .
If you move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then in the beginning itself tea gardens welcome the people moving towards itself in Mussoorie .
Lack of a road in the middle of the tea gardens hypnotise the mind for the first time .
On one side is the green mountain filled with jungles , on the other hand is the trench of Hagiri .
Sometimes the jungles here and sometimes tea gardens are visible .
All around there was a kingdom of greenery .
Once I got into a flood , see these natural jungles or plants of tea planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The beautiful jungle as it is , the tea gardens spread far and wide .
If you look on the road on the way then it feels very strange .
The snake - charming and swimming path was passing through .
Time was also passing .
If it was not past , then forests and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance a hill appeared very dense from houses and houses .
This was Karsingh .
Staying at one place here we made a program to roam around the whole day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we set out on a tour of Carsiang .
The first deer park .
A small garden surrounded all around by large jungles .
To reach up to the deer park the vehicle had to be left very low .
Despite being immensely influenced by the beauty of Karsiyong , it has not been able to develop and fame in the form of a tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the way being desolate the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles and the enjoyment of crossing the road between smoke trees was giving us bravery .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
This is a point located at a height on the other side of the city .
This is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British people used to give life by jumping from here .
Right now , it is equipped with a park and resort .
There is a staircase here at a height of which on observing the entire city a beautiful sight exists .
In the tea gardens nearby women were busy breaking the tea gardens running with extreme speed on the backs of the women .
There is a museum outside the Carsiang city , but that day we could not go there , because it was more necessary to tour the unforgettable environment of tea gardens .
Next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
This was an thrilling experience in itself , but it was very worried that how would we roam when it was raining .
The coincidence was very good that reaching till Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the sunrise against us .
This garden is a beautiful place present with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The way to reach here is even more pleasant than this .
On walking a little further down from here we found a Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst rocks the charm of waterfalls is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we found that waterfalls are present in the empire of stone rocks then the magnificence of waterfalls in Ganga Maa is worldwide covered with stones .
Both of these places are present very low amidst the mountains of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of the vehicle we saw a loop of excitement in Darjeeling .
The entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of telescope .
The mood of the weather was complete till now .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , where did we stand and shout .
Planning for strolling and shopping on Malroad in the evening was made .
In the tour of Darjeeling Toy Trains put four moons in the journey .
The toy train from Darjeeling to Dhoom and Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in the Mirik lake here and an epidemic in the garden .
From this route travellers also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where handicrafted sweaters of Nepali artisans etc . are found .
There is also an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but there is a movement of forest - waterfalls .
Kalimpong is the most popular tourist spot -LRB- Lolegaon -RRB- and which is full of forest - waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata .
My recent small journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither of foreign nor outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like a pink city or the lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of this a special attraction people start walking .
The place where I am going to talk , this bus has been prepared approximately four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that has come here this place has really turned into a jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
In my ears the words of my guide Rambabu Meena are heard , well , we could not even imagine before this that we could live in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work in the heritage hotel as well .
Ajabgarh resident Ram Babu used to work in this very old Jaipur and now this unique royal look is in the Amn Bagh .
He has given a new color to his speaking .
Saheb ' is the prediction of Amn Bagh .
Nobody calls you English language there .
Amn Bagh is actually a tour of incomplete chains and with all the facilities .
That garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it will educate you from the nearby areas as well .
In the royal style of Rajasthan many people who spend holidays must have toured Bhangarh of past , why should they go away , among the people of Jaipur , Kuchhchhek would probably have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Amn Bagh big people of the country and abroad reach there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi had called me there heartily but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he had reached Bhangarh by wandering on his own .
This time when suddenly I reached there at the request of my foreign guests , then it felt that those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time they should definitely go to Amn Bagh .
This garden is the only garden saved from those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to run for hunting .
Its construction took place in nineteenth century .
Its old wall is the witness of those days .
Surrounded by hills and in the shade of dense trees the first glimpse of Ammon garden will hypnotise you .
As soon as you come inside , the way you are welcomed , it seems that here divine peace has been paid attention .
Along with the Mauli dam in Kali the mantra of Mangalacharan is alively pronounced .
We had reached the slope in the evening and intended to set up a cycle that garden .
Whatever kind of hypnotise I am , my colleague said , it is interesting ' .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
Their lighting is the most beautiful .
Everything is new and artistic no wonder that Amn Bagh has also got a recent prize .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey of Bhangarh .
Walking on a circular road we saw the fort of Ajbgarh on which the light of the sun was expanding gradually .
We saw dry lakes in which farmers were farming .
This year when rain did n't happen then for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
For this such a miracle of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh from Jeep .
In the morning and evening I had seen a tourist from Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable moment of million dollars .
The way to say the alumni of Amn Bagh was also traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd they sent us away .
Now we understood that why tourists come here after spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept for showing tributary life .
Is it right .
There is no doubt that this is happening in many states and tourists also show coughing interest in them .
These tours are usually prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and during this time travellers are taken to different places .
In this staying there , food etc . are also included .
This way there is an attempt to explore such a place where there is not much development and where there is no special effect of time on nature and lifestyle of people .
Along with this old tourist cycles etc . are also present here .
Besides this , attention is also given on doing tridisional cuisine survey .
Actually , the aim of such tours is to make the tourists realize the ways and traditions of living there .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such tours are interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
Despite this being with many people you can take the enjoyment of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time without getting disturbed .
Yes , it is necessary that along with giving less expenditure and a lot of time for comfort these tours keep a demand for sure from your colloquial .
This is the reason that for enjoying these it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching foreign destinations via bus tour .
Take the best deal before taking the ticket .
Students , senior citizens of military , children etc get discount on them , then there is arrangement of discount for two people as well .
However , it is cheaper to buy tickets in advance , so it is better to plan the bus at the last moment than to do the planning a little before .
Instead of going to the ticket know about the round injection .
It becomes cheap .
The rules regarding bagge are very tight , therefore ask about the size and weight of the goods .
It should not be such that you have to leave some of your belongings on the terminal or you have to fill the extra percentage .
Also know the rules of insurance or compensation of loss from tourism company .
Carry on bamboo is right , walk on the lake .
Because they come fit in the rake above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus you will have to take care of the luggage on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During the Big Season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better seat operation will be with you .
While choosing seat keep in mind the comfort .
If you will feel more jerked on the back seat then reading on the front seat is not comfortable .
If you have to go to Lou again and again , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be more distorted then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now the talk of one goddess .
If you are in the back of both the arms , then sit on the seat with the corner and keep your bag on the other side .
If there is not much crowd in bus then planning will be there .
If there is facility of basom in the bus then keep in mind that while chewing the seat it becomes difficult to sit there after a while .
Make identification with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus all are asked to go out .
During this do not leave your stuff on the seat , because on its disappearance buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops go back on time .
If you do not come in time , then you can find a new traveller in your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
It is said that if Rome is not seen in Europe then nothing has been seen .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .
The capital of Italy Rome is one of those old cities of the world from where the development of civilizations has taken place .
This is the very reason that its mark is visible on Western Switzerland .

Inside the temple statues of gods and goddesses are made all around .
Incidentally this temple was made a church in 601 AD .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but the unique Bogris is unparalleled .
Therefore on going to Rome do not forget to see it .
You must go to the museum built here as well , because on missing this you will miss the opportunity of being face to face with the best sculpture .
The statues built here are magnificent and looks so lively as if they are speaking now .

Approximately the buildings here are such in which magnificent specimens are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Taravi Fountain ' .

The neighbouring state of Maharashtra Goa is rich with its beautiful sea shores and diverse water sports which is a heavenly repository for tourists where one gets a simple view of the beauty of the ancient era with the tour of ancient churches .
Situated in the capital of Goa Panchim , Ginger Hotel excells the journey of the western coast .
To enjoy cycling , river cruise , cold sea climate and world famous Goan cuisines on the roads of Goa the Ginger Hotel located here is an excellent option .
If seen on today 's date then the cheapest rate for Maldives is 28 thousand rupees per person from Delhi .
After that if you stay in Malaysia then you can also get hotels on a little less rent but if you go on an island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then pocket will be small .
Sea creams prove beneficial here only .
In the first week of December Loui cruise from Kochi started the single cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although because of some problems Louis Cruise has already adjusted its services , but it is expected that it will be dry again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at a rate of at least 5850 rupees per person at night on Louis Cruise ship MV Aquamerine .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
If you are two then children less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
One should do more .
In the fare of cruise tea - snacks , food all are included .
Each time the entertainment gathers .
Reaching the capital Malaysia you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from the plane ride to the underwater lunch .
While roaming in the big airplane suddenly appears in front of you a sea plane then you will feel like a toy .
But this television overflow of 12 - 15 seats is indisputably appropriate for touring Archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- like Maldives .
Running like a speed boat on the surface of water it does not come to know when it gets in the air .
In the entire flight you do not have the experience of flying ordinary airplanes .
Every time your sights keep looking down on the islands and coral islands found in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of them with twenty sea planes .
If you want you can take a flight of around thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- an hour or the entire sea plane can take it on rent for the trip of your day -LRB- condition is pocket filled -RRB- .
If you go beyond Male Island on an island then a sea plane journey will be necessary because this is a mode of travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which may never let you feel like finishing .
Sea plane takes a journey of 12 kilometers to 183 kilometers -LRB- in Umma -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovanier shop of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Mala .
All the soldiers were listening very carefully to the address delivered by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier .
Saying honestly , no Indian has ever seen the President or the Prime Minister listening carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of a remarkable creation on this earth then such seriousness was imperative .
Many people might have considered the meeting done inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but they might have gone to Maldives but if the corpse of nature loses it then how much will the world be
There is something special in its beauty .
As if in a small country such beauty is not included .
Returning from that stroll of the market towards its cruise while returning towards the jetty , when sightseeing with bruises went in the sea water then it felt as if the people here understood the value of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of lamppost the fishes moving in depths of several metres were appearing clean with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
If you see some centimetres also clean in sea or river water connected to any city of India then you will consider yourself fortunate .
While returning to M . . . amorphine 2 hours of the evening spent in the mall were roaming in the brain .
Coral reef -LRB- rocks -RRB- are the life here .
Even you will find rocks on the stones attached to the tombs .
Just a while before we heard President Nasheed 's speech we were standing outside his official residence .
We did n't believe that the dwelling of the best personality of any country was ahead , there was no protector far and wide .
Interestingly we were taking photographs of gardens and verandahs just fifty metres away by lifting our hands inside the door of its bungalow .
That you can think of such a leader 's house in India .
We also got to know that presidents sometimes reach their office two blocks ahead crossing the road on foot .
Everything was surprising about Maldives .
That is why I was waiting for the next day with fervor .
It seemed as if that day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat took us to the airport island from Cruise .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives by cutting the cycle of the runway .
Last evening when Cruise was reaching near the Mall then we immediately recognized the plane passing from above .
Such pictures as we saw were of them .
But then it was not known that next day there would be a chance of a ride in it .
We had to go to Rangali island one hundred and five kilometres away from the sea plane of Trans Maldives .
Watching the hundreds of ponds and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying at a height of approximately a thousand metres was amazing .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a flight of thrill and enthusiasm to stop breathing .
But on reaching the Cornard Resort of Hillton Hotels on Rangli Island it felt as if we have reached some other world .
In such a world whose external world has no residency .
The architecture was not such that it was difficult to get out the beauty or architecture there .
Tour on Konark can be done on foot as well as by a battery operated vehicle .
On both the sides of the bridge while going till the main island from the jetty the view of water life was unique .
Now we could not even simplify ourselves with the surrounding nature , when we reached such a place , it was timeless .
While descending in the sea water several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all sides crossing glasses we could see unique kinds of small fishes , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of eating sitting on decorated tables there was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of visiting and underwater lunch in sea plane from Malaysia is 47 thousand rupees for a man .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to give air to our passport water .
But I knew it was not possible .
With a heavy heart it will return with the same hope that sometimes it will take ' a ' moment ' on a bend .
Since many days they were planning to go out of Delhi but due to arrangement of evening this was not possible .
If you had a sleep of life since childhood then think why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after the biking of Pegong lake ahead of Khardungla pass in Ladakh .
On the morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the zeal with which we had come out , Core circulated our fast .
The journey between Hapur to Gajraula was really tiring .
Cora from above and bad roads in front .
Many times it felt that now it has fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Deccule near the park , whose booking we had already done .
That day there was no special program but despite being cold we went to roam on the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there Corbett museum came out which was very difficult at a distance of two kilometres near Dhangi Gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It took us a long time to return .
The lion had set out from Delhi saying that if we see lions roaming free in the jungle then we kept on seeing lions in dreams all night .
In the midst of the depths of the night suddenly I heard a buzz and after that the dogs which began to bark , they did not remain silent for two hours .
That is why there was a suggestion of roaming around in Kaladungi and Corbett Fall .
Kaladungi is 30 kms away , while Carbet Fall falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi , where some special things related to his personal life are kept .
It was twelve and half past twelve while returning .
Kaladungi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled in this village itself .
On reaching Renuka the safari zipsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they had arranged for skiing in the number one cigarette there .
On asking about number one said that Grasland is more there and Tigers come towards it to prevent cold during this time .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We set out for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusked elephants , which had long teeth .
I did photography running .
In the meantime the guide started trekking on the Tiger .
Guide said that there are around 150 tigers in the park , some of whom have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was sad not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
There was a fountain of tiger in my brain .
Then only I remembered one of my old friends of Halfwani .
I took him the same way .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
Whether she saw a tiger or not .
His words kissed like a thirteen .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone suggested us that you should take a journey inside .
During the journey we came to know that because of being a busy highway near the park often animals get wounded by fighting with vehicles or die .
