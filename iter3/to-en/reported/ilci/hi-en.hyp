Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it ' s different .
Sindh on one side of Kutch and Gujarat on the other is therefore a mixture of both in language .
It is called ' kutchi ' .
Though it is ' Boli ' , it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kutchi then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj only is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes have occurred and the entire city has collapsed .
The tomb of Jaisalmer is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisal - Toral is very interesting .

The tourism industry , considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan , is going through bad phases these days .
Due to global recession and rising terrorist threats in South Asia tourism industry has been shocked .
With the point of view of tourism a considerable decrease has been registered in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan among the major states of the country these days .
Recent statistics issued by the Rajasthan government have shown that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which 20 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana holiday makers says that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism business .
We have not even been able to develop the strong infrastructure of tourism here in comparison to other countries of Asia .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decline of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
From the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With respect to tourism the recent years have passed the best for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , havelis , forts , bawaris , forest everything is that old for the tourists to enjoy .
In the area of tourism all the governments talk of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time incidents of rape and molestation in Rajasthan along with foreign women tourists in recent years have also stained the image of this state at an international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of industry in the state but it has remained confined to paper only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited ( RTDC ) is an example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism .
In order to promote tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in the year 1979 .
This corporation provides the facility of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
The Corporation has a total of 75 units .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one traffic unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has remained thin for many years .
The RTDC deficit in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh , which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that even in the last five years forty percent rooms of its hotels could not be filled .
Along with hotels other factories of corporation are also bringing it a big loss .
Main among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not get attraction towards this train .
Despite less rent this could not attract tourists .
Likewise in recent years a reduction has been seen in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in this fair in the tourist village built by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists stayed this year the number decreased to 217 .
In the midst of all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there has been no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . the royal train .
This railway is continuously benefiting .
Last year, RTDC got the benefit of Rs. 9.5 crore from this train.
With this fall in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If one wants to do something in the heart of man , he can produce gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has made it true by establishing modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain range of Sahyadri of Maharashtra .
The dream he had dreamt of is joyous in his eyes when he grew up day by day .
His joy was also seen at the time of the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been able to make its place as a great city .
Spread over 10 , 000 acres in this city hotels , houses and other facilities have been made available on only 9  land .
Trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available on 91 percent land .
Several industrialists came forward to build their own houses in this city built for millionaires and today there are about 800 families living in this city .
At first , industrialists and nobles bought their ashes here in the form of holiday home , but now they have made it their first home and from here they travel to Mumbai for work .
Behind the Ambe Valley itself is the Koyarigarh Fort which provides the beauty of this area .
The ruins of Likawali in West Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found in the excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple excavation of lotus and statues of gods and goddesses has been obtained which are mostly in a fragmented state .
Malini Thana is an important place in this area .
A decorated idol of Devi Durga has been found at this place .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet tales and old tales are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the glorious saga of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi obtained from these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
One gets a description of the glory of Tamreshwari Devi in ancient literature and mythological stories .
During the time of Chetia kings in the north - eastern hills this goddess was recognized far and wide .
The tribes here used to worship the goddess .
Human sacrifice was also offered here which was later stopped by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which are situated in the middle of the Dibang and Divang rivers .
According to the stories prevailing here this place is the old Vidarbha , where once King Bhishmak ruled .
The Brahmakunda lies at the bottom of the Lohit river , a famous place in the Lohit district .
The tribes of Deegaru , Mishmi etc . here guide the travellers .
These people themselves have great faith in this Kunda .
Near Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kunda .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal , the ruins of roaming in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The relics of the ponds of bricks near the roaming are still telling their stories .
Surrounded by bathing ghats , pucca stairs and other ponds and the relics of wide roads are still singing silent songs of their ancient grand saga .
We reach ero from four hours through jeep from North Lakhimpur city of upper Assam .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this pleasant mountainous place hypnotise the tourists .
This is that charming place where there is an emergency .
It used to take several days to reach here before the jeep was formed .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premieres , vaults , wild currents , strawberries and rasberries disturb the tourists .
Apples and potatoes are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometers .
This beautiful valley is the home of emergency people .
With his tireless hard work , the emergency people have made it their heaven .
The cultivation of rice is very good here .
This place is the store of rice .
This plateau , ten miles long , is a living example of their labour and skill in cultivation .
Their irrigation needs are met by the Kali river .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
In the middle of the snowclad mountain range of the left hand the sight emerging on the horizontal horizon falls on the slightest redness .
It is very cold in the air .
Along with the pricking coolness in the environment one also feels the moisture .
The sound of litter below the legs is seen on the layer of the wooden floor .
There is dullness in the atmosphere and nothing is visible because of the shadow of sunrise .
Eyes remain lying on the redness of the east .
I feel like sitting on a bench lying in a balcony .
As soon as the hand touches the smooth layer of the palate slides with the sound of a mild sound and the hand separates from the shock from the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in the life of Switzerland to spend the night in this small village settled amidst these mountains .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent in Geneva or nearby .
The densely populated population on either side of the thin Balkhati river is spread on very high slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland Rhone , on both sides of which several small and big cities are settled .
Parallel highways of the Ron river and cars of crawling on them have started to clear .
A distance of 300 kms and a journey of two and a half hours by car half an hour is reached parallel to Geneva lake and half a roan river along with it in the eastern direction Ron river Montreu near a city named Geneva lake which is called Dec emon -LRB- Lock Lama -RRB- .
Geneva city is settled at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake again turns towards the west after becoming a river .
Right side beyond the lake are mountain ranges of Dhawal , skyscraping Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Leuke we reach the mountainous way of the north , leaving this highway from the exit of the left .
Because of the slope of the mountain being southward , the sun of afternoon is giving a lot of sunshine to all the fans .
The quantity of snow in comparison to the valley is less here - almost equal to no .
As they move towards height , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite good snow being frozen on both sides of the road there is no specific coolness in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
On this curved hilly road after covering a journey of approximately 20 k . . we reach a small village named Thel .
Halet - There are huge multi-storey bungalows with slopy roofs , fully wooden .
The basement made of cement concrete of this three - storey bungalow has rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , ladders including parking of trains .
Valay is famous for grapes cultivation in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making grapes of grapes .
Grapes are cultivated in 37  of the entire cantonment .
In the villages settled on both sides of the Ron Valley the gardens of grapes provide a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking wineards of grapes , getting them a stroll at night in the villages there and taking them to the factories of grapes wine testing is an integral part of tourism business here .
In a small town named Aighle there is a huge museum of grapes made in the 12th century in a garden , to see which foreign tourists have to make an artificial booking .
Once again we pass through the middle of that jungle where we had been buried from the cavalry .
Mind gets even more distressed by the prickly questions of children throughout the way up to three - four kms .
Suddenly , the scene brings about a dramatic and charming change .
Right in front , on the slope of the deep valley towards the left side of the road a beautiful herd of houses is settled .
On the flat slope from above the village people are skiing in the snow .
The dense forest of cedar is spread till the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
Snow is frozen all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining because of the fall of the sun ' s straight rays .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also there is silence .
From the peak of the mountain all around to the valley the empire of the Dhawal Himalayas .
Within the next five minutes we reach a huge roundabout in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Leukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Luckerabad is about 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and healthy people coming here can be estimated from this fact that here there are 1700 apartments with the capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels for the stay of 1500 , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
65 gold of hot water has been found so far in Leukarabad .
4 million litres ( upto 51  - per day ) coming out of these , thermal pools of 30 small and big water in the entire town are reached , some pools are within five star hotels and others according to the pockets of people of different income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
In the blooming sun the thick layer of snow is shining above the roof of the houses .
Albenin -LRB- Albenin -RRB- name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the preserved places of the national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim 's taxis , therefore there is no checking .
The journey continues , the region may be different , but the mountains are the same , the trees are the same , the rough winds are there .
He is the moisture all over the body .
It is he who lighted the sun in the rainy season .
As soon as the plan for the Darjeeling tour was confirmed , the zeal of Karsiang was first spread .
Kurseong is a small town in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunny jungles .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If we moved from Siliguri towards Darjeeling then in the beginning itself the tea gardens welcome the people moving towards it while smiling .
Passing through the road in the middle of the tea gardens hypnotise the mind for the first time .
On one side is a green mountain full of forests , and on the other side a deep green trench .
Sometimes jungles and tea gardens were visible here .
The empire of greenery was all around .
Once upon a time I was stunned to see these natural jungles or to the tea planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The beautiful forest was as beautiful as tea gardens spread far and wide .
If we glance at the roads on the way then the creation looks marvellous .
The crooked and circular way of the snake was passing .
Time was passing .
If not , the jungle and the tea garden .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance , a hilly house , etc . appeared very dense .
It was a curse .
After staying here at one place we made a program to roam around the whole day .
Hence we set out on a tour of Kurseong with a car .
First dire park .
A small garden is surrounded by giant forests .
To reach the top of the ascent meaning deer park the car had to be left very low .
Despite being absorbed by the beauty of Kurseong , it has not yet been known as a tourist destination .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the way being deserted the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by forests and the joy of climbing the path amidst the sunny trees was giving us the courage .
The next place was the Eagle Crag .
This is a point located at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the British period lovers used to jump and die from here .
Right now , it is equipped with a park and a restaurant .
Here is a ladder like dome whose height to view the whole city beautiful scenes are present .
In the tea gardens nearby women were engrossed in breaking the tea gardens running fast on their backs with baskets .
Cursing is a museum outside the city , but that day we could not go there , because it was more necessary to tour the free environment of tea gardens .
The next day it was decided to roam Darjeeling .
It was an adventurous experience in itself , but it was a matter of great concern that if it rained only then how would we roam .
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching Rock Garden we enjoyed blooming sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining .
On going a little more below from here we found Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst rocks the illusion of waterfalls is worth seeing .
We found in the Rock Garden that if waterfalls are adorned in the empire of stones then the miraculous world of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is rich with stones .
Both of these places are located very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of a car we saw a balusia loop in Darjeeling .
The entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of telescope .
The mood of the weather was still smooth .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , we came down from where and began to shine .
In the evening there was a plan for sightseeing and shopping on the mall road .
In the tour of Darjeeling Trains of all kinds enhance the pleasure of the journey .
Travelling from Darjeeling to Darjeeling and the journey from Dhu to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake and short break in the garden here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where handmade sweaters of Nepali artisans etc . are found .
There is arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is also a city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but there is movement of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots in Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of forest - waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata for a tour of Darjeeling in the shade of coolness but the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here tied me with itself .
My recent short journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither abroad nor outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey pulls towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like a pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come to the fore .
The place I am going to talk about is just prepared four and a half years ago , but the preparation with which this place has come here has really turned into a jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
My guide in my ears resonates with the words of Ram Babu Meena : ' Sahiba , we couldn ' t even imagine before that we could live in the forest like this .
Fifty percent staff belong to this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people didn ' t even get work at the heritage hotel .
Ram Babu , a resident of Ajbgarh , used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal style Aman Bagh .
He has moulded his own speech into a new colour .
Sahiba ' is the style of Aman Bagh .
There nobody calls you from English utterance .
Aman garden is really a comfortable , peaceful and comfortable tourist place .
That garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces you to the nearby areas as well .
Among the people spending holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan , how many people must have toured Bhangarh of the past , why should I go away , even some among the people of Jaipur may have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman garden big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night when Shabana Azmi had called me there with a lot of heart but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had gone astray to Bhangarh .
This time when suddenly I reached there at the feast of my foreign guests then it felt that those who want to spend a magnificent holiday in a short span of time they should definitely go to Aman Garden .
This garden is the only garden left in those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stay for hunting .
It was built in nineteen , twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
Surrounded by hills and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Aman Garden charms you .
As soon as you come inside , the way you are welcomed it will appear that here divine peace has been paid attention .
The mantra of Mangalachara is lively pronounced as the mantra is tied to the wrist .
We had reached the slope in the evening and we intended to plant a garden .
My host , Jackie , who was a gentleman , suddenly said , ' It ' s interesting .
All are inspired by havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic it was not surprising that Aman Garden had also got a prize recently .
The manager set out our programme for the morning .
First of all , a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey to Bhangarh .
On walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbgarh on which the light of the sun was expanding gradually .
He saw the dry lake in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year it did not rain but for the first time we saw tobacco cultivation .
For Jackie such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning and evening I had seen a tourist from Holland sitting in deep meditation .
These are million dollars precious moments .
The way of saying goodbye to Aman Bagh was also traditional , he sent us away by feeding jaggery and curd .
Now we understood why the tourists come here after spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept for showing Tribal Life .
Is this right .
Undoubtedly this is not the case in many states and tourists also show interest in them .
These tours are usually prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It includes staying there , food etc .
This way an attempt is made to explore such places where there has not been much development and where time has not had much impact on nature and lifestyle of people .
Along with this where old tourist sites etc . are also present .
Besides this , attention is also given on serving a traditional key .
Actually the purpose of such a tour is to make the tourists aware of the ways and traditions of living in that place .
Although it seems a bit difficult to think but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
Despite having a lot of people with it you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to your favorite book without being disturbed .
Yes , it is important that along with giving a lot of time in less expense and comfort these tours definitely keep a demand for patience with you .
This is the reason that for enjoying these it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching some foreign destination buses via a tour .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior officers of the military , children etc get discount on them , then there is an arrangement for discount for two people as well .
However , it is cheaper to buy tickets in advance , so it is better to plan a bus tour in the last moments than do a little ahead .
Find out the round trip instead of the two tickets .
They are cheap .
Rules regarding baggage are very tough , therefore inquire about the size and weight of the goods .
It may not be such that you have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or you have to pay extra fees .
Also know the rules of compensation for insurance or loss from tourism company .
Carry on bags are right , take them .
Because they fit in the rack over the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus you will have the responsibility of luggage on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During the Big Season you should take special care of this point .
Actually the sooner you reach the better seat option will be with you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the conferrt .
If there are more tremors in the previous seat , it is not conferred to read in the next seats .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again , take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be more disturbed then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now it ' s a trick .
If you are both in a hurry to grab then sit in the corner seat and keep your bag on the other side .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then keep in mind that while chewing the seat it becomes difficult to sit there after a while .
Make identification by bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
Everyone is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its disappearance buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come on time , you can find a new passenger in your place and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .

Although there are many gardens in Rome but Villa Borgis is unmatched .
Therefore on going to Rome do not forget to see it .

There are two hotels of ginger in Pune which are located in Pimpri and Wakad .
Situated in the center of Pimpri industrial area and on the Pune - Bangalore highway both the hotels of Ginger built in a place named Wakad are equipped with all the state - of - the - art facilities .
The neighbouring state of Maharashtra Goa is contiguous with its beautiful sea shores and diverse aquatic sports which is like a heaven for tourists where one can easily see the grandeur of ancient times through the tour of ancient churches .
Situated in the capital of Goa , Panjim , Ginger Hotel excells this journey of the western coast .
Taking full enjoyment of cycling , river cruise , cold sea breeze and world famous Goan dishes on the roads of Goa the Ginger Hotel located here is an excellent option .
If seen on today 's date then the cheapest person return from Delhi for Maldives is of 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Malaysia then you can get hotels on a little fare but if you go to an island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then your pocket will be small .
Sea cruise proves beneficial here .
In the first week of December , Louis Cruise from Kochi started India ' s only cruise cruise for the Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although because of some difficulties Louis Cruise has postponed his services yet it is expected to start again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at a rate of at least 5850 rupees per person per night on Louis Cruise ship MV Aquamarin .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two grow older children below 15 years of age are absolutely free .
And what else is required .
The cruise fares include tea and snacks , food , etc .
Enjoyment of every time together .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If suddenly a plane stands in front of you roaming around in big airplanes then you will feel like a toy .
But this twin otter plane of 12 - 15 seats is excellent for roaming like Maldives Archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- .
When it gets up in the air running like a speed boat on the surface of water , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not have the experience of flying airplanes .
Every time your sights keep getting stronger below the window , watching the resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
How clearly everything looks .
There are only two plane companies in Maldives .
Tros Maldives is one of them , which has twenty c planes .
If you want you can take a flight of around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- an hour or you can take the entire sea plane on rent for your day long -LRB- provided the pocket is deep -RRB- .
If you go beyond the Male Island on some island then the journey of Sea Plane will be necessary because this is the way of journey between different islands .
And that ' s a journey that might never end up with you .
Sea plane takes a journey of 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in the best way Mavilevaru -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the capital ' s largest antique and sovereign shop in the Ahmadi market of Male .
All the salesmen were listening very carefully to the speech delivered at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed .
To tell honestly , I have not seen any Indian listening to the presidents or prime minister 's speeches so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of an unsurpassed creation of this earth , it was so serious that it was imperative .
Many people might have considered the meeting done by the cabinet of Maldives in October to be a trick but going to Maldives it feels as if nature ' s anger is snatched away from us then how impoverished will the world be .
Something like this is special in its beauty .
In that small country it was as if not so beautiful .
Returning from that stroll of the market towards Jetty to go back on its cruise , when eyes went in the water of the sea along with barren roads then we realized to what extent people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of the lamppost , fish floating in depths of several meters were appearing with all its colours .
This was a part of the sea which was completely tied to the city .
You will find yourself lucky even if you can see a few centimeters clearly in the sea or river water adjacent to any city of India .
While returning to M . V . Aquamarin , he spent two hours in the evening in the garland .
Coral reef -LRB- muga rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will find muga rocks on the stones attached to the graves .
Shortly before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
We were not sure that we were ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country , there was no security guard till far .
Interestingly we were taking photographs of gardens and verandahs just fifty meters away by stretching our hands inside from the door of his bungalow .
Can you think of a leader ' s house in India
It was known that presidents sometimes used to reach their office two blocks ahead crossing roads on foot .
Everything was surprising about the Maldives .
That is why I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
Ilham was supposed to be a special day .
In the morning a boat from the cruise brought us to Airport Island .
From there we reached the base of the Tros Maldives while roaming around the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near the Mall then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing above .
So many pictures that he saw .
But then there was no guess that the next day there would be a ride .
We were about to go to Rangali Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the sea plane of Tros Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying at a height of about a thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a breathtaking flight with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hilton Hotel on the Rangali Island it felt as if we have reached in some other world .
In a world which had nothing to do with any outside world .
It was not like this that it was difficult to get the beauty or luxury out there as well .
There can be a stroll on Konark or a battery driven cart as well .
The view of water life on both sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was amazing .
Right now we could not even comfort ourselves with the surrounding nature , it was unimaginable that we had reached such a place .
While descending in the sea water several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all sides crossing the mirrors we could see the unique types of small and big fishes , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of eating and drinking on decorated tables was very exciting in itself .
The fare of seeing and underwater lunch on this island in sea plane from Male is 47 thousand rupees for a man .
I did not want to return from there .
We were prepared to shed our passports in water .
But he knew that it was not possible .
With a heavy heart we returned with the same expectation that at some point of time fate will definitely be brought here .
For many days he was planning to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
Since childhood wildlife was fond of , then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after biking till Pegong Lake ahead from Khardungla Pass in Ladakh .
In the early morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the fog that had come out of the hustle-bustle rushed our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tiring .
Fog from above and bad road in front .
Sometimes it seemed that he had fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near the park , which we had already booked .
On that day there was no special program , despite being cold we went to roam on the banks of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we left for Corbett Museum which was near Dhangi Gate , 2 kilometres away extremely difficult .
From there we went down to Ramnagar for a walk .
It was late in the evening .
It was decided from Delhi that if I see a lion roaming in the jungle then I kept looking at the lions all night in a dream .
Suddenly I heard a tremendous roar in the midst of the depths of the night , and the dogs who began to bark after that did not stop for two hours .
Therefore the suggestion to roam around Kaladhungi and Corbett Fall came first .
Kaladhungi is 30 km away while Carbet Fall falls on the way .
In Kaladhungi there is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib , where some important things related to his personal life are kept .
It was twelve and half past twelve while returning .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett settled in this gambling only .
On reaching the resort Safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they have made arrangements for singing in the number one site Bijrani there .
On asking about number one told that Grasland is more there and Tigers come towards it to prevent cold during this time .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We left for the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , which had long teeth .
I did a lot of photography .
In the meanwhile , the guide started tracking the tiger .
Guide said that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of them have died recently .
At many places we also saw marks of their claws , but I was sad because of not seeing Tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind , Tiger ' s fittoor was riding .
Then I remembered one of Haldwani ' s old friends .
I called him the same way .
I told him I had come to Carbet .
He asked if Tiger saw it or not .
Her words were pierced like arrows .
I said softly , no .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone advised us to take a safari inside .
