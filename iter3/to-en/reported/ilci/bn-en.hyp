Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yeah, different.
On one side of Kutch is Sindh and on the other side Gujarat , that is why there are mixtures of both in language .
This language is called Kuchi .
However there is no scripture in this language .
If you want to write poetry then you will have to write it in Gujarati script .
Nearby Bhuj is that Anjar city where many times the earthquake took place and the entire city got destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisal-Tural is near Anjar itself .
The stories of Jaisalmer are very exciting .
If we want to return by the way we had come by that route then we will have to take another one month leave and the school will be opened in Bombay .
Then what can be done  Now making the buses of Gujarat fast we will take the journey of a train .
Small trains of metre gauge reach Rajkot from Bhuj .
From there another train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad to Broad gauge will reach Bombay .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through bad situations nowadays .
Due to the fear of recession and increased fear in South Asia tourism has had a deep impact .
With regard to tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan tourism enumerated in the major states of the country has been seen very less .
According to the recent numbers issued by the Rajasthan government , the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 is 10 percent less in comparison to 2008 .
According to the number the number of national tourists is 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists is 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 there were a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists in Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were there in comparison to that in 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 countrymen and 73 lakh 414 foreign tourists were there .
People associated with tourism are very worried due to this situation .
The director of Rajputana Holiday Makers Sanjay Kaushik has said that due to incidents of trade recession and terror tourism has been affected badly .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop and develop strong basic structures of our country .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists coming from France is maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism this year has cut a lot .
This is the first time since 2000 that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has decreased .
From the point of view of tourism nothing is happening .
For desert , palace , fort , pond , forest tourists everything has been kept in the old condition .
To work on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism in the area of tourism all the governments say that nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
Along with foreign tourists , the incidents of rape and disturbance happening in Rajasthan in the last few years have also spoiled the pictures of this state internationally .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry to the state several years ago but it was limited to newspapers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1996 .
It provides facilities like accommodation , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units in this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 models , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one passenger single and two travellers Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the situation of this corporation has worsened for some years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was Rs . 185 lakh which was estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The hotel condition of this corporation is such that in the last five years even forty percent houses of this hotel did not get filled .
Along with the hotel the other islands of Nigam have also faced big losses .
Main among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There is no attraction of tourists towards this railway .
Even after reducing the fare it could not attract tourists .
In such a situation the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair is less visible .
In 2007 - 08 the number of tourists made in this fair in the form of RTDC has decreased to 217 this year from 398 foreign tourists .
In the midst of all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . the Royal Railway .
There is uninterrupted benefit due to this railway .
Last year RTDC earned Rs . 95 crores from this railway .
In the area of tourism in Rajasthan being disturbed due to this destruction is natural .
Tourism is the biggest festival of Rajasthan economy .
If a person has a desire to do something then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has proved it by making modern city Ambo valley in the Sahadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
The dreams that he dreamt of seeing success happens a little everyday shows happiness in his eyes .
His happiness was seen during the inauguration of his own airport in Ambo Valley .
The work of Ambo Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been successful in making its place in the form of a beautiful city .
Spread in an area of more than 10 , 000 acres this city has made hotels , houses and other facilities available on only 9  land .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been provided .
Many entrepreneurs have come forward to build their own houses in this city made for crores of people and today there are around 800 families in this city .
Earlier entrepreneurs and adults bought their homes here in the form of holiday homes but now they have made it their home and are coming to Mumbai for work from here itself .
Behind Ambe Valley is the fort of Koyarigarh which provides the beauty of this place .
The ruins of Likabali in West Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple were found after excavation .
Statues of Padmasambhava and goddess are found carved on the stone blocks of this temple which are found mostly in the dilapidated condition .

The statue of Devi Durga Dussehra is found at this very place .
Behind the names of these statues and places many sweet stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of cedar and pine are still telling the glorious story of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari goddess found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and ancient stories the glory of Tamreshwari Devi is found .
During the reign of the Chait kings on the north - eastern hills this goddess had remained untouched till far .
The people here worship Goddess .
Here only was Narvali which was later closed by king Gaurinath Singh .
Some remains of other ruins were found in the Lohir district of Arunachal .
This is called the ruins of Bhishma Nagar .
According to the stories prevailing here this place is also ancient Vidarbha , where once King Bhishmak was king .
Brahmakund is located below the Lohit river which is a famous place of Lohit district .
The tribes of Digaru , Mishmi etc . here guide the travellers .
These people themselves also have faith in this Kunda .
The famous Parashuram Kund is near the Brahmakund .
During Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins mentioned in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal , the ruins of Rong of Diwang - Valley district are also very historical .
The ruins of a brick pond near Rong tell their stories even today .
The ghats of bathing , ripe stairs and ruins of a broad road surrounded by petals on all the four sides of another pond still present their ancient grand tale .
We reached ero in four hours by jeeping from the upper city of Assam , North Laxmipur .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subsiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotise the visitors .
This is that charming place where companions live .
It took us a long time to reach here before making way for jeep .
On reaching here the scenes of high cedar trees , beautiful premieres , violets , wild currents , strawberries and rosary enjoy the tourists coming here .
Apple and potato are very much here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of refugees .
After doing their tired work the companions made this place the heaven .
Rice is cultivated here .
This place is called the reservoir of rice .
Ten miles long this landmass is the living example of their labour and farming .
Their requirement of irrigation gets mixed with the Kali Nadi .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight also falls towards the shining redness arising in the sky in the midst of snow laden mountain ranges on the left side .
The air is very cold .
In the weather along with cold you also feel moisture .
Beneath the trees on hearing the crystal clear voices we get to see the sand lying on the floor of the wood .
Nothing is seen more in weather because of slowness before sunrise and foggy .
Eyes get stuck on the eastern slope .
He feels like sitting on a bench kept in the verandah .
As soon as the hands touch the light sounds of the bright layer of the sails begin to shine and the hands go away as the feeling of cold comes in the hands .
Thousands of miles away from our country this is the first experience in the life of Switzerland to spend the night in this small village amidst snowy mountains .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this more time has been spent in Geneva or its nearby areas .
The dense population located in the valley on both the sides of the Saru river is spread till far on the slopy slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland , the valley of Roman , on both the sides of which are located several small and big cities .
Along with the Ron river the car on the highway and the road is clearly visible .
A distance of 300 kms and a journey of one and a half hours by a vehicle the parallel of Jeneva lake and half of the Ron river coming from the east meet with the Ron river Montro near the city named Jeneva lake which is called French Lake Lema .
100 km long and 10 km wide Geneva city is located in the western part of this lake .
The lake here again moves towards the west through the river .
The mountain ranges of Dyani and Lake Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke we reached on the mountainous roads in the north leaving the highway on the left side by exit .
Due to the slope of the mountain being southern the sun rises at noon .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow here is almost as less as possible .
The higher the density of snow increases the more it goes .
Despite good snowfall accumulating on both the sides of the road , special cold does not occur in the air due to clear sky and bright sun .
After completing a journey of about 20 kms on this roaming hilly road in half an hour we reached a small village named Thal .
Shale - This is a big multi-purpose bunch made up of wood with slopy roof .
Along with the arrangement of keeping a car in a basement made of this three storied cement concrete there is also a room for controlling essential services like cartilage , water , landridge .
Switzerland is famous for the cultivation of grapes .
This is the main center of making wine - grapes intoxication .
37 percent land of the entire cantonment is cultivated by grapes .
The garden of grapes in the village located on both the sides of the Ron Valley provides a unique view of the beauty there .
Taking in the gardens of grapes , strolling , taking a break in the night in the village there and making a drink of grapes is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named earlier there is a big museum of grapes in a village house built in 12th century to see which foreign tourists keep on making advance booking .
Once again we are going through the deserted forest of Davan .
The mind was getting worse by the question of children going on till three-four kms .
Then only a turn comes the dramatic and charming change of the scene .
Right in front , on the left side of the road deep valley on the top of the slope there are many houses .
People are skiing on the slopes above the village .
The dense forest of cedar trees is spread till the head of the mountain on the skiing slope .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the house of the settlement are shining with the sun rays .
We reached the village in five minutes .
This silence is spread here as well .
From the peaks of the mountains on all the four sides to the valleys is the kingdom of white snow .
In the next five minutes we reached a big circular chakra in the middle of that cabin .
The name of Kasbar is Liukarabad .
The population of Lucknow settled at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level is about 1500 .
1700 apartments and shelters with a capacity of 6900 beds , 28 hotels for accommodation of 1500 , camping site for tents , 90 bed rehabilitation center and 50 restaurants here we can estimate the number of tourists , sportspersons and ascetics coming here .
Till now a total of 65 heat waves have been obtained in Leukarabad .
With this 40 lac litres -LRB- per day -RRB- of hot water can be reached in the small and big 30 thermal pools made in the entire pool of water , some pools are also there in five star hotels and pocket followers of different income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a hot feeling .
The thick level of snow is shining on the roofs of the house in bright sunshine .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albininin village is one of the preserved places of the national importance in Switzerland .
It was said in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim 's taxi , therefore there is no checking .
The journey is on , the state is on the other , but the mountain is the same , the trees and plants are also one , the air is also the same .
Moisture in the whole body is also one .
The shine of the weather during the rainy season is also one .
As soon as the project of Darjeeling safari is completed the decision of taking a joke of carriage is taken first .
Carsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens are filled with dhoti jungles .
Excellent tea is famous for production .
Moving towards Darjeeling from Siliguri the tea gardens welcome you in the form of laughter .
In the middle of the tea gardens the heart gets enchanted just by going through the road for the first time .
On one side green mountains full of jungles and deep green fields on the other side .
Sometimes the jungles here and sometimes tea gardens are seen .
The empire of greenery all around .
Once upon a time it was difficult to see these natural jungles and trees of tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The jungle was as beautiful as a tea garden .
Creation looks marvellous on the streets .
Like the rice of snakes tails and moulded roads were moving .
Time was also passing .
Whatever was not cut is forest and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
Many dense forests were visible from afar .
This was Carciang.
Standing at one place here we make the program of roaming all day .
That is why we set out to roam around Carsiang with a car .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles on all four sides .
We had to leave the vehicle very low to reach up to the staircase that is deer park .
Despite being filled with the beauty of Karsingh I have not yet been able to develop or become famous in the form of tourist spots .
Although the condition is very clean .
Despite the desolate roads reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles the joy of walking amidst greed and smoke was giving us the thrill .
Next place was Eagle Craig .
On the other side of this city at a height is a point .
This is called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to commit suicide by jumping from here .
Nowadays it is connected with a park and restaurant .
There is a dome here on which on looking at the entire city from the top a beautiful scene can be seen .
In the tea gardens nearby women are efficient in making tea leaves with very fast hand holding towel on their backs .
There is a museum outside the Carsiang city , but that day we could not go there , because the circumference of open weather in tea gardens was very important .
Next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
This place was very thrilling but it was very worried that how will we roam if it rains
But the connection was very good that on reaching till Rock Garden we were able to enjoy sunrise .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The way to reach here is even more pleasant than this .
If you go a little below from here then you will find Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst stones the view of waterfalls is worth seeing .
We found in Rock Garden that if waterfalls are charming in the empire of rocks then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Gangamaya is rocky .
These two places are located very low in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw the air loop in Darjeeling climbing upwards with the help of a car .
From here the entire hill and city of Darjeeling is seen by the help of telescope .
The temperament of the weather was good till now .
But the one we proceeded towards the monastery , knowing from where the clouds started gathering and sparkling .
Planning for walking and shopping in Malrode in the evening .
During the journey of Darjeeling the journey of Toy Train makes it even more attractive .
Toy train journey from Darjeeling to Darjeeling through sleep and Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in the Mirik lake and a little breakfast in the garden here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazaar on this route , where sweaters etc . made by Nepali artisans are found .
There is an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
Here there is no greenery of tea gardens but there is a sound of forest - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolehgaon , which are full of forest - waterfalls .
But due to lack of time I could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata for roaming in the winters in Darjeeling but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here itself tied me .
A journey of my recent times was very thrilling and charming .
This journey was neither of foreign nor of outer Rajasthan , was very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an thrilling subject in which sometimes the journey attracts us and sometimes a special place , a ship of water or a royal train or a pink city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people get attracted .
The place where I am going to say that it was made about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place was made in reality that is worth praising in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
In my ears even today my guide Ram Babu was thinking of Meena . could not even imagine that I could stay in this way in my jungle .
Fifty percent stuff is this area .
Suddenly I realized that so many local people did not get work in the Heritage Hotel .
The residents of Ajmer used to work in Jaipur before Ram Babu and now this is such a royal garden .
He has rebuilt his activities in a different style .
The estimation of Saheba is such a garden .
There no one will ever address you in English .
Such bugyals are really a peaceful and comfortable place .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is to introduce it to the nearby areas as well .
Those who spend their holidays in the royal way of Rajasthan , how many Bhutanese travellers in Bhangarh . There is no need to go away . Among the residents of Jaipur , very few people might have spent the night in this area .
After opening such gates many big people of the country and abroad have come here .
I remember that night when Shabana had invited me there but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he had himself gone to Bhangarh by mistake .
This time suddenly I reached there to invite my foreign guests , as if those who want to spend a good holiday in less time then they should go to such a bag .
This garden is one among those seven gardens where the king of Albert took rest to hunt .
It was constructed in the twentieth or twentieth century .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shade of dense trees the first glimpse of such a garden will hypnotise you .
The way you will be welcomed inside you will feel that here you will be able to concentrate on divine peace .
Manglachar ' s mantra is told to be simple with hand binding .
We had reached in the evening and decided that we will set out to cover the garden .
My table sister Jackie woke up with a joke : this is very charming .
Inspired by all the havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is the light house here .
Everything new and artistic , it is not surprising that such a garden has been rewarded recently .
The manager fixed our program for the morning .
First of all walked with Ram Babu and then roamed in the jeep of Bhangarh .
Walking on the crater path we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the light of the sun was expanding gradually .
We saw Sukhi lake so that farmers can cultivate .
This year it did not rain but for the first time it was observed to be the cultivation of tobacco .
The opportunity to see rural life for Jackie was very enjoyable .
After this we went to Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning we saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
It's a million dollars.
While leaving such bugyals they say goodbye to us by eating our jaggery and curd in the traditional way .
Now we realized why tourists come here to spend so much money .
I have heard that a tour package has been prepared to see the lives of the tribals .
That's right.
Definitely this is done in not only one state but also in many states and tourists show special enthusiasm in this tour .
These tours are usually made for four days to two weeks and at this time the tourists are taken to different places .
Among these staying there , eating etc . are also included .
This way an attempt has been made to travel such a place where there is not much development and there is no effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this old tourist sites etc are also there .
Besides this concentration is also given on eating fried food .
Actually the aim of such travel is to bring the tourists face to face with the tradition of lodging and lodging in these places .
Although it feels a bit difficult to imagine but such a tour is really thrilling and a different experience .
There is a different fun of a bus journey .
Despite being with many of them you can take the pleasure of staying alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can read books for a long time without interruption .
Yes , it is a fact that along with spending a lot of time in less expense and peace this journey claims to you all .
For enjoying this trip it is necessary to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching a foreign place while roaming around in a bus .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , elderly people of military , children etc . get rid of this journey and there is arrangement of leaves for both of them .
As such tickets are cheaper than before therefore in the end the bus journey is better than plans .
Instead of taking tickets on both the sides take information about round trips .
It is cheap .
Goods related rules are made specially hence enquire about the weight of the luggage .
It does not happen that you have to leave your luggage on terminal or you have to pay an extra fare .
Along with this you should also know the rules of insurance or compensation from the tour company .
Carry on bags is appropriate for this journey .
Because it gets stuck on the top of the seat .
Keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of the goods is yours .
From where you board the bus you reach the fixed time one hour before .
In busy weather you should keep this in mind specially .
Actually , the sooner you reach the better place to sit .
Remember the comfort while choosing a place to sit .
There is more drizzle in the back and one is not able to move straight towards the front .
If you go to the bathroom again and again then take a place towards the corner and if you do not like to get very tired then it will be better if you take a seat towards the window .
Now it's a trick.
If you are both trying to walk then first sit in the seat of the angle and then keep your bag on the nearby seat .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then this plan will be successful .
If there is facility of bathroom in the bus then keep in mind that while choosing the place to sit because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Discuss with the bus driver or conductor .
By this you will be able to know many important information .
While cleaning the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this time you will not leave your luggage in the place of your luggage because if it is lost the residents will not take its responsibility .
Wherever the bus stops come back in time .
If you do not get time you can take a new passenger at your place and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .
It is said that if you do not see Rome in Europe then you did not see anything .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for many things .
Rome the capital of Italy is one of the oldest cities in the world from where the development of civilization takes place .
This is the reason that its imprint on western civilization is worth seeing .
Rome , located beside the Taiwan river , is a pilgrimage for the Roman Catholic religious followers because the residence of the main pope of this religion is in Rome .
Ancient Rome is located on seven hills .
In the fourth century a wall , cervical wall was built around it .
The ruins of this can be seen around Rome even today .
For ancient buildings and many ruins Rome is famous in the whole world .
With royal palace , beautiful church , beautiful fountains , domes and magicians this city hypnotises in its first glimpse .
This huge and invaluable building of white marble dedicated to the ruler of Italy , Divine Victor Emmanuel began to be built in 1885 and ended in 1911 .
In front of it is the idol of Emperor Imanuel sitting on a horse , which takes 20 years to build .
Here unmarried soldiers sacrificed in the First World War were buried .
The carvings of this memorial and the victory marks built on it are worth visit .
This is also a museum .
If you are interested in artwork then definitely take care of it .
Along with the memorial not only Rome but the famous and magnificent turn of Italy is ' Piazza Venezia ' .
Built in the middle of Rome this verandah is famous as the Vijay Chowk of Delhi .
Besides this Piata di Spagna is also very popular among tourists and people come to visit each other in the evening .
After enjoying Piazza Venezia you must go to Rome 's famous road i . . Via del course .
The big shops , churches and palaces built here enhance the beauty of this road .
This way is the main road of Rome .
This unique building is built on the Capitoline Hill and is located at a very high altitude .
For climbing above this the famous ladder Michael Angelo was built in 1536 .
Infront of Capitoline in front of the horse is the idol of Emperor Marx Orleans who ruled Rome from 160 - 180 AD .
This beautiful idol will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on the Capitoline is also a different identity of this building .
There is a church , museum and ancient temple in Capitoline Complex .
The symbol of Rome is calcium .
This large verandah was built in 80 AD and 50 thousand audience can sit here simultaneously .
In colosseum gladiators i . . swordsmen show their duties .
This would not have happened amongst us , it would have been fighting with wild animals .
Whether it is with the other swordsmen or with the animals while waking up confusion in the mind , till the time one 's death takes place .
There were many forums in ancient Rome .
We did n't tell that the place to visit was called Forum .
All social , religious , economic , political etcetera of the city used to take place here .
Among these the most famous forums were Roman and the remains of Raj Bhavan , temples and pillars are still present here .
Seeing this the importance of ancient Rome can be estimated very well .
Panthiyan - This magnificent ancient temple was built in 27 AD .
In the middle of its huge dome there is an open space of 30 feet .
For this place devotees feel that their prayers are going straight to the gods .
Inside the temple idols of gods and goddesses are made all around .
Although in 61 AD this temple was converted into a church .
There are many gardens in Rome but Villa Borgis is incomparable .
This is why do not forget to see it in Rome .
You must also go to the museum here because if you do not see this then you will miss the opportunity to see beautiful carvings .
The idol built here is unique and so lively that it feels like speaking at present .
Here first Napoleon 's sister Polin , whose marriage took place in the Borgis royal family , an idol sleeping in her palanquin looks so lively that you will not be able to see for a while .
The special attraction of Rome is the fountains here .
There are approximately 300 buildings here in which beautiful fountains are there .
The most famous fountains here are trivial fountains .
It is believed that if someone goes to Rome again then he should pay a penny in this fountain with a desire .
By doing this the desire gets fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city is not complete until you see Vatican City .
In the sixth century this place is the residence of the highest religious head Pope of the Roman Catholic religious followers .
Although it is in Rome itself but in 1926 the status of an independent city was given .
You must see the famous St . Peter 's Church , St . Peter 's Square , Fountains , Museum etc . of Vatican City .
Really it will show you a different world and you will always feel like remembering .

What else do you want.
The fare of cruise is tea - snacks , food etc .
Always with entertainment .
Reaching the capital Mal you can have the fun of entertainment , activities according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater launch .
If you suddenly stand in front of yourself on a plane strolling around the big airport then it will be a toy .
But this Tuin Ooty plane with a 12 - 15 sitting place is excellent in the form of a destination for roaming the island group like Maldives .
One can not know when suddenly he gets into the air to run like a speed boat on the water .
Throughout the flight you feel as if you are climbing on an ordinary plane .
Always below your eyes -LRB- seeing different kinds of blue water of Maldives -RRB- Resort island and Prabal islands .
How clear is everything looked .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of those with whom there are 20 C planes .
If you want you can travel in a flight of around Rs . 4 , 000 -LRB- every person -RRB- in an hour or you can hire the entire plane for a day long -LRB- if there is a need for a taxi . -RRB- .
If you go from Malle Island to any other island then a sea plane will be required because there is only one way of traveling between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you never want that end .
Sea plane is made on the island of Maldives from 12 kilometers to 183 kilometers -LRB- frozen Mavilavaru -RRB- .
We were in the shops of the biggest antique and supplier of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Mall .
All the Salesmans had listened very carefully to the speeches delivered by the President of Maldives Mr . Nashik at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier .
In a way I could not see the president or prime minister speaking so much in any Hindustani .
But when there is a question of a new existence being created on this earth then it is necessary to be so serious .
Many people will also be able to see the meeting point done under water by the cabinet of Maldives in October but Maldives will feel that if the wrath of nature takes it away from us then how impoverished will the world be .
There is a different kind of thing in its beauty .
This small country does not seem so beautiful .
While going towards Jetty to return to that cruise again from that journey of the market when we turned back on our way to the sea water then we realized how much people here understood the value of this beauty .
The water is so clear that in the light of lamppost colorful fish is seen in a few metres deep .
This is that part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
You will be fortunate to have seen some crickets clearly in the water of the sea or river connected with any city of India .
On coming to the top of Ambie Aquarine it feels as if two hours have been spent in the luggage .
Koral Rif -LRB- Munga Chattan -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will find refreshment in crampons .
Shortly before the address of President Nashik we were standing outside his official residence .
It is not believed that we were in front of the highest personality house of any country , no security personnel could be seen from far off places .
We were enjoying taking photographs of the garden just fifty metres away by moving our hands inside the door of its bungalow .
Can you think of any leader 's house in India like this
It was also known that presidents used to go to their office two blocks before crossing the road while walking on foot .
Everything in the matter of Maldives surprises us .
That is why we were waiting for Brussels the next day .
It seemed as if this day would be special .
We took a boat from the cruise in the morning and took it to Airport Island .
From there cutting the curve of the runway we reached the base of Trans Maldives .
The next day in the evening when the cruise was reaching near the ship then we immediately recognised the aeroplane passing above .
I saw a lot of pictures .
But then did we know that next day we will get a chance to ride on this plane .
We were going to Rangoli Island situated at a distance of five kilometres from the Sea Planetarium of Trans Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see thousands of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives while flying at a height of approximately a thousand metres .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
In thrill and excitement breathing stops .
But on reaching at Conrad Resort of Hilton Hotel on Rangoli Island it felt as if we have come to another world .
In such a world which has no relation with outside world .
There was no such relation that the beauty and luxury found here was difficult to get out .
Travellers can also walk on foot or in battery operated cars .
From Jetty to the main island that on both sides of the bridge the view of water life was unique .
Until now we have not been able to fit with the surrounding nature , we have reached such a place which was unimaginable .
Descending down several metres above the stairs in the sea we reached such a room of glass which was under water .
This room was actually a dining room .
On all sides small and big fishes of rocks , coral , snorekelling and scuba diving people were seen continuously beyond the glass .
The imagination of eating and drinking on a decorated floor over there is very exciting .
The fare for seeing and underwater lunch on this island from Malaysia to Airlines is 47 thousand rupees per person .
I was not thinking of returning from there .
We were ready to leave our passport in the water .
But I knew it was not possible .
With the sad heart I returned with the hope that sometimes luck will come here again .
I was planning to go out of Delhi for a long time but due to busyness of work this was not possible .
Wildlife was very fond of childhood therefore I thought lets go to Jim Corbett this time .
This was the second bike journey after biking till Pengg Lake before Khardungla Pass in Ladakh in 2006 .
We left for Jim Corbett from Delhi on 27 December but the hustle and bustle that we got out with our enthusiasm reduced our speed .
The road between Hapur and Gajraula was very tiring .
Again on them is the path of despair and misery .
Many times it felt that it would fall .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park was 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was just near the park in Tikuli , which we had booked beforehand .
That day there was no special program , despite being cold we went for a stroll on the edge of Kosi .
After staying there for two - three hours we left for Corbett museum which was near Ghangadi gate two kilometres away .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was evening to return .
I had come out firmly from Delhi that I would definitely see tigers roaming in the jungle but I had seen tigers throughout the night in a dream .
Suddenly I could hear a loud sound at night and then the dogs that began to challenge continued for two hours .
At first Kaladungi and Corbett came to the advice of roaming fruits .
Kaladungi is located at a distance of thirty kilometres on the Corbett Place road .
There is an exhibition of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi where some special things related to his life are kept .
It was half past twelve to return .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village itself .
After reaching the resort the jeepsy of the safari was waiting for us .
It is said that they made arrangements for sighting in the number one site Bijrani .
It is said about number one that grass is more there and tigers come this way for protection from cold at this time .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide that for roaming for four hours we would take two and a half rupees .
We went out for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two teeth elephants , which had long teeth .
I picked up the photographs .
In the middle of this the guide started tracking the lions .
The guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park , many of them have died in these days .
At many places we got to see the footprints of the tiger , but due to the lack of sight seeing the tiger the heart was restless .
On the third day we were returning to Delhi .
A ghost of tiger was pressed on my head .
Then only I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I called him that way .
I told him I had come to Corbett .
He asked if I had seen a tiger .
His words were engraved like a shore .
I said slowly that I did not see .
There was no permission to take a bike inside the park .
One of us said that take a safari for roaming inside .
