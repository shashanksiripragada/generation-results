Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
Sindhu on one side of Kutch and Gujarat on the other side therefore there is a mixture of both in language .
This is called ' Kutchi ' .
As such this dialect is not its own script .
If you want to write Kutch then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where earthquake has occurred many times and the entire city has been destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisalmer - Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisalmer is very interesting .
If we come by the same route from where we had come then we will have to take a full month 's leave and on this side school will be opened in Mumbai .
So what to do : Now by bringing fast buses of Gujarat on a journey of railways .
The small train of metre gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of metre gauge will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad to Broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad times these days .
Due to global recession and increasing danger in South Asia tourism industry has started to suffer a lot .
With regard to tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country has been recorded very less during these days .
Fresh statistics released recently by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has decreased more than ten percent as compared to the year 2008 .
According to statistics 9 . 87 percent of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent decrease in the number of foreign tourists has come .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in 2008 , out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 country and 10 lakh 77 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried because of this situation .
Sanjay Kaushalik , director of Holiday Makers of Rajput has said that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have influenced tourism industry completely .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not even develop the strong base of tourism there .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
From the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , England , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism the latest year has been the best for Rajasthan .
After 2002 AD this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism nothing new is happening .
Desert , havelis , forts , swimming jungles are all old to serve the tourists .
In the tourism sector the government does the work on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
There along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years incidents of rape and slaughter have also made the image of this kingdom marvellous at international level .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry in the state before the year itself but it has remained contiguous with papers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism .
With the aim of giving encouragement to tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1987 AD .
This corporation provides the facility of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 battalions , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one carriage unit and two trains , Palace on Wheels and Rajasthan on Wheels , but the condition of this corporation has also been spoiled for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in the year of 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that even in the last five years forty percent rooms of its hotels have not been completed .
Along with hotels other units of the company are also making it a big mistake .
The main among these is Rajasthan of Wheels .
This railway could not become the attraction of tourists .
Despite less fares this can not attract tourists .
In the same way in recent years there has been a dearth of tourists regarding the Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC this year the number decreased to 217 .
The satisfaction of RTDC among all this is that there is no dearth of attraction of tourists towards palace on wheels i . . royal train .
This railway is continuously bringing benefits .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this railway .
Located in the area of tourism in Rajasthan this deficiency is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If the person has the desire to do something in his heart then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has fulfilled it by establishing modern city Amboveli in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
Seeing the dream that he had dreamt progressing day by day , his eyes shine with happiness .
His happiness was also seen at the time of the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has become successful in making its place as an excellent city .
In this city spread over more than 10 thousand acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been made on only 9 percent land .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Several industrialists came forward to build their houses in this city made for crores of rupees and today there are around 800 families in this city .
Initially the industrialists and employees bought their homes here as hollywood homes and now they have made it their first home and from here they travel to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambe Valley itself is the fort of Koyarigarh which provides the beauty to this region .
The broken ruins of Likawali in West Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found in the excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple excavation of idols of Kamala and gods - goddesses has been obtained which are mostly in a fragmented state .
Malini Thana is an important place in this area .
On this spot a decorated idol of Devi Durgini is found .
Behind this idol and the naming of the place many sweet tales and old tales are popular among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still narrating the glorious story of Arunachal .
The temple of Tameshwari Devi obtained from these remains is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the description of the month of Tamreshwari Devi is found .
The time of the Chetia kings was recognised far and wide in the north-eastern hills .
The tribal people here used to worship the goddess .
The sacrifice of humans was also offered here which was later stopped by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
It is called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is situated in the midst of the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the popular stories here this place is Vidarbha , where at one time the king used to reign .
Brahmakund is located in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of the Lohit district .
The tribes of Deeg , Mishmi etc . here guide the travellers .
These people themselves also have great respect for this Kunda .
The famous Parashuram Kunda is near the Brahmakund itself .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal , the ruins of roaming in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The ruins of the brick pond near Roing are still narrating their stories .
The ruins of bathing , cracking stairs and being surrounded by forts on all the four sides of a pond and remains of wide roads are still singing silently of its ancient grandeur .
We reach ero from four hours through jeep from North Lakhimpur city of Upper Assam .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this pleasant mountainous place hypnotise the hearts of the visitors .
This is that charming place where people live .
It took several days for the jeep to reach here before the path was made .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premieres , vaults , wild cat , strawberry and raspberry enjoy .
Apple and cinnamon are produced a lot here .
There is a valley spread till 26 kilometres at a height of about 1524 metres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the people of Apatha .
With their untiring efforts the people of their fathers have made it their heaven .
The cultivation of rice is very much here .
This place is the store of rice .
This ten miles long surface is a living example of their labour and skill in farming .
The requirement of its irrigation gets fulfilled with the Kali Nadi .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
Eyes fall on the horizon in the middle of the snowy mountains of the left hand while standing in the sky on the horizon .
It is very cold in the air .
Along with the coolness occurring in the environment one also feels the moisture .
A sheet of snow covered on the surface of wood can be seen from the sound of trash below the feet .
One gets blurred in the environment and one does not see much because of the humidity spreading before sunrise .
The sight becomes stable on the redness of the east .
One feels like sitting on a rock lying in a cave .
As soon as the hand is attached , the palate of the pocket sticks to the sound of the common rubber and the hands separate from the shock because of the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending a night in this small village settled amidst these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third trip to Swiss .
Before this a lot of time was spent in the life or nearby .
Dense population settled on both the sides of the small flowing river and the valley is spread very high on the common slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland Rhone valley on both the sides of which several small and big cities are settled .
The highways along the Ron river and the cars running on them start looking clear .
300 kilometres away and half an hour journey from the car then along with the plains of Geneva lake and half a roun river the Ron river coming from the east side meets in the Geneva lake near the city named Montro which is called Lock Large in Fench .
Geneva city is situated on the western part of this lake 100 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide .
From there the lake again moves towards the west after becoming a river .
On the left side is Dhawal , Gangtok and Alps mountain ranges .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke on the left side by export we leave this highway on the mountainous road towards north .
Because of the slope of the mountain being towards the south the sun is giving a lot of heat to all the corners of the afternoon .
As compared to the valley the quantity of snow is less here - almost like it .
As we move towards height , the density of snow starts increasing .
Despite good snow falling on both sides of the road there is no special coldness in the air due to the clear sky and shining sun .
After completing a journey of about 20 kilometres on this circular hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal .
Chalet slopes are full of slopes , large multi-storied bags made of wood .
In the solder made of cement concrete of three storey bungalows there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , washing etc . along with parking of vehicles .
Valiya is famous for grapes cultivation in Switzerland .
This alcohol is the main center of making alcohol of grapes .
37 percent land of the entire cantonment is cultivated by grapes .
In the villages located on both sides of the Ron Valley the gardens of grapes provide a unique area to the beauty there .
Travelling till the grapes garden , taking rest in the villages there and drunkards taking them to the liquor shops is an integral part of tourism business here .
There is a very big museum of grapes in a fort built in the 12th century in a small village named Aga , to see which foreign tourists have to register .
Once again we move out from the middle of that very jungle , which was frozen with dawn .
The heart gets very nervous by the questions that happen to children on the entire road for three to four kilometres .
All of a sudden dramatic and charming change comes in sightseeing .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley towards the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses are settled .
People are skiing in snow on a flat slope from above the village .
The dense forest of cedar is situated up to the top of the mountain above the slope of skiing .
All around there are covered snow .
The roofs of the houses of the population are shining because of the fall of the direct sun rays .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Peace is over here as well .
From the peak of the mountains on all four sides to the valley the kingdom of white snow .
Within five minutes ahead we reach a big round circular path in the middle of that village .
The name of Kasba is Lukrabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Luckerabad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists , players and health workers coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments with a capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels for staying in the shale 1500 , camping site of trains , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants .
Source of hot water has been found in Lukurabad till now .
Out of these 40 lakh litres -LRB- up to 51 . litres -RRB- of hot water is taken to small and big thermal bridges built at various places , some bridges are inside five star hotels and according to the treasures of the people of various income groups .
On reaching the village one feels extreme heat .
In scorching heat large layer of snow is shining above the roof of houses .
The name of Albenin is of this village .
Albenin village is one of the conserved places in Switzerland in the form of national heritage .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim 's taxis , therefore there is no test .
The journey is on , the region is on the other , but the mountain is that itself , the trees and plants are the same that are the good winds .
The moisture accumulated on the whole body is the same .
In the rainy season the blue color is that only .
On the completion of the plan of Darjeeling journey I got the opportunity to see Karsingh first .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , completely covered with the jungle of Dhupi .
Famous for production of excellent tea .
When we moved from Siliguri towards Darjeeling , then at the beginning the tea garden smiling welcomes the coming towards itself .
Passing through the road in the middle of the tea gardens attracts the hearts of the very first time .
On one side is a green mountain full of forests , and on the other side deep greenery .
On this side sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens are visible .
There was a kingdom of greenery all around .
Once I fell in unconscious state , see these natural jungles of tea plantations planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful wilderness was , the more beautiful is the tea garden spread far and wide .
If one glances at the roads on the roads then the scene looks wonderful .
The circular and circular paths of the snakes were passing through .
Time was also passing .
If they were not able to pass then wilderness and tea gardens .
At times small settlements are seen .
From a distance a hill appeared very dense from houses and houses .
This was Kursingh .
Staying here at one place we made a program of roaming all day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we set out on a tour of Kurseong .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests on all the four sides .
To reach up to the deer park the vehicle had to leave very low .
Even after being enchanted with the beauty of Kursingyang it could not be developed in the form of a tourist spot .
Although the city is very beautiful and clean .
Despite the road being deserted the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of crossing the road between the pine trees was giving us a boost .
The place ahead was Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called suside point .
It is said that during the reign of the British lovers used to give life by jumping from here .
Now , it is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a climbing dome here from whose height a beautiful sight is seen by observing the entire city .
In the tea gardens nearby women used to climb on their backs to break the tea gardens running with extreme speed .
There is a museum outside the Corbett city on which we could not go there that day , because it was very necessary to tour the free environment of this garden .
The next day Darjeeling was scheduled to tour .
This was a thrilling experience in itself , but there was a bigger anxiety than that as it continued to rain so how would we return .
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching till Rock Garden we enjoyed the bright sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with wide slopes , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than that .
Going a little below from here we found Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
The view of waterfalls amidst wide slopes from here is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we saw that in the empire of rocks - widespread rocks the waterfalls are present then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Gangamaya is enriched with stones .
Both of these places are very low in the middle of the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Batasia loop in Darjeeling climbing up with the help of a vehicle .
The entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of tubectomy .
The mood of the weather was clear till now .
But where we proceeded towards the monastery , the hustle-bustle appeared from where and began to shine .
In the evening tour and shopping was organised on the Mall Road .
Toy train in Darjeeling increases the joy of journey .
Toy train journey from Darjeeling to Bhubaneswar and from Bhubaneswar to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake and some rest in garden here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where handmade sweaters etc . of Nepali artisans are available .
There is arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its colors are different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but the flow of jungles and waterfalls take place .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are - Ladakh and Lolegaon which are full of forest - waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata for a stroll in the shadow of cold , but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling stopped me here .
A small journey of my recent past was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither of foreign nor of Rajasthan , but very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey pulls towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , ship of water or some city like a royal train or a pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come after being stretched .
The place I am going to talk about is just ready four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place has been situated there , that has really made fun of the jungle .
Not only for people going there but also for people staying there .
In my ears the words of my guide Rambabu Meena resonate , but before that we could not even imagine that we could stay in the jungle like this .
Fifty percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work in heritage hotels as well .
Ajabgarh resident Rambabu used to work in Jaipur earlier and now it is in this unique royal palace Amn Bagh .
He had switched the walking on his own in a new color .
Sahiba ' is the hustle-bustle of Aman Bagh .
Nobody tells you English words there .
Aman Bagh is a real peaceful and comfortable tour of all .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it will introduce you to the nearby areas as well .
In the royal style of Rajasthan some people who spend holidays must have traveled to Bhangarh of Bhutan . Go away , some among the people of Jaipur may have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman garden big people of the country and abroad have gone there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi had called me there with temptation but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh forgetting the road .
This time when suddenly I reached there at the invitation of my foreign guests then I felt that those people who want to take a grand holiday in less time they should definitely go to Amn Bagh .
This garden is a garden saved from those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to hunt .
Its construction was done in nineteen twentieth century .
Its old wall is the witness of those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Aman Garden charms you .
The way you come inside , the way you are welcomed , it appears that here divine peace has been taken care of .
Along with the tying of pearls in the wrist a living pronunciation of the mantra of Mangalacharya is done .
We had reached early in the evening and thought of a turn in front of that garden .
The one who is doing my hospitality , the one who is doing it , suddenly said , ' It is interesting ' .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . It was not surprising that Aman Bag got the award as well recently .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all a pedestrian journey with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on narrow roads we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which gradually the light of sun set .
We saw dry lakes in which the peasants were cultivating .
This year it did not rain but for the first time saw the cultivation of tobacco .
For which such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning - evening I saw a tourist from Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is a million dollar priceless moment .
The custom of calling Amanbagh awakening was that after feeding jaggery and curd he made us leave .
Now it was understood that why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept for showing tribal life .
Is this right
Besides this there is not only one in many states but tourists also show great interest in it .
This journey is normally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
Eating etc . is also included in it .
This way there is an attempt to discover such places where not much development has taken place and where there is no effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this where ancient tourist spots etc . are also present .
Besides this , attention is also given to traditional Kuzhin Peerwa .
Actually , the purpose of such tourism is to make tourists experience the life style and traditions of that place .
Although it seems a bit difficult in thinking but such travels are really fun and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tourism has its own fun .
Despite this being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can spend a lot of time in playing without your favorite book .
Yes , it is necessary that along with spending a lot of time in less expense and peace tourism keep a desire for your patience .
This is the reason that in order to accept this some things have to be kept in mind , especially then , some foreign place is going with the help of bus tourism .
Take a good package before taking a ticket .
Students , senior citizens of the army , children etc . get a discount on this , then there is arrangement of relaxation for two people as well .
Otherwise , it is cheaper to buy tickets from before , therefore in the last moments instead of deciding the bus journey it is better that you plan a little before .
Get information about the circular journey without ticket on both sides .
This falls inexpensive .
Regular rules are special for goods , therefore ask about the height and weight of the goods .
It should not be such that you have to leave your luggage at the station or you have to pay too much .
Also ascertain the rules of compensation for insurance or loss from the tourism company .
Along with it the absorptions are appropriate , take them along .
Because the horse rides on this seat properly .
Also keep in mind that during the journey while changing the bus the responsibility of the goods will be on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the upcoming season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will have the best seat choice .
While deciding the seat keep in mind the convenience .
If a shock is felt at the last seat , then it will not be right to read at the front seat .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again , take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to face much trouble then the seat of the window will be appropriate for you .
Now there is talk of a walk .
If you are in a diameter of two seats then sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bath on the other side .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then the plan will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then while fixing the seat keep this thing in mind as well , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make identity with a bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
Everyone is asked to go out during the cleaning of the bus .
During this do not keep your luggage on the seat , because they do not take the responsibility of losing it .
Wherever the bus stops come back while returning .
If you do not come in time , then you can get a new place in your place and you will have to wait for another bus at the station .
It is said that if we did not see Rome in Europe then we did not see anything .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .
Rome the capital of Italy is among those ancient cities of the world from where civilizations have developed .
This is the reason that its impression is seen on western lifestyle .
Rome , situated on Taibor river , is a pilgrimage for the followers of Roman Catholic religion because the residence of the head of this religion ' Pope ' is in Rome itself .
Ancient Rome was located on seven hills .
In the fourth century a wall , sarvial wall was built all around it .
Its ruins can be seen around Rome even today .
Rome is famous worldwide for old buildings and their ruins .
Having a luxurious palace , magnificent church , beautiful fountains , domes and museums this city keeps you magnificent to attract in the first glance .

In front of the Capeline in the morning on the horse is the idol of the patriot of Emperor Marcus Orleans who ruled Rome till 160 - 180 .
This magnificent statue will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on copper line is also a different identity of this building .
A church , museum and old temple are also built in ' Capitalline Complex ' .
The symbol of Rome is Colosseum .

Gladiators i . . swordsmen used to show their art in colossal .
They used to compete not only with each other but also with wild animals .
Heart shivering these wars , whether with other swords or animals , would continue till the time one of the warriors die .
There were many ' forums ' in old Rome .
Tell us that light meeting places are called forums in Rome .
All the social , religious , economic , political etc activities of the city take place here .
The most famous of them was Forum Romanam and the remains of palaces , temples and pillars are present here even today .
On seeing it Beshak keeps an estimate of the magnificence of ancient Rome .
Pathian : This magnificent ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
Amidst its huge dome there is an open space of 30 feet .
Because of this place devotees feel as if their prayers are reaching straight gods .
Inside the temple idols of gods and goddesses are made all around .
As such this temple was made a church in 601 AD .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Villa Borgice is unmanned .
Therefore do not forget to see it while going to Rome .
You must go to the museum built here as well because you will miss the opportunity to get rid of the best sculpture from it .
The idols built here are incomparable and looks so lively as if they would start speaking sometime .
Here the sister Paulin of Napoleon ' s ancestor who was married to the Borgis royal family , a idol lying on her bed seems so alive that you will not be able to stay without seeing her alone for a while .
The special attractions of Rome are their fountains .
There are approximately 300 buildings here in which magnificent fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trevy Fountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come to Rome again then he should put a coin in the fountain along with this wish .
It is believed that by doing this the desire is fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city will not be complete until you see ' Vatican City ' .
Since sixth century this place has been the residence of the chief religious head Pope of the followers of the Roman Catholic religion .
Although it is in Rome itself , but since 1926 it was given the status of an independent city .
You must see the famous St . Peter 's Church , St . Peter Square , Fountains , Museum etc .
Undoubtedly you will be able to see a different world and will feel you to be remembered forever .

Ginger hotel situated here is an excellent option to spend a lot of enjoyment of cycling , river cruise , cold sea cruise and world famous Goan cuisines on the roads of Goa .
If seen on today 's date then the fare for Maldives to return from Delhi to the cheapest personality is 28 thousand rupees .
After this if you stay in Malaysia and still you can get hotels on less rent but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be small .
Sea cream proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Louis Cruise from Kochi started the only sea cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some reasons Louis Cruise has suspended its services now , but it is likely to happen again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at a rate of at least 5850 rupees per person on the ship MV Ekamerin of Louis Cruise .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are big then children less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
What should be the second
Tea , breakfast , food etc . are included in the fares of Cruise .
With the entertainment of every time .
Reaching Mall the capital you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If suddenly a sea plane is standing in front of you roaming around in big airplanes then you will feel like a snake .
But this twin otter plane of 12 - 15 seats is excellent for roaming in an island group like Maldives .
Running like a speed boat on the surface of water when it flies in the air , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flight of ordinary airplanes .
Every time your sight remains below the window , resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shadows of Maldives .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Tros Mallian is one of them near which is sea plane .
If you want you can travel by air for about four thousand rupees -LRB- per person per person per day -RRB- or the entire sea plane can be taken on rent for a stroll throughout your day -LRB- really big pocket -RRB- .
If you go to any island before Male Island then the journey of Sea Plane will be necessary because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which perhaps will never let you feel like finishing .
Sea plane takes a journey of 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in the best way Mavilavaru -RRB- in the islands of Malana .
We were in the most ancient and memorable shops of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Male .
People selling all were listening very carefully to the speech given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed in the World Weather Conference held in Copenhagen a day earlier .
Honestly I have not seen any Indian listening to the speeches of the presidents or the prime minister so closely .
But when there was a question of the existence of an excellent creation of this earth then this much seriousness was necessary .
Many people might have considered the meeting done in the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but after going to Maldives it feels as if if the wrath of nature has snatched it from us then how much would the world be .
Something like this is special in the beauty there .
In this small country no matter how much beauty is enriched .
Returning from that stroll of the market came towards Jetty for going to its circumambulation when sightseeing went in the waters of the sea running along unprecedented roads then it felt as if the people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that the fish floating in depths of several metres below in the light of the lamppost was watching with all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
If you can see some centimetres clean in the sea or river waters connected to any city of India then you will find yourself to be ruined .
Moving back on M . . . Aquarine we were walking in the brain for two hours in the evening spent in Malaysia .
Corbett National Park was established in an area of 77 square kilometres in the Andaman district .
Even you will find rocks of peacock on the stones attached to the tombs .
Shortly before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the supreme personality of any country , there was no security worker far and wide .
Enjoyingly we were taking pictures of gardens and elephants spreading their hands inside the gates 50 metres away .
Can you think of any common leader 's house in India like this
It was also learned that the president sometimes crossing the road on foot and two blocks ahead reach his office .
Everything was surprising about the Maldives .
That is why I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
It was known that that day was about to be special .
In the morning a boat took us to Airport Island from Corbett .
From there we reached the slope of the runway on the slopes of the Trans Malian .
Last evening when Kufri was reaching near the Mall we immediately recognized the sea plane passing above .
He had seen such pictures.
But then it was not known that the next day there would be a chance of a ride in it .
We had to go to Rangali Island one hundred and fifty kilometres away from the sea plane of Tros Malian .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands lying in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying at a height of approximately thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was the stopping of breath by thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hilton Hotel on the Rangali Island it felt as if we have reached in some other world .
In such a world , which has no relation with any outside world .
The relation was not as much that it was difficult to get out the beauty or splendor there .
Tour of Conrad can also be done on foot or by a battery operated car .
On both the sides of the bridge going till the main island from Jetty waterfalls island was marvellous .
Today we were unable to hear ourselves from the nature nearby , as if we had reached such a place , it was unimaginable .
After descending in the sea water several metres below the stairs we reached such a glass room which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all the sides of glass we were able to see unique types of small and big fishes , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving people .
Sitting on the decorated table there the imagination of food was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of seeing and underwater lunch on this island coming from Male to Sea Plane is 47 thousand rupees for a single person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to bathe in the water of our Parvati .
But they knew that it was not possible .
Turn back with that desire with a heavy heart , then at some point of time , at some point of time drunk will definitely be taken here .
Since many days they were planning to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
If there was a hobby of wild life tourism from childhood then why should not this time go to Jim Corbett
After biking till Pegong lake ahead of Khardungla in Ladakh in 2006 this was the second line tour .
On the afternoon of 27 December we had to leave for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the hustle-bustle that came out of the hustle-bustle sinked our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Dhums from above and bad roads ahead .
Many a times it felt that now it has fallen .
After doing anything we reached Gajrola at 8 in the morning .
Maybe we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Amara resort was in Dhukuli near the park , which we had already enrolled .
That day there was no special program but we came to roam on the bank of Kosi before it was cold .
After spending two - three hours we left for Corbett Museum which was very difficult at a distance of 2 kilometres near Dhangadi gate .
From there we kept going to Ramnagar below .
It was evening walking back .
It was decided from Delhi that if I had seen the lions roaming open in the jungle then I would have seen a tiger all night in a dream .
In the midst of dense nights suddenly a huge thunderstorm arose and after that those dogs who started sneezing did not stop for two hours .
Before this instruction was given to roam Kaladhungi and Corbett waterfalls .
Kaladhugi is 30 kilometres away while Corbett falls on the way to the waterfall .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladhugi , where some important things related to his life are kept .
On coming and coming we got 12 and a half steps .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was coming to this village only .
Safari jeepsy while reaching the resort was waiting for us .
It was told that they had got the arrangement of sighting in the number one side bidder there .
On asking about number one thing we said that the grassy land over there is more and tigers come towards it to prevent cold during this time .
On reaching Bijra we were given a guide , which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We had to walk inside for the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , which had long teeth .
I photographed properly .
In the midst of this the guide started following the tiger .
According to guides there are around 150 tigers in the park , some of them have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their feet but due to the lack of sight of the tiger I was unconscious .
On the third day we had to come to Delhi .
In my mind the past of the tiger was in the morning .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I made that very phone call .
I told him that I am coming to Carbet .
He asked whether he saw a tiger or not .
This word of this became like arrow .
I said gradually , no .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone suggested us that you take safari for inside .
