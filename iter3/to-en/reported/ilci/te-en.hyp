Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , the other one .
On one side of Kuchh is Sindh and on the other is Gujarat , that is why there is a mixture of both in language as well .
It is called ' kuchi ' .
Although there is a saying here , it has no inscription on its own .
If you want to come to Kachhi then you will have to write only in Gujarati script .
Near Bhubaneswar only is that Anjar city where several times earthquakes have occurred and the entire city has collapsed .
The tomb of Jaisal-Torrhal is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisalmer is very charming .
If we return back by the way that way then we had to take a month ' s holiday again and there the schools opened in Mumbai .
But what to do  Now by telling the fast buses of Gujarat we will take a ride on the train .
Small trains going to metre gauge from Bhuj reach Rajkot .
From there one more small train of metre gauge reach Ahmadabad and from Ahmedabad via Bridge reaches Mumbai .
The tourism system which is believed to be the main basis of the economy of Rajasthan is going on in a very inferior state these days .
Due to the acute dangers of rising wildlife sanctuary and south Asia the tourism industry has become very dense .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased a lot these days as compared to major cities of the country .
A new figure released recently by the Rajasthan government is showing that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than ten percent as compared to 2008 .
According to calculations 9 . 87 percent decrease in the number of national tourism and 27 . 36 percent decrease in the number of foreign tourists has come .
In 2008 AD a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came in Rajasthan , out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists participate . In 2009 AD a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik the founder of Rajputana Holiday Makers has said that due to the incidents of Vaishno Devi and Great Kaushalya the tourism industry was very impressed .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not even developed the tourism industry here on a strong , basis .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of French tourists is maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism Rajasthan has spent a lot of time today .
After 2002 this was the first time that there was a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , palaces , forts , ponds , forest everything is also old to enjoy the tourists .
In the area of tourism all the governments say that working with the name of village tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism is very important but nothing has been done in this direction .
Facilities of tourists coming to Rajasthan are also very less available .
Incidents of violence and mobilization have also taken this state 's beauty to art internationally with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan .
The government of Rajasthan has given the status of tourism in Rajasthan some years back but it has become limited to papers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation is an example of the success of Rajasthan government in tourism .
With the aim of increasing the number of tourists in Rajasthan and developing them on the basis of tourism the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
These branches provide the facility of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 branches in this institute .
Among these 39 hotels , 22 motorways , eight restaurants , three journeys , one unit journey and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan wheels , but this institute has also lagged behind for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh and this year there is a possibility of an increase of 632 lakhs in 2009-10 .
The condition of hotels in this institute is such that even in the last five years in these hotels forty percent rooms are not filled .
Along with hotels other shops of the organization also cause a lot of harm to it .
Among these the main are the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Travellers are unable to attract this train .
Despite the reduction in fares this could not attract tourists .
This way in the present times in Pushkar Fair also the interest of tourists was less visible .
In the year 2007 - 08 this fair in the tourist village built after the RTDC had stayed 398 foreign tourists , that is why this year this number has reduced to 217 .
In the midst of all this the interesting thing of RTDC is that there is no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . the city train .
This train is continuously beneficial .
Last year RTDC benefited nine and a half crore rupees by this train .
Due to this deficiency that has come in the tourism sector of Rajasthan it has become quite natural to see the destruction of the tourism sector .
Tourism is the most dependent on the economy of Rajasthan .
If the person wants to do something in his mind then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy showed it to be true by building modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
Whatever dream he dreamt he saw that by looking at it everyday a pleasant glimpse is seen in his eyes .
His joy was seen at the start of Amby Valley Niger Airport as well .
Amby Valley 's work started and today Amby Valley has been successful in making its place a good city .
In this city spread in an area of more than 10 thousand crores hotels , houses and other facilities have been provided in only 9 percent area .
Plants , ponds , waterfalls , ponds and other facilities have been made available in 91 percent area .
Several industrialists have come forward to make their houses in this city only made for forts and today there are around 800 families in this city .
Initially industrialists and rich people bought their comfortable buildings here in the form of holiday hostels but today they have made them their first home and from here they keep on coming to Mumbai for work .
Behind Amby Valley itself is the fort of Koyarigarh which makes this place very beautiful .
The ruins of Likawali in western Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple were found in the excavations .
On the stone pillars of this temple idols of gods and goddesses are found in excavation which are in very dilapidated condition .
Malininath is a major place in this mountain .
At this very place a statue of ten hands of the Durga girls were found .
Behind this idol and region 's nomenclature many sweet tales and ancient tales of the local people are present here .
The ruins of Devilpani ruins are still singing the glorious stories of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi obtained from these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and ancient stories the glory of Tamreshwari Devi is found .
During the reigns of Chetia this goddess is considered to be of far flung areas in the mountains of north - east .
The jungle people here used to worship Goddess .
Here humans were also sacrificed , after that King Gaurinath Singh was imprisoned .
Some more ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar , which is situated in the middle of the Dibang and Diwang rivers .
According to the popular stories here this place was the ancient Vidarbha , where King Bhishmak ruled once .
Brahmakund is in the lower part of Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
The tribes of Deeg , Mishmi etc . here are guides for the travellers .
These people themselves also take great care of this Homkund .
The main Parashuram temple is just near the Brahmakund .
On the day of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal , the ruins of roaming in Diwang - Valley district are also very historical .
The ruins of Konark made of bricks near roaming tell their stories even today .
The relics of bathing , mud and other ponds around which are the walls of mud and the relics of roads wide still hypnotise its ancient grandeur .
We reach ero at four o'clock from the jeep of the upper Assamese Emperor Lakhimpur .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subasiri district .
Located at a height of approximately 4500 feet this pleasant mountainous place allures everyone .
This is the same entertaining place where there is an extremely important situation .
It took several days for jeep to reach here before going through the roadways .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premierezes , wild cat , strawberries and rasberries hypnotise the tourists .
Apple and aluch are very thrilling here .
Approximately at a height of 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the people living in the desert region .
They have made it their heaven .
Here rice is grown a lot .
This place is ' Var Bhandaar ' .
This ten miles long field is a testimony to its labor and agricultural expertise .
Their farming is enough from Kali Nadi .
By pine the beauty of this valley is enchanted .
Located towards the left hand in the middle of the snowclad mountain peak the eye falls on the red colored red colored skies emanating from the sky on the horizons .
There is a lot of cold in the air .
Along with shivering cold you also feel moisture in the environment .
One gets to see the layer of wood in a sound that comes out while keeping the legs .
Because of the weather being silent and dull before sunrise one does not get to see much .
The vision remains on the red color of the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench situated in Balcony .
The thin layer spread just as the hand falls slips with the sound of a mild sound and the hand breaks immediately after getting cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in the life of Switzerland coming to this small village located amidst these mountains covered with snow .
This is my third foreign country in Swiss .
A long time before this was spent in Janiva or nearby .
Maximum people of both the sides of the valleys of the thin Balkhetti river are spread till very high on the rocks .
This is the main river of Switzerland , Ron Ghati on both sides of which are many small and big cities .
The national highway along the Ron river and the vehicles passing above it are clearly visible .
300 kms away and half an hour journey in the car , on the other side of the Janiwa waterfall and along half the Ron river coming from the east along the Ron river Montro , the Geneva waterfall near the city which is called Lake Lama in French is included in it .
Geneva city is situated in the west of this 100 kms long and 10 kms wide lake .
From there the lake then flows westward after becoming a river .
On the right side while flowing brightly , the sky touching Alps mountain peaks are there .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke we left this highway on the left side by the road , will come in the mountainous way of the north .
Because of the hilly plains being southern the third sun is giving sunshine to all corners .
In comparison to the valleys the percentage of snow is not less than that of here .
As the snow moves towards the height , the density of snow is increasing .
Despite excessive snowfall on both sides of the road the weather is calm and shiny due to sun there is no coldness in the air .
After covering a journey of about 20 kms on this barren mountainous road in half an hour we reached a small village named Thele .
Located on the roof of rocks and slopes , large storied buildings are built with wood .
In this building of three storeys along with cars being built in the foundation stone of cement concrete there are parts of regulation of essential facilities like electricity , water , liquidity .
Wallai is famous for grapes in Switzerland .
This is the main center of wine grapes .
In the total area of canal 37  grapes are found .
The grapes of the villages located on both the sides of the Rong Valley give a magnificent view of the beauty there .
Walking on foot in the grapes , touring them , providing night rest to the villagers there and exhibiting taste of alcohol by taking them to the liquor industry is a part of tourism department here .
There is a very big museum of wine in a narrow craft built in 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to do agrim booking .
Once again we crossed that deserted jungle .
Children crossing three - four k . . are still unhappy with the question of asking .
Suddenly a fascinating scene brings dramatic and charming changes .
Right in front , on the left side of the road in the field situated on a very high valley a beautiful group of houses is established .
People are skiing in snow on the fields flat from the edge of the village .
Above the skiing slope till the peak of the Konda the dense forest of deodar is spread .
There is dense snow all around .
The reason for sun rays falling on the houses in the village is shining .
In five minutes we reached that village .
The same peace is spread here as well .
Snow laden empire ranging from mountain peaks to valleys all around .
Within five minutes after coming we reach a big round wheel situated in the middle of that cycle .
The name of dragon is leukarabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the number of people of Lukarabad is about 1500 hundred .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and healthy people coming here can be estimated with the fact that there are 1700 apartments with facilities of 6900 beds and 28 hotels for accommodation of 1500 beds , tamboo camping site , 90 bedded health center and 50 restaurants .
Till now 65 waterfalls of hot water have been found in Lukarabad .
Forty lac litres -LRB- up to 510C -RRB- out of these everyday the whole of the circular area of the water reaches till the small and big dharamsalas situated at every step , some bridges are within five star hotels and according to the pockets of people of different age groups .
On reaching the village one feels extremely hot .
Snow stuck on the roof of the house glitters in the bright sunrise .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the survivors of national wealth in Switzerland .
In Darjeeling itself we told that Sikkim 's taxis only go and therefore chewing does not happen .
The journey is going on , the place is on the other side , but the mountain is the same , the trees and the trees are on the other side , the wind is blowing .
It makes the whole body shivering .
This is the blue colored light in the rainy season .
As soon as the decision was taken for the journey of Darjeeling , the decision was taken for the first time to take camps of Karsiyang .
Karsiyang is a small town in Darjeeling .
Complete with the tea gardens , is filled with the jungles of Dhoopi .
It is famous for the production of good tea .
Going towards Darjeeling from Siligudi in the beginning itself the tea gardens welcome the people coming towards it while smiling .
Going through the middle of the tea gardens on the road attracts the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains laden with jungles , on the other side a dense valley .
Once upon a time forests were seen gardens of tea .
There was a green empire all around .
Do I once look at these natural jungles of Karnataka or see the tea gardens planted by humans
Both were drawing towards themselves .
As beautiful forests , tea gardens are so beautiful .
The road looks marvellous on the roads on the way .
We were walking with the crooks going to Pamula and passing through the way .
Time is also passing .
Forest and tea gardens are not at all .
Sometimes small settlements were seen .
From a distance on a mountain houses and buildings etc . were seen in abundance .
This is Karsiyang .
After staying here at one place we made a plan to tour the whole day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we set out for the journey of Karsiyang .
First of all Deer Park .
There is a large jungle all around a small garden .
To reach the deer park one has to leave the vehicle very low .
The beauty of Karsiyang was spread till far and wide , till now it has not been able to develop and develop into a tourist spot .
Although the city is very calm and very peaceful .
While the way was uninterrupted the joy of climbing the path between the charming and smokey trees to reach the deer park filled with jungles was giving us patience .
The other place is Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the British period lovers used to take life by jumping from here .
However , there is a park and restaurant here .
There is a Sindhuma cave here , looking at it from a height beautiful views of the entire city can be seen .
In the tea gardens nearby women get busy scrubbing tea leaves on their backs having their hands very fast .
There is a museum outside Kashiang city , but that day we could not go there , because it seemed necessary to tour the beautiful environment of tea garden .
Next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
This was a thrilling experience in us , but it was very painful because of this that it was raining in the same way how can we roam .
But the weather was very good that reaching till Rock Garden we roamed in the sunrise only .
This garden is a beautiful place brimming with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining than this .
Going a little below from here one gets to see Gangamaya flowing above some hills .
Here amidst rocks a mix of waterfalls is seen .
We saw in Rock Garden that if waterfalls breaking in the empire of rocks and rocks then the magic of waterfalls in Gangamaya is decorated with rocks in the world .
These two places are very low amidst the mountains of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of vehicle we saw smoke in Darjeeling .
All the hills and cities of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of fortification .
The quantity of the weather was very clear till now .
When we set out towards Monastery , the group of clouds did n't know from where it came and clouds were bursting .
In the evening there is a plan of shopping by stopping on the mall road .
During the journey of Darjeeling the journey of tower train enhances the beauty of the moon .
The journey of train from Darjeeling to Gum and Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake and a slight break in the garden here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazaar from this route , where sweaters etc . wrapped in hand are available in Nepali industry .
Facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also available .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its size is different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but there are sounds of forest - waterfalls .
The most famous tourist spots of Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon which are filled with jungles and lakes .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
When we came to Darjeeling from Kolkata for a tour of Darjeeling in the calm weather , then the tea gardens spread from Siligudi to Darjeeling here turned on their face .
A small journey of mine was very thrilling and thrilling in my heart .
This journey is not of foreign countries but of Rajasthan , but is very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is a favorite thing in itself in which sometimes the journey pulls towards itself , sometimes it can be a major place , water ship or a city full of rail or pink cities or the Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some major attraction people come towards themselves .
The place I am talking about was made just four and a half years ago , but the construction with which this place came here , that is actually the jungle .
Not only for the ones going there , but also for the ones living there .
Our guide Rambabu Mina was repeating in my ears , we did n't even think before this that we could stay in the jungle like this .
50 percent of the population is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that such locals did not get work in the heritage hotels as well .
Rambabu the resident of Ajabagarh used to work in Jaipur before this and today this magnificent Shahi is in the Aman Garden with beautiful beauty .
He himself has tasted a new method of expressing his words .
Ayya ' is the estimation of Aman Bagh .
Nobody will ever tell you English .
Aman Bagh is actually a tourist spot of peace and all happiness .
This garden also has its own history and the most important thing is that you will also get to know about the regions nearby .
In the royal palaces of Rajasthan how many people have toured Bhanagar of the past , why should they go far , even among the people of Jaipur , if Kuchek had spent the night at this very place .
After the construction of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad came there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi had called me completely there but I could not go .
Another thing that she had herself gone to Bhangarh on her own .
This time suddenly I reached there at the invitation of my foreigner friends but it felt as if those who want to spend their holidays in less time then they definitely wanted to go to Amman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden of those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in nineteen hundred twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Aman bag in the shadow of the mountains and sulphur trees will hypnotise you .
The way you come in the same way you will be welcomed by which you will feel that you will not pay attention to the great peace here .
Manikarni along with tieding the head of the pilgrimage gives life to the mantras .
We reached there in the evening and felt as if we had set out in that garden .
I was decorating the guest house , immediately gave me peace , that was very interesting for me .
All the buildings and forts are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Yes , all new things are artistic . No wonder Aman Bagh has got a lot of pride today .
Manesar organised our program in the morning .
First of all a walking trip with Ramba and then a jeep journey in Bhangarh .
While walking on the small road we saw the fort of Ajabagarh on which gradually the rays of the sun started spreading .
We saw dry lakes in which rails are trading .
This year it did n't rain but for the first time we had seen the fruits of tobacco .
Jaiki Kosam is a unique experience of this glimpse of rural life .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning itself I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable fruit of the million dollars .
The same way as Aman bag alvind was also hereditary and we got a ride of jaggery and curd .
Then it was understood that why would tourists come here spending so much money .
I have heard that tour packages are also put up to show the travel life .
What is this truth .
No doubt and it does not happen in many states and tourists also show more interest in it .
This tour is usually ordinarily decided for two weeks from four days and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this stopping , eating etc are also included .
This way an attempt is being made to explore such a place where much development has not taken place and the quantity of life of nature and people did not have any significant impact on time .
At the same time ancient tourist sites etc are also there .
Besides this , it is also paid attention to doing a trading cuisine survey .
Actually , tourists with the goal of such travels have to show the ways and traditions of dressing in that area directly .
Although a little difficulty is felt here for thinking but such tours are really very interesting and there is a different kind of experience .
Several journeys are joyous for us .
With this you can take the pleasure of roaming alone even when you are with many people .
Not only this , in this journey you can give freedom to your favorite book for a long time .
Yes , it is so important here that along with expense and for a long time we urge to stay comfortable in this journey .
This is the very reason that for enjoying these some things definitely keep in mind , especially whenever you are watching foreign destinations via a tour .
Before taking a ticket look for a good deal .
Students , senior officers of the army , kids etc . get their fare in them , both of them also have the facility of rent .
As such earlier it would be less than taking a ticket therefore it would be better to put a bus tower plan for the last minute before the planning process .
Instead of a tour ticket know about the total tour rate .
This will be cheap .
There are some information about stuff as well therefore one should also know about the quantity and weight of the stuff .
If this happens anywhere then you will have to leave some of your things in the terminals or you will have to pay more money .
Also keep in mind the information of insurance or losing in the tour company .
Carry on bags are good , take them .
Because they come fit in the rocks situated on the seat .
Also keep in mind that during the journey while changing the bus the responsibility of the luggage is on your own .
From wherever you go by bus you can reach there an hour ahead of time .
During routine time you should take special care of this point .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better the chance of getting the seat will also be with you .
While choosing the seat keep an eye on your convenience as well .
There is much pimples in the back seat , but it is not appropriate to read in the front seat .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again then take the last seat and do not like much interference then the seat bending the window will be very nice for you .
Now there is a very interesting thing .
If you are in a seat keeping your hands on both the sides then sit on the last seat and keep your bag on the other side .
If there is no more in bus then planning will be successful .
If there is facility to wash in the bus then keep this thing in mind while choosing the seat , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Inform the bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get to know very important things from them .
They ask everyone to come out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not keep your luggage on the seat because if they are going then the bus will not be responsible for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come in time , then you can get your place for a new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .
It is said that if you do not see Rome in Europe , then you will not see anything else .

The statues of gods and goddesses are made all around the temple .
Incidentally this temple was converted into a church in 601 AD .
Although there are many gardens in Rome but Vila Borgis is worth mentioning .
Therefore on going to Rome do not forget to see them .
Definitely go to the museum built here because if you miss them then you can give a chance to see the excellent specimens of art .
The idols made here are as alive as if they are talking to us now .
Here the first Napoleon brother Paulin , whose marriage took place in the Borgis dynasty , an idol lying on bed seemed so lively that you could not see for a few minutes .
The main attraction of Rome is the fountains there .
Approximately 300 forts are here in which grand fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trevie Pountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come to Rome again then he should put a coin in this pountain along with this desire .
It is believed that by doing this the desire will surely be fulfilled .
The journey of this old city is not complete till the time you can see Vatican City .
Since sixth century this place has been the residence of the main religious guru ' Pope ' of the Roman Catholic religion .
Although it is in Rome itself but in 1926 it was given the status of an independent city .
Definitely see the main St . Peter 's Church , St . Peter 's Square , Pountains and Museum in Vatican City .
Undoubtedly these will be visible to you in another world and you will also get an experience of remembering sometimes .

Situated in the west coast of Ginger Hotel situated in the capital of Goa , Punji , this journey is even more enjoyable .
Cycling river cruises on Goa roads , cool breeze breeze breeze breeze and world famous Goans are very convenient for spending comfortable days here .
If seen in the present situation then the fare for going to Maldi is 28 thousand rupees very cheap from Delhi .
After this if you stay in the fair even then you can get hotels for a little less but if you go to an island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then money will be reduced in the pocket .
Sea cruise has been proved very useful here .
From Kochi in the first week of December itself Lake Cruise , Maldives and Colombo started the only cruise of India .
Louis cruise has got many names in the business of European companies and cruise hotels .
Although due to some problems Louis cruise has now reduced its service but it is hoped that it will start again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a cruise of about 5850 rupees per person per night for a three day cruise in Louis Cruise ship .
That is , the fare for a person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
But if there are two elders then the child is completely free in the age of 15 years .
One should take it any more .
Tea-tiffin , food all are available at cruise fare .
Every moment is attached to time consumption .
Reaching Malayalam the capital you can enjoy the calculations , programs available in the Maldives as per your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly appearing in front of you a sea plane and then you will feel like playback .
But this twin oterplane of 12 - 15 seats is excellent in all ways for roaming in Orchipelago like Maldives .
Running like a spead boat on water one does not know when it flies in the air .
You do n't feel like flying aeroplanes on the entire flight .
Every moment you will be able to see below from the window that in the water of blue color in different sights of the Maldives resort islands and coral islands will be covered with smoke .
Everything looks so good .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
One of them is Trace Maldives , which has twenty sea planes .
If you want then you can roam around four thousand rupees -LRB- for every person -RRB- in air for an hour or you can take the fare for spending your whole day in the entire sea plane .
Although if you go to another island from island to another island then a sea plane is required because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you will never feel like finishing .
The journey of 12 k . . to 183 k . . from sea plane is done in Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovereign shops of the capital of Ahmadi Bazar of Malaysia .
A day before in Copenhagen the president of Maldives Mahmoud Nasheed Salmon is listening very carefully to the conference given in the World Environment Conference .
Really I have not seen any Indian listening so carefully to the presidents or chief ministers of the state .
But when there are questions of a new creation on this earth , then such seriousness is incomparable .
Many people consider it unsuccessful in the meeting happening in the water of the Maldives by the coffin in October but if they go to the Maldives then it feels as if the opposite of nature has drawn us from us then the world will come down to such an inferiority complex .
There are many such places in the beauty there .
As if the beauty of that small country is immersed in plenty .
When we returned back to the jetty to return to our cruise from that bazaar safari then as we turned our eyes towards the sea water , we realized that the people here can understand the value of these beauty to what extent .
The water is so clear that the fishes swimming in depths of several metres under the light of lappost are seen with all their colors .
This is a part of the sea which is completely separated from the city .
If you can see a few centimetres of water of the sea or river completely from any city of India then you will consider yourself very lucky .
Reaching Aquatic Amber the evening spent in Malaysia was roaming in the jungle for two hours .
Coral reef is the life here .
As far as possible you will get to see cracks of rocks in the stones situated on the tombs as well .
A few moments before the conference of President Nasheed we were standing outside his government residence .
It is not believed that we were ahead of the highest courtyard of the other country till some distance no one was protected .
It 's a lot of fun , we take photographs of vasara and gardens situated at a distance of about 50 kilometres after entering through the gate of their palace .
Can you think of any royal family in India like this
Here also it was known that presidents used to go to their office two blocks before crossing the road on foot .
Everything was surprising about Maldives .
That is why I have waited a lot for the next day .
That is Devvani that day some special incident will not happen .
In the morning a ship from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the base of Maldives while roaming around in the runway .
Before evening when the cruise reached near Male we immediately remembered the sea plane moving above .
How many photographs we had seen .
But then it could not be lost that the next day there should be a chance of a journey in it .
We had to go to Rangli Island of an hundred five kilometres through the sea plane of Trace Maldives .
Watching thousands of resorts and coral islands of trees spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying at a height of approximately a thousand k . . is unforgettable .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
It is adventurous and thrilling adventurous to climb straight up .
But on reaching Conrad Resort of the Hilton Hotel in Rangli Island it felt as if we have reached some other world .
In such a world , outside which there is no relation between any country .
It is not like that as well where it is difficult to get out such beauty or luxury .
Visiting on Konark is also possible on foot or by battery driven vehicles as well .
The lifestyle of the tribes on both the sides of the bridge going till the main island from Jetty is marvellous .
Now we are unable to believe ourselves in the surrounding nature , we have reached such a place , it is unbelievable .
With the help of stairs we reached the room with glass which was inside the water going several metres below the sea water .
This room is normally a dining room .
We can see all kinds of small and big fishes , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving people .
The imagination of eating and drinking on decorated chairs here makes us very thrilling .
The fare of coming to this island from Malaysia to see it and underwater ring is 47 thousand rupees per person .
The heart did n't feel like coming back from there .
We were also ready to dissolve our passports in water .
But know , this is not that easy .
Behind this unwanted belief whenever there is any chance , then fortune brings it here for sure .
Since many days we were planning to get out of Delhi but due to the pressure of work it was not possible to go anywhere .
Wildlife was liked since childhood but I thought this would not have gone to Jim Corbett .
After biking till Pegog Lake situated ahead of Khardugula in Laddakh in 2006 this is the second bike tour .
In the month of 27 December we set out for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the enthusiasm with which we got out we observed our speed of smoking .
We really got hungry in the journey between food and Ghazola .
Smoking above and uneven roads in front .
Many times it seemed as if we had gone further .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 in the morning .
Right we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres away from Ramnagar .
Our resort was in a ditch near the park , which we had booking beforehand .
On that day there was a special program that even when we were cold we went to roam on the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we left for Corbett museum , which was at a distance of 2 k . . from much distress was near Dhangi Gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar situated below .
It is evening for the return .
As we set out from Delhi for sure to see a lion roaming around in the jungle then in dreams I was seeing a lion all night .
In the middle of a deep sleep at night I suddenly heard a very loud sound and after that the dogs did not get worn for two hours starting .
Before Sanchen the decision to visit Kaladungi and Corbett Falls had come .
Kaladungi is thirty k . . away then came on the Corbett Fall road .
Kaladungi Jim Corbett is a museum , where some important things related to his real life are kept .
On returning it was twelve and a half .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village .
On reaching the resort the jeepsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they got the facility of cycling in the site Bijarani there number one .
Asked about number one where Grasland is more and Tiger has come towards the prevention of cold at this time .
On reaching Bijarani we were given a guide , who takes two hundred and fifty to roam around for four hours .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
We saw several types of animals and deer of many species there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , which has big teeth .
I took photographs courageously .
In the midst of this the guide started trekking .
The guide said that there are around 150 tigers in the park , some of which have died nowadays .
At many places we also got to see their twin marks , but due to the absence of tiger I remained silent .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
The earthquake of Tiger was in my mind .
That is why I remembered an old friend of Haldani .
I made a phone call to him at Saradake .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
He asked whether he saw the tiger or not .
His words prick me like arrows .
I didn't say softly.
There is no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody suggested us that you take safari inside .
