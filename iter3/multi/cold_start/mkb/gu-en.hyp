Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Diwali.
My best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
In this slock, the light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destroys the opposite intellect and sees eternal understanding.
My salute to this DivyaJyoti can be better than that to remember this Diwali, to spread the light, to spread the positiveness and pray to destroy the spirit of enemies.
Today, Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community is involved in it, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organisations of the country are celebrated with full fervor.
In a way, India grows there.
Friends, Festival Tourism in the world is also one of its own attractions.
There is also immense possibilities of festival tourism in our country which is a country of festivals.
Our effort should be to spread such festivals, be it Holi, be it Diwali, be it Onam, be it Pongal, Behu, and include other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals.
There are many different festivals of every state of our country or the people of other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in increasing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we had decided in the Gai Mann Ki Baat that this Diwali will do something different.
I said, Come, let us celebrate the womens strength and achievements of India, that is, honour the Laxmi of India.
And immediately after this, there has been a chamber of numerous inspirational stories on social media.
It is written on the Namo App that my mother is my strength.
Since the death of my father in the 10th century, my mother had taken responsibility for our five-year-old daughter.
Today we are in a good business.
My mother is God for me.
It is for me that is universal and that is the true sense of India's Lakshmi.
Ramesh ji, my salute to your mother.
Deepika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for them, Major Khushbu Kanwar is India's Lakshmi, who is the daughter of a bus conductor.
Laxmi of India is his daughter for poem Tivari.
He is proud that his daughter works beautifully.
He has achieved a very good record in the examination of the CLAT.
So Medha Jain ji has also written that for a two-year-old woman who has been giving free water to travellers at Gwalior railway station for years.
Medhaji has been very inspired by the humility and compassion of this Laxmi of India.
People have shared many stories when they come.
You must read, get inspiration and if you have such an inspirational story in your surroundings then share.
I also respectfully bow down to all these Lakshmis of India.
It seems as if its foundation was laid in the 17th century itself.
How beautiful words, how good ideas and how good ideas are in this poem of Kannada language.
Pandinda Permegondu Himavantanu, Pandinda Bhrigu Perchidnupandinda Jankarayanu Jasavdednu Arthat, Himawant, i. e. Parvataraj, due to his daughter Parvati, Bhrigu Rishi, because of his daughter Lakshmi and Raja Janaka because of his daughter-in-law Sita.
Our daughters are our pride and our society has a strong identity and a bright future due to the greatness of these daughters.
My dear countrymen, 12th November, 2019 is the day when the 550th Prakash Festival of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated across the world.
The impact of Guru Nak ji is not only in India but in the whole world.
In some countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
I will never forget my visit to Vancouver and the Gurudwaras in Tahran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can tell you, but for this, many people need Mann Ki Baat.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji delivered his message to afar off the world.
He was one of the most travellers in his time.
They went to many places and wherever they went, they won their hearts with ease, humility and simpleness.
With the message of harmony and equality, they visited the north or south, east or west, every direction, everywhere people met saints and sages.
It is believed that the well-known saint Shankardev of Assam was also inspired by him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
A sacred place in Kashi is Gurubagh Gurudwara .
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji was there.
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhist religion .
Guru Nanak Dev Ji traveled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During the visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji himself had solved the problem of water there.
Gurunanak Jira Saheb is a famous place in Bidar, which also reminds us of Gurunak Devji.
A sad moment Gurunanak Devji also visited Kashmir and its surrounding areas in the north.
This led to a good relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also visited Tibet where people considered him a guru.
He is also worshipped in Uzbekistan where he had travelled.
He obtained a place in the hearts of lakhs of people who have followed their teachings and are still doing it today.
Just a few days ago, the Ambassador of about 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
He visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this became a part of the 550th Prakash Parva of Gurunanak Devji.
Thereafter, many envoys had put their pictures on social media and also described their good experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that all of you will be remembered on October 31.
This day is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man of India, who was the great hero of unity to the nation.
In Sardar Patel, where there was a wonderful ability to connect people together, on the other hand, those who had ideological differences, used to synergize themselves.
He was the Man of Details in the true sense.
He was also eligible for organisation skills.
They were involved in planning and strategies.
Whenever we read about Sardar Saheb's work style, we hear it, we know how very compassionate it was.
Thousands of delegates from across the country were scheduled to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 121.
He also used the opportunity to improve the network of water supply in the city.
And it ensured that no one has the problem of water.
Not only this, he also took care of the fact that the luggage or footprint of any representative should not be stolen at the session and you would be very convinced to know what Sardar Patel did.
He interacted with the farmers and urged them to build Khadi bags.
On the other hand, there was a good increase in the sale of khadi.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Patel has done a very big devotion and historical work to unite the queens.
Sardar Vallabhbhai also had a special feature that looked at every incident.
On one hand, his focus was on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other states.
On the other hand, his attention was on Lakshadweep.
In fact, when we talk about the efforts of Sardar Patel, their role in some specific provinces in integration of the country is also discussed.
After the partition of India in the 14th century, our neighbourhood looked at Lakshadweep and sent a ship with his flag.
As Sardar Patel came to know that he immediately started a tough action without delaying his time.
After his order, the triangles were struck immediately and destroyed every mindset of the occupied Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel told the Mudaliyar brothers that they should personally ensure that there is necessary help for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today Lakshadweep is contributing to Indias progress.
It is also an attractive tourist spot.
I hope you all will also visit these beautiful islands and seashores.
My dear countrymen, the day of October 31, 2018 that was dedicated to the Statue of Unity built in memory of Sardar Saheb.
This is the tallest statue in the world.
The Statue of Liberty located in America is also double in heights.
The world's tallest statue fills every Indian with pride.
The head of every Hindustani gets higher than glory.
You will be happy to know that more than 26 lakh tourists had visited the Statue of Unity in a year.
This means that everyday an average of eight and a half thousand people visited the magnificence of the Statue of Unity.
Friends, For the country and for all the states, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study for tourism industry.
We are all witnesses of how within a year, a place is developed as a world famous tourist destination.
People from all over the country come there.
Transit, accommodation, guide and environment friendly arrangements are developing very well after one another.
The big economy is developing and people are facilitating facilities as per the needs of the tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, What would be of India who is not proud of the fact that the time magazine has given importance to the Statu of Unity in 100 important tourist destinations of the world in the past.
I hope that you will also visit the Statue of Unity by taking out some time from your precious time.
This is my request.
Friends, You know that the National Unity Day is celebrated every year from 2014 on 31st October.
This day gives us a message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country.
Ekta Run for Unity is also being organised on 31st October.
It will include every section of the society, every section of the society.
Even today, people are seeing a joy and joy for Marathon.
Run for Unity is also a unique link.
Running is beneficial for mind , brain and body .
The feelings of Feed India are realized by running here.
And at the same time, we are also connected with the objective of Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not only the body but the mind and culture are connected to India to new heights.
And that is why whatever you live in the city, you can connect with yourself with knowledge about the run for unity.
I hope you all will run on October 31, for the unity of India and for your fitness.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country with the thread of unity.
This mantra of unity has emerged as a culture in our lives. And in the country of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every stage at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and vigilant to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we want to go around us then there will be many examples that have been continuously working to enhance mutual harmony.
But many times it becomes such that the efforts of the society are very quickly lost from the memories.
Friends, I remember that when the Allahabad High Court in September, 2010 had heard his observations about Ramjanmabhoomi.
Just remember those days when there was an environment.
The groups with their own interests were playing a game to take advantage of this situation.
What kind of language is being spoken to create heat in the environment.
Attempts were also being made to fill the glory in different voices.
Efforts were made to reduce the turmoil from the environment.
We should always remember that it gives us a lot of strength.
That day, that moment is a duties for all of us.
The voice of unity can give strength to the country and this is an example of it.
Today, I also pay tributes to them.
But it is also a pleasant and comfortable experience.
I have listened to these things so I think that I should also listen to you.
You imagine the world's highest battlefield or the temperature of the world goes from the sun to 50-60 degrees minus.
Oxygen in the air is also the only name.
Staying among such challenges in such a opposite situation is not less than any parameter.
In such a situation, our brave departure of our bravery is not only protecting the borders of the country but is also running a clean syachin campaign there.
I compliment the countrymen for this wonderful commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that it is difficult to burn even the money.
It is a very important task to distinguish and manage garbage in such a situation.
We all know that Siachen is such a snow laden area which is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, there is the meaning of running a cleanliness drive that ensuring clean water for people living in remote areas, these people also use water of rivers like Nubra and Shok.
My dear countrymen, festivals are a festival of a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially in Diwali, buying something or the other, bringing something from the market, making at least in every family.
I once said that we want to buy local things.
If things are available from our village then there is no need to go to Taluka.
There is no need to go to the district if you get it in the tehsil.
We will try to buy more local things.
Gandhi Shardha Shatabdi will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I have been urging that we should buy something or the other made by the workers of our Khadi built by our dear brothers and sisters.
This Diwali too would have bought a lot of money before Diwali.
But there will be many people who would think that if we go after Diwali then perhaps we will get a little cheaper.
So there will be a lot of people who will still be shopping.
With the best wishes of Deepawali, I would urge you to come here to make us a preference to buy local things and buy local things.
You can see how important we can play in fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
We burst species of species in Diwali.
But sometimes there is a fire in inconvenience.
Some wounds also occur.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and also celebrate the festival with great fervor.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Fortunately, there will be no Indian who is not proud of our armed forces, our soldiers.
Every Indian, whether it is a region, caste, religion, creed or language, is always ready to express his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion Indians have celebrated the Parakram Parva.
We recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers responded to the proxy warriors under the leadership of terrorism on our nation.
Our Armed Forces organized exhibitions at different places in the country so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation can know what our strength is, how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by keeping their lives in danger.
The day like Parakram Parva reminds the youth of our Armed Forces of the glorious heritage.
And inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I have also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, now it has been decided that our soldiers will give a brief answer to all those who will try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our nation.
We are committed to encouraging peace, but by understanding with respect, and that too at the cost of the sovereignty of the nation, it is not at all.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
In the 20th century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their supreme sacrifice for peace in the two world wars and when we did not have any connection with the war.
Our eyes were never on any other earth.
It was our commitment to peace.
Just a few days ago, on September 23, we recalled our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur lensers who liberated Haifa from the invasions.
It was also an epic by our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Even today, India is one of the most soldiers sent to different peacekeepers of the United Nations.
Our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmet for decades.
One of the part of the Parade which is awaited by people during the Republic Day celebrations is the fly past in which our Air Force exhibits its strength with strange carnages.
We celebrate Air Force Day on 8th October.
Our Air Force has joined the most adventurous and powerful air force of the 21st century today, with a small start with 6 pilets and 1 air force personnel in 1932.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all Air Warriors and their families who have served for the country.
In 1944, when Pakistan's invaders started an unprecedented attack, it was the Air Force that ensured that the Indian soldiers and equipment reached the battlefield on time to protect Srinagar from the attackers.
The Air Force also responded to the enemy in 1965.
Who does not know the struggle for Bangladesh's freedom in 1917
The Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from the capture of smugglers in 1971.
In Tiger Hill, the Air Force dustbinated them by bombing the enemies at night.
Whether it is relief and rescue work or disaster management, the country is grateful to them for the commendable work of our air warriors.
Their morale has been amazing to deal with natural calamities from storms, floods to forest fires and help the countrymen.
The Air Force has established examples in ensuring gender equity or equality of men and women and has opened the doors of each of their departments for the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is also giving the option of the Permanent Commission along with the Short Service Commission, which was announced on 15th August this year from the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that not only men's strength but also women's strength in the Armed Forces of India is making such contribution.
The women are empowered, but now they are becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, last days, an officer of the Navy, Abhilash Tommy was fighting for his life and death.
The entire country was worried about how tommy could be saved.
You know that Abhilash Tommy is a very brave officer.
He was the first Indian to visit the world without taking a small boat without any modern technology alone.
For the past 80 days, he was moving forward with his speed in the sea to participate in the Golden Global Race in the South Indian Ocean but he made the horrific sea troop for them but the valour of the Indian Navy continued to shout for several days.
I had met Tommy before.
Even after coming out of such a crisis, his courage was a strong morale and once again the resolve to do something like this was a motivation for the youth of the country.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tommy and their courage, their perseverance, their determination, gain and victory will definitely inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, every child also knows the importance of October 2 for our nation.
This year's 2nd October has a special significance.
For two years from today, we are planning several programmes worldwide on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Be it Martin Luther King Junior or great personalities like Nelson Mandela, everybody got strength from the ideas of Gandhiji and fought a long battle to give the right to equality and respect to his people.
In todays Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss another important task of worshipped Bapu, which more and more countrymen should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a Constructive Programme.
Later in 1945, when the freedom struggle took place, he prepared a revised compilation of the ideas.
Pujya Bapu has put his thoughts in front of the country on various subjects such as the protection of farmers, villages, the rights of the workers, the cleanliness and the spread of education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Pujaya Bapu was a folk collector.
It was the specialty of Bapu to join the people and connect them with them.
Everyone has experienced this as the most unique feature of his personality.
He made every person feel that it is most important and eternal for the country.
His biggest contribution in the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement.
Every section of the society and every section of the society dedicated themselves to the call of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom movement.
Bapu had given us an inspirational mantra, which is often known as the Talisman of Gandhiji.
In this, Gandhiji said, "I give you a reply, whenever you doubt that you start getting morning here, remember the face of the poorest and the weakest person you have seen and ask your heart how much will you take the steps you are thinking for that person
Will it benefit him
Can he hold something on his own life and luck
That is, will it help millions of people who are hungry and soul hungry
Then you will see that your doubts are finishing and it is ending here.
My dear countrymen, a share of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the rising middle class of the country, its increasing economic power, the increasing purchasing power, can we remember the revered Bapu for a moment whenever we go to buy
Can you remember that gentleman of worshipped Bapu
Who would be fortunate to benefit from your shopping directly or straightforwardly
And if the poorest of the poor benefits, then my happiness will be more than that.
In the coming days, whenever we buy something, whenever we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we must imagine that there is a need for any countryman from our purchase and whoever has sweated his money, who has dedicated his talent, he should benefit anyone.
This is the interpretation of Gandhi, this is the message of Gandhi and I am confident that the poorest and the weakest person can bring a small step in his life.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji had said that when he was cleaned then he would get freedom then he might not know how it would happen.
Similarly, today we can feel that even with this small work, I can have a huge contribution in the economic progress of my country, in the economic empowerment of the poor to fight against poverty and I believe that this is the true country of today's era.
As you think of buying Khadi and handloom products on special occasions, it will help many workers.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastriji used to preserve the old or broken clothes of Khadi because somebody's hard work is hidden in it.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothings are made with great hard work and one of them should be used.
This feeling of love for the country and the countrymen was residing in the rager of the great man.
Two days later, along with Pujya Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri ji.
As soon as the name of Shastri ji comes, we feel the feeling of unlimited faith in the minds of the Indians.
His glorious personality always fills every countrymen with pride.
The speciality of Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was that he was very humble from outside but he was a firm determination like a mountain from inside.
His instrument of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is the identity of his unique personality.
He was the result of his selfless penance towards the nation that during his one-and-a-half-year brief tenure, he gave mantras to the country's visitors and the farmers to the summit of success.
My dear countrymen, today when we are reminding worshipped Bapu, it is very natural that we cannot live without talking about cleanliness.
A campaign called Swachhata Hi Seva started from 15th September.
Millions of people joined this campaign and I was also fortunate to donate sanitation labour with children in Ambedkar School, Delhi.
I went to the school whose foundation stone was laid by Babasaheb himself.
The people of every section of the country joined this labour donation on 15th.
Institutions also contributed to it colorfully.
School students, college students, NCCs, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Corporate World, all have donated sanitation work on a large scale.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these sanitation lovers.
Let's hear a phone call-namaskar
You tell me a big thing that cleanliness has its own importance in everybody's life and toilets have been built in your houses under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and that is why you are now facilitating it.
And perhaps the people associated with this campaign may not be guessed that you cannot see because of being an expert, but when you did not have toilets, you would have lost your life with so many difficulties and after becoming toilets it became a great gift for you.
Perhaps if you didn't even call to talk about this aspect then perhaps this sensitivity would not have come to the attention of the people associated with this campaign of cleanliness.
I specially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful story not only in the country but also in the entire world.
This time India is organising the worlds largest Swachhta Sammelan in history.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention) and experts from all over the world are interacting with their experiments and experiences related to sanitation.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention) will be concluded on 2nd October, 2018 with the launch of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Bapu.
It is specially necessary to ensure the freedom, peace and justice of the oppressed, the victims and the deprived.
Dr.
Several provisions have been made to protect the basic rights of the poor in the Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October, 1973.
A few days later, NHRC will complete 25 years.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but also worked to increase human dignity.
Our vibrant leader, former Prime Minister of our country, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had clearly stated that human rights are not a synonymous concept for us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal indicators of the Vedic times are marked.
NHRC has created widespread awareness for human rights as well as has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
In this 25-year visit, he has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the countrymen.
For a healthy society, for the best democratic values, I understand that this is a very optimistic event.
Today, along with the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted.
As a society, we need to understand and behave the importance of human rights - that is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
My dear countrymen, be it the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan, be it the birth anniversary of Rajmata Vijayaraj, the birth centenary of Sindhia Ji, all these great men have been inspiring us, we bow down to them and on 31st October the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, I will talk in detail in the next Mann Ki Baat but today I want to mention that for some years, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, on 31st October, Run For Unity, every small town of the city, every town of the city, every town of the city, every town of the city, every town of the city, every town of the city, every town of the city, every town of the city, every town of the city.
This year also we should try to organise the 'Run for Unity' in our villages, towns, towns and metropolitan cities.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge you all to make our efforts to build every section of the society, every unit of the country in the form of unity through the Run for Unity on October 31 and that will be a good tribute to them.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, today the whole country is celebrating the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
For centuries, this festival has also been a major example of social harmony.
There are many such stories in the history of the country in which one holder had linked two different royals or people associated with religion with faith.
Just a few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is also coming.
The entire environment will rise from the jewellery of elephants, horses, palanquins. Jai Kanya Lal Ki, Govinda Govinda.
The joy of swimming in the color of Lord Krishna is something different.
Greetings on Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami.
My heartiest congratulations to all the nations on the occasion of Sanskrit Week.
I am very grateful to daughter Chinmayi who raised this issue.
Friends, Besides Raksha Bandhan, Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on the day of Shravani Purnima.
I congratulate all those who have been engaged in protecting, nutritioning this great legacy.
Every language has its own greatness.
India is proud that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world.
And we are also proud of the fact that Sanskrit language has played a very important role in the spread of knowledge from Vedas to present.
The stores of knowledge related to every field of life are in Sanskrit language and its literature.
You all will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village of the Sivamoga district of Karnataka Raji still use Sanskrit language for interaction.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which infinite words are possible.
It is possible to create innumerable words through 20000 metals, 200 editions i. e. Sufix, 22 Upsag i. e. prefix and solutions.
And that is why a subtle feeling or theme can be completely expressed in any milestone.
That is, if a guru also gives knowledge of a letter to his disciple, then there is no such thing or money in the entire earth so that the disciple can remove that debt of his guru.
Let us all celebrate this spirit of Teachers Day. Knowledge and Guru are invaluable, invaluable and invaluable.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the coming Teachers Day.
I thank you all for your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, these hard workers bring new hopes for our farmers.
Monsoon provides relief to dry trees and dry reservoirs in strong sunlight.
However, sometimes it also brings overwhelming and devastating floods.
There is a situation of nature that in some places more rainfall has occurred than other places.
Just now, we all have seen that there has been a lot of impact on the lives of people in Kerala.
Today, in this difficult situation, the entire country is emerging with Kerala.
Our feelings are with those families.
I am sure that Kerala will meet again very soon with the courage and courage of the people of the state.
But during disasters, we also see humanity.
Wherever there is a disaster, whether it is Kerala or any other district or region of India, it is doing something or the other place from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kanyakumari to Kanyakumari.
The people associated with all the adults and every workforce are contributing to them.
We all know that the Armed Forces are dry of the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala.
He left no stone unturned to save the flood victims.
Whether it is air, navigation, land or BSF, CISF, RAF, everyone has played a very important role in the rescue and relief operations.
I also want to specifically mention the hard work of the brave soldiers of NDRF.
The topic that people have written most of them from all over the country is Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, our beloved.
Ghaziabad to Kirti, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Pravin from Kerala, Dr.
Several innumerable people have requested me to talk about different aspects of Atal ji's life by writing on the Narendra Modi Mobile App and Mai Gov.
On the 16th August, the country and the world heard the news of the demise of Atal ji.
A nation leader who left the Prime Minister's post 14 years ago.
In a way, for the last 10 years, he had gone far away from active politics.
The kind of affection, faith and grief that emerged throughout the country for Atal ji showcases his vast personality.
For the past several days, Atal ji's best aspects have come to the country.
India will always be borrowed by Atal ji for the 19th Amendment Act, 2003.
This transformation led to two major changes in Indias politics.
Firstly, the Union Cabinet has limited to 15 of the Full Legislature meetings in the States.
Secondly, the limit set under the Anti-party Act has been increased from one third to two thirds.
Clear guidelines were also set to make the parties disqualified along with them.
For many years, the political culture of building big cabinets in India was built to enjoy not only the sharing of work but also the politicians.
Atal ji changed this culture.
Their steps saved money and resources.
It also enhanced efficiency.
Atal ji was such a long-standing philosophy that changed the situation and brought about a healthy tradition in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In the year 2017, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5:00 pm to 11.
In this way, he brought our vibrant tricolor closer to the people.
I will definitely say that for healthy democracy, for better democracy, for better traditions, for strengthening democracy, for open minds, it will also be considered a great tribute to Atal ji.
Just a few days ago, the Monsoon Session of Parliament has been completed.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 198 and was 4 of the Rajya Sabha.
And this is the result that the Lok Sabha has passed 21 bills and 14 legislative legislatures in this session.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and the welfare of the youth.
Several important legislative legislative legislations which benefited the youth and the backward classes were passed in this session.
You all know that for decades, there was a demand for setting up of OBC Commissions like Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
To ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country fulfilled the resolve to form an OBC Commission this time.
The work of passing the Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes has also been done in this session.
The Act will further protect the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Together, it will prevent the offenders from tyrannying the people of this class and irrigating faith in the Dalit community.
No member can tolerate any kind of injustice against the women's strength.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and has made such offences strictly punishable, and the culprits of the wicked will be punished for at least 10 years.
Whenever the children of less than 12 years of age will be punished for the sacred persons.
A few days ago, it would have been read in the newspapers that a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh has completed sleeping in just two months and punished two of the culprits on a prisoner.
Earlier, a court in the Katni of Madhya Pradesh had punished the culprits after just five days of sleeping.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts there have paid such a rapid payment.
The Act will play an effective role in preventing crime against women and children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
This time in the fourth session, everyone has presented an ideal with each other.
Today I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, the attention of millions of people presently is on the Asian Games played in Jakarta.
Every morning, people get up in the first newspapers, TV, news, social media, and see that any Indian player has won medals.
Asian sports are still going on.
I would like to congratulate all the sportspersons who won the medal for the country.
I also extend my best wishes to the sportspersons who have still been contesting.
Indias sportspersons are especially showcasing excellence in Marketbaji and Kusti, but our sportspersons are also bringing medals in such games in which our sports have not been so good before.
This is not just a medal, but a pride is the skies of Indian sports and sportspersons and dreams.
Our daughters are included in the increasing number of medal winners for the country, it is a very positive sign.
Similarly, among the young sportspersons who win medals, we are also young in the age of 15-16.
It is also a very good sign that most of the sportspersons who have won medals are living in small towns and villages and these sportspersons have achieved this success through hard work.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons and also pay my homage to Hockey's great sportsperson Shri Dhyanchand ji.
I urge all the citizens of the country to keep in mind the sports and their zeal because a healthy India will create a prosperous and prosperous India.
If India is healthy then it will create a bright future of India.
Namaste Bhavna ji, I respect your feelings.
We all have seen building houses and buildings with brick stones but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago, a huge mountain which was a rock, was given the form of an excellent large and wonderful temple, perhaps it is difficult to imagine but it was made.
And that temple is the Kailasnath Temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra, if anyone tells you that about a thousand years ago, a pillar of granite was built over 60 metres and a rock of about 80 tons of granite was laid on its peak.
But the Brihadeshwar temple of Tanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where this incredible gain of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Harkoi is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patna, Gujarat.
Indias Bhumi Engineering Laboratory has been a laboratory.
There were many engineers in India who imagined the imagination of the imagination and presented an example of the miracles in the world of engineering.
In our heritage of great engineers, we also got a Ratna whose works are still surprised by the people.
M.
He is not only worshipped in that part of the country but the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and spirituality.
In his memory, on 15th September, it is celebrated as Engineers Day.
On their footprints, the engineers of our country have made their own identity in the whole world.
Whenever I talk of marvellous miracles in the world of engineering, I recall an incident of the terrible earthquake that occurred in Kutch in Gujarat in 2017.
I got the opportunity to go to a village and there I got the opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years of age.
They were enjoying and saying that this is my house.
It is called Bhungo in Kutch.
My house then spoken 3-3 earthquakes have been seen.
But you can't see any harm.
This house was built by our ancestors in accordance with the natural situation.
And it was a matter of great pride that I thought that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had created the local situation due to which the common man was protected.
Whenever we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Workshops should be done at different places.
Do we have to learn some new things in the changing age
You have to learn .
You have to join .
What should the students be taught
How to make ero West our priority
Whenever we celebrate engineers day, we must think about many such things.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivals.
And along with this, preparations for Diwali also start.
Congratulations to all of you with such a feeling.
Thank you, I'll meet you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
So, at some places people are still waiting for rains.
The vastness and diversity of India sometimes shows the form of a preferred menace of rain.
But what do we blame the rain
It is a human being who has chosen the path of struggle with nature and the result is that sometimes nature is angry with us.
It takes usually a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But on that day the mishap was another sanction.
Whenever he walked a good distance inside the cave, suddenly due to heavy rains, such water was collected near the entrance of the cave.
The way out of them was closed.
Because of not getting any road, they all stopped on such a small tail inside the cave.
And that too is not one or two days, for the entire 18 days.
On one hand, he was facing crisis.
On the other hand, on the other hand, humanity was being united in the whole world and showcasing the human qualities that God saved.
People from all over the world were praying for taking out these children safely.
The feeling of responsibilities at every level was unique.
Be it the government, be it the parents of these children, be it the members of their family, be it the media, be it the citizens of the country, everybody, everybody has done a wonderful behaviour of peace and patience.
All of them were associated with their campaign by becoming a team.
I believe that everybody's regulatory behavior is a matter of learning and understanding.
It is not that the parents are not sad, it is not that the eyes of the mothers are not blind, but the peaceful philosophy of the entire society is like learning for all of us.
It shows that when humanity is a wealth then wonderful things are made.
A few days ago, the favourite poet of our country, Neeraj ji, took a separation from us.
Everything of Neeraj Ji can give us a lot of strength and inspiration to the Hindus.
We talked about the stress and calculation of examinations given during the Board of Our School Exams and now you have a message of sorrow for students like me.
However, two months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youngsters.
Because this is the same time when the college has a very busy time.
Millions of youth like Satyam come out of school and enter colleges.
If February and March go to exams, papers and norths, then in the months of April and May, along with fun, the results are spent in fixing the way forward in life, selecting carpet etc.
The attention of the students is limited from home to school.
Students come to the umbrella of professionals from the umbrella of parents.
I am confident that my young friends, colleges will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of life.
For the first time, getting out of the house, leaving the village and getting out of a protective environment, it has to be a friend of itself.
All these youngsters have to leave their home for the first time and drive their lives into a new stage.
I will tell you all that be calm, be calm, be comfortable, take a lot of joy in life.
Learn something new like new skills, new languages.
He has already succeeded in examining the MBBS of Jodhpur AIIMS.
Their fathers nutritiously nutritiously follow their family.
I congratulate him for his success.
There are many students who come from the poor families and despite the opposite consciousness, they have done something that inspires us all.
Be it the Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is a bus driver in DTC, or Abhay Gupta of Kolkata, who sat down on the footpath and studied on the footpath, be it the daughter of Ahmedabad's African Sheikh or whose father runs autorickshaws.
Or else, the Divyang girl of Gurgaon is Anushka Panda, who is suffering from a hereditary disease called spinal cord disease, spine muscular atrophy since birth.
All of them have achieved the success of seeing the whole world by extracting every obstacle from their determination and courage.
If we look around us, we will also find some such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives strength to my mind and inspires me.
And whenever I am telling you the story of this youngster, I remember the story of poet Neeraj Ji and this is the goal of life.
There was something like this. Once I was interacting with two Indian youth in San Jose, USA, known as technology hub.
I urged them to think about how they can use their talent for India and take time out and do something.
May Brain drain called upon him to turn into a brain gain.
Both of them from Rae Bareli made an innovative effort to overcome my challenge by IT professionals, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Vajpayee.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have prepared a smart village app together using their professional skills.
This app is not just connecting the people of the village to the entire world but now they believe that they can get information on their mobile phones.
These residents of Taudhakpur village of Rae Bareli, Sarpanch of the village, District Magistrate, Technical Development Officers, all made aware of the people for the use of this app.
It has now become easier to keep an eye on the progress of the development works being done in the village to record it by this app.
The App consists of the village's phone directory, the Department of Communications, the list of occasions, the Health Centre and the Governance Centre.
The Gramer Feature of the App, Factory Rate between the farmers, works in a way as a market for their products.
If you look at this incident slightly then one thing will be noticed that the life of those people who have lost their lives in the United States, the life of the people of America and those who had left India several years ago, those youngsters also know the miracles of their village, understand the challenges and are associated with the emotions of the village.
This is the reason that perhaps the village could be able to make it very well.
The feeling of doing something for their villages, their roots, their roots, is naturally lying within every Hindustan.
But sometimes due to time, sometimes due to the differences, sometimes due to circumstances, a thin dust gets stuck on it, but if a small chicken pox touches them then good things come up once again.
Pandharpur Vari is a unique journey in itself.
Friends, The Ashadhi Academy, which was on 23rd July this time, is celebrated as a magnificent culmination of Pandharpur Vari.
Pandarpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Nearly 15-20 days before the Ashadhi Academy, Varkari i.e. pilgrimages come out on foot for a journey of Pandharpur along with Palakhi.
Millions of workers are connected to this journey which is called Vari.
Vithal, Vithal, while keeping the worship of great saints like Sant Gyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram in Palakhi.
Tirthankaras are Lord Vithal who are also called Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the victims.
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are immensely devoted to the people.
The beauty and spiritual joy of the Vithoba temple in Pandharpur is a different experience.
My request is to the audience of Mann Ki Baat that if you get the opportunity, you must experience Pandharpur Vari once again.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram are still educating human beings in Maharashtra.
They are giving the power to fight against blindness.
We get the message of harmony, love and brotherhood from them.
There is a mantra that society can fight against blindness.
These were those people who stopped the society from time to time, showed the tokys and princes and ensured that the old tribes should be abolished from our society and irrigated the cultures of compassion, equality and authenticity among the people.
We commemorate the birth anniversary of Tilak ji on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence.
He had the power and intellectuality to show the values of his mistakes to the British rulers.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that they blamed him for royalty thrice in 20 years and this is not a small thing.
Today, I would like to present an interesting event related to the statue of Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1966, more than 40 thousand people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad about 100 years ago.
And during this visit, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with him.
And Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was so impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 1, 1920, he decided that he would make a monument of Tilak ji in Ahmedabad.
Finally, the statue was built and Sardar Saheb inaugurated by Khud Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 12th.
And I am telling you about that time of the British.
The tradition of public Ganesh Utsav started due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The Sarvajanik Ganesh Festival became an influential medium of traditional devotion and joy as well as social awareness, collectivity, equality among the people.
Well, that time was such a time when the country had a wealth for the war against the British, these festivals had broken the dragons of caste and sects and worked together.
The popularity of these events has increased over time.
This only shows how this is a craze in our youth for our ancient heritage and our brave leaders of history.
Today, in many cities it becomes such that you can see the mandal of Ganesh in almost every street.
My dear countrymen, I had also requested the last time of May and today when I am reminding Lokmanya Tilak ji, I would once again request you to celebrate the Ganesh festival this time, celebrate it with joy, celebrate it with full strength, but I would urge you to celebrate the eco-friendly Ganesh festival.
And I will even say that the items of Eco-French Ganesh Festival will be kept on May Gov and on the Narendra Modi app for wide publicity.
I will bring your words to certain people.
Lokmanya Tilak expressed confidence in the people of the country and insisted that Swaraj is our right to be born and we will be able to take it, even today it is time to say it.
He said that Swaraj is our right to be born and we will be able to take it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and good results of development.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in the air of freedom.
Chandrashekhar inspired many youngsters for the bravery and freedom of Azad.
Freedom kept his life on the hood, but he never bowed before the foreign rule.
I am fortunate that I also got the opportunity to visit the village Alirajpur of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again I bow down to these two great sons of Mother India, Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, India's brave daughter and Kisanputri Hima Das won the Golden Championship at the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship held in Finland.
I have e-mailed one more girl unity threat to Indonesia in response to my letter that she is still preparing Asian games there.
The name of the country has been Roshan.
The Unity has won the Gold and Bronze Medal in the World Para Athletics Grand Pre-2018 in Tunisia.
Their achievement is so special that they have made their challenges a medium of their work.
Due to road accidents in 2003, half of the lower part of the body of the girl unity movement has become useless, but this girl has achieved this achievement by not losing the courage and making herself strong.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji has also set up a worldwide winner in Para Athletics Grand Pre Mon Discuss Thro (Chakrafank) in Berlin and Sundersingh Gurjer has also won a gold medal in Bhalafenk.
My dear countrymen, many incidents of the history of August are full of festivals but due to monsoon sometimes the disease also enters the house.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the good health, for the months of August, for the inspiration of patriotism and for many festivals that have been going on for centuries.
Once again, I will definitely meet for Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
Just a few days ago, a historic cricket match was held in Bengaluru.
You must have understood a lot that I am talking about the test matches of India and Afghanistan.
It was the first international match of Afghanistan and it is a matter of pride for Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
In this match, the two teams performed a very good showcasing and other bolsters of Afghanistan, Rashid Khan, also performed a lot in the IPL this year and I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, had tagged me on his Twitter, the people of Afghanistan are very proud of his hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our sportspersons to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan.
He is the world's asset of the cricket and along with that he also wrote in a funny fashion that we should give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us.
This was the first match so it is very natural to remember but I will remember that match for some special reason.
The Indian team has done something that is an example for the entire world.
He said the Indian team can do what a winner team can do while taking trophy.
While taking the Indian team trophy, Afghan team, which was playing an international match for the first time, invited the team of Afghanistan and photographed with both the teams.
What is Sportsman Spirit, what is Sportsmanship - we can experience from one incident.
It is a very good way to find the talent of sports society and the skills that are in our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that in the same way we will also compete with each other, with the entire sportsman spirit.
My dear countrymen, this 21st June was a different sight on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world looked together.
Be it the Europian Parliament in Brussels, the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York, the Japanese naval ships, people were seen doing yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic programme of Yoga and I was told that many asanas were demonstrated by women.
On the high Berfila peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China together practiced Yoga.
Yoga works to break and connect all the borders.
Thousands of enthusiastic people of hundreds of countries have made this opportunity a very big festival by going up from all kinds of discrimination, religion, region, color or linga.
If people from all over the world were participating in Yoga Day programmes so enthusiastically, then why should it not be a lot of enthusiasm in India
The country is proud when hundreds of crore people see that the security forces of our country studied Yoga at all three places of the Navy, Army and Air Force.
Some of the brave soldiers performed yoga in Sabmari, while some soldiers practiced yoga on snowy mountains in Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force have embarrassed all by doing Yogasana at a height of 15 thousand feet between the sky and the earth.
The observation of seeing was that he did not sit in the air but he did yoga in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or fields of sports, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
A view of Ahmedabad was touching the heart.
About 50 Divya Brothers and sisters have established the world by doing Yoga at one place together.
I believe that today Yoga is working as a wellness, revolution.
I hope that the movement of wellness from Yoga will move forward.
Maximum people will make it a part of their lives.
On my Gov and Narendra Modi App, many people wrote to me that this time I should talk about Doctors Day in Mann Ki Baat on July 1.
It is a day when the country celebrates the achievements of our doctors and thanks them for their service and dedication to the society.
We are those people who worship Mother as a goddess, believe in God because Mother gives us life.
Mother gives birth to us and sometimes doctors give birth to us again.
The role of the doctor is not limited to treat diseases only.
Today doctors have medical expertise and they have a lot of experience about what impact they have on our health.
Indian doctors have made their identity throughout the world with their capabilities and skills.
In the Medical Profession, along with hardworking, our doctor complex is also known for emerging medical problems.
With the help of Mann Ki Baat, I convey my best wishes to all our doctors and friends on the next July 1.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate people who have been born in the land of India.
India has been such a rich history, when there is no such month, there is no such day in which there is no historical incident.
If you see then every place in India has its own heritage.
There is a saint associated with it, a great man, a famous person, everybody has his own contribution, his own greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and even when I was in Gujarat, you will be aware of the graveyards of Gujarat.
When I was working there, I had made a very big national session of the people associated with the tradition of a saint Kabir.
You people know why Kabirdas ji had come to Maghar
At that time there was a vision that who died in Magahar does not go to heaven.
The body that sacrifices in the swimming Kashi goes to heaven.
Magahar was considered absurd but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in it.
He worked to break the same evils and blindness of his time and he went to Maghar and there he commemorated.
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his witnesses and compassion.
He was his ideal.
We see these ideals in their creations and even in today's era, they are so inspiring.
One of his companions is: Kabir Soi Peer Hai, if not Peer on Peerjo, So Ka Peer I mean Peerte, that is the true Peer Saint who knows and understands the pain of the other, who does not know the misery of the other.
Kabirdas ji stressed on social harmony.
He was thinking a lot ahead of his time.
He gave a message of peace and harmony and worked to unite the people of the world to remove the differences.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God.
Wherever he visited, he made several initiatives for the welfare of the society.
The system of kitchen free from social discrimination where people of every caste, pants, religion or sect can eat and eat. Guru Nanak Dev had started this langar system.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to join it with enthusiasm and zeal.
I also urge you people to think about what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, whatever new ideas, whatever new ideas, prepared and with great pride, let us all make this light festival inspiring festival.
The struggle for Indias freedom is very long, it is very wide, it is very high, it is full of innumerable martyrs.
There is a history related to Punjab.
The horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh in 2019 is also ending 100 years, which was laid down by humanity.
Who can forget the black day of April 13, 1919 when they crossed all the limits of cruelty using power and fired pills on innocent, unarmed and monthly people.
The victory is always peaceful and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Raman Kumar, Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that Dr.
Shyamaprasad is the birthday of Mukherjee and he wants Dr.
Talk to the countrymen about Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
First of all, I thank you very much.
It was very good to see your interest in the history of India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with several sectors but the areas which were closest to him were education, administratations and parliament offices.
Very few people would know that Kolkata was the youngest Vice Chancellor of the University.
On the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation at the University of Kolkata in Bengal.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Minister of Industry in India and in a sense he had laid the foundation stone for India and industrial development, had prepared a strong base and had prepared a strong platform.
The first Industrial Policy of Independent India, which was held in 1948, brought the mark of his ideas and vision.
Mukherjees dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant, efficient and prosperous in every field.
He wanted India to develop big industries as well as focus on MSMEs, handicrafts, textiles and cottage industries.
All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board, Khadi Village Industries Board have been set up for them to get financial and organisation setups for better development of Kutir and Small Industries.
Shyam Prasad Mukherjee had a huge contribution.
He was very dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Their understanding, understanding and activism is the result of a share of Bengal and it is today a share of India.
Dr.
Recalling the message of unity of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, let us be associated with the spirit of harmony and brotherhood for the progress of India.
My dear countrymen, in the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video college.
I got the opportunity to know about the changes in the lives of the people by moving ahead from the files.
People spoke of their resolve, their happiness, their achievements.
Girls are providing services from pension to passports of the elderly of the village through Common Service Centre in remote villages.
When a sister of Chhattisgarh joins the Sitafal and makes it an ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras as well as providing affordable medicines to the nearby villages.
No matter how many things were there, no corner of the country should be there where people have not been talking about their success.
In such a situation, when the common man brings about new hopes, new zeal and incidents in his life, it is not a pride of the government.
The incident of a small child in a remote village also becomes a motivation for 125 crore people.
With the help of technology, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very pleasant, very inspiring and it is a matter of satisfaction to work but also gets the enthusiasm to do more.
A new joy of giving life to the poorest of the poor, a new zeal and a new inspiration is achieved.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined the Video Bridge programme and you worked to give me a new strength.
Once again I would like to express my gratitude to you all.
I always feel that if we look around us then somewhere or the other is better.
There are people who do good.
We can also experience the aroma of goodness.
In the past, one thing came into my mind and it is a unique combination.
On the one hand, where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters associated with agriculture are working in the field.
Now you will think that these two are very different businesses - what is the relationship with it
But it is such that in Bengaluru, corporate professionals and IT engineers have come together and they have made a comprehensive prosperity trust and they have activated this trust for doubling farmers income.
He joined the farmers and made plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Today, they are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their vegetables through Trust.
The farmers who produce cereals are also associated with it.
On the one hand, farmers have a key role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing, while on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure farmers' participation in profits.
I am extremely grateful to these youngsters for this innovation experiment and I am happy that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, technology and engineering have adopted the path of connecting the farmers, connecting the villages and connecting with the fields.
Once again I might have seen these innovative experiments of the younger generation of my country, I might have knew nothing, some people would have known, some would have known, some would not have known, but millions of people are continuously doing something good, they all have a lot of good wishes from me.
GST has to complete one year.
One nation, one tax was the dream of the people of the country, today it has changed into reality.
For this one nation, one tax reform, if I have to give credit to anybody then I will give credit to the states.
GST is a very good example of cooperative federalism where all the states together decided in the country and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country.
Till now, 2 meetings of GST Council have been held and we can pride all of us that people of different political thoughts are sitting there, people from different states are sitting there, states with different procedures but all the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken from all the unanimous consent.
Prior to GST, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax has been implemented across the country.
GST is the victory of honesty and is also a festival of honesty.
Earlier, in the country, there were complaints of Inspector Raj in the case of taxes.
With the arrival of GST, the check posts were closed and the transportation of goods has increased rapidly, which not only saved time but also benefits a lot in the Logistics field.
GST will probably be the world's largest tax reform.
Such a huge tax reform in India was successful because the people of the country adopted it and ensured the success of GST through Jan Shakti.
Normally it is believed that such a big report, such a large country, such a large number of people takes 5 to 5 years to sustain it, but the enthusiasm of the respected people of the country, the festival of dignity is the result of the participation of the people of the country that within a year, this new tax system has made its place, has achieved stability and it continues to be revised by its inbuilt system.
This is a huge success in itself by 1. 25 billion Indians.
Once again, after completing Mann Ki Baat, I am waiting for the next Mann Ki Baat, to meet you and talk to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar
I have once again got the opportunity to be present before you through Mann Ki Baat.
You would be well aware of the fact that a team of six women commanders of the Navy had been on a sea journey for several months.
I would like to talk about Navika Sagar Parikrama ji.
These six daughters of India, their team visited the entire world through the sea for more than a few days and returned to India on 21st May and welcomed them very warmly.
He cut off the distance of about twenty-two thousand nautical miles while traveling in various oceans and many oceans.
This was the first such incident in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these girls and listen to their experiences.
If we want the development journey of humankind then progress has emerged from the corners of some adventure.
In the past, you must have seen that some new things have been taken into account about those who roam on Mount Everest and for centuries, Everest has been fighting humanity and brave people have also been accepting that challenge.
On 16th May, five tribal children of a Ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra - Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Kamatode, Vikas Soyam - a group of our tribal children climbed the highest peak of the world.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Chandrapur school and my young friends.
Currently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman who crossed the Everest from Nepal.
Congratulations to Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Dia Everest have become a link to the first Indian father-son.
It is not that only the youth are praising Everest.
Sangeeta Baheel laughed at the Everest on May 1 and the age of Sangeeta Bahal is more than 50.
There are also some who smile on the Everest who showed that they have not only skills but also sensitivity.
For years, people have been praising Everest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these enthusiasts, especially the daughters and daughters.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, just two months ago when I talked about Fit India, I did not think that there would be such a good impact on it.
Such a large number of people in every sector will come forward in support of it.
When I talk of Fit India, I believe that the country will play as much as we can.
People are sharing video of fitness challenges on social media, tagging each other and challenging them.
Everyone is connecting with this campaign of Fit India today.
Whether it is the people associated with the film, the people associated with the sports world or the common man of the country, the soldiers of the country, the teacher of the school, the same voice is heard all around - 'Hum Fit to India Fit'.
It is a matter of great happiness for me that I have also given the challenge by the captain of the Indian Cricket Team, Virat Kohli and I have accepted the challenge.
I believe that this is a very good thing and such challenges will encourage us to keep fit and to keep others fit.
Chhavi Yadav ji, thank you for your phone call.
It is true that the sports that used to be a part of the lives of every child, the games that used to be lost today.
These games were particularly a part of summer vaccine.
There are two types of games in traditional sports.
There is also outside the house and is also inside the house.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these sports.
The same sports is known by different names in different places.
I am from Gujarat.
I know that there is a game in Gujarat.
They are sportspersons with combined seeds or pieces and with the square board of 88.
This game was built in almost every state.
We were also playing this game.
Who will be among us who have not played Moi Dandia (Girl Danda) in childhood
Moi Dandia (Girl Danda) is a game ranging from villages to cities.
It is known by different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
In Orissa, it is called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vittidalu.
Some sports had their own weather.
Like the kites are also a season of chewing.
When all the kites are flying, we can express the unique qualities that we have in ourselves.
You might have seen that many children are of humble nature but they become very stunned during sports.
He expresses himself, the big one who looks serious, the child who is hidden in him during sports comes out.
Traditional sports have become something in such a way that along with physical capabilities, our determination also increases the concentration, concentration, awakening and excitement.
From children to Dadadadi, Chhotanni, when all are the games, Peda is called the Generation Gap, it gets disappeared.
Many sports also make us aware of society, environment etc.
Today, it is necessary that schools, girls, youth groups etc come forward and promote these sports.
We can create a huge collection of our traditional sports through Crowd Sourcing.
My dear countrymen, On the next 5th of June, our country will be hosting the World Environment Day officially.
It is an important achievement for India and it is a proof of Indias growing leadership in the world to reduce climate change.
The theme of this time is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to you all to ensure that we do not use polythene, la grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on our wild life and on our health.
Go to the website of World Environment Day Wed-India 2018 and there are many suggestions in a very interesting manner. See, know and try to bring them to their daily life.
When there is a severe heat, floods, rains do not take the name of stopping, unbearable cold, then every person makes things about global warming, climate change, but what is the work done by talking about
In the last few weeks, all of us have seen that there was a dust blindness in different parts of the country and heavy winds along with heavy rains which are comfortable.
There was also loss of lives and loss of lives.
All these things are basically the result of the changes in climate change.
Our culture, our traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature and live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had described this thing in a way of life.
When India played a leading role in the Cop 21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the entire world through the International Solar Alliance, it was a feeling of fulfilling this dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this Environment Day, let us all think about whether we can do something to keep our planet clean and green
How can we move forward in this direction
Can we become innovative
Monsoon is to come, we can take the goal of devastating tree plantation this time and not only plant trees but also to maintain it until it grows.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends
You are remembering the 21st June, not only you but also we, the entire world remembers 21st June.
21 June is celebrated as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparations for months ago.
Nowadays, news is being received that strong preparations are being made to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day across the world.
There is a message of Yoga for Unity and Harmonius Society which the world has repeatedly experienced in the last few years.
By doing yoga, the courage is born which protects us like a simple father.
The feeling of forgiveness arises as the mother is for her children and the mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
Bharathuhari has said that by doing regular yoga, the truth becomes our child, compassionate sisters, self-confidence our brothers, the earth itself becomes our bed and knowledge hungry.
When all such qualities become friends then Yogi achieves victory over all kinds of fears.
Once again, I urge the countrymen to move forward and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation of Yoga.
Today is 2nd May, the first ever Prime Minister of India is the death anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Pandit ji.
This month of May is also associated with another thing and that is Veer Savarkar.
This was the month of May in 1985 when Indians showed their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were committed to the oppression of their bravery.
It is a matter of sadness that for a long time, we have been calling the events of 185 only rebellion or sepolitan rebellion.
In fact, this incident was seen as a neglect, but it was also an attempt to push our sovereignty.
He was Veer Savarkar who was desperately written that whatever happened in 1985 was not a rebellion but the first fight for freedom.
The heroes of India House in London, including Savarkar, celebrated their 50th anniversary with a humor.
It is also a marvellous coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the same month before independence.
Savarkar ji's personality was full of specialties
He was an administrator of both arms and sciences.
Normally Veer Savarkar is known for his bravery and his struggle against the British Raj, but apart from all these, he was also an Ozoscopy poet and a social reformer who always stressed the harmony and unity.
A marvellous description about Savarkar ji has been done by our favorite Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Atal ji had done so much painting.
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together.
He was also a brave revolutionary along with being a sensitive poet.
Our daughters who were ever forced to ask for waste from their households - today they are learning the work of sewing and covering the poor.
I extend my best wishes to our daughters full of hope and confidence for their bright future.
He has shown that if you are a pledge to do something and you are committed to it then success can be achieved among all the problems.
And it is not just a matter of sekar but in every corner of India you will get to see all this.
If you look at yourself, you will be able to see how people solve problems.
You must have experienced that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, there is also discussions and discussions with some people present along with them.
These discussions are also of politics, social, music, sports and sportspersons, also of the problems of the country, whether it is such a problem, it should be solved in such a way, but most of these things are limited to discussions but some people are those who move forward with their work, their hard work and transformation.
Shriman D.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades.
Today, you will be surprised to know that more than 70 children are filling the life of education.
He opened a school called Asha Ashwasan for children living in slums, wherein the poor tea sellers spend 50 of their income.
It provides complete arrangements for education, health and food to all the children coming to school.
I'm D.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Prakash Rao for his hard work, his compassion and giving a new direction to the life of the poor.
He has destroyed the darkness of his life.
Tamso Ma Jyotirgamayam is not aware of this Vedvakya who has shown it alive.
Light Rave .
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for the society and for the entire country.
There will also be a series of such inspirational events around you.
There will be countless incidents.
Let us take forward the positiveness.
There is so much heat in the month of June that people wait for rains and in this hope they look at the clouds in the sky.
After a few days from today, people will also wait for the moon.
The meaning of showing moon is that Id can be considered.
The festival of Eid is a symbol of the beginning of a month's fasting during Ramzan.
I am confident that all the people will celebrate Id with full zeal and on this occasion, especially the children will get good meditation.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the essence of harmony in our society.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Recently, 21st Commonwealth Games were organized in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
17 countries of the world, including India, participated in it.
When such a big event is being organised, thousands of players from all over the world are participating in it, how can you imagine
The pledge to do something, emotions, zeal, hopes, aspirations - who can keep it separate from himself when it is such an environment.
Our sportspersons also performed very well in the hopes of the countrymen and went on winning a medal after one.
Whether it is shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton, India has displayed the record.
26 gold, 20 silver and 20 bronze - India won about 66 medals.
This success gives pride to every Indian.
Winning medals is a matter of pride and happiness for sportspersons.
It is a festival of pride for the entire country, for all the countrymen.
Perhaps I have less words to express this feeling.
But I want to tell you what I heard from these players.
Specially, this time there were many things which happened for the first time.
Do you know that this time all the wrestlers from India were won in the Commonwealth Games.
Manika Batra won medals in all of whom he participated in the event.
This is the first Indian woman who won India a gold medal in the Individual Table tennis.
India has got the highest medal shooting.
The only Indian Para Power-Lifter who wins medals at the Centre's Chaudhari Commonwealth Games.
The games of this time were also special because most of the medal winners were women athletes.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting, shooting, women sportspersons have done a lot of work.
In the bedminton, the final match is Indias only two players Saina Nehwal and P.
V.
It happened in the middle of Sindhu.
The athletes who participated in the games came from different parts of the country and from small towns.
His friends also contribute to them, who have maintained their rights in every situation.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all of them along with those players.
During the Mann Ki Baat last month, I had called upon the countrymen, especially with our youth, Fit India. And I invited everyone to join such a fit India, lead a fit India.
A gentleman Shri Shashikant Bhosle has written in a swimming pool that - my weapon is my body, my health is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written, I feel myself hyppi and healthy from the morning walk.
And he further says that for me-fitness companies with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt about Devnathji that there is only hyppines fitness.
Cine artisan Akshay Kumar has put a video on Twitter.
Many other youngsters have also shared their experiences by connecting with the Fit India Defenses.
I understand that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us and for the entire country.
The Mahatma of 21st June International Day of Yoga has now been accepted by the entire world.
You should also prepare it from now on.
And you must have seen that animated video in which I have been shown is now becoming very popular.
My young friends, you will now come out of the dizziness of exam, exam, exam and exam.
How to celebrate holidays, where to go.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to revive and experience life away from the computer.
My young friends, I am appealing to you today for a special internship.
Be it Sports, HRD, Department of Drinking Water, three-four Ministries of the Government of India jointly launched this Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
The students of colleges, the youth of NCC, the youth of NSS, the youth of Nehru Yuva Kendras, who want to learn something for the society, for the country and for the country, for the change of society, who want to join themselves, for the sake of a positive energy and for all, this is an opportunity for them and this will strengthen the cleanliness and when we will be satisfied with the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, and I will also tell you that those who have done the best work in the international colleges, who have done the best work in the national level.
Every intern that successfully fulfills this internship will be given a certificate through Swachh Bharat Mission.
Not only that, the Internet will complete it very well, the UGC will also give them two credit points.
I once again invite students, students and youngsters to take advantage of it for internship.
You can go to MyGov app and register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope that our youth will further pursue this movement of cleanliness.
I also want to know about your efforts.
You must send your mothers, send stories, send photographs, send video.
Come, let us make an opportunity to learn these holidays for a new experience.
I have seen in the past that the youngsters of Delhi were showing things that are engaged in selflessness for the education of the poor children.
This campaign, which started with 15 children in slums near Gita College in Delhi, has connected 2,000 children at 12 places in the capital today.
The youth and teachers associated with this campaign are engaged in this very hard work of social transformation by taking out a free time of 2 hours from their busy routine.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
With his organised efforts not only changed his own but also his fate.
Ragi, Rajgra, Makai or Java are mainly cultivated in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand.
Being a hilly area, the farmers could not get the right price.
But the farmers of Kapkot technologies have adopted the path of value addition instead of selling this crop directly in the market.
He started making biscuits from the same sports production and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative institution in Munnar village and have also started a biscuit factory there.
Seeing the courage of the farmers, the system has also linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit is now being transported not only to about 50 Anganwadi centers of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has reached Rs. 10 to 15 lakhs but as well as those who are out of the district have started stopping the employment opportunities for more than 100 families.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that in the future there is a war with water in the world.
Everyone speaks this thing, but is it our responsibility or not
Do we not think that water conservation should be social responsibility
Our ancestors have shown it alive for centuries.
One drop of water has given priority to the greatness of water.
He has discovered such new methods how to save one drop of water .
Perhaps those of you who have got the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, there are some temples in Tamil Nadu where irrigation system, water conservation system, waste management, its big inscriptions have been written in temples.
Be it Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will get to see big inscriptions everywhere.
If you go to Rajasthan then definitely go to Chand Baw in Jodhpur .
It is one of the largest and beautiful drains in India and the point of view is that it is in the area where water deficiency remains.
April, May, June, July is such a time when there is a great opportunity to collect rain water and if we make preparations in advance, we get the benefit.
Manrega's budget also works for water conservation.
During the last three years, everybody has made its own efforts towards water conservation and water management.
About 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water management separately from Manrega Budget every year.
Talking about 2017-18, I have spent 55 of the total cost of Rs. 64 thousand crore, that is, about 35 thousand crore rupees on water conservation.
During the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land have been benefited in large quantity through water conservation and water management measures.
Some people have taken advantage of the budget that the Government of India has got in Manrega for water conservation and water management.
Thousands of Manrega workers on the Kuttumperur river in Kerala worked hard for 70 days and revived the river.
Ganga and Yamuna are rivers full of water but there are also some areas in Uttar Pradesh, like two small rivers named Sasur Khadri of Fatehpur district.
The district system has accelerated the work of soil and water conservation in large numbers under Manrega.
With the help of people from around 40-45 villages, the Sasur Khadari river, which had dried up, revived it.
Be it animals, birds, be it farmers, be it agriculture, be it village or be it a big blessing.
I will say that once again in April, May, June, July, we should take some responsibility for water conservation, we should also make some schemes, we should also show something.
When Mann Ki Baat is there then I get messages from all sides, papers and phones.
Iyen Kumar Banerjee of Devitola village in north 24 Parganas district of West Bengal has written in his conference on MyGov, we celebrate Ravindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know about the philosophy of living with the peacefulness, beauty and integrity of Rabindranath Tagore winning the Nobel Prize.
In the Mann Ki Baat programme, discuss this subject so that people can know about it.
I thank you for giving me the attention of all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was a complete personality of knowledge and discretion, whose writing has left his impressive impression on everybody.
Rabindranath was a talented personality, a multi-dimensional personality, but one of his teachers can experience every moment.
He wrote in Geetanjali, "He, who is the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students.
I do not know the Bengali language but when I was small, I had a habit of getting up very soon - from childhood and the radio of East India starts soon.
When late starts in West India, I am guessed in the morning, perhaps at 5.30 pm, Rabindra Sangeet started, on the radio and I had a habit of it.
I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Sangeet on the radio by getting up early in the morning and when the opportunity of listening to those poems of Anandloke and Aguner, Poroshamo.
You must have also been influenced by Ravindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated with full respect and respect throughout the world.
The social aspect of Rosa is that when a person is hungry then he also feels hungry of others.
He feels the thirst of others when he himself is thirsty.
This is an opportunity to recall the teachings and messages of Paygambar Mohammad Saheb.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood from their lives.
Once a person asked Paygambar Saheb, what is the best thing in Islam
Paygambar Saheb said - feeding a poor and needy person and meeting with everyone in harmony, even if you know it or not.
Paygambar Saheb believed in knowledge and compassion.
They did not deny anything.
He used to say that the arrogance only defeats knowledge.
Paygambar Mohammad Saheb believed that if you have any substance more than required, you should give it to a person with a need, then donating in Ramzan is also very important.
People donate to the needy in this sacred month.
Paygambar Mohammad Saheb believed that a person is immortal from his soul, not from money and money.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showed the strength of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima recalls the responsibility of all of us to remember Lord Buddha, try to walk on his way.
Lord Buddha is the inspirational power of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is the human values that are the most needed in the world today.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar stressed that his social philosophy has a great inspiration for Lord Buddha.
Baba Saheb has empowered millions of people who have been involved in the development of the Constitution, who are suffering, are exploited, deprived and disadvantaged.
Karuna cannot be a big example of this.
This compassion for the pain of the people was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that the Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries and they used to take along with them the rich ideas of Lord Buddha and it has been happening in every period.
The teachings of Lord Buddha all over Asia are found in our heritage.
This tradition of Buddha and the teachings of Buddha is associated with many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar. And that is the reason why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which connects important places of South-East Asia with Indias special Buddhist places.
I am also happy to note that many of the Government of India are participating in the revival of Buddhist temples, including the centuries old grand Anand Temple in Myanmar.
Today, everywhere in the world, the teachings of Lord Buddha are showing the path of elimination of humiliation.
I extend my best wishes to all those who believe in the principles of compassion and faith in Lord Buddha spread across the world.
I seek blessings from Lord Buddha for the whole world so that we can take our responsibility to build a peaceful and compassionate world based on their teachings.
Today, when we recall Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Lafing Buddha, about which it is said that Lafing Buddha brings good luck but very few people know that Smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event of Indias defence history.
You will imagine what is the relationship between Smiling Buddha and Indias military power
You must be remembered that 20 years ago, on the evening of 11th May, 1988, the then Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, addressed the nation and his words filled the entire country with pride, pride and happiness.
That day was Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 18th, on the west of India, nuclear test was conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan.
Indias experiment was successful and in a way, India had exhibited its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked as an exhibition of its military power in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has shown the world, it is necessary for internal power, the power of inner power, peace.
Similarly, when you are strong in the form of a country, you can also be peaceful with you all.
The month of May, 18 is not merely important for the country that there was a nuclear test in this month but it is important to do the same in the same way.
He showed the whole world that India's land is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can meet the elevators and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra: Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan Jai-Sgyan.
We can also achieve a new joy and new satisfaction to take forward the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, I will talk more when I meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ram Navami.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this sacred festival of Ram Navami.
We have seen the strength of the name Ram in his life every moment.
In the past, on 26th January, when all the dignitaries of the ASEAN countries were here, they had brought a cultural approach with them and it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting Ramayana in front of us.
That is, Ramayana and Ramayana are not only in India but also in Asian countries in this region of the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, like every time, I have met all your friends, e-mails, phone calls and comments in large numbers.
I read what Kamal Thakurji wrote about starting the online course of Sanskrit on MyGov.
It seemed very good to see your love for Sanskrit with the help of being IT professional.
I have asked the concerned department to provide information about the efforts made in this regard to you.
I would also urge the audience of Mann Ki Baat, who works in the context of Sanskrit, to think about what can be done in the context of Kamal ji's suggestions.
Shriman Dhanshyam Kumar ji, Village Barakar, District Nalanda, Bihar. You read the comments written on Narendra Modi App.
The concerns you have expressed on the declining water level in the land are very important.
Shriman Shastri ji, Karnataka.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animal birds in summer.
Shakal ji, I have delivered your feelings to all the admirers.
Mr. Yogesh Bhadresha ji, he says that this time I talk to the youth about his health.
They feel that if compared to Asian countries, our youth is physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time, talk to everyone about health-fit India.
And all of you can join hands and drive the movement of Fit India.
In the past, French chief visited Kashi. Shri Prasant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of this journey were touching the mind and affecting the mind.
And he urged that all these information should be published on the video social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had put the news on the same day on the social media and Narendra Modi App.
Now you like them and retweet them, reach your friends.
Andha, Jaiesh and many children from Chennai have written in their hearts about the gratitude cards that they have given behind the book Exam Warrior.
Andha, Jayesh, I want to tell you all the children that your letters snatch my tiredness all day.
All such letters, all such phone calls, combinations, however I can read, however I can hear and there are many of these things that have touched my mind - even if you talk about them, I will have to go continuously for months.
This time, most of the newspapers are children who have written about the examination.
He has spoken of his plans on holidays.
Water has been anxious for animals in summers.
Farmer brothers and sisters have come to know about the activities related to Kisan Melas and farming across the country.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions regarding water conservation.
During the festivals, our festivals, our culture, our traditions are talking about.
That is, the things of our mind also change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the things of our mind change the weather of somebody's life.
And why not instead
In these things, in your experiences, in your examples, all such inspirations, all such energy, all such spirituality, and for the country there is a need to do something.
It has the power to change the climate of the entire country.
When I get to read in your letters how Ahmad Ali, a Riksha driver of Karimganj, Assam, has made new schools for the poor children with his will.
Saydule collected money from household households and donations in his mission.
Several tourists traveling in their cabs were generously donated.
An engineer girl gave her first step
Thus, after 12 years of collection of money, Saddul Laskar had brought the color of his hard work and today due to his own hard work, he is ready to become a hospital with a capacity of about 30 beds in Puri village near Kolkata.
This is the strength of New India.
Today, the vision of India has changed all over the world.
Today, in the entire country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, in every section of the country this confidence has been awakened or yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward.
It has become a positive environment of self-confidence full of hopes and expectations.
This self-confidence, this positiveness will fulfill our resolve of New India and fulfill our dreams.
My dear countrymen, the next few months is very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why many newspapers have come in the context of agriculture.
This time, I also visited the video of the farmers on the DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan and I feel that every farmer should connect with this DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan and implement these experiments in his field.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji, Chaudhari Devilal ji, everyone considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and common life of the country.
Similarly, Red Bahadur Shastri ji used to emphasize the need for plants, trees and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
Ramanohar Lohia spoke of mass awareness on a large scale for ensuring greater income, better irrigation facilities and food and milk production for our farmers.
In his speech in 1977, Chaudhari Charansingh ji stressed the need for farmers to use new technology, innovation.
I went to the Agricultural Unnati Mela in Delhi last days.
My interaction with the farmers brothers and sisters and scientists, knowing, understanding and innovation related to agriculture - all this was a pleasant experience for me but the hard work of the farmers of Meghalaya and the region was the most affected by me.
This state with lesser area has shown a lot of work.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced irreversible products over the last five years during 2015-16.
He has shown that when the goal is determined, the determination of the mind, it can be achieved and shown.
Today, the hard work of the farmers is getting technology support, which is giving a lot of strength to the agricultural producers.
In the letters that have come to me, I was seeing that many farmers had written about the spirit of support and wanted them to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to give farmers the right price of crops.
It has been decided that the price of support for the specified crops will be declared at least one and a half times of their expenditure.
Efforts are being made to connect the local markets of the villages to the local markets and then to the global market.
Farmers do not have to go far away to sell their yields - for this, 22,000 rural hatos of the country will be upgraded with the necessary interface and connected with APMC and e-NAM platform.
That is, in a way, a direct connectivity of any market of the country with the field is being made.
My dear countrymen, this year the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will be inaugurated.
How does the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our pledge. Besides, how can the hundreds of millions of countrymen pay a great tribute to Gandhiji
How new activities can be respected for this
I urge you all to share your thoughts with everyone through MyGov.
How should the lago of Gandhi 150
Inform you about how slogan or mantra or declaration is suitable.
We all have to pay tribute to Bapu together and remember Bapu and take inspiration from them and bring our country to new heights.
Thanks, thanks, you have said the truth and I believe that Swachh Bharat and Healthy India are supplementary to each other.
Today the country has moved ahead with a strong approach in the field of health.
Every work related to health in the country was earlier the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, when all the Departments and Ministry of Health, whether it is Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Protection or Ministry of Women Child Development or State Governments are working together to work for a healthy India and with affordable health.
Preventive health care is also the cheapest and the easiest.
And as much as we are aware of the environmental health care, the same person, the family and the society will also benefit.
It is the first need for life to be healthy - Swachhta.
We all have picked up a bed in the form of a country and the result was that in the last 4 years, the Sanitation Coverage has doubled to about 80.
Besides, work is being done at a comprehensive level in the direction of setting up of Health Welfare Centres across the country.
It is the result of the commitment of all of us that Yoga has become a collective movement and has reached home.
This time International Day of Yoga has saved less than 100 days for 21st June.
On the last three International Yoga Days, people took part in the country and everywhere in the world with great zeal.
This time also we have to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends and all for Yoga from now on.
With new interesting methods, Yoga has to be popular in children, in youth, in adults - in all ages, in men or women.
Though the country's TV and electronic media are taking various programmes in the context of Yoga during the year, can you create awareness about Yoga in the form of a campaign from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
Yes, I need yoga practitioner but some people have made me a Yoga teacher through their creativity and have made 3D animated video of my yoga.
I will share the video with all of you so that we can practice asanas and pranayama along with us.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level to ensure that healthcare is inserted and nutritional, affordable and accessible to the common man.
The cost of heart stents for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
The number of MBBS meetings in the existing 4 medical colleges of the country has been increased to about 68 thousand.
New AIIMS (AIIMS) are being set up in various states to provide better treatment and healthcare to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every three districts.
We all will see a collective effort to get rid of B.
Years ago, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
Industry was an effective medium for them to provide employment to the poorest.
Today, when the Make in India campaign is going on successfully in the country, Dr.
The vision of a dream that Ambedkar had dreamt of India as an industrial power is inspiring for us today.
Today, India is emerging as a shining point in the global economy and today the highest foreign direct investment in the world is coming to India.
The entire world is seeing India as a centre for capital, innovation and development.
The development of industries would be possible in the cities only because of which Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar trusted the urbanization of India.
He did not want a person to live his life in poverty.
With this, he also believed that poverty cannot be overcome by distributing only something among the poor.
Today Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India Initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators, young entrepreneurs.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of ports and waterways during the 1930s and 1940s when only roads and railways were talked about in India.
He's Dr.
Babasaheb was the one who saw the water power as the nation's power.
He stressed on the use of water for the development of the country, various River Valley Authorities, Water related Aayogs, all this was the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today, historical efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on various seashores of India and the inter-connect on the old ports is being strengthened.
During the 40th decade, most of the discussions were held in the context of World War II, Cold War and Division.
Ambedkar laid the foundation stone of the spirit of Team India in a way.
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism and stressed on working together with the Centre and States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism in every aspect of governance and the most important thing is Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people like me associated with the backward classes.
He has shown us that it is not necessary to move forward that it is born only in a big family, but people born in the poor families of India can also see their dreams, they can try to fulfill their dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it has also been made that many people have made Dr.
He tried to push them back and made every possible effort to ensure that the daughters of the poor and backward families cannot move forward, nothing can be made, nothing can be achieved in life.
But the news of New India is very different.
An India that belongs to Ambedkar, belongs to the poor and the backward.
Under this, there will be various programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across India.
I urge you all to participate in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, in the coming days many festivals are going to be held, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi.
The day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir is a day to recall his sacrifice and penance.
The life philosophy of Ahimsa's messenger Lord Mahavir ji will inspire all of us.
Greetings to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
When Ester's discussions come out, the inspiring teachings of Lord Jesus Christ are reminded of the message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion to ethnic humanity.
In April, the festival of Baisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India, in the same days, Judshital and Satuvan in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and the jealousy of Poila Vaisakh in West Bengal will be spread.
All these festivals are connected to our farming sectors and foodgrains in some form and through these festivals, we thank the nature for the invaluable gifts that are produced in the form of fertilizers.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the coming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat February 2018
My dear countrymen, today we start Mann Ki Baat from a phone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science.
We have seen that the color of the sea looks blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water.
Have we ever thought that the river, the sea, the water becomes colorful
This question came to the mind of a young man in the decade of 120.
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India.
The name of Raman comes to us.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for excellent work on the light skettering i. e.
One of his discoverys is known as Raman Effect.
We are celebrating the National Science Day every year on 28th February as it is said that on this day, the event of light skating was discovered, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand, there has been a tradition of great dignitaries Bodhyana, Bhaskar, Brahmaputra and Aryabhatta and on the other hand we are proud and proud in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana are proud of India.
In the name of Satyendranath Bose, the famous participant Boson was also named.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a programme in Mumbai to inaugurate Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles that are happening in the field of science.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor, the deprived or the needy.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I urged the scientific community to facilitate the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters, how to help artificial intelligence.
Can Artificial Intelligence help in facilitating health services and eliminating modern diseases
A few days ago, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had the opportunity to visit the inauguration of the I Create in Gujarat, Ahmedabad.
A young man, a digital instrument has been developed and showed that if anyone cannot speak, then he is in a dialogue with the help of instrument and he can communicate in the same way as a speaker interacts.
I understand that we can use Artificial Intelligence in many ways.
Science and technology values are coastal.
In terms of value it is not good or bad on its own.
Any machine will work as we want.
But it depends on us what we want to do with the machine.
Here the humanitarian objective becomes important.
Use of science for the welfare of humanity, use to achieve the highest heights of human life.
Thomas Alva Adison, who invented the Light Bulb, failed many times in his experiments.
I am fortunate to note that today I am in Auroville, the land of Maharishi Arabic.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
In this way, he questioned every aspect of life as a great sage.
They searched for answers and waited for humanity.
In order to know the truth, the spirit of asking questions is of great importance.
This is the true inspiration behind scientific research.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I convey my best wishes to all our scientists and people associated with science.
My best wishes for our younger generation to be inspired to explore truth and knowledge, to serve the society with the help of science.
Friends, At the time of complications, I keep getting many messages related to all these subjects and people keep writing something or the other.
From Pune, Shriman Ravindra Singh has spoken on the subject of Occupational Safety in his comment on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He has written that the safety parameters on factories and construction sites in our country are not so good.
The next 4th of March is Indias National Safety Day, the Prime Minister should talk about security in his Mann Ki Baat programme so that people are aware of safety.
When we talk of public safety, two things are very important - one Proactiveness and the other Preparedness.
Safety is of two types - one that is required at the time of disasters, safety diagnostics and the other, which is required in daily life, safety in availability life.
If we are not aware of safety in our daily life, we cannot achieve it then it becomes difficult to sink during the disasters.
We all read the boards written on the roads often, it has been written in it: Awareness Hati, an accident declining, an error destruction, do not leave the world at the earliest of happiness and joy, do not take any fun to connect with the security of the society, the life of the work is cheaper than that of this thing is never used in our life.
If we are cautious, follow the necessary rules, we can protect our lives, but we can also generate the society with very big accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that there are many instruments written by taking safety in the workplace but whenever we want, it does not seem to be followed.
I urge the Mahanagar Palikas, Nagar Palikas, who have fire brigades, to visit different schools once a week or once in a month, to drill the school children in front of them.
There will be two benefits - Fire Brigade will also have the habit of being alert and the new generation also gets its education and there is no different expenditure for this. In a way, there is a sequence of education and I have always been urging this thing.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading the countrys import management.
Apada Mitra has also been initiated for the training of volunteers in the districts of flood, cyclone risky districts.
Training and awareness have a very important role.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year from Lu-Heatwave.
After that, NDM organized a workshop for the redressal of HTV and launched a campaign to bring awareness among the people.
A good result has come up with the participation of all.
The number of deaths from Lu in 2017 was surprisingly reduced to about 20.
It can be ascertained from this that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
Be it social organisation, awakening citizen - I want to describe everybody who is sufficient, gets relief and rescue operations within minutes.
And the number of such anonymous heroes is not less.
(BIMSTEC) - Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal, a Joint Disaster Management Exercise of these countries was one of the first and big human uses.
We have to become a risk conscious society.
In our culture, we always talk about the safety of values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of values of safety and security.
We have to make it a part of our life.
This means what was the system of giving information
Because we are not aware of nature and for this, we hear our ears after sitting in the air, but none of us feels that this suggestion is for me.
Such a unique experience is in every field of our life.
We should not think that security is for anyone else, if all of us become aware of our safety then the spirit of security of the society is also included in it.
The objective of this Gobardhan scheme is to make villages clean and to generate wealth and energy by transforming the dense waste of cattle and fields into compost and bio-gas.
Some European countries and China, cattle dung and other biological disadvantages are used to produce energy but their full potential is not being used in India.
We are now moving forward in this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen.
The goal of using dhore dung, waste from agriculture, waste from kitchen, all these biogas based energy has been set up.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers will be encouraged in rural India to look at dung and waste not only as a waste but as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas.
It will help in keeping villages clean, better animal health and increase productivity.
Biogas will increase self-reliance in energy quantity for cooking and lighting of food.
Farmers and animal husbandry will be helpful in increasing income.
New jobs will be available for waste collection, transportation, biogas sale etc.
An online trading platform will also be set up for smooth management of Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect the farmers to the buyers so that farmers can get the right price of dung and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially our sisters living in rural India to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating self-help groups.
I invite you to be a partner of this movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs and take initiatives in the direction of converting the waste into wealth and making Gobar Dhan from Gobar to Gobar Dhan.
My dear countrymen, till now we have been listening to music festivals, food festivals, film festivals.
However, a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh in which the first Kachhar Festival was organised in the state.
The objective of the festival being organised by the Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about cleanliness, creative use of the city's waste and awareness about various ways to reuse the carbage.
During this festival, there were several activities in which students to adults, all were included.
Different types of art works were made using waste.
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of the Waste Management.
Music performances were made on the theme of Swachhta and Art Works were made.
Inspired by Raipur, different kinds of waste festivals were held in other districts too.
Innovative ideas, interactions and poetry were conducted by everybody on their own side by taking initiatives.
In the context of cleanliness, an environment like a festival was created.
The manner in which school children took part, it was wonderful.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Raipur Nagar Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and the administration for the innovative performance of the importance ofwaste management and sanitation in this festival.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on 8th March.
There are many programmes in the country and the world.
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country is also admired by women who have worked in different fields in the past.
I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda on this occasion.
Today, it is our commitment to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life that is the responsibility of all of us.
We are a part of the tradition where men were identified by women. Yashodan, Kaushalyanandan, Gandhariputra, this was the identity of a son.
Today, our women's power has introduced self-reliance and self-reliance with their works.
He has not only pursued himself but also worked to take the country and society forward and take it to a new stage.
Finally, our dream of New India is the same where women are empowered, strong and equal partners in the entire development of the country.
In the last few days, I had a very beautiful suggestion.
He suggested that there are several programmes to celebrate Women's Day on 8th March. Can the honour of those mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village or town
And can you talk about a long life
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, about 15 lakh women - and this figure is not small, 15 lakh women have organized a Swachhta Abhiyan for a month.
Beginning from 26th January, 2018, these women have set up a new example by constructing one lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days under this campaign.
You can imagine how big it is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will be able to convert Swachhta Abhiyan into the nature of the common man in the normal life effectively.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in News that electricity has reached the three villages of Elephanta Islands after 70 years of independence and there is a lot of joy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all know well that Elephanta Island is 10 kilometres away from the sea from Mumbai.
I was surprised to know that despite being close to Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years of independence.
For 70 years, three villages of Elephanta Islands Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sethbandar have been darkened in the lives of the people there.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am happy that now the caves of Elephanta and Elephanta will be lighted by electricity.
It is not just electricity but also a new beginning of development.
What can be the second moment of satisfaction and happiness beyond the life of the countrymen
My dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
Now this month is the speciality of this month, the fields decorated with the swimming crops, the golden boiling of joyful wheat and the beauty of orange flourishing the mind.
But this month is also very loved by all of us for the festival of Holi.
On March 2, the entire country will celebrate Holi Festival with Harsholas.
The more important in Holi is the Holika Dahan as it is a day to destroy the evils by burning them in fire.
Holi is a good opportunity to forget all the sorrows and join each other's happiness and gives a message of love unity and brotherhood.
My best wishes and best wishes to all of you people for the Holi festival.
This festival should be filled with colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first Mann Ki Baat of 2018 and two days ago, we celebrated the Republic with great zeal and for the first time in history it became such that the leaders of 10 countries were present at this function.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathy has written a long letter on the Narendra Modi App and has urged me to touch the subjects written in his letter.
He has written that on February 17, the imagination of the space is the death anniversary of Chawla.
He left us in the Colombia spacecraft accident but inspired millions of youth from all over the world.
I am grateful to Brother Prakash ji that he has started his long letter with the imagination of Chawla.
It is a matter of sadness for everyone that we lost imagination at such a young age, but they gave a message to thousands of Indian women from all over the world, especially to women that there is no limit for women's power.
There is nothing impossible if there is a desire and a strong resolve, if there is a strong desire to do something.
It is a pleasure to see that today women in India are moving forward at a rapid pace in every field and enhancing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the honour of women in our country, their place and their contribution to the society has been surprised by the whole world.
The long tradition of Indian wizards has been.
India has contributed to the creation of Vedas loans.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi are many names.
Today we talk of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, but centuries ago in our scriptures, in Skandpuran, it has been said: Dasputra Samakanya, Dasputra Pravardhana.
The more sacred than ten goats will be received from a daughter.
It reflects the importance of women in our society.
And that is why women have been given the status of Shakti in our society.
This women's power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family, in the form of unity.
Shriman Prakash Tripathy has given many examples ahead.
He has written that our adventurous defence Prime Minister, Nirmala Sithara, is inspiring to fill the flights in Sukhoi 30.
He also mentioned that the women crew members of the Indian Navy under the leadership of Vartika Joshi are circulating the world over the INSV trinity.
Three brave women have become Bhavna Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi Fighter Pilot and are taking training in Sukhoi-30.
Under the leadership of Shakti Vajpayee, Ol Vemen Crew flyed from Delhi to San Francisco in America and Parat Delhi to Air India Boating jets - and all the women back.
In the past, Honble President ji made a new initiative.
The President visited a group of extraordinary women who first performed something in their respective fields.
The first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Everest, the first woman to reach Everest, the first woman train driver of the Passenger train, the first female firefighter, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Everest.
Our women powers have achieved extraordinary achievements by breaking the conservation of the society.
He pointed out that a new path can be created by crossing all the obstacles and obstacles on the strength of hard work, integrity and determination.
A road that will not only inspire the people of their contemporary times but also inspire many generations to come.
He will fill them with a new passion and enthusiasm.
A book has also been prepared on this Women Echiver, First Ladies so that the whole country can know about these women powers, inspire them from their lives and their works.
He is also eligible in the form of e-book on Narendra Modi website.
Today, the country's women power has an important role in the positive changes in the country and the society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I want to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment you will be thinking about what is the relationship between these two
Mumbai's Matunga station is India's first station where all women workers are.
In all the departments, be it Women Staff-Chahe Commercial Department, be it Railway Police, be it ticket checker, be it administrator, Point Person, the staff of more than 40 employees belongs to women.
This time, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media after visiting the Republic Day parade that the parade was one of the main points of BSF biker continent, in which all women were participating.
He was experiencing experiments with courage and this scene was also surprised by the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today our women power is leading.
When it comes to the tribal women, there is a definite situation in the minds of all who have wilderness, footprints, the ladders are high on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women's strength has made a new place in front of the country.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area, has created a terrible atmosphere of violence, bombs, guns, pistols and Maoists.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running E-Rikshaw in such a dangerous area.
Many women have been associated with it in a short span of time.
And there are three benefits from this, on the one hand, where self-employment has worked to empower them, on the other hand the situation of the Maoist-affected area is changing.
And with all this, it is also strengthening the work of environmental protection.
For centuries, efforts have been made at the individual and social level in our country against social evils and evils.
Just a few days ago Bihar made an interesting initiative.
In order to eradicate social evils from the roots in the state, the world's longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometres has been made human chain.
Through this campaign, people were made aware of the evils of childless and burning practices.
The entire state has taken a pledge to fight with evils like Dahej and Child Marriage.
The youngsters, mothers and sisters, everybody, who were full of zeal and zeal, had participated in this jungle.
The human chain that started from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna has been connecting to the borders of the state in an unbreakable manner.
It is necessary for all the people of the society to get the benefit of development in the true sense that our society is free from these evils.
Come, let us take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and build a New India, a powerful and capable India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the State, the administration and the human chain, who made such a special and comprehensive initiative in the direction of social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Mysore, Shriman Darshan of Karnataka has written on MyGov: The cost of medicines was Rs 6,000 in a month on the treatment of his father.
He did not know about the first Prime Minister Jan Aushadhi Kendra.
But now when they got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and bought medicines from there, their cost of medicines decreased by 5 percent.
He has expressed his desire to talk about it in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that most people can know about it and take advantage of it.
For the past few years many people used to write to me about this.
I have also seen the video and social media of many people who have benefited from this scheme.
And when I get this kind of information, I am very happy.
There is a deep satisfaction.
And I felt very nice that the idea of Shriman Darshan ji has come in the minds of others.
The objective behind this scheme is to make health care affordable and promote Ease of Living.
The medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper from about 50 to 0 of the branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps the common man, especially the senior citizens who take medicines everyday.
The generic medicines sold in it are according to the prescribed standards of World Health Organization.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
It not only provides affordable medicines but also provides new employment opportunities for Industrial Entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available on the Amrit Stores of the Prime Minister, Indian Jan Aushadhi Kendras and Hospitals.
The only objective behind all these is to make the poorest of the country uality and Health Service accessible so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
This photo was such that my attention was drawn towards that picture.
The photograph was in which a grandson was participating in the cleanliness drive of the Clean Moorna River with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised a Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morana river under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Mora river flows for the first twelve months but now it has become seasonal.
The other thing is that the river was completely filled with wild jungles, water pools.
Some garbage was being put on the river and its shores.
Action Plan was prepared and one day before the Makar Sankranti, the two coasts of Morana river were cleaned at four places in the area of four kilometres under the first phase of Mission Clean Moorna on January 13.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 engineers, college students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters, participated in this nack work of Mission Clean Moor.
This sanitation programme was continued on 20th January, 2018 and I was told that till the river Moorna was completely cleaned, this campaign would run on every Saturday morning.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then nothing is impossible.
Large changes can be brought through mass movement.
I express my gratitude to the people of Akola, the administration of the district and the municipal corporation for their efforts to make this work a mass movement.
My dear countrymen, you will be listening to several discussions about the Padma Awards these days.
It also attracts attention to this topic and TV.
You will be proud of the fact that how many great people are among us and it will naturally be proud of how the common man in our country is reaching the heights without any impression.
Every year there has been a tradition of awarding Padmas but in the last three years, the entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone.
The entire process has become transparent due to online.
In a way, the select process of these awards has been completely transformed.
Now the significance of the work of the person is not being identified for the award.
You must have heard that Shriman Arvind Gupta Ji, you will be happy to know that Arvind Ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has dedicated his entire life to make medals for children.
They have been making sports from garbage for four decades so that the knowledge of science in children can increase.
They are trying to inspire children from uncomfortable things towards scientific experiments, for which they are inspiring children by visiting 3,000 schools across the country to showcase films made in 18 languages.
How wonderful life, how wonderful dedication.
One such thing is about the Sitava alliance of Karnataka.
They are not called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades, he has contributed greatly to changing the lives of countless women in Belagavi.
He had dedicated himself to Devdasi at the age of seven years but then he laid his entire life for the welfare of the deities.
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in an extremely poor family, tribal family.
He used to do normal jobs for lifetime but was keen to make traditional tribal paintings.
Today he is honoured not only in India but also in the whole world because of this mourning.
His pictures have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England, Italy.
The talent of Bhujhu Shyam ji, who brought the name of India abroad, was recognized and he was honored with Padma Shri.
You will be surprised by listening to the talk of the tribal woman Lakshmikutti of Kerala.
Laxmikutti is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of tamarind leaves in the tribal area amidst dense forests.
He has made five hundred herbal medicines based on his memory.
He has been able to make the medicines used after snake bites.
Lakshmiji is continuously serving the society with his knowledge of her herbal medicines.
He was honored with Padmashree for his contribution to the society by identifying this anonymous person.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold vegetables and utensils in other houses to build a hospital.
When he was 23 years old, his husband died due to lack of treatment and inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in their hard work hospitals.
I am sure that there are many such men and women in our variety of varieties that no one knows or identifys them.
The Padma Puraskar is a medium but I will also tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who are living around us, who are dedicated to the society, who have worked with some specialty and sometimes in the middle of the society.
They do not work for respect, but because of their work, we get inspiration.
Sometimes in schools, colleges, such people should listen to their experiences.
Beyond the award, there should be some efforts in the society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
This is 9th January when the revered Mahatma Gandhi had returned to India from South Africa.
On that day, we celebrate the festival of untouchable bondage between Indians living in India and all over the world.
This year, we organized a programme on Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas in which all the members of Indian origin from all over the world and invited the Mayors.
You will be glad to note that in this programme, each of our original Indian mayors, where the original Indian parliamentarians have participated from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and other countries.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are serving those countries and they have made their strong relations with India. This time I have sent the European Union to Klander in which they have shown their contribution in different fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Our original Indians who are living in different countries of Europe, are working in a cyber security, some are dedicated to Ayurveda, some are dedicated to the minds of the society with their music, some of their poems.
I would like to thank you for this remarkable work of the European Union, for recognising the people of Indian origin and for giving information to the people around the world through them.
On 30th January, there is a death anniversary of worshipped Bapu, who showed us a new path.
At present, we see every step that how true the things of Bapu were.
If we swear that we can walk on the path of Bapu, what can be a greater tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I convey my warm greetings to you all for 2018.
Mann Ki Baat December 2019
This is the last programme of Mann Ki Baat this year and see that today is the last day of 2019.
This year we and you have shared a lot of things.
Exchange of all your letters, comments and ideas for Mann Ki Baat always brings a new energy for me.
Years will change after a few hours but this sequence of our things will continue in the same way.
In the coming years, we will do more innovative things, we will share new experiences.
My best wishes to all of you for the year 2018.
Recently, on December 25, the festival of Natal was celebrated worldwide with humor.
People in India also celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm.
On this occasion of Christmas, we all recall the greater teachings of the Jesus Christ, and Isha Masiha stressed the most important thing: 'Sevabhav'.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th light festival of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The unusual life of Guru Gobind Singh ji is an inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji taught the great values of life and he lived his life on the basis of these values.
A Guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, such as Guru Gobind Singh Ji has worked to inspire the people in all these roles.
He fought against persecution and injustice.
He instructed people to break the bonds of caste and religion.
In these efforts, he had to lose a lot personally.
But he never gave a place to the feeling of hatred.
The message of love, sacrifice and peace at every moment of life was his personality full of great features.
Let us take all the pledges and take inspiration from the great teachings and inspiring life of Guru Gobind Singh ji and try to drive life in accordance with it.
Those who are born in 2000 or after that will become eligible voters from 1st January, 2018.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century New India voters.
I congratulate our youth and urge all of you to register as your voter.
The whole of India is eager to welcome you as a voter of the 21st century.
You will also be proud of the 21st century voter.
Your vote will be the basis of New India.
The power of vote is the biggest strength in democracy.
Mat is the most effective instrument for bringing positive changes in the lives of lakhs of people.
You can also become the builder of the 21st century and it is being started in a special way from January 1st.
And today in my Mann Ki Baat, I would like to interact with our youth full of energy and resolve of 18 to 25 years.
I am confident that our energy-loving youth will be fulfilled by the skills and their strength.
When we talk of a New India, a New India which is free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Be free from dirt and poverty.
New India, where there is equal opportunity for all, where the aspirations of all are fulfilled.
New India is our inspirational strength of peace, unity and harmony.
My New India Youth will come forward and churn how it will become a New India.
They will also set a way for themselves, connecting them with them and keep moving forward.
You also move forward, the country also moves forward.
When I am talking to you today, I thought that can we organise a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Where the youth of 18 to 25 years of age will sit together and churn on New India, find roads and plans.
How will we achieve our resolves before 2022
How can we build an India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi had made the freedom movement a mass movement.
My young friends, there is a need for the time that we also create a mass movement for the 21st century magnificent divine India.
How to achieve with determination
Today, many new opportunities are created for the youth.
From Skill Development to Innovation and Interpreneurship, our youth are coming forward and succeeding.
I would like to know about all these occasions how to get this New India Youth at one place and create a system on this occasion so that when 18 years of age, they can get information about this world and take the necessary benefits.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, I talked about the importance of positiveness.
I remember a shloka of Sanskrit that means a person full of zeal is very powerful because there can be nothing ahead of enthusiasm.
There is nothing impossible for a person with positiveness and enthusiasm.
People also say in English - Pessimism Leads to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
I had called upon the people of Mann Ki Baat to share your positive moments of the year 2019 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am happy that a large number of people gave a very positive pattern on the social media platform, MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
Millions of tweets were made with positive India Heshteg, which reached more than one and a half crore people.
In a way, the transmission of positiveness in India spreads all over the world.
The tweets and talents that came to us were really inspiring.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some countrymen have shared the events of this year which had a special impact on their minds and had a positive impact.
Some people shared their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Faz One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I talk to the Bodel.
Our insurance was in which a premium of one rupee was paid every month.
It was done by my husband and he died in an accident.
We only know what happened to us at that time.
With this help of the government, we got a lot of benefit and I could have a little meeting with it.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
From our village, the National Highway has passed from Bhinnar village since 2019.
Our roads have become very well and trade will also increase.
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja, Area Sadatganj, District Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satis Bewani.
We had a problem of water in our area and for the last 40 years we had to depend on the Army pipeline.
Now this pipeline has been done separately - free.
So all these big achievements are in our 2019.
There are many people who are doing such work at their own level, which is bringing about positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India which we are building together.
Come, let us enter the new year with the joys of this young man, start the new year and take strong steps towards 'Positive India' to 'Progressive India'.
When we talk about positiveness, I also want to share one thing.
Recently, I found the inspirational point of the Topper Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak of the administrative service in Kashmir.
He has obtained the first grade in the examination of the Kashmir Administrative Service by emerging out of the turbulence of terrorism and hatred.
You will be surprised to know that in the 10th, the terrorists had burnt their ancestral houses.
Terrorism and violence were so much that their family had to leave their ancestral land and come out.
For a small child, the atmosphere of such violence was enough to generate darkness and bitterness in the heart - but Anjum did not let it happen.
He never left hope.
He chose a different path for himself - the path of service to the people.
He crossed the opposite situation and wrote his stories of success himself.
Today, he has become an inspiration for not only the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that no matter how bad the situation is, the clouds of despair can be discovered by positive work.
Just last week, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
And when I was listening to him, he wanted to make progress in the field of life.
The time I spent with those daughters, I also got inspiration and this is the strength of the country. This is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, not only of our country but also of the world's famous religious places, it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala.
Every year millions of devotees come here to seek the blessings of Lord Ayappa Swami in this world famous temple.
Where such a large number of devotees come in such a large number, where such a great great place is there, how big challenge is it to maintain cleanliness
And especially those places which are located between mountains and forests.
But how this problem can be changed into Sanskrit, how to find out the way out of the problem, and how the power in public participation is so powerful, the Sabarimala temple itself is an example.
P.
A police officer, Vijayan, launched a programme Punyam Punkwanam and launched a voluntary campaign for awareness for cleanliness under the programme.
And made a tradition that the journey of those travellers who come is not fulfilled till they don't have any physical work in the Swachhta programme.
There is no bigger or smaller in this campaign.
Every traveller understands the same part of the worship of God and gives some time for cleanliness, works and works for eliminating dirt.
Everyday in the morning the scene of cleanliness is very marvellous and all the pilgrimages take place in it .
Many people do not have a big CELEBRITY, no rich person, no big officer, every person becomes a part of this Punyama Punkvanam programme like a common traveler and moves forward by cleaning it.
We have many such examples for our countrymen.
The Swachhta Abhiyan in Sabarimala and Punyama Punkvanam in it become a part of the journey of every traveller.
At the same time, there is a strong resolve of cleanliness along with hard work.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, we all have resolved that the incomplete work of worshipped Bapu is Swachh Bharat, a dirty India.
Pujya Bapu continued to shout for this work throughout his life.
And we all decided that when Bapu's 150th birth anniversary, we should do something in the direction of giving him the dream of India, Swachh Bharat.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level across the country towards cleanliness.
Transformation is also being seen from the widespread public participation in rural and urban areas.
To examine the achievements of cleanliness level in urban areas, the worlds largest survey - Swachh Survekshan-2018 will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018.
This survey will be conducted in more than four thousand cities in a population of about 40 crore.
The facts that will be explored in this survey, open defecation free in cities, collection of waste, transportation systems for carrying waste, efforts made for scientific processing, behavioural change, innovative efforts made for capacity building and cleanliness and public participation for this work.
During this survey, various teams will go and inspection cities.
He will interact with the citizens and take their reactions.
Analysis of the use of Swachhta App and improvement of various services.
It will also be seen whether such arrangements have been made by cities so that the cleanliness of the city becomes the nature of the people and the nature of the city.
Cleanliness should not be done only by the government.
Every citizen and civil organisation is also a big responsibility.
And I have called upon every citizen to participate in the cleanliness that is going to be done in the coming days.
And if your city doesn't stay behind, the streets of yours will not be left behind.
I am sure that the use of green and blue waste after separating dry wastes and wet wastes from the house would have become your habit.
From 4th January to 10th March, 2018, in the Swachhta Survey, you should not stay behind in this healthy competition of cleanliness - it should be a subject of public discussion in every city.
And you should dream of ourselves, our city - our effort, our progress - the progress of the country.
Come along with this resolve, let us once again recall the revered Bapu and take a pledge of Swachh Bharat and test the Purushartha.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that seem very small, but as a society, it is affecting our identity far and wide.
Today, through this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share such a thing with you.
It is a matter of fact that if a Muslim woman wants to go for Haj pilgrimage then she cannot go without Maharam or her Male Guardian.
When I heard about it for the first time, I thought how could this happen
Who would have made such rules
Why does this difference come
And when I went into its depth, I was distressed. Even after 70 years of independence, we were the people who put up such a restriction.
For decades, there was injustice to Muslim women but there was no discussion about them.
Even in many Islamic countries, this is not a rule.
But Muslim women did not have this right in India.
And I am happy that our government has focused on it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs also took the necessary steps and we removed this restriction by abolishing the tradition that has been going on for 70 years.
Today, Muslim women can go to Haj without Mehram and I am happy that this time about 1300 Muslim women have applied to go to Haj without Mehram and from different parts of the country, from Kerala to North, women have expressed their desire to travel to Haj.
I am confident and my firm belief is that India's development journey has moved forward and will continue to move forward on the strength of our women's strength.
We should constantly try that our women also get equal rights to men, equal opportunities so that they can move forward together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26 January is a historic festival for us.
On Republic Day, it will be not one but ten main guests.
This has never happened before in the history of India.
2019 has been special for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2019 and completed 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2017 itself.
It is a matter of pride for our Indians to be present together with these great leaders of 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
Friends, Dear countrymen, this festival is a season of festivals and our country is in a way a country of festivals.
Perhaps it would have been a day in which no festival has been written in the name of it.
Now we all have celebrated Christmas and have to come a new year.
The coming New Year brings a lot of happiness, happiness and prosperity to you all.
Let us all move forward with new zeal, new zeal, new zeal and new resolve.
The month of January is the time of sunrise and the Makar Sankranti is celebrated in this month.
If Lohari is enjoyed in Punjab and north India, then UP-Bihar is waiting for Khichdi and Til Sankranti.
Say Sankranta in Rajasthan, Magh-Bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all these festivals are special in themselves and they have their own importance.
Every festival is celebrated from 13th to 17th January.
The name of all these festivals is different, but its original element is the same - connectivity with nature and agriculture.
My best wishes to every countrymen on these festivals.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much.
Now I will talk again in 2018.
Thank you.
It was such a conversation that interacts with a lot of things, younger brothers and sisters.
Listen, how Lata Didi is eager to all the things related to the country in this phase of AYUSHAN. And the satisfaction of life is also in the progress of India, changing India and touching new heights.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam.
I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
Lata Didi: Pranam.
Modi ji: I did the phone because this time on your birthday...
When will you go and rotate the layer
Modi ji: I will return late on 28th night and on 27th morning and then you must have been born.
Lata ji: There are many people in the age but it is a big thing to get the blessings of those who are bigger than their work.
Modi ji: Didi, you are very old in age and are also very big in work and those who have achieved this achievement have been achieved by means and penance.
I think that my parents have the blessings and the blessings of the audience.
I'm nothing.
Modi ji: Yes, this is your commemoration, it is a big education for all of our new generations.
It is a great inspiration for us that even after clearing all these things in your life, your parents have always given priority to the culture and humility.
Lataji: G.
Modi ji: And I am happy that when you say pride that your mother was a Gujarati.
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you, G. Modi ji gave me something to Gujarati.
I know that the picture of India is changing due to your arrival and I am very happy with it.
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I see, I know how busy you are and how much work you have.
What do you think
When you went and visited your mother's feet, I also sent someone to him and blessed him.
Yeah.
Modi ji: My father was very happy, because of your love.
Modi ji: But the time was so busy that I could not come.
Modi ji: but I'll come very soon.
It will be my luck.
Modiji: Pranam Didi.
Lotaji: A lot of salute.
Modi ji: Pranam ji.
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, the atmosphere of festivals will once again be filled with new zeal, new energy, new zeal and new resolve.
Festivals are fond.
Festivals across the country will be fond of the coming weeks.
The house will be filled with happiness.
Perhaps this saying is not just a word, it is an inspiration for all of us, an order, a philosophy.
If sweets get spoiled in some households then in some households children are sweet for sweets.
This is the darkness at the bottom of Diu.
The real joy of these festivals is when this darkness is destroyed, this darkness is less and bright.
We share happiness, where there is a lack of happiness and it also becomes our nature.
Think of sweets, clothing, gifts, where delivery is done in our houses.
At least, the things that we don't take in any work in our households should be divided into others.
Start-ups of the young friends of many NGs in many cities work like this.
They gather clothes, sweets, fodders from the houses of the people and find the needy and reach the needy.
Can this time, with full awareness and determination in this season of festivals, make darkness at the bottom of Diu
Your face will glimpse your happiness on the festivals and smiths on the faces of many poor families.
Your diplomacy will become more illuminated and your diplomacy will grow more.
My dear brothers and sisters, Lakshmiji comes home as a good fortune and prosperity in Deepawali.
Laxmi ji is welcomed in a traditional way.
Can we keep the honour of daughters in our society, villages, cities this time
Can you hold public programmes
There will be many such daughters among us who would have been renouncing the name of the family, the society and the country with their hard work and perseverance.
Can we do this programme of honor of this Laxmi of India on this Diwali
There will be many daughters and many sisters around us who would have been doing extraordinary work.
If a poor child is engaged in spreading awareness about sanitation and health then a doctor would have been serving the society as an engineer.
Being a lawyer, it would have been trying to bring justice to anyone.
Our society should identify, respect and take pride in such girls.
Their honour programmes will be held across the country.
The promotion of Laxmi of India means paving the way for the prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had earlier said that one of the major benefits of Mann Ki Baat is that I get the opportunity to interact directly with many unknown people.
I am from Roeing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my examination resulted, some people asked me that he read the exam warriors book
I didn't read this book.
But after coming back, I read this book and read it two-three times.
My experience was very good about this.
I felt that if I had read this book before examination, I would have got a lot of benefit.
My little student friend, first thank you for writing this letter.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors 2-3 times.
You have said that if I can take time for a new turn, I will definitely try to write something for parents and teachers.
I urge all the students of the country, the teachers and the parents to express your experience about the aspects related to the stress-free examination.
So I'll wait for you to think.
I once again express my gratitude to our younger friend of Arunachal, student Alina Tayang.
My dear countrymen, you are also aware of the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through news papers, through TV.
But you know that I am also a common man like you.
I am a common citizen and that is why the impact of things that affects in a normal life is also on my mind because I have also come from amongst you.
Just a short while ago, he had come to the finals from Rafael Nadal, the winner of the Grand Slam and the Tennis stories.
The audience also welcomed their speeches.
Even after losing difficult challenges, he praised his talented dragon and gave a living proof of sports.
However, on the other hand, the winner Nadal also praised Daniel's game.
The humility and humility of those who lost in the same match were both worth seeing.
If you have not heard the statement of Daniel Medvedev, I will tell you all, especially the youth to see this video.
The idea of our ancestors is really commendable.
We say there in the scriptures: i.e., when a person consists of abilities and humility together, then who cannot win his heart
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the heart of people from all over the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to do now, I am doing directly for you.
The debate will continue, the parties will continue, but if some things are stopped before increasing, then it will benefit a lot.
It is very difficult to stop the things that increase very much and spread very much.
But if we are aware of it in the beginning then a lot can be saved.
My heart says that with this spirit, today, especially the young friends should do some things.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit its addiction.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes, blood pressure increases to people who consume tobacco.
That's what everyone says.
The intoxication of tobacco is due to nickotin present in it .
In adolescence its consumption also affects the development of the brain.
But today I want to talk to you about a new subject.
You must be aware that e-cigarettes have been banned in India recently.
E-cigarettes are a kind of electronic device different from normal cigarettes.
In the e-cigarette, there is a kind of chemical smoke by warming of nicotine liquid substances through which nicotine is consumed.
We understand the danger of ordinary cigarettes very well, but a misconception about e-cigarette has been created.
There has been such a corruption that there is no danger from e-cigarette.
Like the rest of the cigarettes, aromatic chemicals were obtained to not spread the smell.
We have seen around that even if there is a father-in-law smoker in the house, they stop smoking the rest of the household.
They are trying that no member of the family does not smoke, do not smoke.
They know that smoking and tobacco causes heavy damage to the body.
The Pinaras also know and the watchers also know.
But e-cigarettes are very different.
There is no such awareness among the people about e-cigarettes.
They are also completely unaware of the dangers and sometimes e-cigarettes enter the house in Kutuhal and sometimes I am showing magic and even children are showing each other.
See, I take out smoke from my mouth. See, without fire, without burning smoke, see, I take out smoke.
Once the adolescents and youngsters of the house get stuck in their clutches then they gradually become victims of this drug addiction.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are found in e-cigarettes, which have a bad effect on health.
You know that whenever someone smokes around us, we know about it.
Even if there is a cigarette packet in its smell, it is known from the smell.
In such a situation, many adolescents and youngsters are seen walking in their hands, in their offices, in their offices, sometimes with great pride in the form of a fashion statement.
The younger generation is the future of the country.
The e-cigarette has been banned so that this new method of intoxication does not ruin our young country.
Do not make the dreams of every family so that the lives of the children are not ruined.
This disease does not accumulate the originals of the society.
I urge you to quit tobacco addiction and do not have any neglect in respect of e-cigarettes.
Let us all together build a healthy India.
They have to be saved from all this for Fit India.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of privilege for all of us that India has been the birthplace and land of such extraordinary people who have dedicated their entire life for the good of not only for themselves but for others.
This is our mother-in-law, this is our country's multilateral dwelling.
Several human races emerge from this earth.
India has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people in the year.
And these are those people who have dedicated themselves not for themselves but for others.
One such great gathering is being honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pop Franceis will declar Marium Threasia on October 13.
The work done by Sister Marium Thresis for the good of humanity in his short life of 50 years is an example for the entire world.
The work done by Sister Thressia was fulfilled with dedication and determination.
Those who are still moving forward their lifestyle and missions.
Once again I pay tribute to Sister Maryam Thressia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, not only India but today it is a matter of pride for the entire world that today when we are celebrating Gandhi 150, 130 crore Indians have resolved to free from single use plastic.
Today, the eyes of all the countries are focused on India by looking at the way India has led the entire world towards environmental protection.
I am confident that all of you will become a part of the campaign to get rid of single usage plastic on 2nd October.
At the same time, people are contributing to this campaign as their own.
But a young man of our country has launched a very unique campaign.
When I looked at his work, I tried to know about this new experiment by talking to him on the phone.
These things can be done to others of the country.
Shriman Riputaman Belavi ji is making a good effort.
When I heard the plogging word for the first time, it was also new for me.
Perhaps those words have been used in some quantities abroad.
But in India, Riputman Belviji has made it very popular.
Friends, This time the Ministry of Sports is going to organise the Fit India Plogging Run on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu.
We have heard how this programme should be done and what happens in the programme with the experience of Riputman ji.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take a step in this direction, then in order to get rid of single usage plastic, our India will move ahead with 130 crore steps.
Once again, thanks to Riputman ji.
We want to move forward to transform our lives into the interest of the country.
There is a desire to remind one thing soon.
However, in the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely make it detailed but today I am telling you just before that so that you can get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember that on October 31, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is.
We have to run for the unity of the country on that day in the number of children, elderly, all the schools, colleges and thousands of villages of India.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 you will go to 15 places of India.
Make a program of staying at least 15 places and even if it can be made one night, two nights.
You see Hindustan, understand, experience.
We have so many varieties, and when the days of holidays come in this festival of Diwali, people definitely go and therefore I will again urge you to visit any 15 such places in India.
And how much is this improvement, where am I to you
You must be happy that today our number is 34 and our number was 65th five years ago, so in a way we have made a big jump.
If we make more efforts then we will make our place in the world's leading places in tourism till 5 years of independence.
Yes, it is also necessary that in the days of Diwali, there is no harm to any person due to fire or fire.
You must keep any precautions for this.
It should also be happy, joy, zeal, zeal and our festivals also bring the aroma of collectivity and also bring the message of collectivity.
Community life gives a new strength and the festival is a place for the means of new capabilities.
Let us celebrate festivals along with new dreams and new resolves with fervor and enthusiasm.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat November 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to interact with the child friends of Karnataka.
The victory of the Times Group, Karnataka newspaper, called upon the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
And then some of them were published by him.
I read those letters, I felt very good.
These small children are also familiar with the problems of the country and the ongoing discussions in the country.
On many subjects, these children have written that Kirti Hegde of North Kannada has described the Digital India and Smart City Scheme and suggested that we need to change our education system, he added that nowadays children do not like to study in classrooms.
And if we advise children about nature then it may be possible for us to move forward in protecting the environment.
Rida Nadafa has written from Lakshmeshwar that he is a soldier's daughter.
And he said that due to being away from school, I cannot spend time with my friends, he has suggested that there should be a school nearby.
It was a good experience for me too.
My dear countrymen, today is 26th November.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
The Constituent Assembly accepted the Constitution of India on this day in 1944.
The Constitution of India is the spirit of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember those members of the Constitution Assembly.
He worked for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
And whenever they read the discussion, we are proud that what is the idea of dedicated life to the nation.
Can you imagine how hard they would have done to build the Constitution of our country with diversity
Have you visited understanding and misery and that too at a time when the country was getting free from the tricks of slaves.
Keeping this Constitution in mind, it is our duty to create a New India keeping in mind the ideas of those great men.
Our Constitution is very wide.
Perhaps there is no such area of life, there is no such subject of nature that he has not touched.
Equality and sensitivity towards everyone is the identity of our Constitution.
It protects the basic rights of every citizen, the poor or the Dalit, the backward or the deprived, the tribal, the women.
And protects their interests.
Our duty is to follow the Constitution.
Be it citizens or administrators move forward in line with the spirit of Constitution.
Several committees were constituted on important issues in this Constituent Assembly.
It was one of the most important committees and Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of this Committee.
He was playing a very important role.
Today, there is an unprecedented impression of Babasaheb Ambedkars efficient leadership in building the Constitution of India which we feel proud.
He ensured that every section of the society is benefitted.
On the 6th December, on his Mahaparinirvana Day, we salute him by remembering him like Kayam.
The contribution of Babasaheb to make the country prosperous and powerful is unforgettable.
On the fifteenth December, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is on the holy occasion.
Sardar Patel, a iron man from the farmer's son, had done an extraordinary work to build the country on a table.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constitutional Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Consultative Committee for basic rights, minorities and tribals.
26-11 is our Constitution Day, but on 26-11, the terrorists attacked Mumbai and how can the country forget it
This country can never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism today looks at every part of the world and in a way has become a terrible form of every day-to-day event.
We have been tolerating terrorism for the last 40 years in India.
There were many people in the world who were not ready to take it seriously, but today whenever terrorism is putting their own bars, every government of the world is looking at terrorism as a big challenge.
Terrorism has challenged the humanity of the world.
Terrorism has challenged humanism.
He is going to destroy human powers.
And that is why not only India but also all the humanitarian forces of the world have been together to defeat terrorism.
Lord Buddha, Bhagwan Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi are the souls of the earth who have given the message of unhappiness and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism make negative efforts to weaken our social tensions and distinguish them.
And that is why it is the need of this time to be more aware of humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, on December 4, all of us will celebrate Navy Day-Navy Day.
The Indian Navy protects and protects our shores.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You will all know that our civilization is part of the rivers.
Whether it is Sindhu, Ganga, Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and seas are important for both economic and strategic purposes.
This is our entrance for the whole world.
This country, our land has been immensely connected with the oceans.
And whenever we look towards history, eight hundred-nine hundred years ago, Chaulnavi-Chaulnaukadal was considered one of the most powerful naval forces during Chaulvansh.
In the expansion of the Chaul Empire, it was a great part of his Navy in making it an economic power of that time.
Chaul Navi's Jhumbesh, Search Travels are still found in the Sangam literature.
Very few people would have known that women were allowed on long-term warships in most of the naval forces in the world.
But in Chaulnaukadal and that too, eight hundred or nine hundred years ago, women had played a very big role and even women were involved in the fighting.
The Chaul rulers had a rich knowledge of building ships and building ships.
If we talk about the Navy then who can forget the strength of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Navy.
The seashore of Konkan, where the rivers are very important, used to come inside the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Swarnadurg etc. were either on the banks of the sea or were surrounded by sea.
The Maratha Navy was responsible for the protection of these forts.
Maratha was a combination of large ships and small boats in the Navy.
Their naval personnel were very efficient to attack and avoid any enemy.
And whenever we talk about the Maratha Navy, how can it be possible to remember Kanoji Angre
He brought the Maratha Navy to a new height and established a threshold of Maratha Navy personnel at many places.
After independence, our Indian Navy also showed its culmination at different times.
Be it the freedom struggle of Goa or the Indo-Pakistan war of 11.
In May-June this year, when there was a severe flood crisis in Sri Lanka, the three ships of our Navy immediately reached there and helped its government and its people.
In the month of September last year in Bangladesh, our Navy's ship INS clock also provided humanitarian assistance to Rohingya.
In the month of June, whenever the government of Papua-Nugini sent messages to us, our Navy helped save the fishermen of their fishing boats.
Our Navy's ship reached INS Trikand to quit a trading ship from Chanchia on the 21st day of the Western Area.
Our Navy has always been proud to provide health services to the Fiji Islands, to provide immediate relief, to provide humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring country.
We are always proud and respected by the Indians, our defence forces, be it the ground, be it the Navy or the Air Force, salute the courage, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
Therefore, the people of the country can live the life of happiness and well-being so that they can go to their own country.
Every year we celebrate the 7th December as the Armed Forces Flag.
It is that day to express pride and respect for the Armed Forces of this country.
I am glad that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to run the campaign from 1st to 7th December to make people aware about the Armed Forces by reaching the citizens of the country.
Put all the small flags on the chest throughout the week.
A movement of respect for the army started in the country.
On this occasion, we can also distribute the flag of the Armed Forces.
The experiences of the Armed Forces who are associated with their familiarity in their surroundings can be posted with video and photographs armedforcesflagday.
In schools, colleges, Laxkar jawans, they can get information about the Armed Forces.
Our new generation can be a good opportunity to understand about the armed forces.
This festival also provides an opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all our Armed Forces.
This fund is spent on the rehabilitation of the families of the soldiers martyred in the war, for the welfare of the injured soldiers by the Army Welfare Board.
Let us do something on this occasion so that the morale of our Armed Forces increases.
We also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, on 5th December is World Soil Day.
I also want to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters.
There is an important part of the earth - soil.
Whatever we eat is connected to this soil.
In a way the whole grain is connected to the soil.
It feels scared to think about whether there was no land or if there were no leaves then how could human life be possible
This is the reason why the organisms could have been worrisome in our culture and we have been aware of the importance of our land since ancient times.
In our culture, on the one hand, it is a comfortable endeavour for the fields, for the soil, for the devotion and respect of the people. On the other hand, the scientific methods that keep nutrition of this land are part of our life.
It has been important in the lives of the farmers of the country, in which the devotion to their land and the conservation of land is being done in a scientific manner.
I had heard about the farmers of Tohu village of Bhoranj Taluka in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The farmers of the country used to use half chemical fertilizers, fertilizers and due to this, their soil health has worsened.
The yield was decreasing and consequently income was also decreasing as well as land productivity was decreasing.
Some farmers of the village understood the seriousness of this situation and then they tested their land from time to time, as they were asked to use fertilizers, fertilizers, micro-nutritional substances and live fertilizers.
You will also be shocked to hear the results, what was the result of the guidance that the farmers received by the land health and the guidance they received
The production of wheat during the Rabi 2016-17 increased by three to four times.
Our farmers across the country have made more than 10 crore soil health cards so that they can understand their land better and also harvest it.
We worship Mother Earth but how much harm the health of Mother Earth by chemical fertilizers like urea
With every kind of scientific experiment, it has been proved that giving more urea to the mother of the earth causes serious damage.
It is the demand of today's time to make this mother-in-law aware again.
Our farmers, our sons of the earth, can we imagine that the urea they use today will half of it when 5 years of independence takes place in 2022
How changes start in the lives of the farmers
We all have started feeling the global warming and climate change.
There was a time when the cold started before Diwali.
Today, December 12 is burstling and the cold is increasing slowly.
But as the cold starts, we all feel that it does not seem good to get out of the holidays.
But in such a season, the people who are constantly awakening can bring a beautiful result and that example is inspiring for all of us.
This little child Tushar has worked inspiring to spread the message of cleanliness.
He shows that there is no age of cleanliness or there is no border.
Whether it is a small child or adult, a woman or a man, cleanliness is essential for all.
And for cleanliness, there is also a need to combine everybody.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have a pledge.
At the moment, we get to learn something.
Today they are doing well in every field.
Whether it is a field of sports, a competition or a social initiative, our Divyangjan is not behind anybody.
You must be remembered that our Divyang sportspersons had won four medals by performing a beautiful performance in Rio Olympics and also made champions in Blind T T T T T Twenty Cricket World Cup.
Several competitions are held across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Paraswimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in it and introduced their skills.
He also won the Gold Medal in the 0th National Para Swimming Competition.
He was selected by the Sports Authority of India for the 20-20 Paralmipics competition.
He is one of the 32 Para-Tarnaviros who will be trained at Central for Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I salute Brother Jigar Thakkar and wish him my best wishes.
Today, special attention is being given to the availability and opportunity for Divyangjans.
It is our endeavour to empower every person of the country.
Building an inclusive society, enriching the society with the spirit of equality and mom and proceeding together.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen and I hope that this festival of Eid inspires all of us to increase peace and harmony in society.
Forget the grief, and do not forget the happiness.
I think we should propagate this thing.
We are trying to recall the compassionate events of the last year in the medium of spreading.
Can you contribute to this
Can we share five positive experiences of our life this year
Remember such inspirational occasions to others.
If we remember the good things then the feeling of improving will be awakened and mood will become.
Good things provide energy to improve.
And I will try to reach out to the countrymen in the next Mann Ki Baat to your details on Positive India Heshtag Positive India.
My dear countrymen, I will come here again for the next Mann Ki Baat in the coming month.
There will be a lot of opportunity to talk.
2nd October, 2019 on All India Radio
The Mahaparva Chhath, celebrated after six days of Diwali, is one of the most regulated festivals in our country.
The traditional regulations are followed in every matter from food habits to vasabhusha.
The unique festival of Chhath Puja is fully connected with nature and the worship of nature.
The sun and water are at the centre of the worship of the Mahaparva Chhath, and the utensils made of bamboo and soil are integral items related to its worship method.
The message of sunrise and sunrise rising in this great festival of faith is full of unparalleled culture.
The significance of cleanliness in our lives is also present in this festival.
Before sixth, the entire house is cleaned, along with rivers, ponds, ponds and ponds, the puja place i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is also a festival of environmental protection, disease redressal and discipline.
Normally, people understand the feelings of taking something, but in Chhath Puja, there has been a special tradition of eating Prasad after the morning half of the morning.
Behind this tradition of asking for prasad, it has also been reflected that ego is destroyed.
It is very natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat continues to be praised and deliberate.
But whenever I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, my belief becomes strong that Mann Ki Baat with the people of this country has been tied up with a hundred percent unbreakable relationship.
Take examples of khadi and handloom.
On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I have always been practicing for handlooms, for Khadi and what is the result of this
You might have also been happy to hear that such a huge sale of Khadi and handloom on a single store.
The sale of Khadi Gift Cooperation during Diwali has increased by about 680.
The total sale of fertilizer and handicraft items has seen an increase of about 70 this year over the last year.
It shows that today the youth, the elderly, the women of every adult like khadi and handloom.
I can imagine how much benefit would have been given to many vulnerable families, poor families and families working on handlooms.
In the lives of the poorest of the poor Khadi, handloom is emerging as a powerful tool to make them empowered by bringing changes in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is playing a very big role in the village community.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about the experience of my Diwali with the security forces and he also wants to know how our security forces are considered bankrupt.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwade has also written on the Narendra Modi App, why can there be arrangements for delivering sweets to the security forces
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that the sweetness of our house should reach the country.
You must have celebrated Diwali with a lot of joy.
I had a special experience for Diwali this time too.
Once again, I was fortunate to celebrate Diwali with our armed security forces at the border.
This time, it was unforgettable for me to celebrate Diwali with the security forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
For the struggle, dedication and sacrifice of our security forces to protect the country by facing the difficult and tortured situations on the border, I respect every soldier of our security forces from every countrymen.
Whenever we get the opportunity, whenever we get the opportunity, we should know the experience of our soldiers, we should listen to their pride.
Many of us do not know that our security forces are playing an important role in establishing peace not only on our border but on the world.
Being a UN peacekeeper, he is renamed the name of Hindustan in the world.
In the past, on 24th October, UN Day was celebrated worldwide.
Everyone remembers the UN's efforts to establish peace in the world and its positive role.
And we consider Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, the whole world is our family.
And due to this belief, India has been actively participating in UNs various important initiatives since its inception.
You will be aware that the proposal for the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begins with words WETHE PEOPLE.
India has always stressed on women equality and the UNDECLARATION of HUMAN RIGHTS is a living standard.
All humans are free and equal, which was replaced by the efforts of India's representative Hansa Maheta and later accepted, All Human Bengs are burn free and equal.
However, it seems to be a very small change but a healthy idea is seen in it.
There will be many of your mothers who have been getting this information for the first time.
More than 18 thousand Indian security forces have provided their services in the UN PEACEKEEPING Operations.
Currently, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN PEACEEPING INITIATIVES and are the third largest in the world.
By August, 2019, Indian soldiers have provided their services in about 50 OperatIONS from the 1st PEACEKEEPING OperatIONS worldwide.
OPERATIONS runs in many countries across the world in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kongo, Cyprus, Liberia, Labenon, Sudan and other parts of the world.
More than 20 thousand patients have been treated and saved innumerable people in the Indian Army Hospital in Kongo and South Sudan.
Indias security forces have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts by making people friendly operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peacefulness.
Very few people might know that India was the first country to send the Female Police Unit to the United Nations Peace Abhiyan in Liberia.
And look, this step of India has become an inspiration for the nations across the world.
And then all the countries started sending their own women policy units.
You will be proud to hear that Indias role is not only limited to the Peacekeeping Operators, but India also works to train the Peacekeepers of about 85 countries.
With this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have conveyed a message of peace and harmony worldwide.
Peacekeeping operations are not easy.
Our security forces have to work in remote areas.
We have to live in different people.
Different situations and different cultures have to be familiar with.
They have to drive themselves in accordance with the local needs and environments there.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, a brave man who was honored with the Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Prem Chand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeeper who made a special identity in Cyprus.
He was made a Force Commander for Operating in Namibia in the age of 18th and provided his services to ensure the independence of the country.
General Themaya, who has also been the Chief of the Indian Army, led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and laid down his universal reception for peaceful works.
India has always been a message of peace, unity and harmony in the world as a peace ambassador.
We believe that everybody lives with peace, harmony and moves towards building a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our land has been decorated with such great people who have served humanity with selflessness.
Sister's statement, which we call Bhagi's statement, was also one of those extraordinary people.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of his statement.
And the essay means that it is completely dedicated.
Later, he showed himself in accordance with his name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Statement.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his happiness and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister's statement was sorry about the atrocities in the British rule.
The British not only made our country a slave, but they also tried to make us a psychological slave.
This work was continuously going on by showing our culture down and creating a brutal feeling among us.
Bhagini Vivekita ji reaffirmed the pride of Indian culture.
He worked to unite the people by awakening the national consciousness.
He went to different countries of the world and raised voices against the evils of eternal religion and philosophy.
The renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati is famous for his revolutionary poem Pudumai Penna, New Women and Women Empowerment.
It is said that his inspiration was the statement of Bhagi.
Bhagini Vivekita ji also supported the great scientist Jagdishchandra Basu.
He helped in publishing and propagating Basu's research through his articles and conferences.
India has a special beauty that spirituality and science are supplementary to each other in our culture.
Bhagini's statement and scientific Jagdishchandra Basu is a strong example of this.
Hundreds of people were killed in the 1980s in Kolkata.
Bhagini's statement started the work of cleaning the roads without worrying about his health.
He was a woman who could live a comfortable life but was dedicated to the service of the poor.
Inspired by his sacrifice, people joined him in service work.
He taught the people the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
And it is written on his commemoration - Here Reposess Sister Navedita, whoever goves all to India is resting here, who dedicated his universal India.
He was undoubtedly doing this.
Today, for this great personality, there can be no other right tribute to him that every Indian should try to walk on the path of service by taking inspiration from his life.
First of all, on the birth anniversary of our first elder Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru Ji, my best wishes to all the children on Child Day.
Children are the most important diamonds of building a New India.
Your concern is true that earlier the diseases that had come in old age, the last phase of life has started to be seen in the children.
Today it is surprising when we hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
Such diseases in the youth were fortunately happening.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorder.
One of the main reasons for this kind of disease in youth is elimination of physical activities in our lifestyle and change in our food habits.
The society and the family need to pay attention to this thing.
When they think about it, you will see that there is no need to specify anything.
It is just necessary that the smaller things should be done properly and regularly to change their habits and make them a habit.
I would like the family members to try to adopt the habit of going to the open fields.
If possible, the elders of our family should also go to the open with these children.
Instead of coming up in the lift, make the children a habit of rotating the stairs.
After dinner the entire family walks a little while keeping the children together .
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga, especially our young friends, will be helpful in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and protecting them from lifestyle disorder.
Yoga of 30 minutes before going to school, see how much benefit is there.
You can do the same at home and the specialty of yoga is that - it is easy, easy, accessible and I am saying that any person of the age can do it easily.
Several studies and researches are taking place to know how effective Yoga is in controlling diabetes.
It is also being studied in AIIMS and the results that have come up so far are very incentives.
Ayurveda and Yoga should not only be the medium of treatment and treatment, let us make it a part of our life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, good news has come in the field of sports.
Our sportspersons have named our country in different sports.
In Hockey, India has won Asia Cup Hockey by playing a glorious game.
Our sportspersons performed excellently and with this, India became Asia Cup Champion after ten years.
Earlier, India had become Asia Cup Champions in 2003 and 2003.
My best wishes to the entire team and the helpful staff on behalf of me, to the countrymen.
After Hockey, good news has also come to India in Badminton.
The Bedmint Star Kidambi Srikanth has won the Denmark Open by excellent exhibition and has made a feeling of pride in every Indian.
This is his third super series premier title after the Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
I congratulate our young friends for their achievements and for enhancing the pride of India.
Friends, FIFA Under-1 World Cup was organised this month.
The teams from all over the world came to India and all showcased their income on the football field.
I also got the opportunity to go to a match.
The sportspersons and audience had a lot of enthusiasm.
Such a big occasion of the World Cup, the whole world is watching you...
Such a big match... I was shocked to see the energy, enthusiasm of all the young sportspersons.
The World Cup was successfully organised and all teams performed their best.
Though India could not win Kittab, Indias young sportspersons won the hearts of all.
The entire world, including India, recognized this festival of sports and this entire competition was interesting and entertaining for football lovers.
The future of football is very bright.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, I feel that if I think of justifying the feelings of those people who write me about Swachh Bharat, then I will have to make a programme of Mann Ki Baat everyday and I will have to dedicate to Mann Ki Baat on the subject of cleanliness.
If a mistake sends a portal of efforts, then there is a case of collective efforts of the youth.
Somewhere there is talk of cleanliness and innovation or there is a report of changes made by the people of an officer.
In the past, I have received a very detailed report, in which there is a thing about the transformation of Chandrapur fort in Maharashtra.
At the same time, the entire team of NGs named Ecological Protective Organisation was campaigning for cleanliness of Chandrapur Fort.
He has sent me the news of the fort before cleanliness and after cleanliness.
I was shocked to see the photographs and whenever I see these photographs, you may have sometimes disappointed by seeing the dirt around them, sometimes they feel that how the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled then I will tell them that you can see the youth of the Ecological Protection Organization, their sweat, their commitment in a living manner.
Your disappointment will be turned into confidence as soon as you see it.
This devotional effort of cleanliness is a unique example of beauty, collectivity and sustainability.
Fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of our fellow countrymen to keep historical heritage safe and clean.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Ecological Protection Organization and the entire team and the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on the next 4th of November, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
He thought of the welfare of the entire humanity, and described all species as equal.
He stressed on women empowerment and women honour.
Guru Nanak Dev ji travelled 28 thousand kilometers on foot and gave a message of true humanity during his visit.
He interacted with the people, showed them the path of truth, sacrifice and devotion.
He gave a message of equality in the society and showed this message not only by talking, but by doing it with his work.
He runs anchor, which gave birth to service among the people.
The feeling of unity and equality among the people was awakened by sitting together.
Guru Nanak Devji gave three messages of meaningful life - name of God, work hard, work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Devji also created Gurbani to say his words.
In the next year, we are going to celebrate the 550th light year of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Come, let us try to move forward on the path of their message and education.
My dear countrymen, after two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Ji on 31st October.
We all know that he had laid the foundation stone of modern integral India.
Today we can learn a lot from the extraordinary journey of this great child of Mother India.
On October 31, Smt. Indira Gandhi also left the world.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was that he was not only a transformative idea but also a skilled in exploring the practical solution of the very complex problem to show it.
He had a favour in realizing the ideas.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took over the dryness of building India in one corner.
He ensured that millions of Indians are brought to the shadow of 'One Nation and One Constitution'.
Their decisiveness enabled them to cross all the obstacles.
He recalled where there was a need for humanity, where there was a need for sacrifice, he sacrificed.
He said that no difference between caste and creed can stop us, all of us are daughters and daughters of India, all of us should love our country and create our policy on mutual love and harmony.
This statement of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring and relevant to our vision of New India.
And this is the reason why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
His contribution to the nation as an integral nation is incomplete.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, on 31st October, the Run for Unity will be organised across the country, including children, youth, women, all age groups from across the country.
I urge you to participate in this festival of Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, with a new resolve, with a new determination, you will be associated again in your daily life.
My dear countrymen, bow down to you all.
The three years have been completed by Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani and today it is 36 Mo episodes.
And when I tell you what I say in Mann Ki Baat, people from every corner of the country reach me, perhaps I can tell you very little things but I get a lot of treasure.
Most of them are inspiring me.
Many of them are for improvement in the government.
Sometimes there are individual complaints and sometimes attention is attracted to the collective problem.
And I take half an hour in a month but people are talking about him on the thirty day Mann Ki Baat.
And as a result of this, it is easier to get the attention of the powers of sensitivity and distant society in the government.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
And perhaps in such a short span of time, I am very grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity to know the feelings of the common man of the country.
And I am confident that this idea will also be beneficial for Mann Ki Baat in the future, there will be a new consciousness and new energy.
Once I had told Mann Ki Baat that we should worry about eating and taking as much as we need, we should not ruin it.
But after that I saw that from every corner of the country so many social organisations and many youngsters have already been doing this work.
Many people who worked on how to use the food utilisation of the food utilisation that is left out of the plate have been reminded of me so that I was very satisfied and very happy.
And then I saw that many people came forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Once I saw the Selfie With Daughter of a Sarpanch of Haryana and I talked to everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
A big campaign has been launched not only in India but also in the entire world.
This is not just a matter of social media.
A new self-confidence in every girl has become an event of new pride.
Every parents felt that I too should take a self with my daughter.
Every girl started feeling that I have some magnificence, I have some importance.
In the past, I had a meeting with the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
Whenever I told the people who went to tour that wherever you go, I sent a picture on Incredible India.
Millions of images of every corner of India, in a way, the people working in the tourism sector have become very distinct.
I have experienced this thing in Mann Ki Baat that how big a movement starts with less than us.
Today it was heartened to say all these things because when I was thinking that three years have passed, many incidents of the last three years have come in my mind.
The country is constantly moving forward to go in the true direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the welfare of the others, for the betterment of the society and for the progress of the country, I have learned and learned from the countrymen in the campaign of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a huge capital for any country and is a very powerful force.
I heartily bow down to the countrymen.
Be it a sheet or a towel or a curtain in the house, the experience was that the attraction of Khadi in the younger generation has increased.
The sale of Khadi has increased and it has led to direct employment in the houses of the poor.
Since 2nd October, discount is given in Khadi and many are released.
Once again I would urge you to move forward and enhance the campaign of Khadi.
Let us work with the spirit of buying Khadi and bringing Diwali in the house of the poor.
The poor of our country will get a strength from this work and we should do it.
And due to the increase in interest in this Khadi, the people of Khadi in the field of Khadi have also increased the enthusiasm to think in a new way.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase productivity, how to bring solar-health
How to revive the old heritage that had been closed for 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years.
In Varanasi Sevapur, Uttar Pradesh, the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri was closed for 26 years but today it has become revived.
Several activities have been connected.
Many people have been created new employment opportunities.
Khadi and Village Industries in Pampore in Kashmir resumed its closed training center and Kashmir has a lot to provide it in this area.
Now due to the resumption of this training center, the new generation will be able to get a help in constructing modern patterns, in making new things and I am feeling very good that whenever they give gifts to big corporate houses in Diwali, they have now started giving food items.
People have also started giving food items as gifts to each other.
We all feel how things move forward with a simple spirit.
My dear countrymen, last month we all had made a pledge in Mann Ki Baat and we decided that 15 days of Gandhi-Jainty will celebrate Swachhta Festival across the country.
I will connect people with cleanliness.
Our Honble President ji started this work and the nation joined it.
Be it children, elderly, men or women, cities or villages, everybody has become a part of the Swachhta Abhiyan.
And when I say that how this Swachhta Abhiyan is moving forward towards a pledge, we are looking forward to our eyes.
Everybody acknowledges it, supports it, and contributes to someone to realize it.
This time, one thing is that we should clean up somewhere, the other is that we should not be aware of it, but if you want to make cleanliness a habit then a ideological movement is also important.
This time many competitions were held with Swachhata Hi Seva.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the essay of cleanliness.
Thousands of children made pictures.
As far as cleanliness comes, I never forget to be grateful to the people of the media.
We can see how much of our country's electronic media can serve the country's primary media in the Swachhata that service movement.
Just a few days ago, somebody paid my attention to the 18-year-old Bilal Dar of Srinagar.
And you will be happy to know that the Srinagar Municipal Corporation has made Bilal Dar his brand Ambassador for cleanliness and when it comes to Brand Ambassador then you will feel that it will be a synonym of artists, perhaps it will be a sports world.
Billal Dar has been in cleanliness since the age of 12-13 years for the last 5-6 years.
Be it plastic, polythene, used bottle or waste, it keeps cleaning.
They also earn some of them.
Because his father died due to cancer at a very young age but he also joined his life with cleanliness.
I also want to convey my best wishes to the Srinagar Municipal Corporation for this initiative towards cleanliness and for their imagination of Ambassador because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every citizen of India wants to go to Srinagar and there is such a big thing that it is a matter of great importance to sanitation.
And I am glad that they have not only made the bill a brand ambassador but the corporation has given the bill this time a car and has given the calculation and it also teaches people to clean up and inspires them to bring out the results.
Billal Dar is young but is a cause of inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
This month of October is a month to remember many great men for us.
These dignitaries gave us the direction for the 20th and 21st century, led us, guided us and suffered a lot for the country.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji is the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh on 11th October and is the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on 25th September.
Nanaji and Deendayal ji are also the year of this century.
And what was the central point of all these great men
One thing was common in his life and that was to live for the country, to do something for the country and to do something for the country and not only teachings but also through its conduct in his life.
Gandhiji, Jaiprakash ji, Deendayal ji are all such great men who were away from the shares of power but continued to live with the lives of the people and continued to do something or the other.
Nanaji Deshmukh had left the political life in the village. And today, when we are celebrating his centenary year, it is very natural to respect the work of his village.
When former President of India, Mr. Abdul Kalam ji was talking to the youth, Nanaji used to talk about the rural development of Deshmukh.
He himself went to the village to see this work of Nanaji.
Remembering all these great men is not a gift to them, we remember these great men so that we can get the path ahead and get the direction ahead.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely say about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, but on 31st October, the run for Unity One India Shreshtha Bharat programme is going to be held across the country.
In every city of the country, every city should have very large run-for-unity programmes and this season is also such that it is necessary to gain iron power like Sardar Saheb.
And Sardar Saheb had united the country.
We should also run for unity and move forward the mantra of unity.
We say very naturally - unity in diversity, Indias specialty.
We are proud of diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I will often tell my countrymen of India and especially to my younger generation that we are in an awareness situation.
Let us experience the diversity of India, touch them, experience their fragrance.
You see, these diversity of our country also works as a very big school for the development of your personality.
There is a vaccine, the days of Diwali, there is a habit of visiting somewhere in our country, people go as a traveller and it is very natural.
But sometimes it is a matter of concern that we do not see our country, we do not know the diversity of the country, they do not understand but they have started selecting the tour of foreign countries by coming under the influence of zeal.
You go anywhere in the world, I don't have any business but sometimes look at your home too.
The person of Northern India does not know what is in South India
The person of West India does not know what is in East India
Our country is full of so many diversity.
All these great men have made a broad visit to India.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to know and understand India.
He tried to live in India.
Can we try to learn and understand different states of our country, different communities, groups, their customs, their traditions, their dresses, their food habits and their beliefs as a student
The Value Adition in tourism will happen only when we are not only visiting but also try to commemorate them as a student.
I have my own experience that I would have got the opportunity to visit more than five hundred districts of India.
There will be more than four and a half districts where I would have got the opportunity to take care of the night and today when I am taking care of this responsibility in India, I feel the experience of this visit very much.
There is a lot of convenience in understanding things.
I also urge you to experience the immense power of our vast India by speaking the message of unity in diversity.
The dream of 'Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat' is included in it.
How many types of food habits are there.
Even if the entire life is eating a different food everyday, no food will be repeated.
This is the great power of our tourism.
Deliberate the diversity of the people of Kotikoti.
Your life will be prosperous by these experiences.
The expansion of your thinking will be huge.
And who can be a great teacher from experience
Normally the period from October to March is often of tourism.
People travel.
I am confident that if you go this time too then you will take this campaign forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share the details.
Definitely send your pictures on Incredible India.
If you want to meet not only the buildings but also the people there then also send photographs.
Write not only the natural beauty but also some of the people there.
Write the best essays of your journey.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can you give any information about that
If all the people of one state will say about this, then I will say in the government that it should be true and that the seven things that have come about every state should be prepared for the publicity literature.
That is, in a way, my aim is to encourage the tourist destinations with the inspirations of the people.
The Government of India will work on it.
Come on, join me.
You can also play an incentive role in enhancing the tourism of the country using the time from October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch me too.
My heart is motivated.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
And then I am also a man like you.
We have seen a unique example of women's strength and patriotism.
We can imagine that when the world has emerged in this young age then how will their mindset be
He worked hard and trained for 11 months and dedicated his life to fulfil his dream.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey's husband was working as a hero in the Dubey Army and he was martyred for the motherland.
His wife Nidhi also decided in mind and they also joined the army.
It is very natural for every countrymen to respect our maternal maternal power and our bravery.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to these two sisters.
He has created a new inspiration and a new consciousness for the Koti-Koti people of the country.
Many congratulations to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Diwali is also a big opportunity for the youth of our country.
We are hosting the World Cup of FIFA Under-17 there.
I am confident that footballs will be spread all around.
The juice of every generation will increase in football.
There should be no school, college field in India where our youngsters are not sportsy.
Let us also make sports a part of our life when the whole world is coming to play on the earth of India.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
There is an opportunity to worship Mother Durga .
The entire environment is filled with sacred aroma.
The atmosphere of spirituality, the atmosphere of festival, the atmosphere of devotion all around and this festival is considered to be the festival of the means of power.
It is known as Saradiya Navratri.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I extend my best wishes to the countrymen and pray to Maa Shakti that our country will achieve new heights to fulfill the hopes and aspirations of the common man of the country.
The country has the power to face every challenge.
When the country moves forward at a rapid pace and 75 years of Indias independence in 2022, the effort to fulfill the dreams of those people who are struggling for freedom will be made by making a five-year rod map to achieve this resolve.
My best wishes to all of you.
Festivals should also be celebrated and enthusiasm should also be increased.
Mann Ki August 2019
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On one hand, the country is drowned in festivals and on the other hand, when violence is known from any corner of India, it is natural to worry about the country.
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, which will give full strength to the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have accepted public life values, non-violence and equal respect.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: We have been listening to it in a small way.
I also told the Red Fort that violence will not be tolerated in the name of faith, whether it is communal belief, whether it is faith in political ideals, whether it is faith in the person, whether it is faith in that tradition.
There is every kind of arrangement for justice to every person in the Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us.
I would like to assure the people of the country, those who take the laws and those who are waiting for violence, whether it is a person or a group, this country will never bear it nor will any government bear it.
Everyone will have to bow down to the law, the law will determine the responsibilities and will be punished by the culprits.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living and dressing.
We see diversity in every behaviour of life.
Our festivals are also full of diversity and due to our thousands of years old cultural heritage, cultural traditions, social traditions, historical traditions, it might have been possible for a few days from 365 days that we are not associated with any festival there.
Now it would have been mentioned that every festival of ours is going on according to the time of nature.
There is a direct relationship with nature.
Our money festivals are directly connected to the farmers and are connected to the fishermen.
Today, I am talking about festivals, first of all, I want to call you all the microbes.
Yesterday the festival of Sanvatsari was celebrated in the Jain society.
In the Jain society, Parushan Parva is celebrated in the month of Bhadrava.
The last day of the festival is Sanvatsari.
This is really a wonderful tradition.
The festival of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
It is also called a forgiveness festival in a way and on this day it is a tradition of calling each other as Michchami Dukkadam.
Sengspeare has written the significance of forgiveness in his drama The Merchant of Venice that Mercy is two Blest, It Blessetth Hem That Gives and Hem That Takes, which is forgiving and whoever gets forgiveness, both get the blessings of God.
Bal Gangadhar Lokmanya Tilak had given birth to this tradition 125 years ago and before 125 years of independence, he became a symbol of the freedom movement.
And since independence, he became a symbol of social and social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasts for 10 days.
This great festival is said to be a symbol of unity, equity and audience.
Greetings and best wishes to every countrymen.
Now, the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
One of the colorful festivals of India is the main festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance.
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival gives messages of love and harmony in the society and creates new hope, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people.
And now our festivals are also becoming a reason for the attraction of tourism.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that as the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or the Durga Festival in Bengal has become the attraction of tourism in a way.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract the foreigners.
We should think of what we can do in this direction.
A few days later in the category of these festivals, the festival of Id-ul-Juha will also be celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to every countrymen.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and faith for us, but we also have to make festivals a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
Festivals and sanitation are associated with family life.
Festivals are fit for preparation, cleanliness.
It is not a new thing for us but it is also important to become a social habit.
Cleanliness should not only be in the houses but also in the entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country, in our country - cleanliness should be a unique part of those festivals.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of modernization are changing.
Recently, a new dimension, a new parameter, how modern you are, how modern you are, how much modern you are, how much model your thought processes are, it is also working to know and how aware you are about the environment.
If it is against it then it is considered bad today in the society.
And the result of this is that today I am seeing that even in Ganeshotsav, eco-friendly Ganesh had emerged as a big campaign.
If you are visiting Youtube then children are making Ganesh ji in every house and are making Ganesh ji by bringing the soil.
Various types of experiments are being done in every family.
In a way, such a comprehensive training of Environment Consciousness was seen in this Ganesha festival which was fortunately seen earlier.
Media House is also training and inspiring people for the statues of eco-friendly Ganesh in large numbers.
And as I said, our country is full of millions of bright minds.
And it seems very good when some new innovations are found.
Someone has said to me that there is a gentleman who himself is an engineer who has collected soil in a special way and combined it and provides training to the people to make Ganesh ji.
And if Ganesh is immersed in water then he keeps drinking water in a dollar so that he melts in water immediately.
Three years ago, when the Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will complete three years on 2nd October.
And its positive results are being seen.
Coverage of toilets has reached from 3 to 6.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free of defecation.
A few days ago, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but after the flood situation, when the water decreased, so much dirt spread everywhere.
At this time, the workers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned the flood affected 22 temples and 3 mosques.
All of them sweated.
The best example of unity for sanitation, the example of inspiration for everyone has been given by every worker of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind.
If it becomes our sustainable nature then where can our country reach
Let us find an opportunity wherever you get the opportunity.
But let us all join.
Work together on the day of the holiday or on Sunday.
Go to the population of Adosh-Padosh, go to the nearby village, but do it as a movement.
A section has been set up on the Inn where after construction of toilets, you can enter your name and the name of the family which has helped you.
My friends of social media can run a constructive drive and become an inspiration to respect the work done in the virtual world.
This campaign of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation from Swachh Sankalp to Clean Siddhi Competition is an essay competition for you, a competition for making short films, a competition of paintings is being organized.
You can write an essay in different languages and there is no limit of age, no age-limit.
You can make a short film, you can make your mobile.
You can make a 2-3-minute film that inspires cleanliness.
It can be in any language, it can also be silent.
The participants who will take part in this competition and the best of them will be given three on the District Level, three on the State Level.
So I invite everyone to join you in the form of this campaign of cleanliness.
Once again, I would like to say that this time, on 2nd October, celebrate Gandhi Jayanti as a Swachh 2nd October, and for this, from 15th September, bring the Swachhta Mantra to the household.
Take some steps for cleanliness.
Be participants in this effort by doing their own hard work.
You see how Gandhi Jayanti will shine on 2nd October.
You can imagine what kind of sacred joy will be inside us to pay homage to the revered Bapu when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October after this 15-day cleanliness drive.
My dear countrymen, today I specially want to accept the loans of all of you.
I want to express my heartfelt gratitude from the depths of my heart, that is, not that you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for such a long time but I want to express my gratitude that I want to accept loans because not Mann Ki Baat, lakhs of people from every corner of the country joins this programme.
The number of listeners is in crores but lakhs of people write me a letter, sometimes send me a message, sometimes a message comes on the phone, which is a huge treasure for me.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I look forward to your messages more than that you see yourself to listen to Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes some things become such a part of our habit that we don't think we misunderstood.
Prime Minister, I am speaking to Pune from Aparna.
I want to tell you about my accusations.
He is always trying to help the people but I am worried about a habit of this.
I once went to the mall to shop with him.
He spent Rs. 20000 for a sari and Rs. 450 for Pitza and the autorickshaws that were taken to the mall were supplied for a long time with the axis for five rupees.
While returning bought vegetables from the road and saved four-five rupees after repaying on every vegetable .
I felt very bad.
We pay big bills without asking them together and we fight for a few rupees with our labourer brothers and sisters.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell some goods around our house, some ferry persons come to the house, some small shopkeeper or vegetable seller or some auto rickshaw comprising oneself, whenever we come in contact with the people living with some hard work then we start feelings and feelings with it.
And whenever we go to eat in a big restaurant, we do not even see what has been written in the bill and we will soon get out of the money.
Not only this, we go to the shop room to buy saris, even then we do not have any feelings and feelings but we are not able to live with any poor person without emotion.
What would happen in the minds of the poor - we have ever thought of it
For this, the question is not of Rs. 2-5 and the heart is sorry that you are poor and therefore you have doubted the dignity of this thing.
Have you ever thought that there is no difference in your life for two-five rupees, but your small habit will have a deep injury to his mind
Madam, I am grateful to you and you have given me a message by calling a phone that touches your heart.
I am confident that even my countrymen will leave the habit of behaving with the poor.
My dear young friends, on August 2, the whole country celebrates as National Sports Day.
This day is the birth anniversary of great Hockey-Plair and Hockey wizard Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to Hockey is unique.
I am recalling this thing because I want to join the new generation and sports of our country.
Sports is a part of our life.
If we are counting among the young countries of the world then we should also be seen in this youth sports field.
Physical Fitness, Mental Allertness, Personality Enhancement, I understand what more than this
Sports is in a way a very large herb of heart merger.
The youth of our country move forward in sports and today in the computer era, I also want to warn that the flying field is more important than that of the platform.
Show the fifa sports on the computer but also in the field outside with football.
Crickets will be played on computers but the joy of playing crickets below the sky in the open field is something special.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out, then the mother used to ask all of them when would they come back
Today, the situation is such that while children come home, cartoon films are seen in one corner or get stuck on the mobile game and then the mother has to say that when will she go out
It was a time when the mother used to tell the child when she would come and today it is a situation that the mother has to say that she would go out when she would go out.
Young friends, Ministry of Sports has prepared a sports talent search portal for discovering and discovering sports talents, where there is a talent in any child who has achieved something in the field of sports, he can upload his biodeta or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to the selected sportspersons.
Let us welcome our young guests from all over the world, with this festival of sports and sports, make an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I would like to share with the countrymen who have touched my mind last week.
I got the opportunity to meet some younger daughters and some of them are born in the Himalayas.
The enthusiasm and courage of the six daughters of our country who have never had any connection with the sea is such that they inspire all of us.
These six girls will have to cross the sea by taking a small boat INS Tarini.
The name of this campaign has been given - Navika Sagar Parikrama and it will return to India after months after touring the entire world.
Sometimes it will spend 40-40 days in water simultaneously and sometimes 30-30 days in water.
This is going to be the first event in the world with courage among the waves of the sea.
Who is Hindustani who is not proud of our daughters.
I salute the enthusiasm of these girls and I have told them that they share their experiences with the whole country.
I will also make a different arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read everybody in such a way as this is a daring story, a self-reliant story and I will be happy to deliver the things of those daughters to you.
My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, we celebrate all Teachers Day.
Former President of our country, Dr.
Radhakrishnan ji's birthday.
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher for life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was dedicated to education.
Excellency Scientist Albert Institution has said that it is the superior heart of the teacher to take pleasure in creative expression and knowledge.
That is, it is the most important feature of a teacher to awaken the joy of creative feelings and knowledge in their students.
This time when we celebrate Teachers Day, can we all make a pledge together
And when we talk of change in our country, the way in which the mother reminds of the family, the teacher reminds of the society.
Teachers have a very important role in change.
Sometimes in the life of every teacher, such incidents have been made that their simple efforts must have been successful in bringing about changes in the life of someone.
If we make collective efforts then we will play a very important role in the transformation of the nation.
Come on, Teach to Transform move with this mantra.
My name is Dr.
Ananya Avasta.
I am a resident of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre in the Howard University.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana Financial Inclusion has been a subject of discussion not only in India but also in the world.
The campaign was launched by taking a dream in mind on 28th August, 2014.
Tomorrow, on 28th August, this campaign of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is going on for three years.
30 crore new families have been connected with it, bank accounts have been opened.
This statistic is even higher than the combination of many countries of the world.
Today, I am very satisfied that within three years my poor brothers sitting on the last corner of the society have become a part of the roots of the country's economy, their habits have changed, they have started covering the bank, they have started saving the money, they are feeling the security of the money.
In the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor in banks.
This is the savings of the poor in a way, it is their strength in the coming days.
And those who have opened accounts with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also benefited from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana - Rs.
In many families, because of the insurance of one rupee, when there was a crisis over the poor, the life of the family was over, in a few days he got Rs.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana - be it Dalits, be it tribals, be it women, be it youngsters, be it a young man with the intention of doing something on his own, crores of youngsters got money from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, banks without any guarantee and they themselves became self-reliant.
Not only this, everyone has also made a successful effort to provide employment to Ekad-Be.
A few days ago, the people of the bank had met me, because of Jan Dhan Yojana, because of insurance, because of Rupay card, how the common man has benefited from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and many inspiring cases have come up.
Today is not so much time but I will definitely tell the people of the bank that such cases are MyGov.
They can also inspire new generations by introducing such people.
The changing weather cycle and environmental changes have a very negative impact.
In the last few days, some parts of India, especially in Assam, Ishaan India, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have faced natural disasters due to the overwhelming past.
The flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Relief is being done at a comprehensive level.
My colleagues of the Cabinet are also reaching Ruburu.
The State Governments are also making a lot of efforts to help the victims of their homes.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and serving citizens are also making a lot of efforts to help the people in such a situation.
Be it Army personnel, Air Force, National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) or the Armed Forces (NDRF) are all connected to the people in the service of the affected persons.
Due to floods, life becomes very uncomfortable.
NDRF teams have been identified.
The Convention has been made disaster friends and these disaster friends have been trained for what to do and what to do during the disaster.
Self-servicemen have been prepared and a Lok Sabha has been taught to work in a distressed situation.
Gradually, let us also make such a nature that we combine our activities in accordance with climate specimens so that we can prevent harm.
Whenever I am preparing for Mann Ki Baat, I see that more citizens of the country are prepared than me.
This time all the letters related to GST have come and all the phone calls have come.
And yet, people are expressing happiness over GST and expressing the jealousy.
And I also tell you a phone call. Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I call Nitu Garg from Gurgaon.
I have heard the statement of your Chartered Accountants Day and I am very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched on the same date last month in our country.
Can you say that the results of the government have been expected after a month or not
I thank you all for your thoughts.
And when a poor person writes a letter to me and says that due to GST, the prices of things that have been required for the poor have come down, things have become cheaper then I am very satisfied and happy.
Now I was watching the impact of GST on the transport sector.
Now the income of the trucks has increased.
The time is decreasing in cutting off.
Highways have been free from traffic jams.
Earlier, due to different taxations, most of the resources of the transport and logistics sector used to be used to maintain the work and they had to make their innovative godowns in every state.
However, the GST which I call the Good and Simple Text.
It has actually affected our economy with a very positive impact and has affected in a short span of time.
The rapid change that has come, the speed that has been transformed into one another, the new records have created a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes economies experts, management experts, technologists, Indias experiment of GST as a model, will present it in front of the world.
It will become a case study for many universities in the world.
All decisions have been taken together by the States and the Centre.
And this is the result that every government has only one priority that due to GST, there is no burden on the plateau of the poor.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries, all the departments, Central and State Governments.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective power.
This is a historical achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but a new economy of honesty.
In a way, this is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again I salute crores of Indians for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
We have been listening to this thing since childhood. And this is the reason why the unbearable movement started on 1st August, 120.
August, 142, the uit India Movement was launched, which is known as the August Revolution.
And on 15th August, 14th, the country was free.
In a way, in the month of August, several incidents related to the date of independence have been specially linked.
This year we are going to celebrate the 5th anniversary of uit India Movement.
But very few people know that Dr. Yusuf Meher Ali had given the slogan of uit India.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 142.
The way the countrymen continued to fight and tolerate with you for freedom from 1985 to 1942, the background of history is our inspiration to build India.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for the freedom movement of India.
This movement was committed to the entire nation to liberate from the British Raj.
This was the time when the people of India had become a part of the uit India movement by combining the people of the country, be it the village, be it the city, be it the city, the educated, the poor, the Amir, the Harkoi community.
The Jan Akrosh was on its summit.
Millions of Indians on the hack of Mahatma Gandhi were shaking their lives with the mantra of death.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their education and liberated books.
The bugle of freedom was heard and came out.
My August Mahatma Gandhi called for the uit India Movement, but all the big leaders were imprisoned by the British Haqumat in jail.
And it was a time when great men like Dr. Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan had played a leading role in the country as leaders of the second generation.
In the non-cooperation movement and the uit India Movement, there are two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi in 120 and 142.
The form of non-cooperation movement was different and the situation of 42 was different, the rapidity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi had given the mantra of death.
This entire success was a peoples support and a peoples strength.
The entire country was fighting together, it was a peoples struggle.
Sometimes I think that if we see the leaves of history together then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1985.
The freedom struggle that started in 1985 was going on at some corner of the country till 1942.
This long time, in the hearts of the people of the country, the struggle for freedom was placed.
Everybody was committed to doing something.
The generations have changed, but there was no dearth in the resolve.
The country was making every effort to eradicate the British Sultanate.
This hard work from 1985 to 1942 created a situation in this movement that it reached the peak in 1942 and such a jungle of leaving India burst that in five years the British had to go to 14.
The five years of 1942 to 144 came to the masses of this struggle of freedom from 185 to 142 and became such a folk companion, with the success of the five decisive years of achieving a pledge, became the reason for freedom of the country.
This was five years of decisive years.
Now I want to connect you with this count.
We were free in 1947, today is 2019.
It has been about 70 years since the governments have come, the systems have been made, the systems have been changed, the development has increased, everybody has made efforts to free the country from the problems.
Likewise, there was a decisive five years of achievement from 142 to 14 resolutions.
I am seeing that from 2019 to 2022, a five-year period of pledge to achieve has come to us.
We must celebrate this 15th of August, 2019 as a resolution festival and when we are 5 years of independence in 2022, we will be able to transform this resolve into achieving it.
Efforts are made to fulfil millions of resolves.
Likewise, the five years of 142 to 14 have become decisive for the freedom of the country, it can become decisive for the future of India from 2019 to 2022.
Five years later, we will celebrate 5 years of our independence.
Come on, in the month of August, let us run a great campaign for achieving Sankalp from August.
Every Indian, social institutions, local units, schools, colleges, different organisations - take some pledge for every New India.
A resolution that we will be able to achieve in the next five years.
Today, I am particularly online world, because we are not there anywhere, but online is definitely there.
I invite my young friends, especially my young friends, who are an online world, to come forward for innovative contribution in building a New India.
Use of technologies, posts, blogs, articles, new ideas.
Make this zeal transformed into a mass movement.
The Prime Minister will also launch the quiz for young friends on the Narendra Modi App.
This quiz is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must make a comprehensive publicity, spread it.
There is no person speaking, the sound of hundreds of crores of people from the Red Fort is lost.
This time also I invite you to send me your thoughts on the MYGOV or on the Narendra Modi App.
I myself read it and I will try to express the time I have on 15th August.
In the last three years, I have heard a complaint in my 15th August speech that my speech becomes slightly long.
We see whether success is achieved or not.
Friends, I want to say this thing as well.
There is a socio-economic in Indias economy.
And we should never make it less.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just an occasion of joy and joy.
Our festivals and festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
But with this, our festivals have a direct relationship in the economic life of the poor to the poor.
Just a few days later, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, then the Ganesh Festival, then the fourth moon, then Anant Chaudash, Durga Puja, Diwali, one after the other, this is the right time when there is an opportunity for economic emergence for the poor.
As long as there is a question of economy, hundreds of families have started making surplus in small domestic industries since several months before Raksha Bandhan.
Business of thousands of hundreds of thousands of sweets is connected to a festival.
The family of our own poor brothers and sisters runs from it only.
We illuminate the lamp in Diwali, not just that light festival, it is not just a festival, it is a decoration of the house.
It is directly related to those poor families who have made small muds.
But today, when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would also like to talk about the environment.
I have seen and sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware of me and more active.
For the last one month, the citizens who have been aware of the environment have written letters to me.
He has urged you to talk about eco-friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi so that people are planning on the choice of Ganesh of soil.
First of all, I am grateful to such aware citizens.
He has urged me to speak on this subject before time.
This time, the public Ganesh Festival has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji had launched this great tradition and this year is the 125th year of Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav.
Once again, let us recall the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak in this year's essay competitions, discuss meetings.
And again, in the direction of the feelings of Tilak ji, how can we take the public Ganeshotsav, how can we make this feeling stronger and along with eco-friendly Ganesh, Ganesh made of soil to protect the environment, it will be our resolve.
And this time I have said very soon
I am sure that you will connect with me and this will benefit from this that our poor artisans, poor artists, those who build statues, they will get employment, the stomach of the poor will be filled.
Let us join our festivals with the poor, join the economy of the poor, the joy of our festivals become the economic festival of the house of the poor, the economic joy of all of us.
I convey my best wishes to every countrymen for the coming festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly looking at the field of education, be it economic sector, be it social sector, sports or be it our daughters are illuminating the name of the country, getting new heights.
We are proud of our daughters.
In the last few days, our daughters have performed a grand performance in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those girls this week.
I felt very nice to talk to him, but I was feeling that he could not win the world cup, he was very favourable to him.
He was also pressurized and stressed on his face.
Many of us have seen such games that if the players of India fail in it then the anger of the country breaks on those players.
Some people break the limits and say something that writes so that there is a lot of pain.
But for the first time, when our daughters could not succeed in the World Cup, hundreds of millions of nations took the embarrassment and did not allow them to fall on the girls.
Not only that, these girls have glorified the glory of what they did.
In fact, the younger generation of our country, especially our daughters, are really doing a lot to illuminate the name of the country.
Once again I convey my best wishes to the younger generation of the country, especially to our daughters.
My dear countrymen, I once again recall the August Revolution, once again remind you of August 15, I once again recall the 75th year of independence.
Every countryman should make a pledge and prepare a five-year roadmap for achieving the resolve of every countrymen.
We all have to reach that country at new heights, reach and reach it.
Let us walk together, let us do something or the other.
The fate of the country will continue to be better and move forward with confidence.
My best wishes.
The weather is changing.
In many parts of the country, the weather has become pleasant due to rains.
After the rains, there is a feeling of relief from the heat in the last few days in the cold winds.
And we have seen that there are many problems in life, some stress, personal life, public life, the arrival of rain changes our mindset.
Today, the chariot journey of Lord Jagannath Ji is celebrated in many parts of the country with great devotion and joy.
Now in some parts of the world, the festival of the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath ji is celebrated.
And the poor people of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath ji.
Those people who do.
Baba Saheb had studied Ambedkar, he must have seen that he was commending the temple and traditions of Lord Jagannath Ji because it was under social justice and social harmony.
Lord Jagannath ji is the god of the poor.
And very few people knew that there is a word in English language, Jagarnaut and it means a magnificent chariot that no one can stop.
And it is also seen that this word has emerged with the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has adopted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath Ji, I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen and bow down to Lord Jagannath Ji.
The diversity of India is also its characteristic, the diversity of India which is also the strength of India.
On the holy month of Ramzan, people celebrated it with a sacred spirit.
Now there is a festival of Id.
My best wishes to everyone on this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is a month of pure donation.
The month of sharing of happiness is the month and the happiness we share is the same.
Let us come together and take inspiration from these sacred festivals and share the treasures of happiness and move forward.
In this sacred month of Ramzan, an inspirational incident of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live in a small village and in a way more ruins belong to the brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
In this Ramzan, the people of the village have decided to build toilets together.
And within this individual toilet, the government also provides assistance and the amount of assistance of about one lakh has been given to them.
This one lakh rupees will be spent for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for changing this sacred occasion of Ramzan into a good opportunity of the society.
Their things are also very inspiring.
And the biggest thing is that he freed Mubarakpur from open defecation.
We know that three regions in our country are Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala which have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration, governance and people of these five states for fulfilling this work.
We know a lot that in the life of a person, in the life of a society, we have to work hard.
If our letter is bad, if it is to be improved then it has to be very aware of it for a long time.
Then the habit of body and mind changes.
This is the subject of cleanliness.
Such bad habits have become a part of our nature.
We have become a part of our habits.
We have to strive to get rid of this.
Everybody has to attract attention.
We have to remember good inspirational events.
And I am happy that today cleanliness is not just a government programme.
In the past, a very good incident came to me, which I would like to say before you.
This is the incident of Vijaynagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration there has taken a big job from public participation.
A 100-hour non-stop campaign.
And what was the goal
Construction of 10,000 household toilets in 1 gram panchayats in a hundred hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that people and the government have successfully completed the work of constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
1 villages have been ODF.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people sitting in the government, government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district that they have presented a very inspiring example of their hard work.
During these days, I continue to visit Mann Ki Baat and keep on coming to the Narendra Modi App, MyGov.
They keep on coming on the in, keep coming from the letters and keep on coming to the sky.
Shriman Prakash Tripathy has recalled the complications that on June 25, he has presented it as a period of time in the history of democracy.
This awareness towards the democracy of Prakash Tripathi ji is commendable and democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
15th, 25th June was such a black night that no democracies can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted into jail.
The opponent voice was pressed.
The dignitaries of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were shut down in jail.
The justice system was also unable to escape from the shadow of that terrible form of crisis.
The newspapers were completely neutralized.
The students of today's journalists, the people working in the democracy, reminding the black era, constantly making efforts to enhance awareness towards democracy and keep on doing it.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
When it took place for a year, Atal ji wrote a poem and he described the situation of that time in his poem.
We have to empower this heritage.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud to raise his head in the world today.
On June 21, 2019, the entire world became Yogamayam.
From water to mountains people welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
People practiced Yoga on the Great Wall of China in China, while people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea on the World Heritage Site Machu Picchu in Paru.
People performed Yoga in Afil Tower Sandhya in France.
More than 4000 people have done collective yoga in Abu Dhabi of UAE.
In Afghanistan, India, Franceship Dam in Hairat, Yoga on Salma Dam, waited for Indias friendship.
The programmes were held at 0 places in small places like Singapore and they launched the campaign till the week.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organised at UN Headquarters.
Each of the UN officials, including the world's diplomats were present here...
Once again, Yoga has worked as a World Record.
In Ahmedabad in Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have made a new world record by doing yoga together.
I also got the opportunity to attend the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time I got the opportunity to do yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers also made Yoga in Siachen where the minus 20, 25, 40 degrees is temperature.
Whether it is our armed forces, BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CISF, everybody has made Yoga his own share with his duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because it was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that the three generations of the family should share the pictures of Yoga together.
Some TV channels also carried forward this thing.
I have received several photographs, some of which have been collected on the selected Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister Shri, I am speaking from Dr. Anil Sonar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Saheb, I have a question that recently we had heard in your statement in Kerala that instead of giving gifts and flowers at different places, we should give a good reading book as mementos.
You have also started this work during your tenure in Gujarat, but Saheb, we have not been able to see that work in just a few days.
So can we do this
Bhinkar Foundation is organised and in order to make the habit of reading books in the people, to make people aware of reading books, to celebrate Reading Day and Reading Month.
For this, I got the opportunity to visit it on the occasion of its launch.
And the handloom of Khadi, which will also encourage Khadi.
As far as I was in Gujarat, that habit of all of us was made, but when I came here, my habit was lost.
But when he went to Kerala, he remembered it once again.
And I have recently started giving the following suggestions in the government.
We can also gradually create a habit.
And the age of flowers is very low.
Once I took it in my hand, then I put it in my hand.
But if we give a book then it becomes a part of the house in a way and becomes a part of the family.
Welcome towel of Khadi, so many poor people get help from it.
Expenditure is also reduced and it is also used in the true sense.
And when I am talking about this thing, how historical value is such things.
When I went to UK last year, the queen of Britain, Rani Elizabeth in London, invited me to dinner.
Yet how many years have passed, Rani Elizabeth has kept the towel given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I was looking at him, he was urging him to touch and see.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I am confident that habits do not change overnight and when we talk about it, we also have to become a victim of vaccine.
However, there will be criticism but if I keep talking then there will be changes gradually.
My dear countrymen, because of being the Prime Minister, there are many kinds of works.
I have to stay in files, but I have a habit for me that I read some of the letters that come to me every day and I get an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different types of newspapers come and different kinds of people write letters.
These days, I got the opportunity to read such a letter and I feel that I should definitely tell you about it.
In a remote south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife of Madurai, Arunmoji Sarvanan, he sent me a letter.
And in Chitti, he wrote that I had also thought of taking care of the children's studies in my family towards doing some economic activity, which would provide financial assistance to the family.
So I took the money from the bank through the Mudra scheme and brought some goods from the market and started a small task towards sending the supply.
I was noted that the Government of India has set up a system called Sarvement e-Marketplace.
So I searched for information about what it is, people asked about it.
Then I registered it myself.
I want to tell the countrymen that if you also get an opportunity then you also visit e-GeM on the Internet.
Those people who want to send some goods to the government, want to send small things, want to send electricity bulbs, want to send dustbins, want to send swords, want to send a chair, want to send a table, they want to sell, they can get their name registered in the site.
They can write and write about the quality they have, and the people of the government departments will have to visit the site on compulsory basis, it will be to see who provides cheaper by not binding the supplementary quality.
And then they have to order.
So, every department of the government is watching the name registered within the e-GeM.
Due to lack of intermediaries, things are very cheap.
Now this Arulamozy Medal has registered all the goods that could be provided on this website of the government.
And it is a matter of fun that the letter he has written to me is very interesting.
He has written that once I got the money from Mudra, my business started, I gave all the information about what I can give in the e-GeM and what I might have been asked from the Prime Minister's Office, he has written that the Prime Minister's Office has bought two thermos from me.
And I also got my bill of Rs 1600.
This is power.
This is the strength of the country.
It also has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
This is the Government e-Marketplace- GEM.
I would definitely want people who want to sell their goods and goods to the government in this way to connect with this site.
I believe that this Minimum Governance and Maximum Governance is a marvellous example of the maximum Governance and its goal is at least cost and easier efficiency and transparency.
My countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga, on the other hand we are proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground connected with yoga then our dreams are to cross the horizons of distant faith.
A few days ago, India has shown a lot of hard work in sports and science.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 NAS satellites with Cartoset-2 Search Satellite.
And this satellite includes about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America, besides India.
And this Neno Satellite Expedition of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the work of farmers and during natural disasters.
A few days ago, we must be remembered that ISRO had successfully launched the GSAT-1.
And this is the most weighty satellite in the satellites launched by India so far.
And if the newspapers of our country had compared it with the weight of the elephant then you can imagine how big our scientists have done in the space sector.
One thousand days of Mars Mission have been completed on 1st June.
But I am glad that the efforts of our scientists were powerful that six months have been successfully completed and now our Mangalyaan Mission is working even after a thousand days.
The photographs are being sent, the information is being provided, the antific data are coming, it is working even more than its age.
Our scientific journey to complete one thousand days is an important step in our space journey.
We are also seeing that the interest of our youth is increasing in the field of sports.
It is now being seen that along with studies, our younger generation is looking forward to their future in sports and because of our sportspersons, their hard work and achievements, the name of the country is also illuminated.
Recently, India has enhanced the honor of the country by fascinating its victory in the Indonesia Open.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to him and his coach for this achievement.
T.
I had the opportunity to attend the inauguration ceremony of Synthetic Track for Usha School of Athletics, Ushaji.
Sports also play a very important role in individual development.
The importance of sports is very big in the entire personality development.
There is no shortage of talent in the country.
If children are interested in sports in our family too, then they should be given an opportunity to play.
If they take them from the fields, stop them in the rooms, do not compulsory for books, they can also study and move forward in it, but if they are capable of sports, are interested then school, colleges, family and surrounding people should encourage them.
Everyone should dream for the Olympics.
Once again, my countrymen, the atmosphere of rainy season, the atmosphere of festivals, in a way, the feeling of this Kalkhand feels new.
We can never forget the heat of this year.
Rainfall is awaiting a fascinating eye.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has begun.
On the occasion of the auspicious month of Ramzan, I convey my warm greetings to the people of India and the world, especially to the Muslim community.
Prayer, spirituality and donation are given great importance in Ramzan.
We are very fortunate that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India can pride that thing, we can pride 1. 25 billion Indians that all the communities of the world are present in India.
This is a country where people who believe in God also live and those who reject God also live, those who worship idols also live and those who oppose the idol worship also live.
Every kind of ideal, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, every kind of tradition, we have imbibed the art of living together and that is, be it religion, sect, ideologies, traditions, it gives us the message of peace, unity and harmony.
This will help in furthering this path of peace, unity and harmony of the holy month of Ramzan.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all.
Last time when I was talking about Mann Ki Baat, I used a word and especially told the youngsters to do something new, come out of the comfort zone.
Take new experiences and this is the age when life can be lived in such a way, take some risk, invite problems.
I am glad that many people have given me a sympathy.
Everyone showed me the zeal of speaking to me individually.
Some are learning dramas and some people have written that we have now started writing poems.
My reading habit was almost lost.
Therefore, I decided to read this holiday.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I realized that how many freedom fighters had to sacrifice, how many years have spent in prisons.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh who had done a lot in a very young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give you some messages to this generation.
I am glad that the younger generation is interested in knowing about our history, our freedom fighters, those who sacrificed for this country.
Innumerable great men, who had spent in the youth jails, laughed and laughed at many young fans.
And that is why today we are breathing in independent India.
One thing we must have seen that the great men who had spent time in the freedom movement had done a great deal of work in writing, study, and their sequences possessed Indias freedom.
I had gone to Andaman Nicobar several years ago.
The Cellular Jail went to see.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book Maji Janmathe in jail.
He was writing poems, writing on the walls.
They were shut down in a small coat.
Imagine how those who are keen to freedom will have to compensate.
When I read Savarkar ji's book Maji Janmath, I was inspired to see the Cellular Jail from it.
There is also a "Light and Sound Show" which is very inspiring.
There was no such state in India, there was no language speaker of Hindustan who had not suffered his youth in the jail of Andaman, who had been decorated with black water for independence.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
I will definitely tell the younger generation of the country that for what kind of freedom we had to face, how many difficulties we had to face, if we had to go to the Cellular Jail then it would be known.
If you also get the opportunity then you must visit the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle in a way.
My dear countrymen, the first Monday of June 5 is the month.
Connecting with Nature means - nurture a better planet.
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say several times: One Must care a world one will not see.
That is, we should take care of the world that we do not want or worry about it.
If you have come very tired and open the windows of the room, open the doors, fill the fresh air in the breath then a new warning comes.
This body of the five Mahabhutas, when it comes in contact with the five Mahabhutas, the self-sufficient emerges a new consciousness in our body and a new energy emerges.
We all have done this experience, but we don't recall it, we don't connect it to one corner, one corner.
After this, you must see that when you are in touch with the natural situation, you will have a new consciousness and that is why the global campaign to connect with nature on June 5 should also become our own mission.
And we are getting some benefits from our ancestors to protect the environment.
If we protect, then our future generations will benefit.
In Vedas, the earth and the environment are considered to be the root of energy.
And Adharvaveda is the biggest direction of the environment in a way and it has been written thousands of years ago.
We say there: Mother Land: Sons Ahm Prithivya: The Vedas say that the purity in us is due to our earth.
The earth is our mother and we are his sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, one thing must be awakened that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the accomplishment of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana, the three trees were underneath.
But we need to connect it with modern dimensions.
These days, I keep getting information from the states.
A big campaign of plantation is going on in almost every state as soon as it rains.
Crores of trees are grown.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has now become a known day for the world on 21st June.
The whole world considers it as World Yoga Day.
In a short span of time, this 21st June World Yoga Day has spread across every corner and is connecting people.
On the one hand, when many powers of partition are showing their distorted face in the world, Yoga is Indias great gift to the world.
We have linked the world to one instrument through Yoga.
As Yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, Yoga is also connecting the world today.
Today due to lifestyle, due to race and increasing responsibilities, life free of stress is becoming difficult.
And it has been noted that this situation is happening in the people of the younger age.
In such a situation, Yoga has a key role to live a stress-free life while taking medicines and passing days.
Yoga is a guarantee for both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through the medium of Yoga if you want to experience the journey through the system, from the mind, from the body, from the thoughts, from the ideas and the way you travel through the health of the people.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world for Yoga Day.
Last year, I announced some competitions related to Yoga.
Gradually work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga and said to me that this time, on the third International Day of Yoga, three generations of the same family should do yoga together.
Whether it is a grandfather or a child or a grandfather or a daughter, the three generations should do yoga together and upload it.
Yoga will get a new dimension if it will be a good combination of the past, today and tomorrow.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that as we had launched the Selfie with Doctor's campaign and had a very interesting experience.
These three generations of Yoga will enjoy the spirit of Yoga for the country and the world.
I invite you all.
We still have about three weeks for the International Yoga Week.
Start studying today.
I will continue to post something or the other related to yoga on Twitter from June 1 and will continue to post till June 21.
I'll sharge with you.
You should also propagate the subject of Yoga for three weeks, spread it, connect people.
In a way, this is the movement of Privative Health Care.
I invite you all to join it.
Because I had a very interesting phone call and I might not have thought of this thing like this.
But I thank him for the way he caught this thing.
You will also be remembered by this phone call.
Namaste Modi Ji, I am Naina, from Mumbai.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, on your call, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission.
The jewellery that you had taken from the valleys of Kashi has now taken the form of a movement by taking inspiration from you.
You are true that wherever I go, the government system does the work of cleanliness, but during these days, the festival of sanitation also becomes in the society.
Five days before my visit, seven days ago, ten days ago, many cleanliness programmes are organized.
Media also gives a lot of priority to such programmes and just a few days ago I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
You can imagine how much I would be happy to know that and how beautifully the country is taking care of these things.
During my journey, the subject of sanitation is connected, can I be more happy than that
The other preparations will be to be made for the welcome of the Prime Minister, but cleanliness will be the main thing.
This is also joyful and inspirational for any sanitation lover.
I convey my best wishes to all those who help in the work of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
However, the suggestion is a bit of commodity.
I don't know whether I can do it or not.
Before Modi ji visited you, tell him who wants to invite you, brother, what would be the level of cleanliness if you want to speak to me
I felt very good, but I would have to think.
However, it is true that it should be started that it would be better to give other things as gifts that we should clean up such tons of waste and give them in gifts.
How many people can be prevented from being afflicted.
How big work of humanity will be.
One thing I would like to say is that we should not consider the garbage that is a waste, it is a wealth and a source.
Do not see it as a waste.
The Government of India has decided to launch a major mission of West Management with the help of State Governments as well as with the help of people representatives of cities.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, about 4,000 cities of the country will be able to collect solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of garbage will be available, one green, second blue.
There are two types of wastes - one Liquid Waste and the other dry waste.
If we stay in the discipline, in those four thousand cities where garbage is to be planted, the dry waste is to be planted in blue waste and wet wastes should be planted in green waste like the wastes that are evacuated from the kitchen, vegetables, drained meals, eggs, trees and plants are all wet wastes and put them in green waste.
This entire process is such that the fields can be used and the color of the fields is green and it will be remembered that what waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste.
And the rest of the wastes such as ruddy paper, cardboard, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, polythene, broken dubbers, rubber, metal, and many other innovative things - all these things are called a kind of dry waste, which have to be recycled by putting in the machine.
Just a few days ago, you must have heard a news that Versova Beach, which is considered to be dirty in Mumbai, has become a beautiful clean salt Versova beach today.
Versova Residents Volunteer (VRV) took over its entire responsibility.
I convey my best wishes to Shriman Afroz Shah.
Congratulations to this movement.
And the way he connected the people of the entire region like a folk culture and converted it into a mass movement, it is an inspiring example.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for the past 15 months, whether it is printed, TV or social media, all these are continuously going on account of the 3 years of the present government.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Minister.
I see this process as a very positive indicator.
This period of three years has been assessed on every commodity.
Every section of the society has reviewed it.
This is an excellent process in democracy.
I obviously believe that the governments should be responsible in the democracy, the people should pay their account of their work.
For a aware nation, for a conscious nation, this chanting is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you, and with a common citizen, the impact of all things falls on me as if it falls on the minds of any ordinary citizen.
Mann Ki Baat looks at it as a one-sided dialogue, some people make it a criticism from the political point of view, but after such a long experience, I feel that when I started Mann Ki Baat, I did not even think that Mann Ki Baat programme would make me a member of every family of India.
It seems as if I am sitting in the middle of the family and talking about the house.
And there are hundreds of such families who have sent me to write these things.
And as I said, I have an impact on my mind in the form of a common man.
Two days ago, the Honourable President, the Honourable Vice President, the Honourable Speaker Mahodya, everyone inaugurated an analytical book of Mann Ki Baat as an individual, as an ordinary citizen, this event is encouraging for me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, whenever I meet, the rains would have come to every corner of the country, the weather would have changed, the results of the tests would have come up, the beginning of a new life would have been started and with the rains coming, a new joyful environment would have spread innovative innovations.
Let us all move forward in love with nature in this environment.
My best wishes to all of you on my behalf.
Most of those who suggest or try to reach me are those who actually do something in their lives.
They are striving in accordance with their wisdom, strength, capability and conditions and when it came to mind, I felt that this suggestion was not normal, it was emerging from the discourse of the experience.
I never thought that today the youth of our country has been doing this work for a long time.
Yes, we have come to know that some social institutions have worked for years, but I came to know that the youth of my country have been engaged in it.
How many have sent me widows.
There are many places where roti bank runs.
People deposit roti from their side in this roti bank, deposit vegetables and those who are required, they also get it from there.
Those who give satisfaction also feel satisfactory and those who take care never have to look below.
This is an example of how work is done with the help of the society.
Today is the end of the month of April and the last day.
On the first day of May, the establishment day of Gujarat and Maharashtra is.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the citizens of both the states.
The two states have made immense efforts to scale new heights of development and have contributed to the progress of the nation.
My best wishes to these two states.
There was a time when climate change was considered the subject of education and world, it was considered the subject of debate, but today, we also experience it in our daily life and express surprise.
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports.
The heat that falls in our country in May-June this time has come to experience in March-April and when I was receiving the suggestions of the people about Mann Ki Baat, most of the suggestions were made by the people in this summer period.
It is not new but it is also very useful to reconcile it at the same time.
Shri Prasant Kumar Mishra and T.
S.
Many friends like Kartik have expressed concern for birds.
The friends have said that water should be kept on the roof in Balkani and I have seen that small children of the family do this thing very well.
Once they understand why this water should be filled up, then it goes to see the utensils that have been kept in that day, whether it is water or not, it also shoes or birds have come or not.
We feel that this game is going on, but in reality it is a wonderful experience of adverse feelings in the mind of the child.
You can also see sometimes with the animals and birds but the feeling of this feeling makes you feel a new joy.
However, in our country, we are coloured with animals and birds and nature, it is important that such efforts should be strengthened in a collective manner.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Dharmaguru Sayedna Saheb of Daudi Wahra Samaj was a hundred years ago.
I had the opportunity to launch it.
He shared the marks of about 52 thousand birds in the corner of the world.
He was also ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that the printers, the milk, the vegetables, the postals, anybody comes in our courtyard, but we forget that the days of summer are the days before asking them a little water.
Young friends, I want to do some things with you too.
Sometimes I am worried that our younger generation enjoys living in the same way.
Parents also reproduce them in a defence situation.
I am confident that some friends will definitely try and tell me.
Do you use this time of vaccination as per my suggestion I suggest that if you implement three of them then it is a good thing but try to implement one of the three.
It's a joo or a new experience.
Try to learn new skills.
If you have never seen, don't think, don't know, but if you want to go there then try to go there.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
Sometimes seeing something on TV, or reading about it in the book or listening to it from the acquaintances and feeling the same thing itself, there is a difference between the common people.
I would urge you to explore whatever your knowledge is in this vacation.
If you are negative, even if you are out of comfort, do it.
We are from the middle class families and from the happy family.
I don't say that do it again and again, feel it once.
It is time for the evening, take your football or take a volleyball or take any means of sports and reach the poor population.
Play yourself with those poor children, you see, you will get the pleasure of a game that may have never been found before.
And I am confident that if you go once then you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many self-service organisations continue to serve.
Search that you are also associated with the Gugal Guru and connect with such an organisation for 15 days and 20 days.
But at the same time, if you have ever seen such summar camps, you have learned the course of personality development then you should reach those people who have not got the opportunity to participate in such camps and learn those people without taking money.
You can learn how to develop.
Every person has become busy with technology.
Community is also a culture. Community is a power.
Today is the era of competition.
Sometimes it feels scared that our young generation is not becoming a human robot
Efforts to spend time with you, away from technology.
Whether it is Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi, they are learning some musical instruments.
If there is a country full of diversity and if you look at it then you can find someone learning around us.
You want to learn car driving. Do you ever want to learn autorickshaws
You have driven the cycle but the three-wheeled cycle that takes the people, has ever been able to run.
You will see that all these new experiments, these schemes are such that will also enjoy you and the life that has been tied in a corner of which it will also expel you.
Let's do something out of box.
This is an opportunity to make life.
And you will think that if all the tests are completed, if we go to the new stage of the carpenter then it will not be a chance to learn.
Later, you will fall into other jewellery and that is why I will tell you that if you are happy to learn the jewellery then learn the jewellery of the leaf.
Keep showing magnificence to your wards.
I say from my experience that by looking at the world, we have to learn and understand that we cannot imagine.
This will give you a lot of learning.
I would like and it is also true that when you are going, share the details of it.
What new did you see
Where did you go, please
Let us share your experiences by using the Heshtag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given a good opportunity for you.
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
If you don't download the Bhima App, you will also be using it.
But refer to others.
If you connect someone else and that new person makes three transactions, if you don't work thrice then you get Rs. 10 for this work.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If 20 people have been given a day, you will earn Rs. 200 in the evening.
Businessmen can also be earned and students can also be earned.
And this scheme is up to 14th October.
You will contribute to making Digital India.
You will become a channel of New India.
So the vacation and earnings of the vaccine.
He had become a symbol of VIP culture in a way, but the experience says that the red lights used to be on the vehicle, it used to be on the car, but it used to enter into the brain and the VIP culture was constructed in a mental way.
Now the red light has gone, no one can claim that the red light that has entered the brain would have emerged.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Well, he has expressed his apprehension in that phone but now this phone call shows that the common man does not like these things.
It feels that it is far away.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am talking to Shiva Chaube, from Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to say something about the government's lead beacon light ban.
I had read a line in Newspaper in which I had written, I was very proud to hear that every Indian is a VIP on a road and it was also happy that today my time is equally important.
I don't get stuck in the traffic jam and I don't have to stay for anyone.
I would like to thank you very much for this decision.
And in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which has been organised, our country is not being cleaned, the duties of VIP are also being cleaned on our roads, then thanks to the government decision to go to the Red Light is a part of the system.
But we also have to try to remove it from our mind.
If we all try to make awakening efforts together then we will be able to get out.
Our concept of New India is that the importance of EPI in place of VIP in the country increases.
And when I am saying EPI instead of VIP, my feeling is clear that every person is Important.
Everybody has the importance, everybody has the greatness.
If we embrace the importance of hundreds of crore Indians, if we embrace the great freedom of hundreds of crore Indians then how big power will be united to fulfill the great dreams.
We have to do together.
My dear countrymen, I have always been saying that we keep remembering history, our cultures and our traditions again and again.
It gives us energy, inspiration.
This year, we are celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of Sant Ramanujacharya ji.
We have become so small because of some of the reasons that we think about more and more centuries.
For other countries of the world, centuries have great significance.
But India is such an ancient nation that we have got the opportunity to commemorate thousands of years and thousands of years old memories.
How would it happen a thousand years ago
Very few people would have known that Ramanujacharyaji had a huge fight against the evils that were in the society, the feelings of heights, the feelings of childhood, the feelings of casteism.
Through his own conduct, the society was embraced by those who were considered untouchable.
Thousands of years ago, he campaigned for his entrance to the temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are fortunate that in every era, a great man is born from our society to eliminate the evil of our society.
When we celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya ji, then we have the strength of social unity, organisation - inspire them to revive that spirit.
The Government of India is also going to release a stamp in memory of Saint Ramanujacharya ji on 1st May tomorrow.
I respectfully bow down to Saint Ramanujacharya ji, pay homage.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is a different significance of 1st May.
In many parts of the world, it is also celebrated as Labour Day.
If Labour is discussed then it is very natural for me to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And very few people would know that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the facilities provided to the workers today.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb, I talk about Saint Ramanujacharya ji, then the great saint and social reformer of Karnataka of the 12th century Jagat Guru Basaveshwar ji also remembers.
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit a function.
This was the opportunity to dedicate the collections of his son-in-law.
In other words, Shram is Shiva.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Thangadi Ji.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world.
The problems that the world is passing through today, the competition of violence, war, destruction, weapons...
When we see this environment, the ideas of Buddha seem to be very relevant.
And in India, Ashoka's life is an excellent symbol of the journey of Buddha from war.
I am fortunate that on this great festival of Buddha Purnima, Vesak Day is celebrated by United Nations.
This year he is going to be in Sri Lanka.
On this sacred festival, I will get an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
They will get an opportunity to refresh their memories.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move forward with the mantra of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas.
And especially for our neighbouring countries.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on March 26, 2019
My dear countrymen, my blessings to you all, most of the families of the country will be busy in the examination of their children.
Those whose examinations have been completed will have a bit lighter environment and where the examination is going on, those families will still have little concern.
But at this time I will say that at the same time, listen to the things I have done to the students in Mann Ki Baat.
During the examination, you will definitely work on that story.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is the day of Independence of Bangladesh.
A historic fight against injustice, a unique victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh.
On this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh on Independence Day and wish that Bangladesh should move forward, develop and assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong friend of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development within the entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories, this is our joint heritage.
Bangladesh's national song is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in the year 1933, he was the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize, as well as the British gave him Naithood.
Three days before this day, on March 23, the British had hanged Bhagat Singh ji and his friend Sukhdev and Rajguru on the floor and we all knew the incident on March 23 that was satisfactory to serve Mother Bharati on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru - there was no fear of death.
All the dreams of life were homage to the sacrifice of Maa Bharati's freedom.
And these three brave people are still inspired by all of us.
We cannot even decorate the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
And the entire British Sultanate was scared of these three youths.
It was a matter of concern that the British were tied in jail, the fiscal was fixed, but how to move forward along with it.
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23.
Fansy was stolen, which is not usually done.
And then the British had quietly burnt their bodies in Punjab today.
A few years ago whenever I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I felt the waves of one kind on that earth.
And I will definitely tell the youngsters of the country that whenever they get the opportunity, go to Punjab, go to the place of the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Datti.
This was the period when the stretch of freedom, its intensity, its expansion was increasing.
On one hand, the heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru inspired many youngsters for armed revolution, just a hundred years ago, Mahatma Gandhi had done the Champaran Satyagraha on 10th April, 1919.
This is the year of the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the movement of India's freedom, Gandhi Vichar and Gandhi Style, it was first seen in Champaran.
This was a major turn in the entire movement of freedom.
In particular, in view of the methods of struggle, the Satyagraha of Champaran in this period, the sports Satyagraha in Ahmedabad, the milestones in Ahmedabad.
In 1915, Gandhi returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917, he gave a new inspiration to the nation.
Today, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Please imagine that a man who returned to India in 1915, a period of only two years.
Neither the country knew them nor the influence of them, nor the beginning was there.
We can guess how hard they had to suffer and how hard they had to do at that time.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that the skills of Mahatma Gandhi's organisation, the capable of pursuing the nerves of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, organising, inspiring, inspiring, bringing this marvellous miracle to the battle against the British Sultanate by his behaviour.
And that is why we feel the vastness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think about Gandhi a hundred years ago, then Champaran Satyagraha is the subject of a very big study for any person who starts a public life.
We can learn from them how public life can be started, how hard it has to be done and how Gandhi had done it.
And this was the time when we heard the names of big Digja leaders, Gandhi had sent them all to villages, whether Rajendra Babu or Acharya Kripalani ji.
The way people were associated with the people and the people were working, they were learning the way to color them with the color of freedom.
And the British could not understand what is the method of Gandhiji
Gandhi knew that he had made a coin on two sides.
Conflict on one side of the coins and creation on the other.
On the one hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand.
There was a very wonderful balance in Gandhi's work style.
What is the word Satyagraha, what is inconvenience, what is inconvenience, what is inconvenience against such a large Sultanate, a whole new vision was established by Gandhi not by words but by a successful experiment.
The desire for this transformation of millions of Indians, the efforts of this transformation are the same that will lay the foundation of a New India.
New India is neither a government programme nor a political party's election nor a project.
It is a feeling that 125 crore Indians want to make a magnificent India.
There is a hope, a humor, a resolve, a desire within the minds of 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, if we go a little away from our lives and see the activities in the society with a sense of consciousness and try to know what is happening around us, then we will be surprised that Lakshadweep people are seen doing something for the society, the disadvantaged, the disadvantaged, the deprived, the poor and the disadvantaged.
And he also keeps on praising and dressing like a mute servant.
Many people go to the hospital daily and help patients.
Many people who know that they run for blood donation immediately .
There are many people who are hungry and worry about their food.
Our country is a multiple spring.
This mantra is in our blood.
If we look at it as a collectivity, if we look at it in an organised manner then it will be known how big it is.
When it comes to New India, it is very natural to see it with a different perspective and it is welcome in the democracy.
But it is true that if the people of the country resolve to make a pledge, decide the path to achieve the pledge, then the dream of New India-Swas crores of nations can be achieved in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all the things should be done by the budget, government projects or government funds.
If every citizen resolves that I will follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen resolves that I will fulfill my responsibilities with full authority and determination. If every citizen resolves that one day I will not use petrol diesel in my life in a week then how big changes can be made.
The meaning of saying is that every citizen follows his civil religion, follows duties.
This can be a good beginning of a New India.
My dear countrymen, I am also grateful to you today.
In the last few days, there was such an environment in our country and a large number of people participated in the digital payments and digital movement.
The demand for how transactions can be done without cash has also increased.
The poor person is also trying to learn and gradually people are moving forward to do business without cash.
Since demonetisation, nomination, there has been a lot of increase in different ways of digital payments.
Since the launch of the Bhima App, it has been just two-and-a-half months but about one and a half crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to move forward with the fight against black money and corruption. Can we resolve to do 2.5 thousand crore digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
If they want to wait for one year, they can do this work in six months.
25,000 crore digital transactions, if we have to pay a disposal fee then we will not be filled with cash, we will have to travel in the railways, if we have to travel in the air, we will pay digital payments, if we buy medicines then we will pay digital payments, if we are running cheap cereals.
We can do this in everyday life.
You don't imagine, but you can serve the country with it and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
In the last few days, several programmes of Digidhan Mela have been organised for public education.
There is a resolve to do 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have already been conducted.
There was also anonymity scheme.
About 12. 5 lakh people have achieved this reward of the consumer.
0,000 people have received the reward for traders.
And everybody has resolved to move forward.
And many times ago, on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar will conclude the Digidhan Mela.
After 100 days of completion, the last is to be a very big programme.
Very big droes have also been added to it.
I am confident that whatever time Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary has saved us, we should propagate the Bhima App.
We can contribute to how cash behaviour is less, how to reduce transactions with notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I inform people about Mann Ki Baat, every kind of suggestion comes.
But I have seen that everybody has always been in the forefront of cleanliness.
I want to talk to you about my mind.
I want to say that people have to understand how important cleanliness is.
I pass through a river everyday in which people throw a lot of garbage and pollut the river.
The river comes to my house flowing from the Rispna bridge.
It has been removed for the river and in many areas and many people have also spoken about it but it has not benefited from it.
And the best thing is that Gayatri himself is expressing his anger, suggesting me and also telling me that he has made a lot of efforts but he was unsuccessful.
Awareness has come to the forefront of the Swachhta Movement.
Every person has been connecting it positively.
He has also taken the form of a movement.
Faith towards dirt is also increasing.
Be it awareness, active partnership, movement, all of them have their own importance.
But cleanliness is associated with the habits of movement.
This movement is a movement to change the habits, this movement is a movement to create the habit of cleanliness.
This movement can be done collectively.
The work is difficult but it is to do.
I am confident that this feeling has awakened in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth and this is a sign of a good result.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat programme, I will tell all the countrymen that this message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I have been talking about Mann Ki Baat from the beginning, I have been receiving a lot of suggestions from the beginning and most of the people have expressed concern about food habits.
We know that we also take more than required food in our family and collective food festivals.
Whatever things we see, we take in the plate and they cannot eat.
We cannot even eat half of the plates that we fill in and keep it there.
Whenever you have thought that how much harm we have left the food that we have left.
Have you ever thought that if we do not spoil the food then we can fill the stomach of some poor people
Even though somebody has been trying to make efforts, sadness on this subject is a social trauma.
There is injustice to the poor.
I am not urging too much on this subject but I want to increase awareness.
Their life inspires us not to spoil food.
We should take as much as we eat.
See, there are similar measures for change.
And those people who are aware of the health of the body always say that keep a bit of stomach empty, keep a plate empty.
We are also familiar with the word depression.
There is an estimate that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally suffering from depression.
The problem is that there are such people around us but we cannot recognize them and perhaps we are sympathetic to speak openly on this subject.
Those who are themselves afflicted with depression do not speak anything because they themselves feel embarrassed about it.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not such a disease that cannot get rid of it.
There is a need to create a psychological environment for this and the first mantra to come out of it is that instead of depression, there is a need for expression.
Talk openly to your friends, friends, parents, brothers and sisters and teachers about what you are feeling.
Sometimes one feels loneliness and especially the students living in the hotel have a lot of problems.
Families are big, we are melting there, due to which there is no possibility of depression.
However, I would like to tell my parents that sometimes you have seen that your daughter or any member of the family is sitting with everyone and they say that I don't leave anymore, then jamish and don't come on the table.
You should understand that this is the first step towards depression.
If he does not like to stay in the group and lives in one corner then keep in mind that it does not happen.
This is the best way.
And depression is the cause of psychological and physical diseases.
Like diabetes is a host of every disease, depression also ends the capabilities of staying, fighting, courage and taking decisions.
Your friends, your family, your premises and your environment can stop you from getting into depression and if you have gone then you can get out of it quickly.
Help with your mind, share their grief and grief, you will feel that your inner pain will end.
If you try to understand their grief, do it with service, then you will have a new self-confidence.
By connecting with others, by serving someone and serving in a selfless manner, the twelve of your mind will be lightened.
However, Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in liberating from stress, liberating from pressure and traveling towards happiness.
International Day of Yoga is on 21st June and this is the third year of it.
Do all your preparations and celebrate Yoga festivals in a large number of lakhs.
If you have any suggestions about the Third International Yoga Day then send me through mobile applications.
Whatever songs and poems can be prepared about yoga, it should be prepared so that it can be easily understood by the people.
But along with work, women also have special responsibilities.
They also take up family responsibilities and also cooperate in the economic responsibilities of the family, due to which sometimes injustice is being done to their infants.
Then the Government of India has taken a very important decision that these Nokriya women have taken Maternity during their delivery, which was earlier received for 12 weeks, has now been increased to 26 weeks.
There are only two or three countries in the world who are ahead of us in this regard.
If this happens then these children will grow up and become an invaluable reward for the country.
It will also ensure the health of mothers and it will be an important decision for them.
This will benefit approximately 18 lakh women working in the Formal Sector.
The life of all these great men will continue to inspire us, and will fulfil the resolve of New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukal Pratipada, Year Pratipada, New Sanvatsar are the best wishes to all of them for this new year.
This is a good time for the farmers to get the fruit of their hard work.
New years are celebrated in different parts of the country in different forms.
Mann Ki Baat (2nd mark)
Flowers bloom.
Not only flowers, the fruits present on the pots of trees are seen shining in the sun.
The fruits of summer season are also seen in the seasonal season of mango .
On the other hand, the yellow flowers of mustard in the field give hope to the farmers.
The flowers of casuda indicate the arrival of Holi.
Amir Khusro has described the moments of climate change.
Amir Khusro has written: The flowering mustard bun Ambwa blooms, Desu blooms, coals, dur-dur, whenever the nature is pleased, the weather is beautiful then man also enjoys a lot of happiness in this season.
The festivals of Basant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi brighten the colors of happiness in the life of man.
In the atmosphere of love, brothers and humanity, we are going to leave Fagan in the last month and we are ready to welcome the new month of Chaitra.
This is the combination of two months.
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions of citizens of the country for the fact that whenever I suggest a suggestion for the matter of mind, then there is a bond of suggestions.
She has written to me on the Narendra Modi App that many people are not aware of the achievements of ISRO and hence she said that I will leave 104 satellites and give some information about the interceptor missile.
Shobhaji thanks you very much that you have conveyed your heartfelt pride to India.
Be it poverty eradication, prevention of diseases, connecting with the world, knowledge, belief, technology and science have raised their place everywhere.
15th February, 2019 is a glorious day in Indias life.
Our scientists have raised Indias glory against the world.
And we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in a few years.
After the success of sending Mars Mission Mangalyaan on Mangal planet, ISRO has created a world Vikram in the field of space recently.
And it is also a matter of joy that this 38th successful launch of PSLV.
It is not only for ISRO but also a historic achievement for the entire India.
This Coast Effective Afficient Space Programme of ISRO has become a miracle for the entire world and appreciates the success of Indian scientists to send me to the world.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is very important.
Carto Sat 2D is the satellite of India and it will provide a lot of help to the planting of stretched data, resources mapping, infrastructure, development assessment.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, however water resources are there in the country, however it can be used, however it can be used, what should be taken care of, this new satellite will help Catrosat 2D on all the subjects.
We also sent some news as soon as our satellite went.
He has started his work.
It is also a matter of joy for us that this entire campaign has been led by our young scientists, our women scientists.
Such a strong partnership of youth and women is a proud aspect of the success of ISRO.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
The more we commend our scientists to their entire team is that low.
Shaoh ji has asked another question and that is Indias security, India has achieved a huge achievement in this regard.
This thing has not been discussed anymore, but the attention of Shavji has gone on this important thing.
India has successfully tested the ballistic interceptor missile in the field of defence.
This interception technologies missile, during its test, was successfully destroyed by destroying the enemy missile at a height of approximately 100 km from the ground.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security.
And its specialty is that even if India comes from a distance of 200 kilometres then this mission will destroy it in space itself.
Whenever we want new technologies, some new scientific achievements, we are happy.
And in the development journey of human life, knowledge has played a very important role.
And the special intelligence talent that does not let the jigyas live in the form of a jigyasa, also raises questions within them, finds new jigyas, creates new jigyas.
And this wisdom becomes the reason for new inventions.
He used to sit on his feet until he gets the answer.
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years of human life then we can say that this development journey of human life is not a complete break.
Perfection is impossible.
The efforts of Brahmanda, the rules of creation and the mind of man continue to be made to know.
New science, new technologies are generated from it.
And every technology gives birth to a new era of every new science.
My dear young friends, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have told me that our youth should increase the attraction of science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientific era becomes a cause of a stable change in the lives of generations coming in the future.
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a very unique competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharati Day.
The invitation was given to social useful innovations.
Recognition, showcasing, informing the people, and how to work for the common man, how to make jungle manufacturing, how to be commercially used and I saw how important work has been done.
Many times the problem also showcases the importance of science for solutions.
Within Mumbai, there was rains in 2005, there was floods in the sea, there was a lot of trouble, there was a crisis, and whenever there was any natural crisis, the first crisis comes to the poor.
Two brothers and sisters have done a lot of work in this regard and they have developed a house that protects the people of the country from such accidents, saves the people of the country, saves them from water consumption, saves them from water consumption.
And our society also becomes technology-based.
The systems also become technology-based.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our life.
In the past, there was a lot of importance on digitization.
Gradually, people are coming out of the block and moving forward towards digital transactions.
Digital transactions are increasing rapidly in India too.
Especially the younger generation has started possessing the habit of making digital payments with their mobile phones.
I convey my best wishes to him.
Our country has received huge support for the Lucky Consumer Scheme, DGDN Business Scheme in the last few days.
It has been about two months and a reward of Rs. 1,000 per day is given to 15 thousand people.
And through these two schemes, an initiative to make digital payments a mass movement in India has been welcomed across the country.
And it is a matter of happiness that so far 10 lakh people have received rewards under the Digidhan Yojana, more than 50 thousand traders have got rewards and more than 1.
Under this scheme, most of the consumers are those who have received a reward of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received a reward of Rs. 50,000.
Be it farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, housing, students, all participate in this scheme with enthusiasm.
From Mysore, Shriman Santosh ji has written on the Narendra Modi App that he received a reward of Rs.
But I should tell you that he has written the biggest thing.
He said that I received a reward of one thousand rupees and at that time I came to know that there was a fire in the house of a poor elderly woman.
When the goods were burnt, I felt that the rewards I have received, perhaps it is the right of the poor mother, then I gave them thousands of rupees.
You have done a very good inspirational work.
All the time is giving knowledge of this digital.
He keeps talking with such enthusiasm and encourages others as well.
I would urge the countrymen, especially the youth of the country and the Lucky Consumer Scheme or the Digidhan Business Scheme that they have received, to be your messengers.
You take it forward and it is in a way anti-corruption worker.
In a way you are a soldier of ethics.
You know that the 100 days of Lucky Consumer Scheme will be completed on 14th April, when Dr.
It's a memorable day.
On 14th April, there will be a drove of prize worth Rs.
Nearly forty-five days are still left.
You can do one work by remembering Babasaheb Ambedkar .
At present, Babasaheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary was celebrated.
Remembering them, you should learn at least 125 people downloading the Bhima App.
Learn how transactions take place, especially the small businessmen around you.
I would like to say that this time Babasaheb Ambedkar's Jayanti and Bhima App.
For the last two-three months, many townships, several villages and many cities have been successful.
- My dear countrymen, agriculture has a huge contribution in the roots of our country's economy.
The economic power of the village strengthens the economic pace of the country.
I want to tell you this thing of great happiness today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have laid the store of food by working hard.
With the hard work of the farmers in our country this year, the production of record food has been done.
Every indicator is saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time there is such a crop in the fields that everyday it seemed as if Pongal and Baisakhi have been considered today.
This year, more than two thousand seven lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
The last record that has been recorded in the name of our farmers is 8 more.
So this is an unprecedented achievement.
I specially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I would like to thank the farmers for their traditional crops and cultivation of different pulses keeping in mind the poor of the country as the pulses are the highest protein for the poor.
I am happy that the farmers of my country listened to the voices of the poor and cultivated pulses on about two lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but the biggest service to the poor of my country made by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters are specially grateful for the way the farmers of my country have laboured and produced records.
My countrymen, it keeps on walking something or the other in the direction of cleanliness by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organisations.
In a way, everybody is looking to be aware of cleanliness in some form.
And it was to use not only the seminar in the closed rooms in Varanasi, but what is the importance of direct cleanliness.
Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 1-18 February.
The toilet pits of six households were evacuated and the officers themselves showed that the two pit toilets could be used and re-experimented.
He also showed how convenient the toilets of the new technology are and there is no discomfort in evacuating it, there is no narrowness that is psychological barrier.
And we can clean up a toilet bag in the same way as cleaning the common man.
And the result of this endeavour was that through the medium of the country, it was also important and it is natural that when an IAS officer himself cleanses the toilet bed, the attention of the country is natural to go towards it.
And from the toilet pit that we consider is waste but if we look at fertilizers then it is a black gold equivalent.
We can see what wealth is from the waste.
And it has been proved.
A Standard Twin Pit Toilet for the family of six members is filled in about five years.
After that, the waste can be easily removed and redirected in the second pit.
The garbage accumulated in PIT in six to twelve months is completely decomposed.
This decomposed waste is very safe in handle and fertilizers are extremely important fertilizer NPK.
Farmers are very well aware of the NPK.
And now there is a special programme of cleanliness in Doordarshan.
It will benefit as much as these things are awakened.
Various departments in the government are also considered to be Swachhta Pakhwada.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development along with the Ministry of Tribal Fairs Ministry will give a boost to the Swachhta Abhiyan.
And in the second Pakhwadia of March, two more ministries, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will also move forward in the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever any poor citizen of our country does something good, the whole country feels a new energy, self-confidence.
We all welcomed the exhibition of our Divyang sportspersons in Rio Paralympics.
India defeated Pakistan in the Blind T-20 World Cup finally held in this month and again became a World Champion for the second time.
We are proud of the achievements of these Divyang friends of the country.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, are determined, are courageous and determined.
Every time we have to learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anybody.
The nation is moving ahead by taking steps and illuminating the country with their achievements.
Our women sportspersons won the Silver Medal in the Asian Rugbi Sevens Trophy in the last few days.
My best wishes to all the players.
8th March is celebrated as World Womens Day.
In India, there is an increase in consciousness and awareness among the children and their families.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Today this is not just a government programme, it has become a campaign for social consciousness and public education.
During the last two years, this programme has linked the common man.
In every corner of the country, this vivid issue has forced people to think and has brought about a change in the thoughts of the people towards the old ways that have been going on for years.
When it is reported that the festival was celebrated on the birth of a child then it is very happy.
In a way, positive thinking towards girls is becoming a cause of social inheritance.
I have heard that under a special drive in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, children have been banned.
More than 15 children have been stopped at present.
The district administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand children under the Sukanya Samriti Yojana.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu Kashmir, all the departments have been connected to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme and efforts are being made to ensure that the orphaned children get their dues by the district administration along with the planning of the Gram Sabhas.
In Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being run for the learning of children in villages and houses under the Har Ghar Dastaka Programme.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to inspire the children who had been droped out by running the 'Apna Bacha Apna Vidyalaya' campaign.
It means that this movement of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has taken several forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement.
New imaginations are associated with it.
It has been circulated as per local requirements.
I consider it a good mark when we want to celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we have the same feeling.
The woman is that power, it is the woman of India, it is not more or less, it is the right officer in all of them. My dear countrymen, you get the opportunity to talk about something at different times in Mann Ki Baat.
I know a lot from your side.
What is going on on the earth, what is going on in the minds of the villages and the poor reaches me.
I thank you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
We have celebrated many festivals in the past.
Yesterday, Krishna Birth Festival was celebrated in the entire country.
And everybody can find solutions to the present problems from the life of Krishna.
Sometimes, there is a feeling of innovation in every matter.
And that is why, today when I am talking to you, I look at two Mohans.
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan used his intelligence, his duties, his capabilities and his thoughts to prevent the struggle even thousands of years ago in the situation of that time.
And the Charkhadhari Mohan also chose such a way, for the protection of human values for freedom, for the sacrifice of personalities, for the freedom of India, gave such a form to the freedom fighters. It is still surprising for the entire world.
Whether it is the importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or the importance of laughing and moving forward in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna.
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is engaged in the preparation of a big festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but in the world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Those who gave a new turn to human history, established new Vikrams.
One thing has always been associated with Mahatma Gandhi, in a way it has become a part of his life.
Whenever, whenever, whenever needed, Mahatma Gandhi was always present for the service.
He not only gave importance to service but also emphasized the spirituality associated with it.
We can understand this very well from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, the society, humanity and humanity were the same.
Whether it is a financing farm in Africa or a Tolstoy farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Vardha Ashram, he put a special emphasis on social promotion, community mobility in his own unique way.
I am fortunate to be here that I have got the opportunity to visit several important places associated with the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi was also focusing on the organisational spirit with service.
Social service and social promotion, community service and community mobility are such a feeling that we can also remove in our flowing life.
In fact, this is the true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.
No countrymen.
And collectivity has its own strength.
All these programmes of Gandhi SARDHADI have collectiveness and service.
Why don't we get out of the whole month
If we have a football team then we will not only play a football team, but will also work in accordance with the ideals of Gandhi.
We can do a lot, collect old books and share in the poor, spread knowledge.
And I believe that perhaps 130 crore Indians have 130 crore imaginations and 130 crore entrepreneurs can be created.
Be it goodwill, goodwill, goodwill and serving with complete dedication, it is also done for the feeling of freedom and well-being, a unique joy.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
The Satyagraha of salt in the freedom struggle, Dandi is an important turning point.
I inaugurated a very modern museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi of Dandi.
I urge you to visit one place or another associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
It can be anywhere.
Be it Porbandar, be it Sabarmati Ashram, be it Vardhana Ashram or be it associated with Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
And also write two-four words, expressing your feelings.
Several programmes, competitions, exhibitions have also been organized in the coming days.
But in this context, one thing is very interesting that I want to share with you.
Venice is a well-known art programme called BINL where artists from all over the world are gathered.
This time, a very interesting exhibition associated with the memories of Gandhiji has been held in the India Pavilion of Venice Bienal.
The story of Haripura was specially interesting.
You must be remembered that the Congress session was held in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhas Chandra Bose was elected Chairman, the incident is also included in history.
Gandhiji wanted him to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India through art and showcase his art work during the session.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose artworks enhance the beauty of our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
And his artistic devices have made Nandlal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited villages around Haripura and then made some artworks showcasing the lives of rural India.
There was a lot of discussion in the Venice of Anamol Art Crafts.
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I look forward to making some resolve from all Indians.
Something should be done for the country, for the society, for any party.
And that Bapu will be a good and honest workforce, the sons of Maa Bharati will remember that in the last few years, we are running the same service drive for about two weeks before October.
This time the campaign will start from 11th September.
During the expedition, we will leave ourselves home and pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdaan.
Whether it is home or street, chowk or drain, school, colleges and all public places will run a massive campaign of cleanliness.
This time, a special emphasis has been laid on plastic.
Similarly, we have to eliminate the use of plastics that work together.
This time, on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will dedicate to him an open defecation free India, as well as lay the foundation stone of a new folk movement against plastic all over the country.
I appeal to all sections of the society, to the residents of every village, small towns and to join hands and pray that this year we will celebrate Gandhi Jayanti in a way as a liberation of Mother India from plastic waste.
Celebrate October 2 as a special day.
May the day of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti be a special festival of Shramdaan.
I urge all the municipalities, municipalities, district-class systems, rural panchayats, government and non-governmental systems, all organisations, one-one citizens, all of them to make proper arrangements for collection and storage of plastic wastes.
I also urge the corporate sector to ensure that all these plastic wastes are collected when they come forward for proper evasion.
It can be recycled.
It can make fuels.
This way we can fulfil the work of safe evasion of plastic waste till Diwali.
Just vision is needed.
There is no need to look like this for inspiration.
The greater inspiration from Gandhi can be another
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit well-defined is a form of knowledge.
Whatever we want in life can be found from it.
My contact with him has been reduced recently.
But earlier my contact was very much.
Today, I want to touch a very important thing from a Sanskrit definition.
And it has been written centuries ago but how important is it today
It is an excellent definition and it has said in a sub-division: 'Prithviya Trini Ratnani, Jalam Annam Subhastama, Mudhai: Pashankhandesh Ratna Sanjya Pradiyate, so that water, food and well-defined in the earth are three Ratnas.
The fools are called stones.
Food is a great month in our culture.
It has even changed the knowledge of food into science.
Balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and newly born children, because they are the foundations of the future of our society.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once one thing was brought to me.
Muthibhara Dhanya has become a big movement in Nasik.
Anganwadi workers collect cereals in the days of crop harvesting.
This grain is used to make fresh food for children and women.
The person who donates it becomes an aware citizen, a social servant.
After that, he himself becomes dedicated to this objective and becomes a sign of this movement.
All of us have heard about the food and joy in the corner of India.
This is done when we start feeding the child for the first time.
This is a very beautiful initiative which can be adopted anywhere.
In many states, people run a tithi food drive.
If there is a birthday of someone in the family, it is a good day or a memorial day then the members of the family go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food, tasty food and go to schools and the members of the family themselves feed, feed, share their happiness and increase happiness.
A unique combination of service and happiness is seen.
Friends, There are many such small things that our country can fight against malnutrition effectively.
Today, due to lack of awareness, malnutrition is afflicted with poor and happy family.
The month of September will be celebrated as a Poshan Abhiyan throughout the country.
I never thought that I would become such a place in the hearts of the youth of our country and the world.
I never thought about how many things the youth of our country and the world are looking at.
I never thought that there would be any chance in my life to touch the youngsters of the world.
And it becomes like - I had gone to Bhutan last week.
I have seen that as a Prime Minister, I have got the opportunity to go from Jayar and because of the International Day of Yoga, the situation has become such that if anybody in the world meets and sits then somebody asks me about Yoga for five-seven minutes.
Discovery has organised this programme in 165 countries in their language.
Today, when there is a global dialogue about environment, global warming and climate change, I hope that this programme will help the discovery channel in introducing the world with the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity of nature in Indias Sanskrit Yatra.
And now people want to know about the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in our country.
But one more interesting thing is that some people also ask me to skeptically say that Modi ji was saying that you were speaking Hindi and Beer Greels did not know Hindi then how was it possible to interact with you so fast.
Or later, it has been updated.
He asks very quietly.
Jews, there is nothing in it.
If there is a question in the minds of many people then I will declare this mystery.
Well, it's not mystery.
In fact, technologies have been utilised in the interaction with beer grills.
A small cardless device was installed in the ears of Beer Greels, with which it was interpreted in English.
Likewise, I used to say Hindi, but it used to be associated with English, and it used to make communication easier and this is the complication of technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me talking about the Jim Corbett National Park.
You too must go to places related to nature and wildlife nature and other animals.
I have said before and I have spoken to you loudly and must go to Ishaan India in your life.
The world inside you will expand.
On 15th August, I had urged all of you to visit at least 15 places in India in the next three years.
For the purpose of 100 tourism, go to 15 such places, see, study, take the family and spend some time there.
This diversity will also fill you with diversity as a teacher.
Your life will expand.
Your thinking will be wide.
And believe me that there are places inside India where you will bring new zeal, new zeal, new zeal, new inspiration.
Your family will also mind.
My dear countrymen, the care and concern of the environment in India is natural.
Last month, I had the privilege of declaring a tiger population in the country.
You know how many tigers are in India
A resolution was taken to express concern over the decreasing population of tigers in the world.
This resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a new India that we can achieve the goal at the earliest.
We have doubled the population of tigers in 2019.
Not only the population of tigers in India, but also the number of reserved areas and community conserved places has increased.
When I was declaring the population of tigers, I also remembered the lions of Gir in Gujarat.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister there, the housing area of lions was shrinking in the forest of Gir.
Their number was decreasing.
We took one step after another in Gir.
In the year 2009, it was decided to undertake women's guards.
Improved Infrastructure Amendments to enhance tourism
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk of defence.
But now you will have to think about the compassion of compassion by moving ahead of defence.
This is a good guidance in our scriptures.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic statement of Swami Vivekanandaji on September 11, 183
The young Sanyasis of India, who suppressed the humanity of the whole world, had left Indias brightest identity in the world.
Swami Vivekanandji had seen the form of India that Swami Vivekanandji knew the strength of India, let us try to live it.
Everything is inside us and come out with confidence.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that August 2 is celebrated as a nation sports day.
On this occasion, we are going to launch the Fit India Movement-Chust Bharat Jhubash across the country.
My dear countrymen, I will wait for you, on 2nd August, in Fit India, in the POSHAN Abhiyan in the month of September, and especially in the Swachhta Abhiyan from 11th September to 2nd October and for the complete dedicated plastic liberation of 2nd October.
Let us come out with a new zeal, a new resolve, a new energy.
My dear countrymen, today the same thing is in Mann Ki Baat.
I'll meet you again.
I will wait for your suggestions and your suggestions.
Let us all come together to make India of the dreams of the freedom fighters, let us all come out to realise the dreams of Gandhi.
Namaskar.
On January 26, we all celebrated our Republic Day with fervor and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
I hope that at every level, at every time, the more important rights are given, the more important obligations should also be received.
On the two sides of rights and duties, India's democracy can move forward at a rapid pace.
Tomorrow is 30th January, our devotee is the death anniversary of Bapu.
On 30th January, we all pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country by keeping the silence of 11 o'clock.
As a society, as a nation, on January 30, at 11 a.m. onwards, there should be a simple feeling of paying homage for two minutes.
There should be no more than 2 minutes, but there should also be a reverence to collectiveness, determination and martyrs.
In our country, there is a simplicity of respect for the army and the security forces.
I convey my best wishes to the brave men and their families who have been honored with different bravery awards on the eve of this Republic Day.
The awards consist of several categories like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishnu Seva Medal, Vishnu Seva Medal.
I would especially urge the youngsters and you are very active in social media.
You can do one thing this time the brave people who have received this honour - Search on your net, write two good words related to it and spread it in your friends.
We are surprised, pride and inspired when we are aware of their courage, valour and compassion.
On the one hand, we all were happy with the joy and enthusiasm of the 26th of January, at that time our army personnel who were engaged in the service of the country in Kashmir were braveryed due to avalanches.
I pay homage to all those brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I am continuously doing Mann Ki Baat.
January-February-March-April, all these months are for every family.
There is a test of one or two children at home, but the entire family is buried under the burden of examination.
So I felt that this is the true time that I should talk to the students, talk to their friends, talk to their teachers, because for many years, wherever I visited, the examination was found to be the reason for a very big problem.
Family trouble, student trouble, teacher trouble, a strange psychological environment is seen in every house.
And I always feel that it should come out of it and that is why I want to talk to young friends in a bit detail today.
When I declared this thing, many teachers, guys, students sent me messages, sent me questions, expressed pain, told me about the problems and I thought about it, which I would like to talk to you today.
I received a telephone message of creation.
So I want to ask you so much that this environment cannot be happy
The question has been asked by the creation but this question will be in your mind.
Exam should be an opportunity of happiness itself.
The whole year has laboured, the time has come to showcase, it should be a festival of joy and enthusiasm.
There are very few people for whom the exam is happy, but most of the people have an exam pressure.
It is to make a decision that you will be happy to believe that you will consider it a pressure.
Whoever feels happy will get it and whoever feels the pressure will fall.
And that is why I believe that the exam is a festival, take the exam in such a way that there is a festival and when festivals are held then the best amongst us comes out.
The feeling of the strength of the society also takes place at the time of the festival.
We usually feel how proud we are, but if we look at the Kumbh Mela that runs for 40-45 days then it will come to know what is the Make Shift Arrangement and what is the discipline of people.
This is the strength of the festival.
During the examination, the entire family and friends should become an atmosphere of festivals in neighbourhood.
You will see that this pressure will be transformed into happiness.
Festivals will make the environment free.
And I would like to say to the parents here that you should make the atmosphere of a festival for three-four months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to make these three-four months a festival by understanding our traditions and by understanding the environment of our family.
And that is why I will tell you that Smile More, Score More.
You must have seen that when you are happy, you will see yourself relaxed and you will be relaxed easily and when you are relaxed then your years old things will also be remembered easily.
A year ago, the entire view of what the teacher had said in the classroom will be remembered.
And you should know that the power to recall the memory is the highest in the relaxation.
If you are in tension then every door closes, does not go inside and does not come out.
The process of thinking stops, which itself becomes a boss.
You might have seen in the examination that you remember everything, theme remembers, the snakes remember, the leaves are written upwards in the leaves and it is also remembered downwards.
Why didn't you remember, there was pressure.
But what was inside came out immediately and it came out that you were relaxed.
And that is why if there is any medicine to recall the Memory then it is relaxation.
And I say this on the basis of self-confidence that if there is pressure then we forget our things and if there is a relax then never imagined it and suddenly such things are remembered that it is very useful.
And it is not that you have no knowledge, it is not that you have no knowledge, it is not that you have not worked hard.
But when tension takes place, your knowledge gets buried and your tension gets overtaken.
And that is why it is necessary that A Happy Mind is the sector for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot see the test in the true perspective.
It seems as if it is a question of life and life.
Whatever exam you are going to give is the test of what you have learned throughout the year.
It's not the problem of your life.
There is no test of how you live, how you live, how you want to live, how you want to live.
In your life, in addition to the tests given by the books in the classroom, many people would have had the opportunity to pass through the distress.
And that is why get rid of such burden that with the success and success of life, there is a need to take the test.
Our former President Dr.
A.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is an inspirational example.
Any Rincha Anand ji has sent me a question: Today, if I see the biggest challenge in front of education then it is that education examination has become centered.
The qualities have become the most important.
Because of this, competition has increased significantly and stress has also increased in the students.
So I want to know your ideas about this current direction of education and its future.
Though he has given his own answer, he wants him to present my point here too.
Marx and Marksheets are very limited use.
There is no such thing in life.
Life is on how much knowledge you have achieved.
Whether you have tried to live with what you know or not.
Whether you have got a sense of mission, which is your senses of ambition, whether you are getting any measure between your mission and ambition or not, life continues on it.
If you believe in such things, then the Marx will be behind you, you will not need to participate behind the marks.
You will work in life, skills will work, self-confidence will work, will work.
You tell me that there will be a doctor from your family and every family will have to go with him who is a family doctor.
No one of you should have asked him how many qualities he had passed his family doctor.
Nobody asked.
Just, you felt that brother, it is very good as a doctor, you are benefiting and starting to serve him.
If you go to a girl to fight a bigger case then do you see the mark sheet of that lawyer
You see his experience, his knowledge and his successful journey.
And that is why those qualities which are the burden of these things sometimes stop us from moving towards the right direction.
But it does not mean that I say that it is not just learning.
Its use is necessary for our misery.
I was tomorrow and it is necessary to know where I am today.
Sometimes this happens and if you look at yourself closely then it will be noticed that if you fall behind the qualities then you will find a little way, catch a few choices and focus on it.
But if you focus on qualities, then gradually you are shrinking yourself and you limit yourself to a certain area only to get a mark.
So it may be possible that despite being hontile in the examination, you can never fail in life.
Richa ji has also said one thing - competition.
It's a very big psychological battle.
Indeed, competition does not work to move ahead of life. And whenever I say competitiveness then it means to compete with you.
How to be better tomorrow from Gai tomorrow
One of the special features of the lives of most of the successful sportspersons is that they compete.
Let us take the example of Shriman Secretary Tendulkar ji.
Friends in every field of life, when you are going to examine then think if you are able to read peacefully for two hours then you can read three hours .
Shriman S.
Sundar ji has expressed his feelings about the role of vali.
He says that the role of guys in the examination is very important.
He has written more and more: My mother was not known, yet she used to sit with me and ask me to count count.
Because mothers are aware of the future of children and are active, they make things easier.
Once you learn to accept, most of the problems will end there.
Everybody would feel that.
Valis, teachers are in the roots of the problem.
Acceptance opens the way for solutions to problems.
Hopes make it difficult to wait.
Accepting the situation, there is an opportunity to open a new path.
And hence accept what is.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not ask any question about his health.
Sit down, and whenever you come there, what is the situation, how is the disease, don't talk about it.
The slopes began to hear and in the first two-four minutes the atmosphere was lightened.
By going to the sick person, we often put them away from the disease.
I will say to the dwellers, sometimes we do this with the children.
Have you ever felt that during the days of examination give the child the atmosphere of laughing - laughing
You see, the environment will change.
A lot of phone call has come to me.
Namaskar, elder Prime Minister, I can't say my name because I did something like that in my childhood.
And when I tried to imitate and pass, I was caught in it and because of me, many friends around me have suffered a lot.
You must have heard it many times, don't do it, don't steal it.
I also tell you the same thing again.
Once the habit of misunderstanding happens, there will never be a desire to learn anything in life.
Then where can you reach
Their overall creativity, such a time if you are able to read in the preparation of the examination then perhaps you will not need a copy.
My first question is whether we can reduce the stress that arises during our examination and my second question is why the examination looks lighter or not thanks to you.
If you have to develop inclusively then there is a life outside the books and it is very big.
This is the time to live and learn it too.
Somebody says that I first pass all these tests, then ramish.
So it's impossible.
So the rest of the body should also get physical activity.
Have you ever thought that when all these things are in front, you can get out two moments and look at the skies, look at the trees and plants, make your mind light.
By doing so, you will again come in your rooms and your books with a freshness.
Keep that thing that you are doing, keep it for a while, get out of the kitchen, go to the kitchen, find the cheese of your choice and eat if you get the emotional biscuit.
Not only for five minutes but take a little break.
There is no need to stay closed in any room to take deep breath.
Go down a little open sky, go to the sky, take a deep breath for five minutes and sit down again.
You will feel that the body will become very light and the body will become light and will also make the brain light .
Some people feel that we will wake up late in the night, we will read more and more.
Take as much sleep as the body needs .
It'll be fresh.
Your efficiency will increase simultaneously.
Whenever I hold meetings during the election, I sometimes sit in my throat.
I came to see a folk singer.
He came and asked me how many hours are you sleeping
He gave me a herb.
So indeed, if we understand the importance of these things then we will benefit from it, you will see it.
But it does not mean that just sleeping.
Not only this, the people of your family will be despised by me.
And I will see the day when your marksheets will come, not you.
This is a very big medicine to keep the person who plays, shines, mind, intelligence, body alert.
But I will also say that do not let the burden of what I have said.
So, I also feel that as I suggest your family and parents not to be foolish.
Remembering your resolve, keeping yourself confident, go for a test.
My best wishes.
To get off from every slope, make a festival.
Then there will never be any bitterness.
Take this mantra forward.
Friends, Feb 2019 is completing forty years on the Indian Coast Guard.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has made its place among the four largest Coast Guards in the world with all its 126 ships and 62 aircraft in the country.
Last year, the people of Coast Guard had taken a major campaign to clean the coastal coast of our country along with their responsibilities and thousands of people joined it.
And very few people would know that in our country, not only men but also women are taking their responsibility in the same way.
The Coast Garden is also our female officer Pilot, Observer, and also handles the Honorcraft.
Today, when maritime security is an important topic in the world, I congratulate them on the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard in the maritime security of India.
The festival of Basant Panchmi is on 1st February.
The spring has been accepted as the best weather.
There is a queen of spring seasons.
The opportunity of learning is considered to be admiration.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the brave.
Mera Rang De Basanti Chola - this is the inspiration.
I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on the auspicious festival of this spring Panchmi.
My dear countrymen, Mother of Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani also always fills new forms with his imagination.
Immediately after the completion of my mind since last month, he has started telling me about the mind in regional languages.
He has received widespread approval.
People are writing letters from far off places.
I congratulate Akashwani for the work done by his own inspiration.
My Pyara countrymen, Namaskar. My best wishes to you all on Christmas.
Today is an opportunity to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our life.
Lord Isu said that the poor are not our gifts, we want to accept it in the Gospel of St. Luke. Lord Isu has not only served the poor but also demonstrated the service made by the poor. This is the true empowerment.
There is a story associated with it which is very popular.
It is said that Lord Isu was standing near the treasure of a temple.
Several immortals came there and they donated adult.
After that a poor widow came and he gave two copper coins in the form of donation.
If we go to see this then two copper coins are not called a very big donor .
It is very natural for the devotees present there to feel compassionate.
Then, Lord Isu said that this woman has donated the most because all others have given a lot of donations but this woman has offered her universal donations.
Today, 25th December is also the birth anniversary of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviyaji.
Malviya ji, who brought awareness of the resolve and self-confidence in the Indian masses, gave a new direction to modern education.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to launch several development works in Malviyaji's Tapabhoomi Banaras.
His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre, at BHU in Varanasi, has laid the foundation stone of land.
This Cancer Centre is being built in the entire region, not only for the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand-Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister, Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country can never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we have honoured the nation by gaining success in the field of nuclear energy.
Be it the leader of the party or the Member of Parliament, whether the Minister or the Prime Minister, Atal ji had established an idealism in every role.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for his good health.
I was fortunate to work with Atal ji as a worker.
A lot of memories with them are swimming in front of their eyes.
Today, on the day of Christmas, as a gift, the countrymen will get the benefit of two schemes.
Secondly, two new schemes are going to be launched for the countrymen.
Whether it is a village or a city, academic or academic, how cashless business runs, how to buy money without cash, the environment of jeansha is spread all around the country.
Everybody wants to learn from each other.
In order to promote this thing, two new incentives schemes are being started from today for the Government of India, for the consumers and for the smaller traders to make mobile banking stronger.
A scheme to promote consumers - Lucky Consumer Scheme and other schemes - Digidhan Business Scheme for promotion of traders.
Today, on 25th December, as a gift of Crimsum, 15,000 people will get a reward from the dro system and they will be filled with one thousand rupees in the accounts of 15 thousand people and this gift is not just a single day of today, this scheme will start from today to 100 days.
One thousand rupees per day will be awarded to 15 thousand people.
In 100 days, lakhs of families have to get a gift of crores of rupees but this reward will be entitled only when you will use mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI, USSD - this digital payment system, and on the basis of this it will be drove.
At the same time, there will be a day-long dross for such consumers, including prizes for lakhs and after three months, on 14th April, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary will be a bumper dro, which will have crores of rewards.
Digidhan Business Scheme is mainly for traders.
Businessmen themselves connect with this scheme and also connect consumers to make their business cashless.
Such traders will also be given separate rewards and these awards will be in thousands of numbers.
Businesses will also run their own businesses and will also be able to fight the rewards.
This scheme has been made by keeping every section of the society, especially the common poor and the lower middle class in the center and that is why if you buy something above Rs. 50 and buy less than Rs.
Those who buy more than Rs. 3,000 will not get the benefit of this reward.
The poorest of the poor can also buy goods through feature phones, ordinary phones and also sell goods and pay money and every person can become the beneficiaries of this scheme.
Even in rural areas, people can buy and sell through AEPS and they can also win rewards.
These 30 crore people can soon become part of this prize scheme.
I am confident that my countrymen will be interested in this system and the youth around you will definitely know about it and you will definitely understand it.
Hey, even in your family, there will be children studying in the 10th-12th standard, those people will also be able to learn this easily.
This is very simple: The way you have sent a vote-up message with mobile phones is that simple task.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know how to use technology in the country, how to do e-payment, how to do online payments, its awareness is increasing rapidly.
In the last few days, cashless trade has increased from 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to promote this.
How big is this decision, the businessmen can apply it well.
Those traders who sell digital transactions, will develop online payments instead of investment in their business, such traders have been exempt from income.
Everyone has taken this mission forward in their own way.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shriman Chandrababu Naidu, has appointed a committee, which is considering several schemes in this regard.
But I have noticed that several State Governments have also launched and implemented several such schemes in their own way.
Somebody told me that the Assam Government has decided to give 10 percent rebate on digital payment of Property Taxes and Trade Licensing Fee.
The Branch of rural banks, which will provide at least two digital transactions of 5 of their consumers in the mid-January to March, will get Rs. 50,000 in the form of reward from the government.
The Government has announced a reward of Rs. 5 lakh under the Uttam Panchayat for Digital Transction to the villages which have digital transactions by 31st March, 2019.
Under the Digital Agricultural Shiromani for the farmers, the Assam Government has decided to give a reward of Rs. 5,000 to 10 farmers, which will be fully used for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers.
I convey my best wishes to the Government of Assam and salute all the governments who have started such a best wishes.
Many institutions have also made several successful experiments to promote digital procurement among the poor farmers.
I have come to know that GNFC-Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd, which mainly works for fertilizers, is facilitating farmers, there is a thousand POS machines and 5 lakh fertilizers bags have been given to 35 thousand farmers through digital means and this work has been done in the last two weeks and it is a matter of fun that 2 percent increase in the sale of fertilizers of GNFC in comparison to last year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our lifestyle, the informal sector is very big and most of the people are paying wage money, money or payment money in cash, payments are being paid by stopping and we know that this is the reason why the labourers are exploited.
They get 80, 80, 50 and other facilities in the health sector such as insurance are deprived of them.
But now cashless payments are going on.
The money is being deposited directly in the bank.
In a way, the informal sector is changing in the formal sector, the exploitation is shutting down, the slaughter had to be shut down and it has become possible to meet the labourers, the artisans and the common man.
They are also entitled to the benefit of other benefits along with them.
Our country is the country of the youngest.
Technology is easier to us.
The countries like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have made a lot of progress from start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
With our youngsters, with new ideas, with new technologies, with new technologies, we should make this sector as strong as well as with the campaign to liberate the country from black money and corruption.
A large number of other writers have also mentioned the fact that such a good work, the work of the country's wishes, such a sacred work, however, however, however, however, new ways are being discovered for the wrongdoing.
And the third phase is that in which people have supported what is happening, but along with this fight should move forward, corruption and black money should be destroyed.
I am grateful to the countrymen that they have helped me by writing all such letters.
Shriman Gurumani has written on Mai Gov only - This step to curb black money is worthy of appreciation.
We are distressing the citizens, but we are fighting against all corruption and we are happy with the support we are supporting in this fight.
We are fighting against corruption, black money etc. like the militias, the feelings that Gorumani Kewal ji has written are emerging in the corner of the country.
We all are feeling it.
But it is also true that when people are suffering from problems, when they are suffering from problems then who is such a person who does not have pain .
I also feel the same pain as you are suffering.
But for an excellent purpose, for a higher purpose, whenever it works with a good determination, the people of the country remain intact among these problems, in the midst of sadness and pain.
In fact, these people are the forefront of change.
I also thank people for another reason that they have not only troubled but have given a remarkable answer to some people who are trying to mislead the people.
Someone has to say that there is an error, spelling on the note, somebody has said that the salt prices have increased, somebody has to spread the error, the notes of 2000 are to be canceled, the notes of 500 and 100 are to be repealed.
I also salute this strength of the people.
My dear countrymen, I am feeling obvious that whenever 1.
The blessings of the people become the blessings of God.
I thank the people of the country and salute them that people have participated in this great joy of corruption and black money.
There was also a comprehensive discussion in the Parliament for the political parties as well as for the political parties.
If the Parliament was going on, it would have been a good discussion.
The people who are spreading fools are wrong that the political parties are all discharged.
Those people who cannot support open corruption and black money, they have been searching for the government's mistakes all the time.
This government is for the people and the people.
The government is constantly trying to reflect the people.
On the other hand, I had said on the first day, on the eighth day that this fight is extraordinary.
The power of those possibilities which have been associated with black money and corruption for 70 years
Whenever I have decided to compete with such people, they also adopt new instruments to defeat the government.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of the country.
How could it be possible
I tell her mystery.
The secret is that I am getting all these information from the people.
The information received from the government system is being received from the citizens of many more respected persons and most of us are getting success due to the awareness of the common citizens.
Nobody can imagine how much the aware citizen of my country is taking the risk to open such elements .
And most of the information is being achieved.
I am confident that the government has given an email address for this thing that you can also send on those whom you want to give such precautions.
You can also send it to Mai Gov.
There is also a third group of journalists and it is also in large numbers.
He says: Modiji will not be tired, he will not stop, and the harder steps he has to be filled, but once he has taken the path, he has to reach Manzil.
I specially thank all those who write such letters because their letters also have a kind of faith and blessings.
And there is no question of returning to the blessings of millions of people for the work.
We have excluded it and made the law of multi-stakeholder Benami Property.
These laws will also work on their own in the coming days.
Our priority is to do whatever is to be done for the welfare of the people.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last month too, I had said that even among these problems, our farmers have laboured hard and have broken the cycle of last year.
This is a good sign from the point of view of agriculture.
Be it the labourer of this country, be it the farmer of this country, be it the youth of this country, the hard work of all these is bringing a new color today.
In the past, India has marked its name very proudly in many sectors on the world's economic forum.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
In the Global Financial Index 2016, we have achieved a growth of 16 places and the World Bank's Transport Efficiency Index 2016 has improved by one of the ranks.
There are several reports that have been directed towards this direction in evaluation and India is moving forward at a rapid pace.
The President, the Vice President also expressed his open monarchy.
But in such a situation sometimes it becomes a good thing and then the mind gets a lot of satisfaction.
There was an excellent work in the midst of the Hobala of Parliament that the country did not pay attention to it.
Brothers and sisters, Today I am very proud to say this thing that a legislative legislative legislative legislation related to the campaign that my government had come out with Divyang-Jan.
I also express my gratitude to all the MPs of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for this.
I express my gratitude to millions of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is committed to Divyangs.
I have also tried to make the zombesh more conscious by taking it personally.
My intention was to get the rights of the Divyangjans, to get respect, to which they are entitled.
Our efforts and beliefs were strengthened by our Divyang brothers and sisters when they won four medals in Paralmipics.
He has not only enhanced the faith of the country by his victory but has also surprised the people with his capacity.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters also have an invaluable heritage like every citizen of the country.
I am happy to note that after passing this law in the interest of Divyangjans, there will be more opportunities for jobs with Divyangjans.
For them, the limit of reservation in government jobs has been increased to 4.
The Act also provides special provisions for the prevention of education, convenience and grievances of Divyangs.
You can imagine how sensitivity the government is for the Divyangs that in the last two years, the Central Government has conducted four thousand three hundred fifty camps for Divyangjans and has distributed resources to 5 lakh 80 thousand Divyang brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs 352 crore.
The government has passed a new law in accordance with the feelings of the Nation.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, it has come to know from the field of sports that have made us proud.
It is very natural for us to be proud of being an Indian.
The Indian Cricket team has won from four to four in the opponents of England.
The work of some young sportspersons in it was worth mentioning.
Test dry Virat Kohli, along with good batting, also led a good leadership.
Indian Cricket team's off-spiner R.
ICC has declared Ashwin the best cricketer and best test cricketer of the year 2016.
I convey my best wishes to you all.
Even after fifteen years in the area of Hockey, a very good news came to light.
Our Junior Hockey team called the World Cup.
After fifteen years, this opportunity has come when the Junior Hockey team has won the World Cup.
Congratulations to young sportspersons for this achievement.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey Team.
Last month, our women sportspersons also showcased compassion.
The Indian Women's Hockey Team also won the Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days ago, the Indian Women's Hockey Team won the Kansyachandra in the Asia Cup competition for less than 18 years of age.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the sportspersons of the cricket and hockey team.
Last month we all were enjoying Diwali.
Like every year, on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border of China to celebrate Diwali with my departure.
I celebrated Diwali at the height of the Himalayas along with the soldiers of the ITBP.
Not only that, the message of good wishes sent by the countrymen was a marvellous reflection that included the security forces of the country in their happiness.
And people did not just send messages, they were associated with their minds.
Someone made a video i.e. almost every household had become a square of soldiers.
And whenever I used to see those letters, I was very surprised that how many imaginations are there, how many feelings are filled and from this, MyGov thought that a coffee table book should be made.
The work is going on.
With the contribution of all of you, the imagination of the sentiments of the soldiers of the country and the feelings that you have towards the security forces of the country will be integrated in this book.
But it didn't seem to be true.
This time it did not seem that there is a festival and I am not at home.
It seemed as if we are also celebrating Diwali with millions of Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases by 125 crore.
Just a while ago, I had come to meet all the Sarpanchs of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
And with so much love, the Sarpanchs of the villages had spoken and touched my heart.
I urged them to go and focus on the future of those children.
Today, I am happy that all the Sarpanches who had promised me from the valley of Kashmir were well aware of the promises made by me.
Just a few days ago, when the board was tested, about 95 percent of the girls and students of Kashmir participated in the board examination.
The presence of such a large number of students in the board examinations indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to laying new heights of development through education, for a bright future.
I would like to congratulate him for his enthusiasm but also convey my warm congratulations to his parents, his family members, his teachers and all the villages Sarpanchs.
Brothers and sisters, This time when I asked people to inform about Mann Ki Baat, I can say that the suggestions of all have come on one side.
Everyone used to say that talk about a number of 500 and one thousand.
However, on 8th November, while addressing the name of the nation, I had discussed the launch of a great campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision and presented it to you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is its implementation.
And I was supposed to have to face many new problems in our normal life.
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take fifty days to get out of its impact and then we can go towards the normal situation.
The diseases that we have been treating for seventy years cannot be easy to get rid of diseases.
I can understand your problems and conversations in a good way.
But when I see your support, I see your support, all the efforts are being made to embarrass you, even though sometimes the incidents that distract the mind come out, you have well understood this path of truth and have well accepted this thing of the country's interest to shut down the notes of five hundred and thousands.
And such a big country, such a large number of notes, such a huge number of notes and these decisions are being seen by the world very finely, every economist is analyzing and evaluating it.
The whole world is watching whether the countrymen of India will also get success by getting problems and problems
Perhaps there may be a question mark in the minds of the world.
India has only faith in millions of Indians. It is believed that hundreds of crores of Indians will be fulfilled by fulfilling their resolve.
And our country will emerge as gold in every way, and its cause is the citizens of this country.
The path of this success has also become possible due to you.
In the entire country, lakhs of bank employees, more than one and a half lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work day and night.
In the midst of different types of stress, all these people are working with a very calm thought to consider it a yagna of service to the nation as an attempt to make a great change.
If you start in the morning, you don't even know when the night will take place, but everyone is doing it.
And this is the reason that India will succeed in it.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank and post office are working in such a situation.
And if we talk about humanity, they look two times ahead.
Someone told me that there was an accident of an old brother in Khandav.
Suddenly there was a need for money.
It was a matter of great happiness to know about the local bank employees and I was happy to know that they had given money to their own homes, the old man so that he could help in treatment.
Such innumerable cases come out every day in TV, in media, in newspapers and in conversations.
I convey my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends who worked hard in this majesty.
The survival of energy is only when we cross the survival.
I remember that the campaign for the Bada Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was going on and the way the bank employees had picked it up on their shoulders and the work that was not done in seventy years was shown by them.
Today, once again, he has raised this challenge and I am confident that the resolve of millions of people, the collective Purushartha of all will make this nation a new power.
They are searching for ways to save their money.
It is a matter of sadness that he has also explored the way through the use of the poor.
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about redness or temptation, putting money in their accounts or doing some work with them.
I would like to say to such people today that it is your wish to amend or not to amend the law or to follow the law.
But by pleasing you should not be able to get rid of the lives of the poor.
You do not do anything so that the name of the poor comes on the record and after that when checks are done, my dear poor will get stuck due to your sins.
And there has been such a tough law of Benami asset, which is being implemented, there will be a lot of problems and the government does not want that our countrymen face any problem.
My name crosses Ashish.
I am the common citizen of Tirali village, Tirali Taluko, Harda district and Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to say many examples in Mann Ki Baat that people have welcomed this tough decision for the upliftment of their nation despite inconvenience, which will enhance the enthusiasm of the people and I am with the entire nation.
I am very happy that you have closed the notes of thousands and five hundred.
I call Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal district of Karnataka.
I would like to thank you because you had said that good days will come (Achcha Din Ayeng) but no one thought that you would make such a big decision.
Looking at the notes of five hundred and thousands, the black money and corrupt people have got a bondage.
Every citizen of India will never have a better day than this.
I would like to thank you for this.
Some things are known through media, through the medium of public, through the medium of government informs, the enthusiasm of working increases a lot.
It is so joyful that it is so proud that the common man has a unique strength in my country.
If you go to the ground and get the opportunity to pass through this road again then you must pay the money.
And people go there, jamm and after two-four days when they pass again then they pay the money.
This is the power of my country, which also has the spirit of service, sacrifice and authenticity.
I used to discuss 'Cha' in the elections and this thing was reached all over the world.
The people of many countries of the world also learnt to speak the word 'Cha on Church'.
But I didn't know that there was a marriage in 'Cha on Charcha'
I came to know that on 17th November a wedding took place in Surat, which was held with the discussion on Cha.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl gave her only tea to those who came to marriage and did not spend any other thing.
Surat's Bharat Mary and Daksha Parmar, who have contributed against corruption and against black money through their marriage, should be inspired by the contributions made by them.
When I was late at night, I was watching TV and I saw in the news that Dhekia is a small village named Juli in Assam.
There are artisans of tea gardens and they get money every week.
What did they do if they get a note of two thousand rupees
Four women of Ahosh-Padosh gathered together and bought them all around and paid a note of two thousand rupees, they did not need a small note because they bought together and decided that when we met next week, we would sit and look at the account.
People are searching for their own paths.
And also see changes.
The people of Assam's tea gardens are saying that we should apply ATM there.
See how the life of the villages is also changing.
Some people have got the immediate benefit of this campaign.
The country will get the benefit in the days to come, but some people have got the immediate benefit.
Every municipality gets a tax rate of about 50 per cent.
But this time due to this decision of eight dates, all the people ran to deposit their old notes.
In 47 urban units, about Rs. 3,500 crore has been taxed this year.
You will be surprised to know that it will also be happy that 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the same week.
Now that four times the money has come in the municipal corporation, it is natural that there will be arranging water in the poor populations, anganwadi will be arranged.
There are several such examples in which direct benefits are also seen.
Brothers and sisters, our villages and our farmers are a strong root of the economy of our country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, every citizen is ensuring himself among the problems.
Farmers have also discovered the road in the midst of difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been prioritized but still there are problems, but I am confident that even if there is any problem, if there is any problem in the farmers, if there is always a problem in natural calamities then it will also be a problem.
Small traders of our country, who also provide employment, are also increasing the economic growth.
In the last budget, we had made an important decision that even small shopkeepers of the villages, like big malls, cannot stop their business for twenty four hours, because I believed that if big malls get 24 hours then why should not the poor shopkeepers of the village get it
Large initiatives have been taken to provide loans to them through Mudra Yojana.
Millions of crores of rupees have been delivered to such small people from the Mudra Yojana because a large number of people do small businesses and pace the business of billions of rupees.
But it is natural that they will also face problems with this decision.
You also download the bank app in mobile phones.
You should also set up POS machines for credit cards, learn how you can do business without a note.
Technological roads are safe and faster.
I would like to assist you in making this campaign a success and not only this, but also lead your change and I am confident that you can lead this change.
I am confident that you can work on the basis of this technology in the business of the entire village.
I also want to tell the labour brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
There is a step on the paper and when it comes to the hands then it is different.
Sometimes a lot of money is received and sometimes sometimes it has to be given a little share and the labourers are compulsoryly making this exploit a part of life.
With this new system, we want to snatch yourself or yourself in the bank, your pay money will be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages will be followed.
Nowadays your mobile phones also work as e-packets. You can also buy money from the same mobile phones that you have to buy from the small shops of Adosh Padosh.
Therefore, I specially urge the labour brothers and sisters to be a partner in this scheme because in the end, I have taken such a big decision for the poor, the farmers, the labourers, the deprived and the victims of the country, which they should benefit from.
Today, I specially want to talk to the youth.
We say that India is such a country with 65 of the population, less than 35 years of age.
Young and youngsters of my country, I know that my decision must have been chosen by you.
I also know that you are supporting this decision.
I also know that you are contributing to this thing positively.
But friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true friend.
We have got a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother Bharati and the opportunity to take the country to an economic height.
Can you help me by my youth
I'm gonna join me, I'm not gonna stop it.
Whatever experience you are from today's world, the older generation is not the same.
Your family may not know the elder brothers and parents, kakaka-kaki, maternal uncles.
You know what the app is, you know what online banking is, you know how online ticket booking is done.
All these things are very common for you and you are also using it but today the country which wants to do the great work is our dream.
Hundreds of cashless society is not possible but can India launch a lace cash society
Once we start the 'Lace Cash Society' today, the council of cashless society will not be far away and I will see your physical help in it, you will see your time, you will see your resolve.
And I am confident that you will never disappoint me because we all want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know that today there are many opportunities for digital banking or mobile banking for cashless society.
Every bank provides online facility.
Walt means e-packet.
Many types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, millions of poor families of India have RuPay cards and after 8th, the RuPay card was used very little.
The poor have started using RuPay cards and has registered an increase of about 300 percent.
Likewise, print cards are available in mobile phones as well as print cards are available in banks.
One of the best platforms is the UPI for doing business which you can also buy money, you can get money and this work is so easy as you have sent it to the VOTSAP.
Sava will be an educated person and how to send messages to the Votsapp today.
Not only this, technology will become so easier that there is no need for any big smartphone for this work.
Every bank has also taken it and now the cost of online surcharges has also been abrogated and it has also been seen that in 2-4 days every expenditure has been abrogated so that the movement of cashless society can be strengthened.
My young friends, even after all this happens, a whole generation is such that is unaware of it.
And as much as I know, all of you are active in this great work.
As you have sent a Creative Message on WOTSAP, slogans, poems, cases, cartoons, new imaginations, and how many difficulties our youth have the creation of this creative power, it seems that this India is the specialty of the land that the song was born in the battlefield in some time, similarly today we are passing through such a big change.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I want your help in this work.
Yes, I am again saying that I want your help and I am confident that millions of youngsters of my country will do this work.
You should do one thing, you imagine that you will become a part of yourself for cashless society.
All the technologies you have to spend online on your mobile phones are available.
Not only this, what is the technology for at least 10 families taking out half an hour or two hours everyday, how to use technology, how to download their bank apps and how to spend the money in your accounts
Whether to teach shopkeepers or how to trade
You voluntarily have a campaign to bring this cashless society out of the dizziness of this note, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to get rid of black money, the campaign to free people from problems and difficulties.
Once people are using Ru-Pay cards, they will bless you if you are learning then the poor will bless you.
If the ordinary citizens learn this system then they will probably get rid of all the concerns and if all the youngsters of India are engaged in this work then I do not believe that it will take more time.
Within a month we can emerge as a new modern Hindustan in the world and you can do this through your mobile phones.
You can go to 10 households everyday and connect 10 households with it everyday.
I invite you, come, not just support, but we will be the army of this change and we will continue with change.
We will move ahead with this fight to free the country from corruption and black money and there is a wealthy country in the world where youngsters have changed the lives of the nation and believe that the change that brings to the youngsters and revolutions they do.
Kenya, she has swiftly used a mobile system, named M-PESA and today the entire business of Africa has come to Kenya.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again ask you to take this campaign forward.
I invite you to work in a collective and personal way in every school, college, university, NCC, NSS.
Let us move forward.
We have got an opportunity to do the best service of the country, which is not an opportunity to lose.
Brothers and sisters, Today is the day of the birth anniversary of a great poet of our country, Shriman Harivansh Rai Bachan ji and today Shriman Amitab Bachan ji has given a slogan for the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It must have been seen that the most popular artists of this century, Amitabhaji is taking forward the campaign of cleanliness very well.
It seems that the subject of cleanliness has spread in his nervous system and on the birth anniversary of his father, he also remembered the work of cleanliness.
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through this.
So his son, Shriman Amitabha ji, who is running a mission of cleanliness in nervous system, has sent me by using the poems of Harivansarayi ji and has written to me Swachh Tan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, Mera Achievement.
I bow down to Harivansh Rai ji.
I also thank Mr. Amitabha ji for joining Mann Ki Baat in such a way and for taking forward the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your feelings, your letters, on MYGOV, the Narendra Modi App always keeps me connected with you.
Now there is a Mann Ki Baat at 11 o'clock but soon after that we will start in regional languages too.
I am grateful to Akashwani that new initiative has been taken by those people so that even where Hindi language is not popular, my countrymen will definitely get the opportunity to connect with it.
Thank you very much.
Those who see from afar feel like the name of the Indian Janjeevan Festival is another, and it is also natural.
The festivals that have been held in India from Vedas till date have been festivals that have brought about a time-bound change.
We have seen the courage to finish the tradition of festivals outside of time and changes in time and society's demand festivals have also been easily accepted.
And it is through this festival.
All these things have been covered by our ancestors in a very scientific manner.
This whole world discusses the environment and is a matter of natural destruction.
The festival of India is going to strengthen the nature love, from the child to every individual.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, birds have been the festival of responsibilities for everyone.
Nowadays, we keep a holiday on Sunday, but those older generations, workers, fishermen etc...
That is why we have developed the tradition of keeping the vacancies and sciences connected there.
Today, whenever we celebrate the festival of Diwali, every festival of I have said is an educational festival.
One thing we all know well, go to any corner of India, come from Amir to Amir's house, go to the hut of the poorest of the poor, go to the hut of the poor, in the festivals of Diwali, in every family the campaign of cleanliness is visible.
The corner of the house is cleaned.
But the need of the hour is that not only cleaning our houses but also cleaning the entire complex, cleaning the entire district, cleaning the entire village.
We have to expand our nature and tradition.
The festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated and celebrated in some form in all the countries of the world.
Many governments of the world, Parliament and the rulers of the world have also started becoming a part of the festival of Deepawali.
Whether it is east or west, whether it is a developing country or a developing country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, the smoke of Diwali is visible.
You will be aware that the US postal service of the United States has also released the postal stamp of Deepawali this time.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared Diu on his Tasvir Twitter on the occasion of Diwali.
On the occasion of Diwali in London, the UK Prime Minister organised the Satkar Samvat, which connected all the societies, he himself took care of it and perhaps the U.
And what is Tasvir
The 16 women MPs of Singapore are standing outside the Parliament wearing Indian sads and this photo has been viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
The festival of Diwali is being celebrated in every street of Singapore.
The Prime Minister of Australia has extended his greetings to the Indian community on the occasion of Diwali in various cities of Australia.
Recently, the Prime Minister of New ealand came.
He said that I have to return soon for this reason that I have to attend the Diwali celebrations. I mean to say that Deepawali, the festival of this light is becoming a festival of inspiration for bringing the world community from darkness to light.
Besides good clothes, good food, etc. on the festival of Diwali, there is also a lot of fatness.
And the children, the youth are very happy.
Sometimes it does not take care of what is lying around .
In the days of Diwali, news of accidents, fire news and mortality causes heavy concerns.
And it becomes a matter of fact that in the days of Diwali, doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers.
The festival of Diwali runs very long in our country.
It's not just a day.
Say Govardhan Puja, say brothers, say beneficiary, and take it to the light of Kartiki Purnima, in a way it continues for a long time.
At the same time, we also celebrate the festival of Diwali and prepare for Chhath Puja.
The festival of Chhath Puja is a very big festival in the eastern parts of India.
But its specialty is that it provides a lot of messages to the society.
But it is said that brothers, people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath Puja is such a festival in which the sun is also worshipped .
There is a great social message in this festival...
I would like to talk about the festival of Deepawali or talk of Chhath Puja. This time I would like to convey my best wishes to you.
But there is also a special time for me.
I am particularly grateful to the countrymen, thank you.
In the events that have been taking shape for the past few months, our army is losing its own collection for our consciousness.
My future, the sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the Armed Forces on the world continues to be covered.
And one of these things was realised that these Deepawan Defence Forces should be dedicated to them.
I invited the countrymen for a campaign called Message to Soulgers.
But today I would like to bow down to my head and say that there is no such human being in India that in the day of which there is no unprecedented love for the soldiers of the country, the way it has been expressed, it will give strength to every countrymen.
We cannot imagine the destiny of the security forces as a message of one of you has emerged as a message.
Whether it is a school, college, a student, a village, a poor, a businessman, a shopkeeper, a sportsperson, a sportsperson or a cinematographer, it would have been fortunate to have saved anyone who has not given a message to the people of the country, the media has also changed the opportunity to express his gratitude to the army.
Whether it is BSF, CRPF, Indo-Tibetum Police, Assam Rifles, Air Force, Coast Guard, I cannot mention the names of all, how many types of troubles do we visit
I can imagine how proud is this moment for my countrymen
There have been so many acts on the message to Soulgers Heshtag, in a symbolic way or what to talk
I would like to read that Shri Ashwini Kumar Chauhan has sent a poem.
Such sister Shivani has sent me a telephone message. What do we say to the Fauji family
The Prime Minister of Namaskar, I speak the fascination of Shiva.
Our armed brothers are getting a lot of encouragement from the message to solvers campaign that has been launched by Diwali.
I belong to a mighty family.
My husband is also an officer of Laxkar.
My father and father-in-law have been an officer of Laxkar.
So we are full of going to the entire family.
I want to say that along with the military officers and soldiers, their families and their wives also give such a good sacrifice.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers are not only on the border but also on every frontier of life.
Whether it is a natural disaster, sometimes a crisis of law, sometimes a mobilization of enemies, sometimes it is necessary to showcase courage to return to the youngsters who are walking on the wrong path, every round of our youth works inspired by nationalism.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was free from open defecation free.
Now Himachal has also been formed and Kerala is also going to be formed on the first November.
But how can this success be seen
Now it was our ITBP jawans who had gone to the village on their own duty.
So perhaps the village had to meet the Gram Sabha at that time and it was being discussed in the Gram Sabha, and the toilets were being constructed.
It was found that some families could not make toilets due to lack of money.
This clan should be forgotten and look at their patriotism, it is not that he used to serve the country only after leaving the bullets on the enemies.
He said that the five households which have not been made toilets, give them one thousand rupees to every family, make 5 toilets and make the villages of all of us free from open trees.
I am really grateful to the youth.
I was noted that there is no way in the far-flung forests of Kerala, wherever there is no road, when the entire day walks on foot then that village can be reached with difficulty.
It is difficult to reach the tribal Panchayat Idmalakudi there, that is why the students of engineering in the nearby urban areas were noticed that toilets are being constructed in this village.
The students of NCC, the youth of NSS, the engineering, together decided that we will build toilets.
The goods that were to be taken to build toilets, bricks, cements and all the goods that were to be taken up by these youngsters and walked on their feet throughout the day.
He worked hard and made toilets in the village and these youngsters freed a small village in the remote forest.
This is the reason why Kerala is getting ODF.
Gujarat has also declared all municipalities - municipalities, perhaps more than 150 open defecation free.
10 districts have also been declared free from open trees.
Haryana is also going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on November 1 and he has decided that in a few months, the entire state will be ODF.
So far, he has completed seven districts.
Work is going on in all the states.
I have mentioned some.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the citizens of all these states for connecting with this great work and contributing to the work of eliminating dirty blindness from the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of schemes in the government and after the first scheme, if there is another good scheme then the first scheme has to be left.
But usually there is no focus on these things.
Old plans are also going on and new schemes are also going on and waiting for the coming plans is also being seen.
This is going on.
There is no need for kerosene in the houses that have gas in our country, which have electricity in the houses.
I have heard that seven or eight districts have been freed from kerosene in the present time.
I am confident that the entire state will soon become kerosene free.
And the convenience of the people will also increase, yes, there will be difficulty, there will be problems for the intermediaries, there will be problems for the unmanned.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Everything of them should be, how should the country go
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you make a scheme then first of all remember the poor and weak faces and then decide whether the poor people will benefit from what you are going to do or not
You decide on the basis of this criteria.
The need of the hour is that we now have to satisfy the hopes of the poor of the country.
To get rid of difficulties, we will have to take one step after another.
Whatever our ancient thinking is, the society must be freed from the distinction of the daughter-in-law.
Be it the 21st century and the darkness of the village cannot move now.
And that is why the great campaign to provide electricity to the villages is successfully moving forward to free the villages from darkness.
Time is moving forward in limits.
After so many years of independence, what will happen to the health of the poor mothers and the smoke of 4000 cigarettes in a day after cooking the kitchen on the wooden powder
These five crore families are moving ahead with success to provide smoke-free life.
Small traders, small businessmen, vegetable sellers, milky shopkeepers, royal shopkeepers used to be stuck in the midst of the interests of the royals.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow 31st October, the great man of this country is the unity of India who made the mantra of his life and showed him alive.
On the one hand October 31 is the festival of Sardar Saheb's Jayanti, the life-style of the unity of the country.
On the other hand, there is also the death anniversary of Smt.
We should not only remember the sacred memories of the great men.
However, the phones of a brother of Punjab, his pain and touched me too. I am speaking Jasdeep, the Prime Minister said.
From Punjab, sir, you know that on the 31st, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel is.
Sardar Patel is such a legend who spent his entire life in connecting the country and I feel that he had succeeded and brought everyone together.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a person.
A Sardar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, history is a witness to the fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did the work of uniting the country after Chanakya.
The successful effort to bring the freedom fighters down to a flag, the great work that was done by such a big devotional work, salute the great man.
But it is also a pain that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, shouted for unity, because of his priorities, because of his priorities, he was also a victim of many kingdoms but never left the path of unity.
On the birth anniversary of that great man who lives for unity, and on the birth anniversary of Sardar, he added.
But in the midst of this crisis, we have to move forward with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the power of that country.
Be it many languages, varieties, dresses, eating and drinking, but unity in diversity is the power of India.
The root of unity is the strong foundation of the best India.
The journey of Sardar Saheb started with the struggle for the farmers.
He was the son of the farmer.
Sometimes many of us listen to the name of Amul.
Today, people are also aware of every production of Amul, outside India and India.
But very few people might know that it was Sardar Saheb's divine vision, who imagined the cooperative milk producer Sangh.
And Kheda district, which was called Kera district at that time, and in 1942, he stressed the idea.
We have a living example of how Sardar Saheb had constructed the sand for the farmers of todays Amul.
I pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
And on this unity day, on 31st October, let us remember Sardar Saheb, resolve unity.
My dear countrymen, in this series of festivals of Diwali, there is also a festival of Kartiki Purnima (Devdivalina) Prakash Festival.
Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings are guiding not only for the entire humanity, but also for the entire humanity.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
This was the original mantra of peace, unity and harmony.
Whenever we were at the top of the distortion of hiding, sex, sex, high and low, Guru Nanak Dev chose brother Laloo as his colleague.
Come on, if we have to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', then Guru Nanak Dev could be the best guide of ours.
I salute Guru Nanak Dev whenever this light festival of his birth anniversary is coming.
My dear countrymen, once again the name of this Diwali to the soldiers of the country.
Thank you very much.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat Programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, all of you namasmaskara, all of you prior to a few days ago, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri area of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all those brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
It was sufficient to destroy the entire country.
There is also sorrow and anger in the country and it is not only for those families who lost their daughters, lost their brothers, lost their husbands and lost their husbands.
My dear countrymen, we believe in our army.
We are proud of our army.
We have many opportunities to speak to our citizens and politicians.
But the army doesn't speak, the army shows the parameters.
Today, I would like to interact with the citizens of Kashmir as well.
Citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the opponents of the country.
And as soon as they have started understanding the true reality, they have emerged on the path of peace by dragging such elements from themselves.
Every parents want to work as soon as they become schools and colleges, the farmers are also feeling that their crops, fruits etc. have been prepared to reach the markets across India.
Economic activity also runs well.
And for the last few days, the work has started well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path of our progress and the path of our development.
We have to reach new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem, we will find the way out and also push the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of that rule.
Governance has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
And we will fully follow it.
Sometimes people who think about the ideas that we think also present innovative ideas.
I have the opportunity to know a lot in the social media recently.
From every corner of India, there is an opportunity to know, understand the feelings of every kind of people and it strengthens the strength of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harsh Vardhan of the 11th grade gave a different idea to me.
He wrote, I was very distracted after the Uri terrorist attack.
But the way to do something is not swelling and what can be done by a small student like me
Out of these, I thought that how should I work for the welfare of the country
And I promised that I will study an extra 3 hours daily.
We will become the best citizen to work for the country.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, it is a matter of joy for me that in this environment of anger, at such a young age, you can think healthyly.
But Harsh Vardhan, I will also say that the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country is a huge value.
This is a symbol of the nations consciousness.
But you might know that when the 1965 war took place, the Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was leading us and it was such a spirit of anger and patriotism all over the country.
Everyone wanted something, something, something and something to do something.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastriji had made a strong effort to touch this feeling of the country in a very best way.
And he inspired the people of the country to work for the nation by giving the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
Another path of expressing patriotism among the voices of Bomb and Bunduk is for every citizen was shown by Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
When Mahatma Gandhi was also campaigning for freedom, whenever the movement was on its rapid pace and whenever there was a need for a stability in the movement, he used to do very successful experiments to turn the rapidity of the movement towards constructive works in the society.
If all of us, the army takes their responsibility, the people sitting in the house, and if we make a constructive contribution to the feelings of the countrymen, every citizen, the feeling of patriotism, then our country will certainly rise to new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T.
Kartike has written to me on the Narendra Modi App that the sportspersons who had gone to Paralympics have created history and showcasing them is a victory of human spirit.
Shri Varun Vishwanath has also written on the Narendra Modi App that our sportspersons have done very well and you should mention this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only this, every person of the country has got an emotional connectivity to our sportspersons of Paralympics.
Perhaps by moving ahead from sports, the vision of humanity, our vision towards the Divyangs has completely changed.
There is a great strength in this momentum.
This time, in Paralympics, one players including 3 women from our country participated.
In comparison to other sportspersons, whenever Divyangs are playing, there is a greater thing than physical capabilities, sports skills.
Bhai Devendra Jhajria Bhalafank, who won the gold medal, won the gold medal for the second time and also won it again after 12 years.
The age increases in 12 years and once the winner wins, the enthusiasm also decreases.
However, Devendra pointed out that the condition of the body or the increase in age could never weaken his resolve and he brought the golden hub again after 12 years.
And they were not disabled from birth.
He had to open his own hand because of the electric bitterness.
You think that the man who achieves the first gold medal at the age of 23 and gets the second gold medal at the age of 35, how big he has done in his life.
Mariyappan Thangavela won a gold medal in a high jump.
And Thangavelu lost his left leg at the age of only 5.
Poverty also did not come under their synergy.
They are neither living in big cities nor from the middle class Amir family.
Despite passing through the life of difficulty at the age of 21, he also gave medals to the country with determination among physical problems.
With the name of Deepa Malik of the sportsperson, the pride of blossoming many victories has been added.
Varun C.
Bhati won a bronze medal in high length.
These medals of Paralympics are not only great but in our country, in our society, in our diversity, these medals have done a lot to look at our Divyang brothers and sisters.
Our condolences are not only awakened, but our vision of looking towards this Divyangjan has also changed.
Very few people would be aware of how these Divyangjans have performed in this time's paralympics.
A few days ago, there was an Olympics competition.
This time it was built.
The 1500 metres of the competition of Olympics was created by Abdeltif Baka of Algiria to break the Vikram for the Golden Championship of Olympics for a period of 1500 metres for Divyangs and set up a new Vikram for a short time.
Not only this, I am surprised that the fourth among the Divyangjans, who did not get any medal in the competitorship of the competitor, but it also ran in a short span of time than the winners of the ordinary runners.
Once again I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward towards creating a Sucharu scheme for Paralympics as well as for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a lot of wonderful experience in Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
A mega camp of the Government of India was organised for Divyangjans and that was established a lot of worldwide programmes.
On that day, I also got the opportunity to dedicate a book and collected the successful stories of some Divyangjans in the book.
There was a lot of inspirational events.
The World Record on the land of India and Navsari, which I consider to be important.
It was successfully used to put the machines in the ears to listen to six hundred Divyangjans who could not hear it within eight hours.
It was replaced in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for all of us to establish three-three world Vikrams by Divyangs in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Poojay Bapu on October 2.
And on that day I had said that cleanliness should be our nature and it should be the duty of every citizen.
Whenever 2 years are taking place on October 2, I can assure you that the awareness of cleanliness has increased in the hearts of millions of people in the country.
And I said that one step towards cleanliness and today we can all say that everybody has tried to move forward one step.
That is, the country has moved towards cleanliness by millions of steps.
It has also been decided that the direction is true.
Its fruits are very good and what happens with some such efforts has also been seen.
Be it the bus station, railways, school or colleges, religious places, hospitals, hospitals, vegetables, children to the elderly, villages, poor, farmers, women are contributing something towards cleanliness.
Media friends have also played a positive geography.
In fact, we have to go a long way.
For health, for the honour of the citizens, especially for the honour of mothers and sisters, the tune of open trees should be closed.
The entire success in the near future will be achieved in the direction of liberation from the habit of flooding in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala.
Recently, when I went to Gujarat, the officials told me that Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will achieve the goal of ODF completely on October 2nd.
I want to introduce a scheme for the young friends, especially those who use technologies today.
Everyone has the right to know what is the situation in your city of Swachhta Abhiyan and that is why the Government of India has given a telephone number- 16.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1986.
It will not only be able to know the situation of construction of toilets in your city by calling on these 16 numbers but will also be able to evacuate toilets.
You must take advantage of it.
Not only this, a Cleanliness App has been launched to know the situation of cleanliness related complaints and redressal of grievances.
The Government of India has also called upon the corporate world to come forward.
They can be sent to the districts as a Swachh Bharat Fellows.
This Swachhta Abhiyan will not be a matter of fact even if it is limited to Sanskrit alone.
Cleanliness is not enough.
These waste fertilizers are being made and for this, the government has also started with policy duration.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the Compost-Centrial Fertilizers from the waste.
And the farmers who want to go to livelihood should reach this surplus.
Those people who want to improve the health of their land, worry about the health of the earth, they want to prevent such damages due to chemical fertilizers, if such fertilizers are required in a small amount then companies will give them such assurances.
And Shriman Amitab Bachan ji is contributing a lot in this work as a brand ambassador.
I also invite the youngsters to create new start-ups from West to Wealth to Kanchan Jhumbesh and develop such technologies and work in cheaper production.
This year, a special programme- Indosan-India Swachhta Parishad is also being held from 25th September to 2nd October.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors, Commissioners from all over the country, all of them together are merely making a deep thought on cleanliness.
What can happen in technology
What can be the economic structure
How to do public participation
How to increase employment opportunities in this
All the topics are to be discussed.
And I am seeing that there is a lot of innovation about cleanliness.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that students from Gujarat Technology University have launched a campaign to build toilets in 10 villages.
He himself worked and contributed to constructing about thousand toilets.
A few days ago, you must have seen that under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh, a team has swimmed and gave a message of cleanliness from Devprayag to Gangasagar.
The Government of India has also made a calendar time sheet of one year in its respective departments.
Every department will focus on cleanliness in a special way for 15 days.
The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayati Raj and Department of Rural Development (DoRD) will work together in the coming month from October 17 to 15th.
And during the last two weeks of October 16th October to 31st October, the three other departments of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs, will run the sanitation drive where these three departments are connected with them for 15 days.
It must have been seen that the survey of Swachhta is also going on.
First of all, the report of the situation of sanitation by serving 3 cities was presented to the people of the country.
Now there are 5000 cities in the country with more than one lakh population and there is a belief in every city that we have left behind, but the next time we will do something better.
Cleanliness has become an environment of competition.
I hope that all of us can contribute to this campaign.
The next October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is going on for two years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali, I continue to urge you to buy something of Khadi.
This time also I urge that there should be some or the other thing of Khadi in every family so that the lamp of Diwali can be lighted in the house of the poor.
On October 2, when it is Sunday, what can we connect with ourselves in the work of cleanliness
If you have a video then send a video.
If our efforts in the entire country will once again get a new strength and will get a new momentum.
Remembering the sacred memories of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
And I have seen that in the past, whenever I have said to leave gas subsidy and the people of the country have given a pledge, it is a very inspiring event of Indias national life itself.
Whenever I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the shells and the old sports that the families used to donate and the memorials they used to beat up the angles of the poor areas.
The wonderful joy that the poor kids were enjoyed by watching the pella memorials was like that.
Millions of workers like me who have been working with the political thinking, the work of defining the political thinking, the participants of the politics associated with the roots of India, with an attempt to reward the cultural heritage of India, who have given a political philosophy, the soul-manufactured philosophy, the centenary year of Pandit Deendayal ji is starting today.
Sarvajan Hitay - Sarvajan is the principle of Sukhya Antyodaya.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the well-being of the person of Ankwada.
How to get the fruits of development to the poorest of the poor
They gave the entire economic agenda to every hand, to every farm, to every field in two words.
The country will be concentrated on their birth centenary year as a poor welfare year, the governments of the society and the governments of the society will get the benefits of development to the poor only then we can free the country from poverty.
As part of this, the Prime Minister's residence and the road that was known by the name of the Rescurers Road of the modern British has been named as Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya on the birth centenary year.
This is a symbolic form of the poor welfare year of the century.
My dear countrymen, the two years ago I started Mann Ki Baat on the day of Vijayadashmi.
In this, I have been making a sincere endeavour that Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to diversify those government works.
How is the human being of this country inspiring me
What is the aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Shrotaj for the way Mann Ki Baat was amended and the way he blessed him.
I am also grateful to Akashwani, who has not only spread these things but also made efforts to bring it to all languages.
I am also grateful to those countrymen who wrote letters after Mann Ki Baat, suggested the government's window. Akashwani made a special programme on these letters and provided a platform for the solution of problems.
That is why Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20 minute dialogue but also a new opportunity for social transformation.
For anybody who can cause more satisfaction than this .
My dear countrymen, the festivals of Navratri and Durga Puja in the coming week, the festival of Vijayadashmi and the preparation of Diwali in a way a different kind of environment takes place throughout the country.
It is a festival of efficient worship and the unity of the society is the country's potential.
Then how should it be the Navratri or the Durga Puja be the festival of the worship of the Shakti and the worship of the unity of the society be celebrated
How to make a festival connecting humans and humans .
And we can celebrate the festival of victory by merging together when it becomes the means of true capability.
Come, take the means of efficiency and take the mantra of unity.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat Programme on Akashwani on August 28, 2016
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, Yesterday is the birth anniversary of Hockey's Jagyagar Dhyanchand Ji.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay homage to Dhyan Chand ji and on this occasion I also want to remind you all of them of their contribution.
He played an important role in giving hockey gold medal to India in the 128th, 132th, the 1936 Olympics.
We also know the name of all the cricket lovers, breadmen.
He said for Dhyanchand ji, the High Scorse Goal Like Runs, Dhyan Chand ji Sportsmen Spirit and a living example of patriotism.
Once during the match in Kolkata, a opposition team played a hockey on the head of Dhyan Chand ji.
There were only 10 minutes left for the end of the match at that time.
And Dhyanchand ji had made three goals in ten minutes and said that I have turned the revenge of injury.
But I saw that this time, everybody urged me to talk about Rio Olympics.
I see it positive for the common man to put such a thing towards the Rio Olympics, so much awareness and pressure on the elderly Prime Minister of the country.
Besides the cricket, there is so much love for the citizens of India and sports, so much awareness and so much knowledge.
For me, reading this message has also become a cause of great inspiration in itself.
A Shriman Ajit Singh has written on the Narendra Modi App. Please speak to the girls in Mann Ki Baat on their participation in education and sports because they have made the country proud of winning a medal in Rio Olympics.
A Shriman Secretary writes that you are urging you to mention Sindhu, Sahabhi and Deepa Karmakar in Mann Ki Baat this time.
These girls gave medals to us.
Our daughters have once again proved that they do not descend from anyone in any way.
If one of these daughters is from North India then one is from South India then one is from East India.
So there is no one from any other corner of India.
It seems as if the girls of the whole of India have glorified the name of the nation.
Summit Thakur has written on May Gov that we could perform better in the Olympics.
He has written, Honourable Modi Sir, first of all congratulated us for winning two medals in Rio, but I want to draw your attention to the fact that was our exhibition really good
And there is no answer.
We need to cut a lot of distances in sports.
Our parents are still asking to pay attention to the learning.
Even today, sports is considered to be a hurricane of time.
We need to change this idea.
The society needs inspiration.
Thousands of people have expressed this feeling in this way.
No one can deny that we cannot exhibit our hope in accordance with our hope.
It also happened that the exhibitions that our sportspersons were performing in India could not reach there.
And only two medals can be found in the course of the medal.
But it is also true that even if you look at medals, then for the first time in many sports, Indian sportspersons have shown a lot of skills.
But why can we forget that it is the first Indian girl to qualify for the Olympics and for the Olympic Final
This is what happened in Tennis with the links of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopana.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babare convoluted the track field final.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, the women's hockey team reached the Olympics.
The sportspersons of India will definitely be good for us.
Many sportspersons like Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhoknal, Atanu Das are many names.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we continue to do what we have done then we will be restless again.
I have announced a committee.
We will make a map of how we can do better.
He thinks that Raj may choose one of his two sports and plan how he can perform excellently in it.
I also urge the Federation-Sociations associated with the sports that they should also be neutralized.
And I also urge every citizen of India to send me a suggestion on the Narendra Modi App, whichever is interested in it.
Write to the government.
The association will discuss and give its address to the government.
The State Governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
But we are fully prepared and I am confident that we have to move forward with the resolve to achieve a better situation in the world of sports, out of which 65 per cent of our countrymen are young.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, there is a Teachers Day.
I have been spending a long time with the students on Teachers Day for many years.
But for this time I had to go to the G-20 Summit and I had to say that today I would express my feelings in the matter of mind.
The place of the mother in life is the same as the teacher and we have also seen teachers who are more concerned with their students than themselves.
They dedicate their lives to their disciples, to their students.
Nowadays, after the Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichandra ji is being discussed.
He is a sportsperson but he has presented an excellent example of what is a good teacher.
Today, I am seeing Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher besides a player.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji for his penance, his dedication to sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
The contribution of teachers in our friends' life is always felt.
Former President of India, Dr.
Sarvapalli is the birthday of Radhakrishnan ji and the country considers it as a teacher day.
He might have reached anywhere in his life but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only that, he always used to say that good teachers are those in whom the students never die.
Despite being the President's post, keep the inner students alive as a teacher and a teacher's mind - such a wonderful life, Dr. Radhakrishna ji lived and showed life.
I think that I remember a lot of things from my teachers because they were our heroes in our village.
But today I can say with joy that even today, a teacher of my age has come to me at the age of 70, his letter comes to me every month.
Because of this, if I see any good letters then I feel very respectful in my mind.
It is the responsibility of all of us to enhance the pride of our teachers in society.
You must present your photographs with your teachers on the Narendra Modi App, if there is any inspirational thing with your teachers.
See, it is also very valuable to see the contribution of teachers in the country with the eyes of the students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival will be held in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a scholar and we all want that the life of our country, our society, our family and every person remains innocent.
But whenever we talk about the Ganesh festival, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh Festival is a gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Now not only Maharashtra but also in every corner of India, the public Ganesh Festival has started taking place.
Organisations compete and colour competitions.
In the exhibition they have, they also enhance the issue of touching the society very artistically.
This big campaign of public education is run by the public Ganesh festival.
Surajya is our right to be born, we should now move towards the state, the state should be our priority - can we not give a message through the public Ganesh festival
Come on, I invite you for this.
It is true that festivals are likely to be of the society.
This time many people have sent me a lot of writing in Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
Why should not you use the idol of Ganeshji made of soil of the lake of the village
The statues made of POP are not incomplete for the environment.
Safety of the environment, protecting our rivers and rivers, protecting the small animals of this water from pollution. This is also God service.
Ganesh ji is a legislative man.
We cannot create such a legislation that produces a legislation.
I don't know how you will take these things, but I don't just say this thing, many people say and I have heard about many people - one idolist is Shriman Abhijit Dhondfale.
An unprecedented Ganesha Festival of Environment - this is also a work of service to a society.
Durga Puja has more time.
Let us just decide that the old family that makes the statues.
If I buy the idol from them then they will also get employment and these idols will be made from the soil of the pond or the river then they will get to it again.
My best wishes to you all on the occasion of Ganeshotsav.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Madhur Teresa will be divided by Saint Upadi on 4th September.
Madhur Teresa dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor in India.
It is natural to be proud of all the Indians who have served the poor people of India whenever they have received the satisfaction of the saint.
In the event that will be held on September 4, the Government of India will also send an official delegation under the leadership of our Foreign Prime Minister Sushma Swaraj.
From the saints, from the sages, from the great men, every moment we have to learn something.
Let us continue to achieve something, keep learning and keep doing something better.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then how big change comes.
Janash Kit is considered to be the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the people with the help of five State Governments, for clean Ganga, for clean Ganga and for cleaning the Ganga.
On 20th of this month, the Sarpanches of the village on the banks of the Ganges were invited to Allahabad.
The village does not allow the river Ganga to become dirty and no one came from Uttarakhand for this resolve.
Somebody came from Uttar Pradesh, somebody from Bihar, somebody from Jharkhand, somebody from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India who have fulfilled this imagination. I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states who have joined the people and took an important step in cleaning the Ganges.
My dear countrymen, some things touch me sometimes and those who imagine they also have a special respect in my mind.
On July 15, more than seventy-seven school students collectively wrote a letter to their parents in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh.
Children from seven to seven years of age have done this work.
Congratulations to the students who have made this effort, and special congratulations to the parents who decided to take their children's letter seriously and make toilets.
There are similar things that inspire us.
A sixty-year-old girl Mallamma in Koppal district of Karnataka respected Satyagraha against her family.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become a pledge.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
But everybody is associated with it in some form and everybody is contributing to it.
Everyday news comes about how new efforts are being made.
There has been an idea in the Government of India and has urged the people to make a film of two minutes, three minutes on cleanliness and send this short film to the Government of India.
You will get details on the website.
It will be contested and awarded on 2nd October on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti.
I also say to the channels that you should also compete for such films.
The creativity and creativity can also give a strength to the Swachhta Abhiyan.
New methods will be found, new inspiration will be found and all this will be done by ordinary artists with the participation of the people.
It is not necessary that there should be big studio, good cameras to make films.
A very important thing happened in the past.
Our Honble President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new programme in Kolkata - Akashwani Maitri Channel - will some people now have to inaugurate a radio channel
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
On the other hand, Akashwani Maitri and on the other hand, they will share their commodities and the Bangladeshi people on both sides will enjoy Akashwani.
I also thank Bangladesh that they joined us for this work.
I also congratulate the friends of Akashwani that they are contributing to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, even if you have given me the work of the Prime Minister, then I also believe that it is like you.
And sometimes incidents of emotions touch me a little more.
Such emotional events also provide new energy and also provide new inspiration and this is what inspires the people of Barat to do something.
In the past, I got a letter that touched my mind.
This letter was written to me by a mother who is a retired teacher of about 84 years.
If he had never refused to declare his name in this letter then today I would have spoken to his name.
In the letter, he wrote that whenever you had requested to leave gas subsidy, I had left the subsidy and then I had forgotten.
My countrymen, you must have known that I have tried to send a letter to the people who have left the gas subsidy and some of my representatives should go to the room and write a letter.
I am trying to write a letter to more than one crore people.
He wrote a letter to me that you are doing a good job and the campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of smoke is better and I am a retired teacher.
The question is not about fifty thousand rupees but it is the feeling of the mother and the blessings of such Kotikoti mothers and sisters who have faith and strength for the future of my country.
I salute that mother and also salute the Kotikoti mothers of India who always wishes someone to suffer from themselves.
My dear countrymen, last year we were suffering from drought but this month was constantly filled with floods.
Some parts of the country flooded.
The state governments could do as much as the central government, the local bodies, the social institutions and the citizens could.
However, there were also reports in the midst of the floods that needed to be more remembered.
This year will be remembered for the month of August for what is the power of unity, if we walk together and how big results can be achieved.
In August 2016, many parties from all over the country, all these political parties, together passed the GST bill.
Similarly, whatever happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country talked about Kashmir in the same voice.
If you have to say this in the least words, I will say that unity and momta - these two things have been in the original mantra, and all of us believe that there are hundreds of crores of people from the Sarpanch of the village to the elder Prime Minister that if anybody dies in Kashmir, then it is a young man or any security worker, it is ours, it is our people who are trying to create peace in Kashmir, sometimes they will have to answer the defected children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to make a nation full of diverse diversity binding into the binding of unity, that we can make a bright future.
My residents believe in the possibilities of crores of people.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Today morning, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the youth of Delhi and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports will make every young man enthusiastic.
We all know that in a few days the world's largest sports festival is going to be held.
The word Rio will be repeated in our ears.
The whole world will be playing.
Every country in the world would have kept an eye on the exhibition of its sportspersons.
Our hopes and aspirations are very much but those who have gone to play in Rio are the work of increasing the enthusiasm of the sportspersons.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a Honey Broadcasting Run for Rio, Khelo and Jio, Khelo and Khilo.
In the days to come, wherever we are, let us take care of our sportspersons for the promotion.
The food habits are so fond, but everything has to be left.
Even if sweet sleep comes in the winter, one has to leave the bed and participate in the field and not only player but also his parents.
Sportspersons don't make night and night.
I am also ready to do this work on your behalf.
To deliver your messages to these sportspersons, the country is ready to become the leading Prime Minister of the country.
Come, let us all take as much as we can glorify each other in the days to come, we can enhance their efforts.
And today when I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poem lover Punjab Central University student Surya Prakash Upadhyay has sent a poem.
There may be many other poets who have sent poems, maybe write poems, maybe some will also make it a voice.
Everyday technology keeps changing, taking new forms everyday, creates new effects everyday, it keeps changing.
You can't catch technology.
If there is no research and innovation, then the way water is spreading dirt, technology also becomes powerful.
And if we are living without research and innovation, then we will become out of the world's changing times and that is why in the new generation, we will have to enhance the spirit of research and innovation towards science.
The Atal Innovation Mission is being promoted by NITI Aayog.
One goal is to create an eco-system through the Atal Innovation Mission, innovation, experiment, enterprise, this sequence is going on and thereby enhancing employment opportunities.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre (Centre of Discussion) has a direct relationship with innovation.
And if I talk of Atal Incubation Centre then the government is thinking about providing a huge amount of Rs.
Similarly, India is facing many problems.
We have problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find solutions through technology.
And through the Atal Grand Challenge, the younger generation of the country has called upon you to find, research, innovation and bring solutions with the help of technology.
Government of India seeks to promote special awards to the technologies discovered for solving our problems.
And I am happy to note that when we talked about the tincture lab, about thirty thousand schools have requested and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand institutions have come forward for the Incubation Centre.
I am confident that Abdul Kalam ji will work as a new generation to solve the problems of our daily life and technology for ease of getting rid of our problems.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were worrying about the misery and now the joy of rain is also coming and the news of the flood is also coming.
The State Government and the Central Government are making a lot of effort to help the flood victims together.
Even though there are some problems due to rains, every human mind becomes compassionate because the centre of our entire economic activity is in the rainy season.
Sometimes such a disease also arises that we have a presidency throughout our life.
But if we are aware, be cautious and striving then the way to escape from it is also very easy.
Take Dengue alone.
Dengue can be saved.
Keep in mind a bit of cleanliness, be cautious and be safe, pay special attention to the children and such a disease occurs in the poor population.
Dengue comes first in the happy prosperous areas and therefore we can understand it.
You will be able to see the news on TV but sometimes we are very sad to take care of it.
The government, the hospital, the doctor - he will not only do his work but also we will not enter our households, our households, our family and I will be careful about the disease caused by water.
On the other hand, I would like to take care of you, my dear countrymen.
Life has become so busy and has become so busy that there is no time for us to think about it.
If you have become sick then you feel that you get alright soon and we take any antibiotic substance to the body.
But the bacteria that are in it are used by these medicines and then medicines prove to be useless for these bacteria and then it goes to years in fighting with these bacteria, making new medicines, scientific discovery etc. and till then these diseases produce new problems.
The bacteria that spread tuberculosis and malaria are bringing about such a change in itself that medicines do not have any effect on it .
In medical language, it is called antibiotic ratiologists and hence it is necessary to comply with the rules for use of antibiotics.
When the matter of health is coming out, I want to raise one more thing.
However, in the last decade, the rate of maternal mortality has decreased, but even today, a large number of pregnant mothers cannot be saved.
During pregnancy or after the deficiency of blood , infection related to childbirth , high BP , no one knows any problem .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign for the last few months.
Under the 'Vadapradhan Safe Maternity Abhiyan', the Government Health Centres of all pregnant women will be tested free of cost on 9th of every month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not give twelve days a year for this work for the poor
In the last few days, I have written a lot of letters.
Thousands of doctors have taken forward my point of view.
But India is such a big country that lakhs of doctors should be added to this campaign.
I am confident that you will definitely join.
My dear countrymen, today all over the world is worried about the Climate Change, Global Warming, Environment.
It is a collective concern in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
Lord Krishna also discusses the tree during the war of Kurukshetra.
In the Gita, Lord Krishna says, "Swasvaththa: Sarva Vrikshana", that is, I drink in all the trees.
In the Shukracharya Policy, it is said that there is no such vegetation in which there is no medicinal properties.
The discipline festival of Mahabharata has been discussed in many areas and it is said that the trees are satisfactory for the trees that are planted.
There's no doubt.
The tree that donates it also gives it in Parlok like a child.
A few days ago, I found an example of a daughter of Pune Sonal that touched my heart.
It is said in the festival of Mahabharata that the tree also fulfills the responsibility of the child in the world and Sonale has not only fulfilled the desires of his parents, but also the desires of the society as if he has raised the bid.
Farmer Khandu Maruti Mahatra of Narayanpur village in Junnar taluka of Pune, Maharashtra, married her grandson Sonal in a very inspired way.
It was surprised that when I saw them in the social media, the slopes were seen all around in the marriage.
The scene of this tasvir was synonymous.
In a way, Sonal's marriage has become a immense story of nature love and I congratulate Sonal and Shriman Mahatreji for this innovative effort.
And this is how many people use.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there are a large number of pilgrims in the month of Bhadrava in the Ambaji temple there.
And I will tell them that this is the Prasad of Mother Ji and if you worry about this plant going to your villages and villages then the mother will continue to bless you.
And lakhs of pilgrims came and lakhs of plants were distributed that year.
The temple can also start the tradition of planting instead of Prasad in this rainy season.
A simple mass movement can be of tree plantation.
I have repeatedly told the farmers brothers that if we ruin our land on the banks of our fields then why do not we cultivate timber instead of that jungle
If we plant such trees on the banks of our fields, which are furniture and homework, then it can be cut and sold by the government's permission after 15-20 years.
And you can also become a new tool of income and India can save from importing timber.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan-Marumbhoomi has done so much innovation and has resolved to grow twenty five lakh plants.
There is no small thing about twenty five lakh plants in Rajasthan.
The people who know the land of Rajasthan know how big bed has been picked up.
He has also promised to increase his green cover by fifty percent.
The Central Government has launched the Green India Mission, under which the Railways has accelerated the work.
There is also a very bright tradition of forest festival in Gujarat.
This year, several projects like Amravan, Ekta Forest, Shaheed Forest have been taken up as a Forest Festival in Gujarat and has launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but they are also eligible for congratulations.
But for me the journey of South Africa was a pilgrimage in a way.
When we remember South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
In the world, when this word of unhappiness, love and forgiveness falls, the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela are swimming.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to Phinex Settlement and is known as Mahatma Gandhi's residence as Sarvodaya.
The train that Mahatma Gandhi had travelled to me and the incident of which Mohandas had played a second role in becoming Mahatma Gandhi, it was also my privilege for Peter Maritzburg Station.
But this time I got the opportunity to meet the dignitaries who lost their lives for equality and equal opportunity and fought with Nelson Mandela.
Twenty-twenty-twenty years of life was spent in jail with Nelson Mandela.
In a way, the entire youth was welcomed by him and I was fortunate to visit these dignitaries, Mr. Ahmad Katha, Mr. Lalu Chiba, Mr. George Bejori, Roni Kasariles.
The symptoms of the duties that have been described in the Gita were very witnesses.
My heart will be remembered forever.
Equality and equal opportunity cannot be a big mantra for any society and government.
The priorities will be different, but the path is the same and the path is development, equality, equal opportunity, equality, emotional feelings.
Let us pride our Indians who have lived and showed the original mantras of our life in South Africa too.
My dear countrymen, I thank Shilpi Varma.
Those who have given me the message and their concerns are very natural.
As a woman, I am sorry for her family.
And some people are disappointed and stuck in the face of money.
A new way of looting through this technology is spreading all over the world.
And that too on a SMS.
And in a few moments he came to know that everything has been looted.
But recently I felt a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh had come to me.
Artificial paintings have been painted at the station.
If you ever go to Aligarh then definitely see the station.
Today I am getting such information from several railway stations in India and locals are identifying their areas on the walls of railway stations by their art.
An innovation is being felt.
This is an example of how changes can be made by public participation.
Congratulations to all those who have done this kind of work in the country, special congratulations to my friends of Aligarh.
And you will also be participating in the festival outside the house.
We have special significance in the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Like last year, can you not give the mothers and sisters of your country to the Vadapradhan Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
Think, give such gifts to the sisters who give them the right protection in life.
And this is social security.
This is the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
My dear countrymen, there are many of us who have been born after independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country who was born in independent India.
The entire country should be colored in the color of freedom fighters, once again the fragrance of freedom, make us all this environment and the freedom festival should not be the programme of the countrymen.
We should be our own festivals like Diwali.
I hope you too will do something related to the inspiration of patriotism.
You would like to keep your words from the Red Fort as bright as you want.
And nowadays, the platform of technology is so easy that you can send things to me comfortably.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio
Everybody makes several programmes in holidays.
And in the holidays, there is also a season of mango, so it also feels like enjoying mango.
And sometimes it feels that if you get a chance to sleep for a while in the afternoon then it is better.
But the horrible heat of this time has enjoyed all the fun all around.
But I have seen that the citizens also make very good efforts.
Awareness is seen in many villages and what is the value of water, those who are suffering from water are aware of it.
And that is why there is also a sensitivity about water and there is also an activity to do something.
A few days ago somebody had told me that Bajar Gram Panchayat and the villagers have raised water as a very sensitivity question in the village.
The crops which used most of the water, then have decided to leave crops like sugarcane, banana.
It seems very easy to hear, but it is not so easy.
And in which water is required at least, all of them went on plantations and vegetable farming.
They have taken all the initiatives such as fountains, drip irrigation, rain water conservation, water conservation, and today the village has emerged on its own strength to deal with water constraints.
It is true that I may talk of a small village like Bajar but there will be many such villages.
I also thank all such villagers for their best work.
Somebody told me that there is a Gorwa Gram Panchayat in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh.
This Panchayat has tried to create sports slopes.
However, water has saved, but whenever water comes up to the bottom then the quality of water also improves.
Sometimes it seems that when the Government of India has provided water to Latur by train, it has become a news for the world.
It is true that the speed that the Railways has done this work is eligible for congratulations, but the people of Pella village are also eligible for the same congratulations.
I will say, I am eligible to congratulate you even more than the Railways.
However, many such schemes that are being run by the citizens are never faced.
The nature of human beings may be sometimes passing through problems, but sometimes some good news comes, it feels as if the entire crisis has gone away.
This year, the news of the possibility of rains from 106 percent to 110 percent has been revealed from Jayar, as if a message of great peace has come.
There is still a time for rains, but news of good rains has also taken a new warning.
It gives us the kind of joy that it will be a good rain, it also gives us an opportunity and a challenge.
Can we run a campaign from now on to save the village water
The farmers need soil and the crops are grown in the field.
This time why do not we take soil out of the ponds of the village and take it in the fields
This will also improve the field land and also increase the water conservation capacity of the ponds.
Sometimes in the cement bags, sometimes in the empty bags of the fertilizer, there is a way of water coming from where water can be stopped or not .
The water will stop for five days, the water will stop for seven days, the water will land in the ground and the water will rise in the ground.
We will have water in our wells.
Water should be stopped as much as possible.
We have time for the next one and a half months, whether it is a problem of water or a condition of drought.
And I am always saying that whenever we go to the birthplace of Porbandar Mahatma Gandhi, one place of the different places we see is also like seeing how two hundred years old tablets have been constructed under the house to save rain water and how pure water is there.
Because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Many governments have come, many schemes have been made, so it is very natural for crores of people of the country like Bhai Kumarakrishna to face this problem.
The people who have religious faith have Ganga Mokshadayini for them.
I will accept this greatness but more than that I feel that the Ganga is life-style.
The Ganga provides us a new strength to live.
Just as the Ganges flows, it also gives a new boost to the economic activities of the country.
There is a need for crores of devotees to save the Ganga by bringing us the Ganga.
This work cannot be successful without public participation.
And that is why all of us will have to become a representative of cleanliness, for cleanliness, for change, and we will have to repeat this thing again and again.
A lot of efforts are being made by the government.
Efforts are being made to take full support from the states that are on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are also being made to connect social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have also been taken to stop the dream of Patna and industrial pollution.
A large number of dense wastes flowing through the drains every day and inside the Ganges.
In order to clean these wastes, the Tresh Skimmer works to clean the swimming wastes at places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc.
These machines have been supplied to all local bodies and they have been requested to continue and clean the garbage from there.
And in the last few days, I have been told that there is a lot of effort there and there are three to 11 tonnes of waste everyday.
The emission of garbage or blake linker from the pulp and paper industry is almost completely closed.
All these are a sign of the fact that we are moving forward in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that if a person is found not only on the banks of the Ganges but also from remote south then he definitely says that Saheb, Ganga will be cleaned
And that is the faith of the common man, it will definitely succeed in cleaning the Ganga.
People are also donating Ganga for cleanliness.
This system is being run very well.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
It is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
On this day the Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
And today, the Panchayati Raj system across the country is working successfully as an important unit of our democratic system.
And that is why with the help of the State Governments, the Government of India has launched Bharatodaya Abhiyan from 14th April to 24th April, 10 days of Gramoday.
And today on 24th, I would like to celebrate the Panchayati Raj Divas in Jharkhand where our maximum tribal brothers and sisters live in that region.
And I will once again interact with all the Panchayats of the country on the occasion of Panchayati Raj Day at 3 pm.
This campaign has done a very big job of awareness.
How to make democratic institutions strong at the level of the village in every corner of India
How to make the village self-reliant itself
How to make the village its own development plan
The birth anniversary of the daughter should be the festival of the village.
There are several such schemes.
In some villages there were programmes of food donations.
In all these villages of India, perhaps such various programmes may have been running for 10 days.
I congratulate all the State Governments and the Sarpanches of the villages for this thing.
In a very fundamental way, with innovation, this entire opportunity was transformed into an opportunity for the betterment of the village, for the development of the village, for the strengthening of democracy.
The awareness that has come in the villages is the guarantee of the emergence of India.
Prime Minister Namaskar
I speak from Mumbai to Sharmila Dharpur.
I have a question about education in school colleges.
For the past several years, there has been a need for improvement in the education sector.
Like not sufficient schools or colleges or there is no quality in education.
Today, if there is a dream of parents in every family then it is a good education of children.
Everybody thinks after home, car.
And for a country like India, this feeling of peoples mind is a great power.
Children should now be worried about learning and better learning and better education, and more awareness should be made.
And the child also becomes aware that I go to school for this work.
And that is why I would first urge all the girls and parents to talk about the activities being done in the school by giving time to the child.
And if something is taken care of then go to school and talk to the teachers.
These technologies can also reduce the evils of our education system.
So, in a way, it was a priority to spread education all around.
And it was also necessary.
But more important than the importance that is now to spread is to improve our education.
We have done a very big task of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Now good education has to be our priority from the literacy campaign.
Entry, Entry, Entrance, Entrance - Mantras have continued to be lost, but now those children who have reached the school have to focus on good education, proper education.
You must have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to emphasize good education.
But it is true that we need to improve ourselves from religion.
This time, in the budget, you must have seen that the work has been done with the cheeks.
In the budget, ten government universities and ten private universities have been asked to get rid of government dams and to come on a challenging path, let us tell what you want to do to become the top university.
This scheme has been initiated with the objective of giving them complete freedom.
Indian Universities can also become a global competing university.
At the same time, the importance of education is that of skill.
Similarly, technology will also play a big role in education.
Remote space education and technology will also make our education easier.
And I am confident that the results of this will be seen in a very close future.
For a long time people keep asking me about a subject.
Some people write on Webportal Mai Gov.
Some people write me on the Narendra Modi App, and most of these youngsters write.
In today's era, along with studies, sports is also very important for the youth.
So one day I also got to talk to you all before that.
The result was that I just called a meeting in which NCC was the elders of NSS, the elders of Scout and Guides, the Red Cross, the Naheru was from the youth center.
And whenever I asked them when they had met before, they said that our brothers and sisters, this kind of first meeting has been organised after the independence of our country.
I have got that benefit in my childhood and I also believe that a new life of these organisations should be supplied, a new strength should be supplied.
This time I have put some topics in front of him.
I have told them that brothers, why should not our youth organisations do a big job of water conservation in this season
Which programs can be constructed to connect the country .
What can be the common youth of all our organisations
What new things can be added to their work style, programme
If you write on my Narendra Modi app, then I will get the right place.
Such a situation will become.
My dear countrymen, today I have asked you to compete with us to think about it.
I also look at it as a matter of surprise to the people.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is such that in the last few elections, there were discussions about how many parties would give a cylinder of gas
And every political party felt that if it was to reach the middle class society, it was a big issue of gas battalion.
On the other hand, the economists used to pressurize or reduce the subsidy.
And because of this, several committees were sitting in which there was a lot of suggestions for reducing gas subsidy.
These committees used to spend crores of rupees.
But the matter was left there.
This experience is of all.
But there was no thought outside it.
My countrymen, today I am glad to calculate you all that I adopted the third path.
One crore families voluntarily handed over their gas subsidy.
But after calculating, it was found that there were more than 80 percent of the families of these one crore families who themselves digged the distributors there, stood in the queue and gave them their subsidies.
This incident has also forced the economists of the country to think newly.
And if the economists of the world do this then they will do that then they will result in the economic inclusions that make.
For them, this is an external incident of their thoughts and sometimes they have to think about it.
I would especially like to say to the entire political class today that we need one thing to trust the people everywhere.
Even if you didn't think, we would get such a result.
And we should go in this direction.
Believe in those who are sending Marcus by giving your test.
Sometimes I feel that sometimes we declare that there will be no ticket checker in the railway pails today.
Every braking neus is bad news in every newspaper and News channel.
Doesn't any good happen in our country with a population of Rs.
Please change this situation.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that only a positive news was printed on the eve of the print.
He continued to say this thing.
A few days ago, he wrote a letter to me and said, We have decided that on Monday, we will not give a single negative news.
It is the biggest reason for the inspiration to improve good news.
It is true that as much as we will strengthen goodness, it will be less space for your evils.
If I light the canopy then darkness will be removed, it will happen.
You can also contribute to it.
Ravi ji has made a good suggestion but please do not anger me.
Let us all try to make it positive and try to speak positive.
The specialty of our country is the Kumbh Mela.
Kumbh Mela can also become a center of attraction for tourism.
Very few people of the world will know that for such a long time millions of people come to the bank of the river.
For the last two days, I have been seeing that many people are uploading the news of Simhastha Kumbh.
I would like to compete with the tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the State Government.
Photo competition, and tell people to upload the beauty of beautiful pictures.
And people will also know how many varieties are happening in the corner of the Kumbh Mela.
So it can be done.
Jews, it is true that I met the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and he used to say that we have given special emphasis on cleanliness.
And it is not just that cleanliness remains there.
From there people also take the message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh Mela may be a religious and spiritual fair but we can also make it a social opportunity.
We should do this Kumbh Mela as well as how to love water, how to improve the faith of water, how to utilize this Kumbh Mela in giving a message of water conservation.
My dear countrymen, on this important day of Panchayatiraj, I would like to meet you again in the evening.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
You must be remembered that last time I had discussed a book of Prem Chand ji's statements and we had decided that whatever book you read will share with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people have shared knowledge of various books.
I am glad that people are discussing and discussing the books written on many subjects such as science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade, lifestyle.
Okay, I will definitely talk to you about some other books.
But I have to acknowledge that now I cannot give much time to read books.
But one benefit has come to me that if you are sending people then I need to get the opportunity to know about many books.
But from the experience of last month, I feel that we have to move forward.
Why should we make a permanent Book's corners on the Narendra Modi App and whenever we read new books, discuss it there
And you can also mention a good name for our Books Corner.
I want this Book's learner to become an active platform for readers and writers.
Keep on reading, writing and share it with all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Several effective efforts are being made across the country towards water conservation.
People are telling about traditional methods and methods.
Media also has many innovations on water conservation.
Be it the government, NGOs, all are doing something or the other on the level of war.
Seeing the strength of the community, the mind is feeling very good and is getting very satisfactory.
Like at a distance from Ranchi in Jharkhand, in the Ara Karam village of Ormanji block, the zeal of water management has become an example for everyone.
You will also be happy to know that Ishaan Indias beautiful state of Meghalaya has become the first state in the country that has prepared its water policy-water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, the crop farming is encouraged in which less water is required and there is no harm to the farmers.
I specially congratulate the Government of Haryana that he interacted with the farmers and inspired them to cut off from traditional farming for less water crops.
Now the time of festivals has come.
Several fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals.
Why do not we use this fair for water conservation
Friends, some of the things in life fills us with enthusiasm and specially the achievements of the children, their accomplishments, their accomplishments, gives us a new energy and that is why today I feel like talking about some of the children and these are those children - Nidhi Bipotu, Moneyesh Joshi, Dewanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tivari, Preeti Nag, Adharva Deshmukh, Aaronyatesh Ganguly and Hritik Alla-Manda.
You will also be proud of what I will say about them.
We all know that cancer is such a word that the whole world is scared.
It seems that death is standing at the gate, but all these ten children have not only defeated the fatal diseases like cancer in their lives, but have also raised the name of India in the whole world with their perspective.
In fact, this month, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
This is a unique sports competition in which the Young Cancer Service (YCS) is participating in the life of those people who have come out of cancer.
Competitions like shooting, chase, swimming, runing, football and table tennis were organised in this competition.
All these ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament.
Some of them won medals in more than one game.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that you must have been proud of the success of India across the sky, in the space and in the space - I am talking about Chandrayaan-2.
Sanjeeva Haripura of Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendrakumar Daga of Kolkata, P.
Aurobindorao, many of these people from different parts of the country have written to me on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and he has urged me to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, in the vision of space, 2019 has been very good for India.
Our scientists had left A-SAT in March and then Chandrayaan-2.
At that time, big and important news such as A-SAT could not be discussed.
We have achieved the ability to break the satellite at a distance of three hundred kilometers in just three minutes from the A-SAT missile.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve this achievement and now on July 22, the entire country was proud that Chandrayaan-2 has stepped towards space from Sriharikota.
But if you ask me what two big teachings I have received from Chandrayaan-2, then I will say that these are two teachings - Faith and Fearlessness i.e. faith and devotion.
We must believe in our talents and capacities, we must believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is completely in Indian color.
It is an Indian in terms of objective and emotion.
It is completely a indigenous mission.
The way our scientists have launched the Chandrayaan-Bay by uniting all the technical problems day and night in the unprecedented times.
The world has seen this great penance of scientists.
We also have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but always remember that the power to deliver it is within us.
I am confident that the Chandrayaan-2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
In fact, science is the path of development.
Now we are waiting for the month of September when lander Vikram and Rover Pragya will land on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share the information about a very interesting competition with the students of the country and young friends and invite the youngsters of the country to a quiz competition.
Explorations related to space, Indias Space Mission, Science and Technology will be the main subjects of quiz competition like what to do to leave rockets.
How satellites are set up in the room and what information we get from the satellite, what is A-SAT, there are many things.
I urge young friends, students to participate in this quiz competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with your participation.
I specially urge the schools, volunteers, enthusiastic teachers to work hard to make their schools victorious.
Encouraging all the students to join it and the most thrilling thing is that the Government of India will take the highest quality students from every State to Shriharikota at its own cost and in September, they will get the opportunity to witness the moment when the Chandrayaan is descending on the surface of the moon.
This will be a historic event of his life for the victorious students.
But for this, you will have to participate in the quiz competition, you will have to achieve the highest number, you will have to succeed.
Friends, My suggestion must have enjoyed you - it is a wonderful opportunity.
My dear countrymen, you must have mentioned one thing.
The things of our minds have accelerated the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time and the efforts made for sanitation have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
This journey, which started five years ago, is being set up today with the participation of the people and with the participation of the people, new standards for cleanliness.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal situation in cleanliness, but the way we have achieved the success of Swachhta Abhiyan from ODF to public places, it is the strength of the resolve of 1.
This movement is now moving forward from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I was watching Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh is a military engineer and has left his job in the US and returned to the service of Mother India.
He has not only made Delhi clean but also made it beautiful some time ago.
He started with his team from the jungles of Lodhi Garden.
Through Street Art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of the overbridge and the school to the slums, when he started cutting his town, the people got the help and this sequence started.
You must be remembered how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh.
I came to know that Bhai Yogesh Saini and his team played a big role in it.
The message of Indradhanush that is created by the texts made by it is more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this thing in the beauty of the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important for us that the culture of making West to Wealth develops in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making waste blankets.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting picture on MyGov.
This comment was of Bhai Mohammad Aslam, who lives in the shops of Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote: He likes to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to note that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme-Back to Village in my State of Jammu and Kashmir.
The programme was organized in the month of June.
I think such programmes should be held every three months.
At the same time, there should be an online monitoring of the programme.
With my view, it was such an initiative in which the people had directly interacted with the government.
Brothers and sisters, I am keen to know about the Back to Village programme that was sent to me and after reading it, and when I came to know about it in detail, I felt that the entire country should also be aware of it.
The people of Kashmir are so eager to join the mainstream of development and how enthusiastic they are.
The programme lasted for a week and in all the four and a half thousand panchayats of the state, government officials informed the people of the village about the detailed schemes and programmes.
How can Panchayats be further strengthened
How to increase their income
Their services can affect the lives of the common man and the people of the village have also shown their problems unconsciously.
Friends, It was not merely naming in this programme that the officers would return to the village all day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in Panchayat and this gave them the opportunity to spend time in the village.
Many other things were also included to make the program interesting.
Sports Competition for Children was organized under Khelo India.
Sports Kit, Job Card and SC-ST Certificates of Manrega were also shared.
The people of Kashmir became a participant in this festival of development.
It is a matter of joy that the Back to Village programme was also organised in such remote villages where government officials had to travel for one day and one and a half days while walking through inaccessible roads.
These officers also reached the border panchayats, who are always in the othar of the bullets crossing the border. Not only this, officers also reached the extremely sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts without any fear.
Some officers were so impressed by their welcome that they were staying in the village for more than two days.
Such programmes and peoples participation in it show that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir want good governance and it also proves that the power of development is always heavy on the strength of the bombs.
It is obvious that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, want to create obstacles, they can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, honoured by the Gyanpeeth Award, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre has presented a month of Shravan month in one of his poems.
In this poem, he said: The dam of rainy drains and water streams is unique and the earth is enlightened by seeing its beauty.
In the whole of India, people of different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Shravan as their own.
Whenever we look around us in this season, it seems as if the earth has covered the green sheet.
During this time the festival of Raksha Bandhan is also a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
You will be happy to know that this time the most devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the sacred Amarnath cave since 1st July.
More than the pilgrimages that were included in this journey for the last 60 days in 2015, this time only 28 days have been included.
I would like to appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
The people who return from the journey are admirers of the spirit of compassion and spirituality of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I was told that even in Uttarakhand this year, the journey of Chardham has started since then, more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months.
After the severe disaster in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there for the first time.
I appeal to you all that you must visit those parts of the country whose beauty is very bright during the monsoon.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and travel, perhaps there can be no more teacher than that.
I convey my best wishes to you all that this beautiful and live month of Shravan brings new energy, new hopes and new expectations to all of you.
Similarly, the month of August reminds of uit India.
However, when we see on TV, only one aspect of the rains is visible to us - floods, floods, traffic jams all over.
Thank you very much.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am equally worried about your children's examinations.
But if we change our way to see the tests then perhaps we can become anxiety free.
In my back Mann Ki Baat, I am happy to note that you have experienced your suggestions on the Narendra Modi App.
The teachers who have been very successful have sent a lot of things to me by their parents and some thinkers of the society.
Whatever I have heard, what I have read, what I have told me, I will also do some of them.
And how much of that I feel like.
I would like to tell you the messages that the youngsters of India have the pride of Bharat Ratna Shriman Secret Tendulkar has sent...
You must work hard, but decide a real accomplished goal for yourself and try to achieve that goal.
When I was playing cricket, there was a lot of expectations from me.
So it was very important for me to find a move.
So I thought that I would expect a lot and fulfill my goal.
But if I am fulfilling the goal of my honey and fulfilling it then I am definitely doing something good for the country.
And I always tried to achieve that goal.
My focus was on speaking and goals gradually achieved.
I will tell you that your thoughts are very important to be positive.
Why is competition
Why not comparison
Why should we ruin our time to compete with others
Why don't we competition with ourselves
Why don't we decide to break all our old records
You uo, no one can stop you moving ahead.
And whenever you break your old records, you will be happy to enjoy, for satisfaction, no one will expect anybody.
Do not consider friends tests as a game of statistics.
Don't be stuck in the accounts and accounts of what they reached.
Life should be linked to a great objective.
We should walk with dreams, we should be resolved.
These tests are being corrected or not, we calculate whether it is true or not, our speed is correct or not.
And that is why if the dreams are huge, the test will be a joyful festival in itself.
Every test will be a step to fulfil this great objective.
Every success will be the key to achieving this great objective.
And for this, do not be limited to what will happen this year, what will happen in this examination.
Let's take a very big goal and if there is something less than expected then despair will not come.
And it will be the courage to make efforts with greater strength.
Thousands of people have written little things with mobile phones on my app.
Shreya Gupta has stressed that there is a healthy mind in the healthy body.
Students, along with your studies, keep in mind your health so that you can write well in the examination.
Now, on the last day, I am not just saying that you should start punishing and go to run three kilometres, five kilometres.
But one thing is true, especially in the days of the test, how your hearts are.
Our 365 days of daily routine should be unprecedented to our dreams and resolves.
I agree with one thing about Shriman Prabhakar Reddy ji, he has specially urged him to sleep on time and revision on wheels in the morning.
One should reach the examination center before taking entrance and other things.
This is what Prabhakar Reddy ji has done, I may not have the courage to say because I am slightly sad about sleeping.
And many of my friends also keep complaining to me that you are sleeping very little.
And this is possible.
I'm not talking about lying down.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even if there is a slight problem in our body organs.
Not only this, our day-to-days also become rude.
And that is why we do not consider any thing small.
You don't fail yourself in the habit of confessing with the Jews, which are certain.
Specify, see it.
Friends, sometimes I have seen that the students who go for examination have two types of students.
You must have seen these two types of students.
If anybody can do this well with me, who has a mastery in chocolate and the world's big sportspersons who have checked it.
The Champion Vishwanathan joy of this chase will tell his experience.
Let us learn from them the way you check in this examination.
Hello, I am Vishwanathan Anand, first of all convey my best wishes to you.
I will talk about the exams and experiences I have given.
Exams have been like problems that have come to life since then.
Whenever you are playing, you don't know what will be done now, even in the classes you don't know what questions will be asked in the examination.
Whatever you are calm, healthy, and have sufficient sleep, the right answer will give you the brain at that time.
So be calm.
It is very important that you do not put too much pressure on yourself, do not have too much expectations.
Look at it as a challenge, I remember what I have learned during the year, I can raise problems.
In the last minute, pass out of the topics that you don't remember properly.
You can recall some details with teachers or students, which will help you write in the examination.
If you repeat the problems you feel difficult then it will be fresh in your mind and you will be able to write about it very well in the examination.
Therefore, be calm, take sufficient sleep, do not be very convinced, and do not be disappointed in the beginning, but I can successfully cross these tests.
Therefore, keep your belief in yourself.
Vishwanathan Anand has indeed done a very important thing.
Sometimes we were listening to him, the incident of Arjuna's life - how did he look at the bird's eyes
If you are passing through sadness then you will not be able to calm down if you are putting books in the last moment.
Laugh, let's laugh, let's say jokes with friends, let's see that the atmosphere of peace will be saved by it.
Do you imagine that you are standing at a pond, and you see beautiful things below the pond.
But suddenly if stones were thrown in some water and the swelling started in water then what would be the beautiful things that were seen in the lake
If the water is calm then the things may not be as deep as it is.
But if the water is calm then nothing can be seen below.
Then I feel that if I get lighter, I will feel better.
So I myself have developed my technological development.
Maybe this is my experience, which will also work for you.
Rajat Agrawal has said a good thing.
He writes on my app: We have experienced lightness with at least half an hour of friends, family members, Gappa My said that this is a very important thing because most of us think that whenever we are examining, we sit down to count or how wrong we have done.
We are stuck in it.
Friends, don't do that.
Just come out and spend half an hour.
It is really like understanding the thing of Ratnaji.
While describing it in the present context, he is trying to reach this Sanskar Sarita of the country and the world.
Such worshipped Muraribapu has also sent a very important drop to the students.
And he is also a teacher, a thinker and hence he is a synonym of things.
I feel that by accepting the situation, we can be very happy and happy.
If you go ahead with your exam, you will definitely get success and if you do not get success, you will not be able to get absorbed and will also be proud of success.
I am also grateful to the priest Muraribapu that he gave us a good message.
Friends, Today I want to tell you another thing.
I am seeing that this time people who have told me their experiences have discussed Yoga.
Friends, I will make it clear today, if you start doing yoga from tomorrow morning then it will be injustice to you.
But it is true that Yoga is a big key to the development journey of distinction, whether it is in a student life or in the latter half of life.
It is easier to enjoy.
Look, if you can.
I have great faith in it.
It's not like that.
But if we read the suggestions then perhaps we suppress ourselves, yes, yes, yes, yes, let me go this way.
And I would urge you to go to this for five minutes, but you must read the suggestions.
When I read it for the first time, it seemed that it did not come to me, but it was read again, it was noticed that no questions were asked again, but this is the same thing that sometimes because of not understanding the questions.
Rao, he has stressed on patience.
In very few words, a very good message has been given to all the students.
Come, listen to the messages of Rao Saheb.
From Bangalore to C.
N.
R.
I'm Rav.
I understand that it is natural to worry due to the examination.
And these are competitive examinations.
Don't worry, you do a good job.
This is what I say to my young friends.
Keep in mind that there is a lot of opportunities in this country.
Like mountains and trees, you also have the right to be here.
Strongness, determination and penance should be in you.
With this quality, you will succeed in every examination and in other efforts.
Good Blace, how is the way to talk about a scientist
This is the power of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
What they have spoken is Nishtani, Tapni, this is the same thing - Dedication, Determination, Diligence.
If you are feeling scared then you will also be scared.
And a golden future is awaiting you to do good work.
Now my app has given a message regarding the experience of the test on the right.
He said that in his family, efforts are made to create a positive environment at the time of examination.
This is true that the Secretary also said that he was Positive Approach, Positive Frame of Mind.
We are studying in our course of Electricity Gallery Research Thomas Alva Edition.
But friends, how many years have they taken to do this work, how many times have they been disappointed, how long has passed, how much money has gone, how disappointed it would have been.
But today that electricity, that bulb also illuminates our life.
It is said that the possibilities of success are also hidden in failure.
Who does not know Shrinivas Ramanujan
He did not have any special training in his formal education, which was not included in the subjects of counting.
However, he contributed deeply in various fields like Methematical Analysis, Number Theory.
K.
Rolling is an excellent example that success can be achieved by anyone at any time.
Herry Potter category is popular all over the world today, but it was not in the beginning.
He had to face many problems.
Rolling said that in the difficulties, he used to put the entire energy in such a way that was really important for him.
Nowadays the examination takes place not only for the students but also for the entire thinking, and for the entire school and the teacher.
But it is not good that the students are alone without the help of the vali and the teacher.
Whether it is a teacher or a senior student, it becomes a team and becomes a unit and moves forward with a common idea, the examination becomes easier.
Shriman Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the App - he has complained that parents should never pressurize their children to bring more marks.
They should be encouraged only to prepare.
If the child is talking to his friend, don't stop it.
Make a light environment, make a positive environment, be it your daughter or daughter, see how much confederation comes.
You can also see those confederations.
Friends, One thing is certain, especially I want to tell young friends, the life of our people has changed much more than our old generations.
Every moment, new innovations, new technologies and sciences are seen.
And we are not just realized.
We choose to join it. We also want to go ahead with the speed of science.
I am doing this because today is the National Science Day.
The Science Festival of the country is celebrated on 28th February as National Science Day.
28th February, 128th Sir C.
Raman was declared his discovery of Raman Effect.
He received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
Thus, the country celebrates 28th February as National Day.
The knowledge is of the people of science.
And innovation cannot be possible without science and technology.
Emphasising on new research in the country on this National Science Day.
All these things should be an easier part of our development journey.
And this time theme of National Science Day is Make in India Science and Technology Drive Innovations.
Friends, sometimes successes are achieved after a long time and when success is achieved then the vision of seeing the world changes.
If you are very busy in the examination, you might have been able to find many news in your mind.
But I want to repeat this thing to the countrymen.
You must have heard in the past that science has been very big and important in the world.
Scientists of the world worked hard, generations came, they did something and after about a hundred years a success was achieved.
The discovery of Gravitational Waves was awakened by our scientists.
This discovery is a very far-reaching success of science.
This discovery does not prove the theory of our great scientists in the last century, but it is considered to be a great discovery for physical science.
This entire humanity will work throughout the world.
But as an Indian, we are happy to note that the dreams of our country were associated with the Honorable Scientists of our country in the process of overall research.
Our scientists will be trying to pursue research in the future.
India will also be a part of international efforts.
And my countrymen, I have made an important decision in the last few days.
The government has decided to open Laser Interfare Gravitational-Wave Observatory which is called Lego in India to achieve more success in this discovery.
The connectivity of India will give a new energy and a new momentum to this process.
India will definitely become an active partner in this greater scientific research process of human welfare among its limited resources.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all the scientists.
Yesterday, you can listen to my Mann Ki Baat by making a message on that number.
You can also listen to your mother tongue.
There is a number of medals and I am again to say, 8108-8108.
Your examination is going on for 81908-81908.
Hey, brother, tomorrow is the budget.
All of us celebrated the festival of Christmas on the occasion of Paramdivas and now preparations are being made to welcome the new year.
India is a country full of diversity.
In a way every festival goes on waiting for the other festivals.
Sometimes it seems that India is such a country where the economies from the festival are going on.
This is the reason for the economic activities of the poorer sections of the society.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on behalf of me on Christmas and my best wishes to the New Year of 2016.
The year 2016 brings immense happiness to all of you.
New zeal, new zeal, new resolve, bring you new heights.
Shri Ganesh V.
Saveleshwar has written to me that this weather is the weather of tourists.
A large number of tourists from all over the country come.
People also go to celebrate the holidays of Natal.
As clean as our tourist destinations will be, India's image will be better in the world.
I welcome the ideas of Ganesh Ji and I am delivering the message of Ganesh ji to the countrymen.
And we also call guests, goddess Bhav, whenever we have to visit a guest there.
And, at our tourist places, at the believing places of the tourists, on our pilgrimages, it is indeed a special emphasis.
They are ordinary artisans and work hard.
He has done such a unique task that he has been published.
And when it came to me then I also felt that I had brought this thing to you.
In Bhojpura, he has made 100 toilets till now, assuming that this work is a sacred work without his hard work.
I convey my heartfelt gratitude to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we listen to despair about the country.
And this is the thing that pushes the country forward. And it seems very natural for them to take pride for Dilip Singh in Mann Ki Baat.
This is the result of the efforts of many people that the country is moving forward at a rapid pace.
250 crore Indians have been moving forward on their own one step and are increasing the country forward.
New opportunities for better education, better skills and employment.
It is a big task to provide easier credit to the people of the common family who cannot reach the windows of the bank.
Who can forget the occasion of Yashoda Mata and Krishna when Balakrishna opened his mouth and visited Mother Yashoda to the entire Brahmind.
The event of Yoga has made India a distinction.
Cleanliness is in a way in the household.
The participation of citizens is also increasing.
After so many years of independence, the village where electricity pillars have reached, the blindness of the village cannot be guessed by the extent of the enthusiasm and fervor that happens to be removed.
Till now, it has not been discussed in the media but I am confident that the media will certainly reach such villages and the biggest benefit will be that the workers of the government who are doing this work will be so happy that they have done something like that which will bring about changes in the lives of any village.
Whether it is a farmer or a poor person or a young man or a woman should reach all these services or not
That is why it should not be reached that what the government has done and which government has not worked.
But it should be so that if they are entitled to this thing then they do not let it go.
They should also get information for their right to get them
We all should try that the true thing, the good thing, the work of human beings, the more people can reach.
This is also a service work.
I have made a small effort to do this work in my own way.
I can't do everything alone.
But should I do something of what I am doing
A common man can also connect with me by downloading the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone.
And I will continue to share such small things on it.
And it is a matter of joy for me that people also tell me many things.
How will I reach without your help
Come, let us all come together to share the interests of the common man, in the language of the common man and inspire them to achieve the interests of them.
This was followed by all the departments of the government.
My young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India is going to launch the Complete Action Plan Action Plan of Startup India.
And in this programme, IIT, IIM, Central Universities, NITOs and youth will be connected to this programme through Live-Connectivity.
This startup is for them, such as the digital world or the IT business.
No, we have to bring about changes as per the requirement of India.
Market will be available.
In the same way the intelligence resources of our youth are limited to some cities .
This is wrong.
In the corner of India, the youngsters have talent and the chamber should get an opportunity.
This start-up India, Stand-up India should not be limited to some cities.
And I also urge the State Governments to move forward.
On 16th January, I will definitely be present in front of you in detail and will always be welcome to your suggestions.
Friends, The birth anniversary of Swami Vivekanandji is on 12th January.
Those who are getting inspiration from Swami Vivekananda ji.
On 15th to 12th January, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti (National Youth Festival) is celebrated as National Youth Festival.
This year, he is scheduled to be held from 12 JanyaRi to 16 January in Rampur, Chhattisgarh.
And I have come to know that this is his theme of this time because his organisation is based on the theme, the theme is very good, I have been told of the Indian Youth: of Development Skill and Harm that more than 10 thousand youth will be gathered in all the states and corners of Hindustan.
Youth Indias vision is to be created.
In a way, the flood of dreams is to be seen.
The resolve is to be realized.
Can you inform me about this festival
I especially urge the young friends that I am the Narendra Modi App.
So I will wait for you to know your ideas about the Youth Festival on the Narendra Modi App.
Dilip Chauhan, Ahmedabad, a Visual Challenged Teacher, celebrated the Excellency India Day in his school.
He has expressed his feelings by calling me, sir, and in my school, accessible India zombesh was celebrated.
We enjoyed school and encouraged children to help the disabled in the society.
I feel that you were the first to do this.
Thank you very much.
And you are yourself working in this field.
You are very well aware of these things and if you give it then you will have to face many problems.
Sometimes there is a chance to meet such a person in the society and there are some thoughts in our minds.
We also express our vision of going to them as per our thinking.
And for such people many words have been used in the world but there is always a contemplation of words.
Every time people feel that no, no, no, for them the identity of this word does not seem good, no respectable.
This year when the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, I had to go to the programme.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu and especially in the districts of Tamil Nadu, I could not attend the commencement programme that day.
But he had to go to the programme, he used to keep thinking of something in my mind.
At that time it was thought in my mind that the soul who has given some deficiency to the body, has given some damage to the body, the united organs used to work properly, they are also called disabilities and we know as a disabilities.
But whenever we come to their familiarity, it is known that we have seen a deficiency of their eyes, but God has given them some special impression.
After that, I thought in my mind that from the eyes we feel that it is handicapped, but it feels that it has an extra power specific.
And when I went, I thought that why should not use the word Divyang in place of handicappedness in our country
These are people who have an organ that has more than one organ in which there is divineity, the transmission of divine persons who are not with us ordinary body.
I think this word is very good.
Are my countrymen, can we prevalent the habit of Divyang in place of disability
I assure you that you will take this forward.
We have launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
Under this, we will make it easier for the people of Divyang by improving the interface in both physical and indirect ways.
Whether it is a school or a bus station or a railway station, there are ramps, ease of parking, accessible lift, braille lippy.
They need innovations, technology, systems, sensitivity to make them easier for availability.
We have picked up the bond of this work.
Democracy is also being achieved.
It should not be dead in files.
In the past, the Government of India has made an effort to ensure that how to reach the benefits of the schemes which are entitled to them
In our country, subsidies are provided to gas cylinders.
The government has made some changes in it.
Be it Jan Dhan Account, Aadhar card, it is the worlds largest, largest director, Benefit Transfer Scheme to deliver subsidy directly to the bank accounts of beneficiaries.
This scheme is known by the name of the initiative and the experiment has been very successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore cooking gas users have become beneficiaries of Pahal Yojana.
14 crore people have started directing government money in bank accounts.
No intermediaries, no recommendation, no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the campaign of Aadhaar card on the other, opening of Jan Dhan Account on the other, on the third, the State Government and the Government of India together prepare a list of beneficiaries.
Till now, about 40 thousand crore rupees have been directly entered into beneficiary accounts through various schemes.
I am sure that about 35 to 40 projects are being directly covered under the Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, a golden moment of 26th January, Indian Republic Day is also a pleasant coincidence that this time the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the founder of our Constitution.
In the Parliament, special discussions were held on the Constitution for two days and there was a very good experience.
All the parties, all the MPs discussed the sacredness of the Constitution, the importance of the Constitution, the understanding of the Constitution in the true form etc.
We should move forward on this issue.
The Republic Day can really connect the public with the system .
Our Constitution gives us a lot of rights and the discussion of the officer is done in a compassionate manner, and should be done.
But the Constitution also emphasizes the duties.
But it has been seen that the discussion of duties is very less.
It is our sacred duties to donate votes when elections are very much, there are all-round publications, writing on walls, hoardings.
There is a lot of compulsion at the time of vote donation but why does not it happen even in adventurous life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, can we celebrate the essay competition, poetry competition, development etc. in schools, in our villages, in our cities, in different societies, in organisations
If 1. 25 billion people of the country are taking a step after one, then how big history can be created.
Can you send it to me
I want to know your thoughts.
He sent me to my portal Mai Gov.
I would definitely want to know what the youth of my country thinks about duties
It feels a small suggestion.
Whenever we celebrate the Republic Day on 26th January, we have statues of all the great men in our city by the citizens, by the children of school colleges.
And I am not waiting for the government.
Can we make it easier for ourselves
On 26th January, we all try together to honour the statues of such great men, the sanitation of the premises, the cleanliness of the premises and all these things happen easily by the people of Janardhan.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to the New Year 2016.
There must have been an opportunity to go.
And with the new zeal and enthusiasm, trade and employment would have started.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have also started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
There are reports of natural calamities from every corner of the world and there are reports of natural calamities that have never been heard or not thought.
People are also feeling the impact of climate change at a rapid pace.
Many people have died.
I express my condolences and condolences to all those families.
The State Governments are fully engaged in rescue of relief.
The Central Government also always works together.
A team of Government of India has already been Tamil Nadu.
But whenever we look at the problems around, we need to bring about a lot of change.
15 years ago, the natural disaster was a part of the agriculture sector because more natural calamities, i. e.
Today, the form of this has changed.
It has become very compulsory to work for our capacity building at every level.
The governments, civil society, citizens, every small institution will have to work very scientificly for capacity building.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
And I suggested to them that we should jointly quote SAARC countries for disaster eradication.
I am glad that a tabletock exercise ease and best practices of SAARC countries were concluded in Delhi.
It's a good beginning.
I have received a phone call from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
(This is Lakhvinder Singh from Punjab district Jalandhar.
We are doing organic farming here and guiding many people.
I am very happy to hear your messages.
Not only this, you know the problem of farmers.
And your concerns are true but this is not just happening in Punjab Haryana.
This is our habit throughout India and traditionally, we move on the way to burn the remains of our crops.
But the pain that you have expressed is true.
The first way is that we have to train our farmer brothers and sisters.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are also very precious.
He himself has a biological fertilizer.
We give it wedfee.
Not only this, if its small pieces are made then it becomes a dry fruit for animals.
Secondly, due to the burning, the upper layer of the land burns.
My farmer brothers and sisters, think for a moment that our bones are strong, our heart is strong, our kidneys are good, everything but if the upper skin of the body burns then what will happen
If the heart continues, you can not live.
The upper layer of our land burns, which pushes the land to death.
And that is why a positive effort should be made.
This foam is once again burnt into the ground, but it becomes fertilizer.
Or if a piece of biological fertilizers are poured out by putting a little water in a piece of pieces, then it becomes the best type of biological fertilizers.
Not only this, if we put the fertilizers prepared in the land then it gives double benefits.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmers who have cultivated banana.
And he told me a good experience.
Whenever they used to cultivate bananas and when the bananas were finished then they used to spend five thousand, ten thousand, fifteen thousand rupees per hectare to clean it.
And till the time the people who picked it up were not taking the tractor-bacter, they used to remain like this.
But some farmers proved that six-six, eight-eight-inch pieces of this kitchen were pieces and they were burnt into the ground.
The water that is in that thorn keeps the crop alive.
Dear countrymen, the International Day of Personnel with DCABILITIS will remember the entire world on December 3 next.
Last time I talked about Mann Ki Baat.
My Noto Helpline was also discussed for Organ Donation.
The Indian Organ Donation Day was celebrated on 2nd November.
Many well-known people, including film actor Ravina Tandon, joined it.
Angan donation can save valuable life.
Whenever the organs go from one body to another then the organ gets a new life but it gets a new life.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness in this sector and in the true sense the needy will get the best help because this help will not donate any other thing.
I said earlier that he is celebrated as Disabilities Day on 3rd December.
Physically and psychologically handicapped people also have an unprecedented courage and strength.
Sometimes whenever there is pain, they get fun.
Sometimes the feeling of compassion and compassion is expressed.
But if we change our vision, then these people can inspire us to live.
You can inspire to get rid of something.
We start crying even if there is a small problem.
When I remember that my problem is very small, how does it look
And that is why all these are the source of inspiration for us.
Their vision is also commendable to revive the way and complications of their visionary life.
Javed Ahmed, I want to talk to him today.
40-42 years of age.
In 1966, Javed Ahmed was shot by terrorists in Kashmir.
The ability to stand up on his feet went forever, but Javed did not consider it to be defeated.
They cannot even lose the wounds of terrorism.
Body does not support but for twenty years they have been drowned in the study of children.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for handicappedness in government offices at public places
They are working on it.
He also turned his studies in this direction.
He received master degree in social work and became a messenger of the disabled as a aware citizen, he is making a silent revolution today.
Whether the life of Javed is not enough to inspire us in every corner of India .
I specially recall the penance and dedication of Javed Ahmed's life on 3rd December.
In the absence of time, I may be talking about Javed but in every corner of India, the lamp of such inspiration has been encouraging.
The new light of life is spreading, showing the path.
It is an opportunity to inspire them by remembering all these things on December 3.
Be it a person of the middle class, be it a person of the lower middle class, be it a poor person, be it afflicted, afflicted, disadvantaged, the disadvantaged and the disadvantaged, there is a constant disadvantage with the government.
And as a citizen, sometimes sometimes sometimes somebody feels bad on behalf of a government Babu.
And that very bad experience changes our vision of looking at the government system throughout the life.
Many times we don't even know because we don't know that any government system, any government servant is doing this work.
ASHA workers in our country are networked across the country.
I have never heard about ASHA workers among the people of India.
But whenever I am the world-renowned family Anterpreneur of the Bill Gates Foundation, his success has become a philosophy in the world.
When we jointly gave Padma Vibhushan to such bill gates and Milinda Gates.
They work very socially in India.
Whatever he earns throughout his life and time of his retirement is being used for the work of the poor.
In the last few days, the Government of Odisha specially honoured an ASHA worker on Independence Day.
They should be used for treatment on the basis of the preliminary arrangements they have been taught.
Emphasis on using every household insecticide mosquitoes.
As your child sleeps well and as much care should be taken, ASHA worker Jamuna Mani Singh is working in a dedicated manner to protect the entire village from mosquitoes.
And he met Malaria, prepared to meet the entire village.
If you come then how much will you have.
How many lakhs of people will be around us.
We will look at them with respect.
Such people become the greatest potential of our country.
How many big friends are made of the happiness of the society.
I commemorate all such ASHA workers through Jamunamani.
In the context of the inspirational events of an e-book Swachh Bharat, the ideal village of the Parliamentarians and the health sector.
I urge you to look at it.
Not only this , show others as well .
Read it and it can be possible that you want to raise such things.
So sure you mygov.
Please send the in.
Such things do not come very soon in our minds, but it is true for the society.
The positive potential is the biggest energy.
You should also share the best events.
So you can become a social teacher in the true sense.
The temperature of the earth should not increase now.
It is also the responsibility of everyone, it is also anxiety.
And this is the first way to avoid temperature.
Energy Safety Conservation is December 14, National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are underway from the government.
Bulb schemes are underway.
I once said that the full moon should be bathed for hours by shutting down the window street lights at night.
It should feel the light of the moon.
If a friend had sent a link to me and I got the opportunity to see it then I felt that I would tell you this thing.
A woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur does not seem to be on TV or she has got the opportunity to learn more.
But they are doing such a thing that perhaps nobody might have thought.
They are working to give the poor unemployed by using solar energy.
He has set up a committee of women and has set up a plant of solar energy runner Fanus.
And they pay a fee of Rs. 100 per month.
People take bonus in the evening and get back to charging in the morning.
And in a large number, I have heard that people from 5000 households come.
Now see what the world's largest people would have done for climate change, but an inspired person is working to inspire everyone.
And even then, Nurjahan means publishing the world.
They are spreading light through this work.
I congratulate Nurjahan and congratulate GT because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur in front of the country and the world.
Thank you very much.
I have received a phone call from Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey, Uttar Pradesh.
We want to know from the elder Prime Minister how the Mudra Bank runs in which help is given to adventures like us
Mudra encourages trade entrepreneurs.
Mudra creates opportunities for earnings.
And Mudra really empowers it.
This Mudra Yojana is going on to help small adventures.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginning is good.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
It is a matter of great happiness that about 24 lakh women are among 66 lakh women, be it dhobi, be it dhobi, be it printer, be it milk seller, small businessmen.
And most of those who receive this help are people of SCs, STs, OBCs who work hard and try to run a family with respect.
Abhishek himself has spoken of his enthusiasm.
I have a lot of news.
Someone has just told me that there is a shalesh address in Mumbai.
Under the Mudra Yojana, he got a loan of Rs. 8.
And he started trading Suez Dress Safai.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I said that Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new adventures.
And Shailesh Bhosle did it.
He has brought a tanker and I am told that he has paid Rs. 2 lakh in such a short time to the bank.
This is the objective of our Mudra Yojana.
But earlier they used to bring money with more interest.
And earlier due to excessive interest and other reasons, the money that was spent due to other reasons was now coming into their hands, they started saving about one thousand rupees more every month.
And a good business of his family started to grow gradually.
But I want that the scheme should be more propagated.
All our banks should be more sensitive and help more and more small people.
In fact, the economy of the country runs by these people.
Only those who do small work are the economic potential of the country.
We also want to emphasize it.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Sardar Patel Jayanti on 31st October, I had talked about Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.
These are the matters that should be constantly aware of the social life.
What should be the structure of the program
What is Logo
How to increase participation
I had said for all these suggestions.
I was told that many suggestions are coming.
But I look forward to further suggestions.
I look forward to a lot of square schemes.
And I am told that those who participate in it have to get certificates.
It has been announced on a large number of nominations.
You also run your creative brain.
How to make this mantra of unity integrity the mantra of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat connecting this mantra with one Hindustani.
Be it glorious, glorious, vibrant, and it is easier to connect everyone, what should the government do
What should the society do
What should the civil society do
There can be many things.
I am sure your suggestions will be worked.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter has come.
I would urge you to keep the body healthy for some time, this good weather will be used for exercise-yog.
And make the environment in the family itself, be it a festival of the family and one hour is to do the same together.
You see what kind of consciousness comes and how much the body supports the whole day.
If there is a good weather then it will also be a good habit.
Greetings to my dear countrymen again.
Jaihind...
My dear countrymen, I bow down to you all.
Once again I have got the privilege of connecting with you all through the words of mind.
Today, India and South Africa are going to play the fifth one-day match in Mumbai.
This category has been named Gandhi-Mandela category.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased significantly.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of Kannur Centre of Akashwani.
I would like that if such Akashwani Kendras are focused on such awareness and active people in their respective regions across the country, then they will get a new strength for our objective to run the country with democracies.
And that is why I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the colleagues of Kannur Akashwani Kendra.
Students of St. Mary Upper Primary School in Chittor in Kerala have written a letter to me.
The letters are special in many ways.
First of all, these girls have prepared a picture of Mother India with their thumb marks.
The picture of Indias map has been sent to me.
Earlier, I was very surprised to see why he made a map of India with his thumb print.
But whenever I read his letter, I realized that he had given a good reflection.
These are those girls who have tried to make the Prime Minister aware.
He is campaigning for public awareness for organ donation.
He has also staged dramatic dramas in many places so that people can understand their organ donations.
Organ donation becomes a process and activity.
These children have written to me in a letter that you should invite people to donate organs in your mindset.
He says that organ donation should be made a festival.
Recently, I have a lot of messages on phone calls.
Devesh ji of Delhi has also given me such a message.
The aspirational goal of organ donation by every 10 lakh persons is a very fruitful step taken by the government.
I feel that this thing is very important.
More than two and a half lakh kidneys, heart and liver donated every year in the country.
But in the country of 125 crore, we can succeed only five thousand transplants.
Every year there is a need for one lakh eyesight.
And we can reach Kewal only up to twenty five thousand.
We can only give one in front of the requirement of four eyes.
Efforts have also been made to guide Rajo in this direction.
Some states have made a good effort to reduce the Lakhpatti and accelerate it.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the forefront of organ donation.
Many social institutions, many voluntary institutions are working very well in this direction.
National Organ and Textile Transplant Organization Noto has been set up to promote organ donation transplantation.
One Helpline of 24 hours is also available 1800 1140 services.
And we have been told there that Tyakteen Bhujitha.
The best description of the joy of quitting is in this Tyaktan Bhujitha Mantra.
A few days ago, we all had seen on TV that Delhi's G.
And that operation was successful.
A life was saved.
Organ donations should realise the spirit of Tyaktan Bhujith and we must accelerate this thing.
Our countrymen, recently we have celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi festivals.
And after a few days, I will also celebrate the festival of Diwali.
Eid is also celebrated and also celebrated by Ganesh Chaturthi.
The India-Africa Foren Summit is being organised in the capital of India from 26th to 2nd October tomorrow.
For the first time on the earth of India, such a large scale is being organized.
Choppan has been invited to African countries and leaders of the Unions.
Outside Africa, one of the largest conventions of African countries is being held.
India and Africa have close relations.
The number of populations in India belongs to African countries.
And if we meet both then we are the third largest population of the world.
And it is said that lakhs of years ago this was the same treasure.
Later, these two pieces of the Indian Ocean were divided.
We have such a good destiny in natural resources.
And about 2 lakh people of India have been living in this country for a long time.
India has economic relations with African countries and has cultural and political relations.
But India plays a very important role in training the youth of the most African countries.
More than 25,000 African students are studying in India.
And today there are leaders of many African countries who have known in India.
So how deep we are
And in that sense, this Summit is very important.
Normally when the Summit meets, heads of different countries meet.
In the same way, the Chief Ministers are scheduled to meet the Summit.
But we are trying to meet the people too.
About 100 schools participated in this event.
There were also schools outside India and India.
And thousands of school children have written things that enhance India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, an exhibition from the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi from Porbandar to the Memorial of Mahatma, is reaching Delhi from Porbandar to the Northern States on October 2nd.
Millions of school children have seen this exhibition.
The people of the village looked and the great role of Mahatma Gandhi in Africa and Indias relations was how the personality of Mahatma Gandhi was affected by these two landscapes.
Children of schools in our smaller places are also very excited, how wide their vision is, and how depth they think.
Although this summit is of India-Africa, we can clearly see the opportunity to connect the people.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the children participating in the competition, to more than 1600 schools and to the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
On 15th August last year, I had made a proposal about the Parliamentarian Adarsh Gram Yojana.
After that, many MPs fulfilled this work.
He was very fond of heart.
Last month, a workshop was held in Bhopal.
Here the ideal village is being built, the Sarpanch, the collector, some of the MPs there, the Government of India, the Government of India, all of them together discussed the subject of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Several new things were taken into account and very encouraging things were discovered.
Some of these things I would definitely like to take care of you.
Jharkhand, in a way, is a very large region, a tribal area.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to be an ideal village.
It was also difficult for government employees to go there.
I congratulate the Honble Parliamentarian, Shriman Karia Munda ji.
And in the same way, the school provides education for children in the morning and education for children in the evening.
And these children taught about five hundred fifty inspectors and read and write them.
If you see that there is no budgetary system in the society, not a character or a special system, but how big changes can be brought from the will, we can see through Pudi Gram Panchayat.
This village is well known for production of sugarcane and for Kurtai jaggery in the state.
Shriman Ruwala ji started the Kurtai Goal Seed Festival on 11th March in this village.
The people of old public life also came.
The government officials who worked there also came and an exhibition was also organized to increase the sale of sugarcane production.
How the village can be made a centre of economic activities, how the sand can be sold in the village.
Shriman Ruwala ji is actually a complimentary officer for his efforts to build a self-reliant village along with the ideal village.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be a matter of mind and how it does not matter about cleanliness
Savita Rai of Mumbai has sent a message to me through telephone. We are cleaning our homes every year for the preparation of Diwali.
This Diwali should make us clean along with our homes and the outer environment and keep it clean even after Diwali.
He has focused on the right thing.
I would like to recall you, my dear countrymen, after the festivals of Diwali last year, our country, especially the media, launched a huge joke and showed that there was a slaughter in the aftermath of Diwali.
All media persons had launched a campaign for awareness.
And the result was that a clean drive was run immediately after Diwali.
So, Savita ji is true to you that we should do as much as we think before the festival even after the festival.
Every public programme should be done.
And today, I would like to especially congratulate the entire media world of India.
On October 2, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and on one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, I was fortunate to participate in the Safety Summit organized by India to Day Group.
He gave the Clean India Awards and I was also watching how many activities are going on.
For this, however people themselves are working like One Light One Mission.
What are the places in our country which have been kept so clean.
All these things came to light and I conveyed my heartfelt gratitude to that commendable work of India to Day Group at that time.
He has been encouraging cleanliness for the last one year through e-TV.
He has connected 51 lakh children from about 55-56 thousand schools in Andhra-Telangana.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, gardens, many people have launched a big campaign for cleanliness.
Now these news itself shows the power to realize the dream of a Swachh Bharat.
The Mission Clean India is hundreds of channels of our country, thousands of prints, I cannot take the name of everyone due to lack of time, but everyone has run this campaign.
And therefore, according to the suggestions made by Savita Rai ji, the entire country is considering this thing as its own and is pushing it forward.
I have written a letter to our Governor of Meghalaya, His Majesty Shanmuganath.
And through that letter, I have mentioned the Mavalyanong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last few years this village has faced the challenge of cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this sanitation.
And it is said that a few years ago, he received the award of Asia's cleanest village.
I am happy to hear that there is a village in Meghalaya in the remote north east of our country which has been in the field of sanitation for years.
This nature of the citizens of the country has become a culture of the village.
This is the only thing that creates confidence in all of us that our country will definitely become clean.
Whenever we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we can say that by pride, hundreds of millions of Indians, our dear countrymen, on the 15th of August, whenever we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we can say that those who have freed our mother India from dirt.
Whenever the poor person goes for a small job then no one knows how many problems he has to bear, how does the brokers have to bear their money
I have never heard that there is a psychological psychologist in the world who takes a person completely in an interview of two minutes.
And with this idea, I had announced that why should we not abolish the tradition of interview for smaller jobs
My excellent young friends, today I am proud to say that the government has completed all the procedures and the Central Government's Group D Group C and Group B Non Gazetted Posts will no longer be interviewed.
The Rule will be implemented from 1st January, 2016.
We will not interfere in the process where the process is going on, but it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
So my best wishes to you young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget, we had announced an important scheme.
The gold has become a part of social life in a way in our country.
Gold is considered a means of economic security.
Twenty-two gold of difficult times is considered.
This tradition has been going on for centuries in social life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the Goldbank and the bank will give you an interest on it, the money you deposit and the interest you get.
Earlier, we used to keep the gold in the folker and we had to pay the rent of the folker.
Now I will put gold in the bank and the bank will give you money as interest.
Speak the countrymen can no longer become the property of gold .
Whether one can change or not as a living power from the dead money of gold .
Just do this thing we have to do, you help me.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
Its safety and interest. Two benefits.
Take certain benefits.
There is another scheme, sovereign gold bond does not come in your hands, but there is a paper.
But the cost of this paper is as much as one gold. The day you will repay this paper, the same amount of gold will be paid to you.
So we are launching these schemes.
Now we do not need to buy gold.
So I will present this scheme with security guarantee to the countrymen next week.
I am glad to tell you that we are also bringing Gold Canyon, the gold coins of Ashoka Chakra.
Our independence has been about 70 years but till now we have been using foreign golden coins or we have also been using Gold Bullean Bars.
Why should not our country have indigenous marks
That is why in the next week and in the next week, we will come out before the density and wealth will be available to the common man. The Indian gold coins with five grams and ten grams of Ashoka Chakra are starting.
Besides, 20 grams of gold bullion will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, Ironpurush is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Remembering the Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the map of integral India comes forward.
This great man has contributed a lot to Indias unity.
As a iron man, he has introduced his capabilities.
We will pay homage to Sardar Saheb, but he had dreamt of uniting India, which he had geographically shown, but this mantra of unity should constantly be the medium of thinking, behavior and expression.
India is a country full of diversity.
Many creeds, many sects, many sects, many sects, many dresses, a variety of varieties are our country and this diversity is our beauty.
If there was no diversity then perhaps we might have taken pride for the beauty that we cannot take.
And that is why diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity, this is the root of development.
Over the last few years, on 31st October, programmes of Run for Unity are being held in the corner of the country.
I have heard that this time also it is being organised around.
People are enthusiastically preparing for the race of unity.
The race of unity is the race of development in the true sense.
In the second sense, the guarantee of development is also a race of unity.
Come, pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Please take the mantra of unity forward.
My dear countrymen, I have to visit Britain on the second day of Diwali.
I am very thrilled for my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India, and the State Governments also give scholarships to those sections of the society, whether they are Dalits, tribals, backwards, their talented children who go abroad.
I am confident that when such children of India are going to learn in Britain, Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage for them and will become an inspirational place.
And that is why I am saying that I am specially thrilling about my visit to Britain.
And now that building is being constructed by the wealth of 1. 25 billion people, with which Babasaheb Ambedkar is connecting the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar, you can imagine what kind of joy the people like me.
I will also have another opportunity in London and unveil the statue of Lord Bashweshwar.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Bashweshwar for democracy, for women empowerment is indeed a studying aspect of the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Bashweshwar on the house of London was an excellent example of how great men of India used to think about it centuries ago.
You know that when such incidents have been connected, the hearts of all of us are thrilling.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Later, your letters are also discussed on the Akashvani.
The Government officials are interacted with them.
Some people write their problems and try to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
Similarly, a good relationship between us has been closed.
Last time I was completing one year.
Today we are entering the new year.
Congratulations to my dear countrymen once again.
Jaihind.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat Programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, bow down to you all.
I have had a basic idea in my life and because of this, I have immense faith in Jan Shakti but what Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what I have learned, what I have experienced, I can say that we think is more than that people are oppressed.
Our ancestors used to say that Janta Janardhana is a part of that god.
I can say with my experiences of Mann Ki Baat that our ancestors have a lot of power, a lot of truth because I have experienced that I was asking for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat and every time I could talk about two or four suggestions but lakhs of people were active and informing me that this is a huge power.
Yes, these lakhs of journalists also gave me a big bond.
Different departments of the government have analyzed the letters of the people and what is the matter of policy and what is the matter of personal question, which is not in the mind of the government.
Who had thought that the source of these information would become Mann Ki Baat
One day I had said that Selfie with Doctor and the entire world were surprised.
Perhaps in all the countries of the world, some of the millions of people have got the pride of selfie with the doctor and the daughter.
And when he used to do Selfie with the doctor, he used to enhance his daughter's zeal but also in himself commitment.
Even when people were looking at it, it seemed that the neglect of the daughters would have to be observed now.
There was a fucking revolution.
Keeping in mind the tourism of India, I told the same citizens that you also go to Incredible India or Bhi, if there is a good news then I will see it.
However, there has been a huge change in the number of lakhs of people from every corner of India. Perhaps the tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the state government has never thought that we have such a beautiful heritage.
There was a time when Khadi for Nation.
Isn't there any demand for time now or 'Khadi for Fation'
Today, I am very satisfactory to say that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year, now this work has not happened due to any government announcement.
On a TV channel, I had seen that a retired teacher was standing in a widow lady line to leave subsidy.
The ordinary middle class of the society, the lower middle class, for which it is difficult to quit subsidy, but such people have left.
Is this not a silent revolution
Is it not a vision of this manpower
Governments also have to learn that the work done in our government offices is a powerful, energetic and visionary society outside Umbra.
He made every small thing his own and tried to connect himself to the good of the country.
What can be a big satisfaction with this
This time I thought of doing a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I prayed to the citizens of the country that you should telephone your questions and suggestions.
I will focus on Mann Ki Baat.
This is a very pleasant experience.
All the adults have sent a message.
I liked to hear some messages myself and I felt good.
My team is working on the rest.
You might have taken one minute or two minutes but your phone call for me, your message is very important.
The entire government will definitely work on your suggestions.
But one thing was surprising and joyful for me.
It seems as if there is negativeity and negativeness all around.
But my experience was different.
Thousands of people had to say their own words.
But I am surprising that all things were like this in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat.
Completely positive, indicative, creative.
People have said that more than the remaining 70 percent of the energy filling and enjoying things.
They must listen to the radio.
I noticed how important the radio would be for the visually impaired people.
I am watching a new dimension and telling such good things that these people and the government are sufficient to sensitize.
I have given this message from Alwar Rajasthan to Pawan Acharya.
Listen, what do they ask for to say - surely listen - my name is Pawan Acharya and I am from Alwar Rajasthan.
I am confident that like the wind, your feelings will definitely reach every corner of India.
It is a good suggestion that the soil should not be rooted and that is why the dust of the soil is also invaluable.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the army personnel.
Whether it is our navy, be it land force, air force - Army, Air Force, Navy.
The war of 165 was completed 50 years with Pakistan.
On this occasion, an exhibition of valour has been set up near India Gate in Delhi.
If you look at the point of view of history then you can learn a lot and if you look for inspiration in life then perhaps there can be no more inspiration than this to serve the motherland.
Whether it is the battle of Hajipir, the actual north, the Chaminda and the visions of the victory at Hajipir are thrilled and our army is proud of the soldiers.
My visit to these brave families also met with those sacrificed families and those who participated in the war are now in the north of life.
If you want to make history then it is necessary to understand history deeply.
I came back in two and a half hours but you will definitely take three-four hours.
Look at the strength of democracy, a small child has ordered the elderly, but the child has forgotten to call his name at the earliest.
We should also make the nature of cleanliness and make arrangements for cleanliness.
I got a lot of satisfaction from the message of this child.
I also have to hear a lot.
I see the best thing from this that the Parliament of the country is also discussing Indias cleanliness.
On the other hand, look at the Parliament on the one hand and on the one hand the child of this country talk about cleanliness - what can be the luck of a big country
The movement that is going on, the ideas that are becoming an environment of hatred towards dirt - the awareness of cleanliness has come - it will also compensate the governments to work, provide and provide them.
We have to move forward even if there are deficiencies, and we will work towards fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Once, he said that if I have to choose one of the two freedom and sanitation, then I will first choose cleanliness, after independence, there was more importance for Gandhi than independence.
Gulshan Aroda ji from Delhi has conveyed a message to Mai Gau.
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Deendayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the life of great men is always a cause of inspiration for us.
And it is not our task to evaluate the ideas of the great man.
You take out any date, one of the jewels of history will get the name of a great man.
Let us recall all these great men in the coming days, let us reach home and home, and let us also try to learn something or the other.
I would like to invite you once again for October 2.
October 2 is the birth anniversary of Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi.
I had also said last year that you will have every kind of fashion clothes, every kind of fabric, there will be many things but one should also have a place of fashion.
I once again say that from 2nd October to 1 month, there is a liberation in Khadi.
It should take advantage of it.
And along with Khadi, handlooms should also be given the same importance.
And that is why in this Diwali, we must give a place to our house and place on our body.
And when you see, the sales were almost doubled.
How many poor people have benefited.
You people have made the work that the government cannot do with a publication of billions of rupees.
This is the Jan Shakti and that is why I once again request you for this work.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy with one thing in my mind.
You should also get some taste of this joy.
I went to Kolkata in the month of May and came to meet the family of Subhas Chandra Bose.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose had organised everything.
I had got the opportunity to spend a joyful evening with the family members of Subhash Babu for a long time.
You can imagine how happy is the moment for me
Perhaps for the first time in his life, the family members of Netaji would have come together to visit Vadapradhan Niwas.
But more than that, it is a matter of greater happiness for me that the privilege of such hospitality has never come to the Vadapradhan Niwas place, which will meet me in October.
More than 50 people of Subhas Babu and the entire family live in different countries and all the people are coming specially.
I got a message from Bhargavi Kande and I felt like listening to the sound of his words that he feels like a leader himself and perhaps it feels like becoming a leader.
My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to make a statement to the Prime Minister that you should awaken to the younger generation about water registration so that the participation of the younger generation will increase in the coming days and the government will be selected and run the important cooperation of the younger generation in the future.
Every voter in democracy is the fate of the country and this awareness is increasing gradually.
A few years ago, we were seeing that our Election Commission has been working as a controller but in the last few years, there has been a major change in it.
Today, our Election Commission has not only been a controller, it has become a facilitator in a way. The voter friend has become a friend and all its ideas are in the center of voter.
We should keep on upgrading the voter list and we should also be observed.
I am telling you during the election time that the first time after polling, water drinks.
Everyone should do the sacred work.
I visited Kashi on Param Day.
One of me was a seventh grade student named Kshitij Pandey.
It is the seventh grade in the Central Vidyalaya in Banaras Hindu University.
Well, it is of a very sharp wisdom.
But I have seen his interest in physics research in such a young age.
It was awesome that how the feelings were coming to robots, what was it saying.
There should be constant questions in the mind of the child - why
How to .
When is costly
This child should ask the mind.
Similarly, I had to meet Sonam Patel with a very small burning.
Nine years of age.
The daughter of Sadabriz Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi, is a daughter of a very poor family and I am surprised that the entire song of the burnt song is comfortable.
But the biggest thing I felt was that when I asked him, he used to say slock, he used to define it in English and used to define it in Hindi.
Does the only song read or is there any other song
If you take history then it is all faced in the evening.
We are also surprised to know how they are so talented in the entire family.
I was really very impressed.
Sometimes some children have the grief of celebrity, but Sonam had nothing like this.
Besides what you see on TV, you read in newspapers, we do a lot of work and sometimes enjoy such works.
Similarly, my interaction with these two children was memorable for me.
I have seen that some people take a lot of work for me in Mann Ki Baat.
Sandeep ji, what will you do with me
I have to make so much dissolution in the month and I have to do so much adjustments.
Sometimes my friends of Akashwani have to sit waiting for half an hour.
But I respect your feelings.
I thank you for your suggestions.
Now it's just a month.
Mann Ki Baat has been completed one year.
Do you know how much Subhash Babu used the radio
He started his radio from Germany and familiarized the citizens of India through continuous radio movements.
He started the Azad Hind Radio from a weekly News Bulletin.
He was running the radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushto, Urdu all languages.
It has been a year since I am talking about Mann Ki Baat on Akashwani.
I am also talking to you and this is my satisfaction.
I will meet again for Mann Ki Baat in the next month.
You keep sending suggestions.
Your suggestions also benefit the government.
Amendment begins.
Your contribution is valuable for me.
Once again my best wishes to all of you.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modis Mann Ki Baat
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
Once again I have got the opportunity to come amongst you to talk of mind.
People are celebrating the festival of Onam in remote areas and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
In view of social security, the Government of India has implemented several new schemes for the common man.
I am glad that in a very short span of time, everyone has adopted these schemes.
I had requested that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, we should offer this security scheme to our sisters.
I have come to know that since the beginning of this scheme, eleven crore households have been connected with this scheme.
Moreover, I was also told that about half of the benefits have been received from the mothers and sisters.
I consider it a good sign.
I convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the sacred festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, a year ago, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up with a lot of hands.
The work that has not been done for sixty years will take place in such a short span of time .
I also saw the abundance of the poor
The Shunya was about to open an account from Bellens.
However, by saving the poor, the amount of Rs.
Young people have got jobs.
You will be happy to know that in a year, one lakh one lakh and twenty three thousand Financial Literacy Camps have been organised to meet the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
It is not just to stop opening the accounts.
And now thousands of people have also become officers to get overdrafts under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it.
And there was a belief that the poor can get money from the bank.
I have brought it to you and now it is your task to maintain it.
All of us should be active.
I am sure you will do that.
Last days, the incidents of Gujarat made the entire country unconscious.
But in a short span of time all my enlightened civilian brothers and sisters of Gujarat took care of the situation.
He played an active role before the situation worsened and once again Gujarat went on the path of peace.
Peace, unity, brothers - this is the true path.
And we have to walk on the path of development only.
Development is the solution of our problems.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I got the opportunity to hear their words.
And what I really felt was that I got the opportunity to listen to the kind of things they were singing music in a way.
I looked very good.
Perhaps it has become the most important to realize the true form of Islam in the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition that is associated with love and generosity will bring this message far away, which will benefit the human race.
And I also say to others that even if we believe in any community, we should sometimes understand the Sufi tradition.
In the coming days, I am going to get another opportunity and I am fortunate to invite this invitation.
In India, the scholars of the Buddhist tradition of many countries of the world will come to Bodhgaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodhgaya.
I have the opportunity to visit Bodhgaya with these scholars from all over the world.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to say this thing specially today.
Earlier, I have mentioned this topic in Mann Ki Baat.
You must have listened to me in Parliament, you must have heard it in public meetings, you must have heard it in Mann Ki Baat.
I have always been saying that the mind of the government is open on the issue of a dispute regarding the Land Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion for the benefit of farmers and I have been saying this again and again.
But today I have to say to my farmer brothers and sisters that the revision of the Land Acquisition Act has come through the states, it has come to the forefront that if the village and the poor farmers have to make canals to provide water to the fields, there will be pillars to provide electricity to the villages, there will be roads to the poor of the village, there will be a provision for the employment of the poor youth of the village, then we will have to leave the law from the brink of implementation.
And then there was a proposal to improve.
But I saw that so much fear was spread, the farmers were so frightened.
My farmer brothers and sisters, My farmer should not be confused and should not be confused.
And I do not want to give any such opportunity to anyone who threatens farmers and illusions farmers.
We presented an order.
Tomorrow, the visit to the Ordinance is being completed on the 13th August.
And I have decided that it should be finished.
This means that the situation that was before my government was formed has now been re-established.
But it was incomplete.
And that is why we brought them to the Ordinance, but due to these disputes, they also got lost.
And I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan is not the hell for us.
Village, the welfare of the poor farmers.
And that is why on 15th August, I had said that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Agriculture and Welfare will be set up.
And when it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is also natural to remember the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan.
It is also very natural to remember all those martyrs who have maintained the triangular flag of India.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 war.
And I am happy that India is doing excellent work in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing excellent work.
Now we have the opportunity to reach these researches to the common man .
How to convert the principles into equipments
How to connect Lab with Land
It has to be pushed forward as an opportunity.
I also got some new information.
I can say that it was also an inspiring for me.
And when I had said in Mann Ki Baat last time that our students should move forward towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there is a lot of opportunity and there is a lot of possibilities.
I get several letters from the citizens.
He has written about Skill Development.
From Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu, Shriman Prakash Tripathy has stressed the need for good teachers for primary education.
Emphasis is on the reforms in the education sector.
I have also said one thing to my young friends.
I had told the Red Fort on 15th August why interview for lower level jobs
And when Interview comes to coal then where will every poor family, widow mother and feeling be found
The poor do not have to run for emotion.
Exploitation doesn't happen, bitterness.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For health, especially for mother mortality and infant mortality, the call-to-actions of the world have contemplated on the land of India.
This was the first time in another country outside the US.
However, there has been a lot of improvement.
India has started to appreciate at the international level, but this figure is not small
Just as we get rid of police, we also get rid of tetanus in the death of mothers and children.
The world has accepted this.
Brothers and sisters, Today the news of Dengue continues to come.
It is true that Dengue is dangerous but it is very easy to save it.
And I am talking about the Swachh Bharat and it is directly connected with it.
We need advertising on TV.
There is widespread public education in this regard but our attention is not going on.
I would urge you all to say that we should not make death such cheaper.
Life is very precious.
Improving water, satisfaction about sanitation, it is not right that it becomes a cause of death.
Dengue Free Testing facilities are available at around five hundred four centres across the country.
Then cleanliness should be given a lot of importance.
These days, from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali, there is a festival in our country in a way.
Why should not every festival be connected with cleanliness now
You see, Sanskrit will become a nature
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan, but in his heart, the spirit of serving the tribals of India is strong.
These two brothers have enhanced Indias pride.
This year both the brothers won the race.
Indias honour has increased.
I extend my best wishes to these two brothers.
But I am very happy that this entire campaign of them is being done with the intention of eliminating the Time India- Vision for Tribal for tribals.
See, how every person is making efforts to push the country forward
And that is why when we hear such incidents, the chest blooms.
Sometimes due to pursuit of pursuit, we are sitting on a horrific injustice to our youth.
My experience is different in relation to the youth.
Sometimes we talk to the youth and we also get to learn a lot.
I have met many youngsters who say that Brother, I have inspired in life that Sande on Cycle.
Some people say that I have kept a cycle day a week.
Today, I specially want to congratulate the Maharashtra government.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a grand, divine and inspirational monument there.
When Indians traveling around the world go to London, the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar, which is now going to be built by the Maharashtra government, will be our inspiration.
I convey my sadness to the Government of Maharashtra for both these efforts to honour Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Once again after a long distance, we are starting this thing between you and you people, Mann Ki Baat, the talk of the people, the talk of the people, the talk of the people and the people.
Several people used to listen, repeat and sometimes our things used to be inspired for us in the form of a dream of the family of 130 crore Indians in a light environment.
You can imagine that the time between it would have gone and how it would have gone.
Perhaps it wasn't a lifeless program.
I was missing something every moment and when I am talking about Mann Ki Baat, the words may be mine, the sound is mine, but the story is yours, the Purushartha is yours, the prakrama is yours.
I used only my words and my words and because of this I was missing you not this programme.
I was feeling empty.
But wait a lot on Sunday.
Well, the opportunity has been finally found.
In a family environment, Mann Ki Baat, small, light, society and life are the reasons for change.
In a way, this sequence will give birth to a new feeling and in a way it will support the learning of a New India.
I feel myself.
Sometimes I feel that this is my own journey of satisfaction.
This is my journey from Aham to Beyond.
For me, my silent interaction with you was a part of my spiritual journey in a way.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions about why I was going to Kedarnath in the race for elections.
Most of the people have emerged from this political meaning.
For me, it was an opportunity to meet me.
The rest of you are your jealousy, I think that I will also discuss it.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, in the same way, I am constantly feeling in your efforts to strengthen a positive thing.
The letters that come to Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are received are completely different from the regular government work.
Sometimes the task of pushing my thought process forward makes some of your words.
If someone writes for cleanliness then he is also showing his ignorance towards dirt but also describes the efforts of cleanliness.
Somebody discusses the environment, it feels painful but at the same time, he also shows the experiments he has seen and also depicts the imaginations he has in his mind.
That is, in a way, I am feeling a glimpse of how problems are resolved throughout the society.
Mann Ki Baat is like an arrow for the country and the society.
It shows us that there is no dearth of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
It is necessary to incorporate that strength and talent, give opportunity and activate it.
Mann Ki Baat also points out that all 130 crore Indians want to join the development of the country with strength and activeness and I will definitely say that so many letters come to me in Mann Ki Baat, so many telephone calls are received, so many messages are received but the element of complaints is very low and if someone has asked for something for himself, one thing has not come to me in the last five years.
When I analysis of such things, you can imagine, how much joy my heart would have been, how much energy I would have got.
I have not come here, you have brought me, you have helped me and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
Let us go ahead with this feeling of Mann Ki Baat.
When there was a crisis in the country, it was not confined to the political sector, it was not confined to the politicians, the movement was not simultaneous till the burning of the jail.
There was an outrage in the hearts of the people.
There was a thirst for the lost democracy.
When you eat the food day and night, you do not know what is the hungry and what is the enjoyment of the rights of democracy in the normal life then it is known when some democratic rights are snatched away.
Every citizen of the country started feeling that something has been taken away.
Perhaps in any country of the world, everybody from there had voted for democracy, not only for the rest of his rights, rights and requirements but also for the democracy.
At present, the great festival of democracy, a huge election campaign was concluded in our country. From Amir to the poor, everybody was willing to facilitate the future of our country with happiness.
Whenever any thing is close to us, we ignore the importance of it, its amazing facts also become ignorant.
This number can be very common for us but if I say that if we leave China then more than any country in the world had voted in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States, is about two times.
The number of voters in India is more than the population of the entire Europe.
It introduces the vastness and expansiveness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election was the world's largest democratic election in the history so far.
You can imagine how much the requirement of resources and human power would have emerged in fulfilling such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and employees can be elected by day and night hard work.
In order to successfully fulfil this great man of democracy, where about 3 lakh security personnel of the paramilitary forces took their responsibility, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also examined their hard work.
As a result of the hard work of these people, this time more than the last time voting was done.
Approximately 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than one lakh VVPAT machines all over the country can imagine how big Tam-Jam.
All this was done so that it could be ensured that no voter is deprived of his votes.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only one female polling station was constructed.
You will be surprised to know that the officers of the Election Commission had to travel there for two-two days - this is the true honour of democracy.
The highest polling station in the world is also in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is also another fact full of pride in this election.
Perhaps for the first time in history that women have voted with zeal like men.
The percentage of voting for women and men was almost equal in this election.
Another encouraging fact related to this is that today the record 8 is a woman MP in Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the election process and bow down to the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth many times that books are not books, I was urging you to give books instead of flowers in the welcome.
Since then, people have started giving books in many places.
Someone recently gave me a book called Premchand Ki Popular Kahaniya and I felt very good.
Though it was not possible for a long time, but during the visit, I got the opportunity to read some of his stories again.
His interactions that expresses human sentiments in a simple, simple language also touched my mind.
His interactions contain the spirit of the whole of India.
When I was reading his name of drug addiction, my mind went on its own to the economic inequalities in the society.
I remembered the days of my youth how discussions were held on this subject till night.
It is learned from the story of the heroes of the son of the landlord, God and the poor family that if you are not careful then when the effect of the bad world falls, it does not know.
The second interaction that touched my heart was Idgah.
A child's sensitivity, his grandmother's sensitivity, his love for her grandmother, at such a young age.
When the 4-5-year Hamid reaches his grandmother by taking chipies from the fair, the human condolences are really at its peak.
In this context, a live picture of the problem of life of the poor farmers was seen.
Despite their crops being destroyed, the tiny farmer is happy that now he does not have to sleep in the field in the cold winter.
Though this story is almost a century ago, its relevance still seems to be the same.
After reading it, I felt a different kind of experience.
When it is a matter of reading, in some media, I was studying about Kerala's letter library.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village settled in the dense forests of Idukki.
The teacher of the primary school here is P.
Chinnathampi, both of them have worked hard for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by tied in a potato and laddies on the back.
Today this library is showing a new path to everybody along with tribal children.
The Vanche Gujarat campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat.
Millions of people of every age participated in this campaign to read books.
I would also urge you to replace books in your daily daily daily routine after extracting some time in the time of the Google Guru in todays digital world.
You will really enjoy and write on the Narendra Modi App on all the books you read so that every audience of Mann Ki Baat can also know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to note that the people of our country are thinking about the issue which is not only a challenge for the present but also for the future.
I was studying your comments on Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides the Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf, many people have written about the challenges related to water.
Water has a lot of importance in our culture.
Rig Veda's 'Aap: Sukshtam' has been said about water, i.e. water is the source of energy and energy.
Give your blessings like your mother, like your mother, please keep on showering on us.
Many parts of the country are affected every year due to lack of water.
You will be surprised that only 8 of the water received from the rains throughout the year is saved in our country.
8 per cent.
Now the time has come to solve this problem.
I am confident that we will also solve this crisis with the strength, cooperation and determination of 1.
With the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been formed in the country.
This will facilitate speedy decisions on all issues related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to separate something.
I wrote a letter to Sarpanches across the country, to the village Prime Ministers.
I wrote to the Prime Minister that in order to save water, to save water, to save water, to save the drops of rain, they should sit with the villages and talk to them.
I am happy that he showed full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month, millions of people have donated labour in thousands of panchayats.
In the villages, people resolved to collect one drop of water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell you about a Sarpanch.
The people there are once again ready to play their active role in water conservation.
My best wishes to every village Prime Minister, every Sarpanch for his activeness.
There are many Sarpanchs across the country who have paceed the water conservation.
In a way, the entire village has become an opportunity.
It seems that the people of the village have now been engaged in the competition to build a water temple in their villages.
As I said, a lot of positive results of collective efforts can be achieved.
There can be no formula for coming out of water crisis all over the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country.
But everyones goal is the same, and it is to save water, water conservation.
Drainage lines are being fixed in Punjab.
This effort is getting rid of the problem of waterlogging.
The life of the people of the village is changing due to the construction of a tank in the themepalli of Telangana.
There has been a major change in the Kabirdham of Rajasthan from the small lakes built in the fields.
I was studying a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the river Nag.
I have also read about those women of Garhwal who are doing a lot of good work on rainwater Harvesting.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we work together, we can also make the impossible possible.
When people connect, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I am insisting on 3 requests to the countrymen.
My initiatives are insisted that as the countrymen gave Swachhta the form of a mass movement, let us initiate a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us resolve to save every drop of water together and I am confident that water is a prasad of God, water is a form of Paras.
Earlier it was said that with the touch of Paras the iron becomes gold.
I say that water is Paras and by touching water, new life is created.
Initiate a awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Tell them about water related problems, as well as propagate ways to save water.
I specially urge all the stakeholders of different sectors to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Be it the field of films, sports, be it our friends of the media, be it the people associated with social organisations, be it the people associated with cultural organisations, be it the people who are narrating, every person leads this movement in their own way.
Besides society, connect society, connect society with society.
You see, we can see changes in front of your eyes.
My second request to the countrymen is that many traditional methods are being used for the conservation of water in our country for centuries.
I urge all of you to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to the birthplace of Porbandar, worshipped Bapu then there is another house behind the house of worshipped Bapu, there is a 200-year-old water tank and even today there is an arrangement for stopping rain water, then I always used to say that whateverever goes to the Kirti temple, they must look at the water tank.
There will be many such experiments at every place.
Let us make a list of more and more methods related to water conservation and inspire people to conserve water.
You can share your content using JanShakti4JalShaktiheshTag.
My dear countrymen, I also have to thank you for one thing and express my gratitude to the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again, with the activeness of the Yoga Day, the three-three generations of each family from each other, together, celebrated Yoga Day.
The glory of Yoga Day is increasing in the awareness of the Holistic Health Care.
In every corner of the world, as soon as the sun rises, if a Yoga lover welcomes it, then it is the entire journey of sunset.
Perhaps there will be such a place where human beings and not connected to yoga, Yoga has taken the form of such a big one.
In India, from Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from Air Force to Aircraft Carriers, from AC Gyms to Desert Desert, from villages to cities, from wherever possible, not only Yoga has been done, but it has also been collectively celected.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities and common citizens of many countries of the world showed me on Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their own country.
On that day, the world was looking like a very happy family.
We all know that there is a need for healthy and sensitive persons to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures it.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
The announcement of Prime Ministers Awards was a matter of great satisfaction for me to contribute to the promotion and development of Yoga in 2017.
This award has been given to those organisations around the world which you have not even imagined that how they have contributed significantly in the propaganda of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Several Institutes and Training Corps of Japan Yoga Niketan are running or such Ms.
Take the name of Antonietta Rozi, who started the Sarva Yoga International and propagated Yoga throughout Europe.
It is an inspirational example in itself.
If this is a matter related to yoga, can Indians stay behind in it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger has also been honored and it has been dedicated to Yoga for the past several decades.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honoured and established Life Mission and Lokush Yoga University.
The honour of the widespread celebration of Yoga and the message of Yoga, both of them made this Yoga Day special.
It is a big journey for me to connect with your thoughts. Mann Ki Baat is contained.
Come on, let us keep talking.
Keep listening to your feelings, be sure, keep understanding.
Sometimes I keep trying to live those feelings.
Keep getting your blessings.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Come together, enjoying Mann Ki Baat, let us also look at the responsibility of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Ten days ago, Mother India has lost her valorous sons.
We sacrificed ourselves for the protection of millions of Indians.
Our brave sons had made it one day and night so that they can sleep peacefully.
After the martyrdom of the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in the Pulwama terror attack, there is a heart attack and anger among the people and the people of the entire country.
There has been condolences all over the martyrs and their families.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who have saved their lives in protecting Mother India.
All of us have to face the challenges faced by the country by forgetting all the differences of democracy, communalism, territorialism and others so that our steps against terrorism can be much stronger than before.
Our Armed Forces have always been introducing unprecedented courage and courage.
He has unilaterally shown the amazing potential to establish peace.
On the other hand, the attackers have also worked to answer their language.
You must have seen how steps have been taken in 100 hours of the attack.
The Army has resolved to destroy the group of terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspiring issues of his family members have given the entire nation the courage and strength.
Ramniran ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, has inspired us all in this hour of grief.
He said that he will also send his other daughters to fight against the enemy and if needed, he will also fight himself.
The whole country is saluting the unparalleled courage of Meenaji, wife of Shaheed Prashan Sahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
They have also sworn to file one of their daughters in CRPF.
When the Parthiva Deh of Shaheed Vijay Soren reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his mother-in-law said that I will also join the foz.
The spirit of this month expresses the feeling of one child in the whole of India.
Such feelings are being seen in the house of our brave martyrs.
I urge the younger generation to know and understand the spirit that these families have shown.
We do not need to go to an ancient event of history.
Shri Omkar Shetty ji of Karnataka, who has emerged on the Narendra Modi App, expressed his happiness for the formation of the National War Memorial (National War Memorial).
I was also surprised and painful that there was no national war memorial in India.
This is a memorial where the bravery of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation can be preserved.
I decided that such a memorial should be sure in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial (National War Memorial) and I am happy that this memorial has been built in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, we will dedicate this national military memorial to our army.
The country will make such a small effort to repay its debt.
A new monument has been constructed at the heart of Delhi that means that place where Indiagate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are located.
I am confident that it will be right for us to go to any pilgrimage to this national military memorial for the countrymen.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the nation towards those who sacrificed the highest sacrifice after independence.
The design of the memorial shows the indomitable courage of our soldiers.
The martyr of Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the soldiers.
The second is the Circle bravery cycle that expresses the courage and bravery of the soldiers.
After that, there is a liberation chakra.
These circles showcase the sacrifices of the soldiers.
The names of soldiers who sacrificed the highest sacrifice for the country are written in golden letters.
After that, the defence chakra shows security.
This circle contains dense trees.
The identity of the National Military Memorial will emerge as a place where people will be aimed at studying their gratitude to know about the great martyrs of the country.
Those who have laid down their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and developed.
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country.
In October last year, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our thoughts under which we believe that the country should be grateful to the men and women who are busy in our security.
I hope you will need to see the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, my thousands of newspapers and comments keep on reading through different mediums.
Whenever I was studying your comments this time, I remembered Atish Mukhopadhyay ji's very interesting tip.
He has written that when the British had arrested Birsa Munda on 3rd March, 1900, he was only 25 years old.
Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshed ji Tata on 3rd March.
He further writes that these two personalities are completely from different family backgrounds who have enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
It is right to bow down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand in a way of paying tribute to Birsa Munda and Jamshed ji Tata in Mann Ki Baat.
These two great personalities have not only illuminated the name of Jharkhand but also the entire country.
The whole country is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youth need an inspiring personality for guidance then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
Whenever he was sleeping, the British hid him very carefully.
Do you know why did the British take the shelter of such a cruel activity
Because the British who raised such a large empire were also scared of them.
Lord Birsa Munda suppressed the British rule adorned with guns and cannons only with his traditional tiredness.
In fact, whenever people get an inspiring leadership, the collective will of the people is overwhelmed by the power of the armed forces.
Lord Birsa Munda did not fight against the British only for political freedom.
But they also fought for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
They have done all this in their short life.
In the blind life of deprived and exploited, he shined like the sun.
Lord Birsa Munda gave his sacrifice only by the younger age of 25 years.
The sons of Mother India like Birsa Munda have been in all parts of the country.
There should not be any corner of India, where no one has contributed to this struggle for centuries of independence.
But fortunately, the words of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice are not reached to the new generation.
If we realize our existence as a person like Lord Birsa Munda, then the dignitaries like Jamshed ji Tata gave the country a bigger institution.
Jamshed ji Tata was really a visionary person who not only saw the future of India but also laid the foundation for it.
He knew very well that it was his vision to make India a centre of science technology and industry.
As a result, the Institute of Science has been established, which is now called the Indian Institute of Science (Indian Institute of Science).
Not only this, he also established world-class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bhai Desai was born on February 27.
You all know that this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai Desai, owner of comfortable and peaceful personality, was one of the most eminent leaders of the country.
In independent India, Vikram is the name of Morarjibhai Desaina to present the largest budget in Parliament.
Morarji Desai led India in such a difficult time when it was a threat to the democratic tension of the country.
Morarji Bhai Desai fluttered in a movement against complications for the protection of democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price even in old age.
The government of that time had arrested him and put him in jail.
But when he won the Janta Party elections in 1971, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The Amendment also added that the jurisdiction of the fundamental rights obtained under Section 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be violated during the period.
For the first time, it was arranged that only after the written recommendations of the Cabinet, the President will announce the crisis and it was also decided that the period of deficit could not be extended for more than six months once.
Thus, Morarji Bhai ensured that the manner in which the democracy was killed in the 15th century cannot be repeated in the future.
The future generations will always remember their invaluable contribution in maintaining the month of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, people were very keen on Padma Awards this year too.
Today we are moving forward on the path of a New India, we want to honour those people who are doing their work at the foundation level.
With their hard work, those who are bringing about positive changes in the lives of others.
In fact, he is a true workforce who is unsuccessful in the service of the nation and in front of the public service, social service and all this.
I want to tell you about some such people.
Speaking about Abdul Gafur Khatri ji of Gujarat, he worked amazing to revive the traditional illness of Kutch.
He is doing a great job to bring this rare painting to the new generation.
The Trie of Life (Life Tree) architecture made by Abdul Gafur was presented to former US President Barack Obama.
In the achievement of Padma Puraskar, Sabhid Sayed of Marathawad is known as the servant of Gaumata.
The way he has delivered his entire life into the service of Goddess Gau Mata is strange.
You will be surprised to hear the Tao Porchon-Lynch of America. Linch has become a living organisation of Yoga today.
Even at the age of 100, he is training people from all over the world, and till now, one and a half thousand people have been made Yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, known as Lady Tarzon in Jharkhand, worked adventurously to combat Timber's forgiveness and counterfeiters. He not only saved 50 hectares of wildlife but also inspired ten thousand women to protect trees and wildlife.
Despite being Divyang himself, it is difficult to find an example of the work he did for the upliftment of Divyang women and establishing an institution named Pragyachakshu Mahila Seva Kunj and renewing the renewed work of making the eyeless children self-sufficient.
He has presented an example to make women empowerment and farming beneficial.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women of their area to join the Self Help Group and make them economically prosperous.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk about the experience of those who have been experienced for the past few days.
Today, whenever I go to the country, I have been trying to meet some beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, the scheme of Ayushman Bharat.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme.
I have seen how big change is coming in the lives of the poor.
If you are all aware of such a poor person who is unable to treat him with the lack of money then tell him about this scheme.
This scheme is for every poor person.
My dear countrymen, the time of testing in schools is in the beginning.
Different education boards across the country will launch operations for examination of 10th and 12th grade board in the next few weeks.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the students of the examination providers, their admirers and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a very big event of examination-pay discussion in Delhi was held in the form of a Townhole.
The speciality of the Exam Pe Charge Programme was that there was open interaction on various subjects related to the exam.
Some aspects have come up which are certainly beneficial for students.
If all the students can see this entire programme on their parents and teachers on the U-Tube then my best wishes to all the warriors of the examination for the next examination.
My dear countrymen, be it a matter of India and not a matter of festivals
Perhaps there is no such day in our country that there is no significance for which there is no festival.
Because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture.
After a few days, the festival of Mahashivaratri will come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and whenever Shivratri is on Monday, a special significance of it will be brought into our mind temple.
My best wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of this Shivaratri.
My dear countrymen, I went to Kashi a few days ago and I got the opportunity to spend time with Divyang brothers and sisters.
So, he said, I am smiling the Prime Minister.
I was indeed very impressed by the power of the Divyang youth.
My dear countrymen, I have had a unique experience for connecting you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Through Radio, I meet millions of families in a way every month.
Sometimes while talking to you all, reading your letters or listening to the thoughts sent on your phones, I feel like giving me a share of your family.
This is a very pleasant experience for me.
Friends election is a great festival of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy with all the elections.
And for years, I will continue to talk with you.
Once again I express my heartfelt thanks to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on the 21st of this month, the country received a very sad news.
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to the service of the society.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us that it is equal to Lord Shiva's residence in Kailasam Dhaam to be responsible for hard work.
His fame was a scholar who had a wonderful pucca on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He laid down his entire life behind the objective that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
Every kind of welfare of the farmers was the priority of Swamiji's life.
Siddhganga Math organized animals and agricultural fairs regularly.
I have been fortunate to receive the blessings of Param Pujya Swamiji several times.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for Pujya Swamiji on this occasion.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shiv Kumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhganga Math beautifully.
Once again, I pay my tribute to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country, which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our democracy. I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
There is no stone unturned in ensuring that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, gets an opportunity to vote.
When we hear that polling stations are set up in Himachal Pradesh with a height of 15,000 feet from sea level, then arrangements are made in remote islands in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Just for a voter
When we hear these things, it is natural to be proud of the Election Commission.
He takes care of a voter, he gets the opportunity to use his voter rights, so that the entire team of Election Commission workers goes to the remote areas and arranges for voting and that is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for continuously making efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the polling process and ensure independent and indirect elections.
This year, the Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country. This will be the first time that the youth born in the 21st century will use their votes in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have got the opportunity to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are going to be a part of the decision-making process in the country.
The time has come to connect our dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register themselves as a voter if they are eligible to vote.
Every one of us should realize that becoming a voter in the country, achieving the right to vote, is one of the important accomplishments of life.
At the same time, it is my duty to vote - this feeling should continue in us.
There should be a lot of pain if you can never donate votes in life because of any reason.
You should be sad whenever you see something wrong in the country.
I urge the well-known participants of the country to make the people aware about the registration of the voter or voting on the day of polling.
I hope that a large number of youth will register as a voter and strengthen our democracy with their partnership.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated his Jayanti in a different manner.
On Netaji's Jayanti, I got the opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the brave people who contributed to the struggle for India's freedom.
You know that many rooms and buildings have been closed since independence inside the Red Fort.
The rooms of the closed Red Fort have been converted into a very beautiful museum, dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, the Museum dedicated to the first freedom struggle of Yaad-e-Jalian and 185-India and this entire complex has been dedicated to the nation as the Kranti Mandir.
In one brick of these museums, the aroma of our glorious history is settled.
The synonym of the museum inspires us to visit the history of the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle.
The brave sons of Mother India - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dillon and Major General Shahnawaz had conducted cases at this place.
When I was visiting the memories associated with Netaji in the Kranti temple in the Red Fort, the members of Netaji gave me a very special hat.
Netaji used to wear this hat.
I preserved the hat in the museum so that people visiting there also look at the hat and inspire them to patriotism.
In fact, the bravery and patriotism of his heroes needs to be repeated to the new generations.
Just a month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
In a programme, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had flown the tricolor five years ago.
Thus, when the tricolor was furious on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there was a tradition on 15th August.
This was the occasion to complete 5 years of the organisation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled organization.
A brave soldier who played an important role in the freedom struggle.
Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian with Ozsvi sources such as 'Dilli Chalo', 'Tum Muze Khun Dee', 'Man Tummeh Freedom Dunga'.
For many years, it was expected that files associated with Netaji should be made public and I am happy that we can do that.
I remember that day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together, we did a lot of things related to Netaji and paid tribute to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop several places connected to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 Alipur rod connected to Babasaheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel museum or it is a Kranti Mandir.
If you go to Delhi then you must go to see these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to call you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered it an important medium to connect the radio with the people as Netaji also had a close relationship with the radio and he also chose the radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu launched the Azad Hind Radio and interacted with the soldiers of Azad Hind Fauj and the people of the country through Radio.
I was told that it was also broadcasting the radio station, weekly news bulletins which lived in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
The Radio Station is being operated by M.
Vyas ji played a very important role.
The programmes being broadcast on the Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes also strengthened our freedom fighters.
A visual museum has also been built in this revolution temple.
This effort has been made to showcase Indian art and culture in a very attractive way.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 paintings and art workshops have been placed there.
The museum showcases the excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendra Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Seloz Mukherjee.
And I would specially urge you to visit there and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you will be thinking that things are happening here and I am talking to you about the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made pictures on many topics.
He has also made pictures of animal birds, he has also made pictures of many beautiful scenes and afterwards he also worked to bring human characters to Canvas through art.
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to his most works.
He believed that those who see their pictures themselves understand those pictures, see the messages given by them in pictures from their own perspective.
Their pictures have also been exhibited in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope you will need to see their pictures in the Kranti temple.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have given a message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and works.
There was such a saint - Sant Ravidas.
Ravidas Jayanti is on 1st February.
The Doha of Saint Ravidas ji is very famous.
Sant Ravidas ji gave a big message through a few lines.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every human being, it is not right to share them on caste, creed and other social bases.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the sacred land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji tried to understand the importance of labour and labour in his entire lifetime through his message.
It is not wrong to say that they have explained the real meaning of the prestige of labour to the world.
He used to say, "Man Changa then Kathauti I have Ganga meaning if your mind and heart are sacred then Sakshat God resides in your heart.
The messages of Saint Ravidas Ji have influenced every level, every section of the people. Be it the Maharaja of Chittor or the queen of Chittor or Meerabai, all of them were his followers.
Once again I bow down to Sant Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidre has written on MyGov that I have highlighted the aspects related to Indias space programme and its future.
He also wanted me to enjoy the students in the space programme and urge them to think of going ahead of the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate your thoughts and special messages for our children.
A few days ago, I was Ahmedabad, where I was fortunate to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud of the fact that the satellites developed by our students and sounding rockets are reaching the space today.
The Kalam-Set launched by our students on 24th January has been launched.
The Sounding Rockets built by the students of the University in Odisha have also made several records.
Since the independence of the country, the kind of space missions have been launched in the last four years.
We have also created a world Vikram to launch 104 satellites simultaneously along with a single spacecraft.
We will soon recall Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign.
Our country is using space technology in a beautiful way in protecting lifestyle.
Whether it is a pleasant vehicle or rail and road safety, all these are getting a lot of help from space technology.
Navic developments have been shared among our fishermen brothers who are helpful in their safety as well as economic progress.
We are using space technology to improve the delivery and responsibilities of government services.
Approximately 40 lakh houses of 23 states have been enrolled in this scheme.
At the same time, about three and a half crore wealth under Manrega has also been jeo tagged.
Our satellites are today a symbol of the growing strength of the country.
It contributes a lot to our better relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative which has provided gifts to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through our boundary competitive launch services, India today not only launches satellites of developing countries but also of developed countries.
The sky and stars are always attractive for children.
Our space programme gives children an opportunity to think bigger and move ahead of the borders which were considered impossible till now.
It is a vision to keep our children watching stars and inspire in search of new stars.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that the sportspersons will play and this time many young and young sportspersons have come forward in Khelo India.
In the month of January, about 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
When the sportsperson performs the best at the local level, he will also showcase the best globally.
This time in Khelo India, the sportspersons of every State have performed well at their own level.
The life of many sportspersons who win medals is very inspiring.
In Mukkabaji, the young sportsperson Akash Gorkha won a silver medal and I was studying that the father of the sky, Ramesh ji, works as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
So, the under-21 female cubed team of Maharashtra is a resident of Sonali Helvi Satara.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged Sonalina Hunar.
Sometimes it is seen that dogs do not get such a boost in sports like Kabddi.
Nevertheless, Sonali chose Kabddi and performed excellently.
The ten-year innovative show of Asanasol is the youngest medal winner of the Khelo India Youth Games.
A farmer's daughter Akshata Baswani won a gold medal in weightlifting.
When we are talking about the creation of India, it is the resolve of youth power that is a New India.
These stories of Khelo India are showing that the people of big cities are not only contributing to the creation of New India but also the youth, children, youth sports talents from small towns and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot of prestigious beauty competitions.
But have you heard about the competition to shine the toilet
Hey, more than 50 lakh toilets have also taken part in a unique competition that lasted for nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is the clean beautiful toilet.
With the help of keeping the toilet clean, people are making it beautiful by making some paintings and you will also be seen on social media from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup.
I urge all Sarpanchs and Village Prime Ministers to lead this campaign in their Panchayat.
Definitely shart on social media along with MyIzatGhar, the news of your clean beautiful toilet.
Friends, On 2nd October 2014, we started a memorable journey together to free our country from clean and open defecation.
With the collaboration of the people of India, today, India is moving towards becoming open defecation free long before 2nd October, 2019, to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
In this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat, the audience of Mann Ki Baat has also contributed a lot and therefore, with you all, it is heartening to note that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and 6000 districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and have crossed 8 of Swachhta coverage in rural India and about nine crore families have been provided toilets.
My young friends, the days of examinations will come.
Ansul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about the tests and tests.
Ansul ji, thank you for taking up this issue.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is a period of examination.
Students, from their parents to teachers, many people are busy in the work related to examinations.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would like to discuss this subject today in this programme of Mann Ki Baat but you would be happy to know that I would like to interact with students from all over the country in the Praksha Pe Charcha programme two days later on January 2, at 11 a.m.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this programme.
I will talk to my young friends about all aspects related to the exams, especially the stress-free exams in this Exam Pay Dialogue.
I had urged people to send inputs and ideas for this and I am very happy that a large number of people are holding their thoughts on MyGov.
I will keep some of these ideas and suggestions before you during the Town Hall Programme.
You must be a part of this program...
You will also be able to see its live broadcast through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, on 30th January is the death anniversary of worshipped Bapu.
At 11 o'clock, the entire nation pays tributes to the martyrs.
We must pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes wherever we are.
Remember the holy reverence of Pujya Bapu and fulfilling the dreams of revered Bapu, building a New India, determining his duties as a citizen - let us move forward with this resolve.
Make this 2019 journey successfully moved forward.
My best wishes to you all and my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
What should we do so that we can bring about changes in our lives and contribute to furthering the country and the society.
My best wishes to all of you for the year 2019.
You must have thought how to remember the year 2019.
It is also important to remember how India will remember as a nation in 2019 as its capabilities of 1.
It is a pride to all of us.
In 2018, the world's largest health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat started.
Electricity has reached every village of the country.
The world's dignitaries have acknowledged that India is freeing the country from poverty on the path of immense speed.
With the immense resolve of the countrymen, cleanliness coverage is moving towards crossing 5.
For the first time from the Red Fort after independence, the tricolor was hoisted on the 5th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
In the honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who felicitated the country in the form of unity, the world's highest statue was found by the Statue of Unity.
The name of the country has risen in the world.
The nation was awarded the UN's highest environmental award with the Champions of the East Award.
Indias efforts in the Solar Energy and Climate Change have been ranked in the world.
The country's self-reservation has got new strength.
This year, our country has successfully completed the Nuclear Triad, so now we have become accomplished in all the waters, places and rivers.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by touring the entire world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
Indias first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the field of waterways.
The longest rail-road bridge of the country was dedicated to the nation, which started the first and the country's 100 Maa Airport - Packyong.
India won the Under-1 Cricket World Cup and Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India won a large number of medals in Asian Games.
India has also performed a lot in Para Asian Games.
However, if I keep talking about the men and our collective endeavours of every Indian, then our mind will be so long that perhaps 2019 will come.
All this is possible with the efforts of 130 crore Indians.
I hope that even in 2019, this journey of Indias progress and progress will continue and our country will be able to reinforce new heights with greater strength.
My dear countrymen, in December this year we lost some extraordinary countrymen.
Dr. Jayachandran was known for providing cheaper treatment to the poor.
People say that they were always ready for the treatment of the patient.
They also used to pay for the old patients coming to their treatment.
I'm thebeterindia.
He has read about many such works that inspire the society on the Com website.
Similarly, on December 25, the demise of Sulagitti Narasamma in Karnataka was reported.
Sulagitti Narasamma was a helper to help pregnant mothers and sisters in delivery.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the remote areas.
In the beginning of this year, he was honored with Padmashree.
There are many inspiring personalities like Dr. Jayachandran and Sulagitti Narasamma who have dedicated their lives for the wishes of everyone in the society.
When we talk of health care, I would like to discuss the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In the past, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors of the city are treating the poor free of cost by imposing camps.
Today, hundreds of poor patients are benefiting from this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctors friends associated with selfless service is really commendable.
Today, I am proudly saying that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign due to collective efforts.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the Swachhta Abhiyan in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I learnt about Jayachandran and when I get the opportunity then thebeterindia.
I will continue to try to know such inspiring things by going to the com.
I am glad that today there are several websites that are introducing us with many stories inspiring the lives of such observations.
Like thepositiveIndia.
Com is working to spread positiveness in society and make society more sensitive.
I am confident that more and more people will be able to know about our heroes who transform society.
It is easier to spread negativeness but a lot of good work is being done around us in the society and it is being done by the collective efforts of all 130 crore Indians.
Sports has a vital significance in every society.
When sports are played, the mind of the audience is also filled with energy.
We have experienced many things in the name, identification and respect of the players.
However, sometimes there are many things behind it that move ahead of sports and are very big.
I would like to talk about a daughter of Kashmir Hanaya Visar, who has won the Golden Championship in Karate Championship in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and is a resident of Anantnagar in Kashmir.
Hanaya studied hard work and hard work and demonstrated himself by observing it a mild observation.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for a bright future.
My best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, there has been a lot of discussions in the media about a 16-year-old daughter-in-law.
You must have read.
Rajni has won the Gold in the Junior Women's Mukkabaji competition.
Rajney won a medal and drink a glass of milk on a stall of milk.
After that, Rajni dragged his medal into a cloth and put it in a bag.
I am thinking that why did Rajni drink one glass of milk
He did this in honor of his father Jasmer Singh ji, he sold lassi on a stall of Panipat.
Rajni said that her father has sacrificed her to reach here and has suffered a lot.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work before his brothers and sisters arose in the morning.
When Rajni expressed his desire to learn boxing in front of his father, the father encouraged him to get all possible help for him.
Razni had to start Mukkebaji studies with old folds because at that time his family had no better economic condition.
Despite all such disputes, Mukkebaji did not lose the pride of the holiday.
He has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Razni.
And I congratulate his parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani ji for supporting and enhancing the spirit of Rajni.
This month, a 20-year-old daughter of Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni has become the fastest Asian touring the world from Cycle.
He used to run around 300 kilometres of cycles daily for 15 days.
Do we not get inspired by knowing about this kind of achievement
Especially my young friends, when we listen to such incidents, we also inspire to do something among the problems.
If there is power in the resolve, enthusiasm is full then the obstacles are lost themselves.
Problems can never be obstacles.
If we hear many such examples then we also get a new inspiration every moment in our lives.
My fellow countrymen, there are several festivals full of fervor and enthusiasm in January like Lohdi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi
During the period, Surya gets down and enters Makar Rashi.
After this day the day starts to grow gradually and the cold crop starts to be cut off.
My best wishes to our farmer brothers and sisters.
The spirit of unity in diversity, the spirit of Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat is integrated by our festivals.
We can see how many festivals and festivals are associated with nature.
In the Indian culture, society and nature are not considered to be different and there is only one person and the harmony here.
It is a good example of our close relationship with nature and a calendar based on festivals.
There is also a list of planets along with festivals.
This traditional calendar shows how old our relationship with natural and astronomical events is.
The date of festivals and festivals is determined according to the moon and sun calendar based on the speed of the moon and the sun.
It depends on which calendar is considered.
In many areas, festivals are also celebrated as per the condition of the planet maps.
All these festivals are celebrated on the basis of the sun calendar, when the Tamil Puthand, Vishnu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Pila Baisak, Bihu are celebrated on the basis of the sun calendar.
In many of our festivals, the spirit of rivers and water conservation is specially incorporated.
Sixth festival - rivers and ponds are connected to the sunrise.
Even on Makar Sankranti, millions of people dip in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals also give us understanding of social values.
On the one hand, its archaeological significance, on the other hand, every festival teaches the inspiration to live with brotherhood with each other very easily.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the year 2019 and wish you all to enjoy the coming festivals.
Share the details taken on these festivals with everyone so that everyone can see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of things in our culture that we can pride and showcase the whole world with pride and one of them is the Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
Even in films, it would have seen a lot about its magnificence and vastness and it would also be true. The form of Kumbh is unique as divine as it is.
The people of the country and the world come and join the Kumbh.
The people of faith and faith rise in the Kumbh Mela.
Millions of people from across the country are connected to one place together.
The tradition of Kumbh is blossomed and flourished with our great cultural heritage.
This time, on 15th January, the World Famous Kumbh Mela will be organised in Prayagraj, which you might have been waiting with a lot of enthusiasm.
The silsilo for the Kumbh Mela has started from now on.
Its global significance can also be estimated from the fact that last year, UNESCO has marked the Kumbh Mela in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, the Ambassadors of several countries saw the preparations for the Kumbh, where the national flags of several countries were hoisted together.
The Kumbh Mela organised in Prayagraj is likely to visit more than 150 countries.
With the divineity of the Kumbh, Indias magnificence will spread its color throughout the world.
This can be a very big learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparation of the Kumbh is going on with a lot.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic for the Kumbh.
There I dedicated the Integrated Commond Control Centre and the devotees will get a lot of help in it.
This time, there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in the Kumbh.
If there is a cleaning of faith in the event then a good message will reach far and wide.
This time every devotees will also be able to visit Akshayvad after a sacred bath in the confluence.
The symbol of the faith of the people was this Akshayvad in the fort for hundreds of years, whose devotees could not visit.
Now the doors of Akshayvad have been opened for all.
I appeal to you all that when you come to Kumbh, you must keep on different aspects of the Kumbh and on social media so that more and more people get inspired to go to Kumbh.
The Kumbh of spirituality becomes the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
This Kumbh will also be the Kumbh of nationality.
This Kumbh of devotees also becomes the Mahakumbh of global tourists.
This Kumbh of artisticism also becomes a great Kumbh of creative powers.
Poojaya Bapu and South Africa have a unique relationship.
He was South Africa from where he became Mohan, Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi had started his first Satyagraha and stood firmly in opposition to colorful differences.
He also established Finnics and Tolstoy Forms, from where peace and justice have emerged all over the world.
2018 is also being celebrated as the birth centenary year of Nelson Mandela, who was also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela was an example of the colourful struggle all over the world and who was the inspirations of Mandela
He had received the courage and inspiration of spending such a year in jail only from Poojay Bapu.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only inspiration for the world but their ideals also encourage us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, on the Narmada coast of Gujarat, there was a positive discussion with the police personnel of the country where the world's highest statue is the Statue of Unity.
What kind of steps should be taken to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen were discussed in detail.
At that time, I also announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for National Unity and this award will be given to those who have contributed to national unity in any form.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He always tried to keep Indias integrity intact.
Sardar Saheb believed that the power of India is in the diversity here.
Honouring that spirit of Sardar Patel Ji, I pay tribute to him through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, on January 13, Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary is auspicious.
Guru Govind Singh ji was born in Patna.
For a long time of his life, his land was north India and he sacrificed his life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
The birthplace in Patna, the Karmabhoomi in north India and the last moment of life in Nanded.
In a way, he received his blessings throughout India.
If they look at their lifetime then they get a glimpse of the whole of India.
After the martyrdom of his father Guru Teg Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji had achieved the post of Guru in the short age of New Year.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice from Sikh Gurus.
He was a peaceful and simple personality but whenever an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the vulnerable people, Guru Gobind Singh ji had strongly condemned his voice for the poor and the vulnerable people and hence it is said: 'Seven lakhs to one fight, 'Chidio Son Baj Tudauntbe Govind Singh'
He said that strength cannot be exhibited by fighting with the weaker sections.
Shri Govind Singh ji knew that the biggest service is to remove human sufferings.
He was a divine man full of valour, valour, sacrifice, religion, who had an intellectual knowledge of both weapons and sciences.
He was a pilgrimage, along with many languages including Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I bow down to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
That is, Food Safety and Standard Authority of India is happening.
Several events are being organized across the country on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In this series, F.
Under the Eat Right India Campaign, healthy India tours are coming out across the country.
The expedition will be run by 2nd January.
India will also be prosperous when India is clean and healthy.
The most important for good health is nutritious food.
You also participate in it and especially I would urge the children to show these things.
Important education of food habits is essential since childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the last programme of 2018.
In 2019, we will meet again, talk of mind again, the life of a person, the life of a nation, the life of a society, the inspiration is the basis of progress.
Come, new inspiration, new zeal, new resolve, new heights, new heights, move forward, move forward, change yourself, change the country too, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On 3rd October 2014, the holy festival of Vijayadashmi, through Mann Ki Baat, we all started a journey together.
This 50 episode of Mann Ki Baat has been completed.
Similarly, today this is the Golden Jubilee Application-Golden Jubilee Application.
The letters and phones you have received this time are mostly in respect of this 50th episode.
Likewise, the Manika Jain of Delhi, Bardwan of Delhi, Prasanjit Sarkar of West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur have asked about a similar question on the Narendra Modi App.
They say that many times people connect you with latest technology, social media and mobile apps, but why did you choose radio to connect with people
Your quest is very natural that when the radio had forgotten in today's era, why did Modi come with radio
I was in the month of November and I was going to some other place while traveling in the evening.
In the mountains of Himachal, it gets cold in the evening, then on a dhaba on the way, I stayed for tea and when I ordered tea, before that it was very small, the same person himself used to make tea and sell it.
There was no cloth on top.
The same was standing on the edge of the rod with a small larier.
He said, not just, Saheb doesn't know what, it is a matter of great happiness.
I didn't understand anything, he said, Listen to Saheb Radio, discussions were going on on on the radio.
Access to Communications and its depths, perhaps no one can correct the radio.
This thing has been housed in my mind since that time and the power of this thing has come to me only then.
And when I became the elder Prime Minister, it was very natural for me to take care of the most powerful medium.
And when I took over as a Prime Minister in May 2014, I wished that the unity of the country, our magnificent history, its bravery, the diversity of India, the serpent of our society, the purity of the people, the penance of the people, the penance of the people, all these things should be delivered to the people.
From remote villages to metropolitan cities, from farmers to young professionals.
At present, Akashwani also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen some of these talents which are very interesting.
Out of those who have been surveyed, average of 70 are those who listen to Mann Ki Baat regularly.
Most of the people feel that the biggest contribution of Mann Ki Baat is that it has increased the feeling of positiveness in the society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, peoples movements have been encouraged at large.
There is also a comprehensive discussion on India Positive.
It also reflects the feelings of positiveness and emotions of the people of our country.
People have also expressed their experience that the feeling of doing something with voluntaryism has increased from Mann Ki Baat.
Along with Radio, Mobile, Internet, Fassbook Live and Pariscope, Narendra Modi is also connecting Mann Ki Baat through App.
I convey my heartfelt gratitude to all of you from Mann Ki Baat for expressing confidence in it and becoming a part of it.
Your apprehension is true.
In fact, if the leader gets a mic and if he is listening to millions of crores then what should he do
Some young friends studied on all the topics in Mann Ki Baat, they analyzed the words of all applications, laxical analysis and studied how many times the words were spoken.
Which words were repeatedly spoken.
One of his stars is that this programme has been undemocratic.
When Mann Ki Baat was started, I had decided that there was no politics in it, neither the government was praised in it, nor there was Modi anywhere in it and the biggest strength to fulfill my resolve, the biggest inspiration was received from you.
Modi will come and go away, but this country will remain at all, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
This will take the country to new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
There will be so much power of any government that the zombesh of Selfiewitchdaughter will start from a small village in Haryana and spread not only across the country but also abroad.
Every section of the society, celebrity, all joins and in a new, modern language of conversion in the society, which is considered to be the generation of today.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat also enjoys but in my mind, there are always 130 crore people living.
His mind is my heart.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government matter, it is a matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is aspirational India, aspirational India.
India's original life is not politics but India's original life is also not power.
Indias original life is social policy and social power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life and one side of politics is also there.
It is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes the incidents and politicians of politics are so much that other talents and other talents of the society are buried.
It is the collective responsibility of all of us and Mann Ki Baat is a soft and small effort in this direction.
Your question is in a way a question of self-confidence.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are not asking questions to the elderly Prime Minister, as if you are asking questions to one of your friends.
If I answer the questions you have asked, then I will say nothing.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple task for me.
Every time people's letters come before Mann Ki Baat.
People share their views on Mai Gov and Narendra Modi Mobile App. There is also a toll free number - 1800 1180.
People also record their messages in their voices by calling there.
As the Mann Ki Baat episode comes closer, I read the ideas and information sent by you during the visit very slightly.
And because of this, when I read the letter, I can easily connect that place and context with myself.
Later, I recall some factors like the name of the village, the name of the person, etc.
Ask the truth, I have made a voice in Mann Ki Baat but examples, emotions and feelings are of my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not been able to take the name of Mann Ki Baat till now, but they keep sending their letters and comments without being disappointed - your thoughts, your feelings have a lot of importance in my life.
I am confident that I will get many more things from before and make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, more effective and useful.
It is also tried that the letters which are not included in Mann Ki Baat will also focus on letters and suggestions.
With his hard work, Mann Ki Baat reaches more and more people.
The team of Akashwani prepares every application for broadcasting in many languages.
Some people efficiently describe Mann Ki Baat in the sound of Modi in regional languages and in the same ton.
In this way, he becomes Narendra Modi for just 30 minutes.
I also congratulate those people for their talent and skills.
I would urge you all to listen to this programme in your local languages too.
I would like to heartily congratulate my friends of the media who have regularly broadcast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
No political media is ever happy, he feels that he gets a lot of coverage or the coverage that is available is negative, but the media has made many subjects raised in Mann Ki Baat.
Cleanliness, Road Safety, Drugs Free India, Selfie with Doctors are many topics that the media has worked to move forward as a new campaign.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat remains incomplete.
In fact, I don't have any mystery.
Whatever I am doing will also happen in all the families.
In a simple language, I try to put myself in that youth and try to make a vibrant and compassionate approach with its ideas.
It is the old bag of our own life, when it does not come in between then it becomes easier to understand anyone.
The youngsters of today are very good that they don't do anything that they don't believe in themselves and when they believe in something, then they leave everything behind it.
Many times people discuss the Communication Gap between adults and youth in families.
In fact, the interaction with the youth in most of the families is very limited.
In most of the times, the talk of learning or habits or lifestyles is such a hurdle, the talk of open minds has started gradually decreasing in the families and it is also a matter of concern.
Discussion will be effective instead of expedition and dismissing.
I have been trying to interact with the youth through different programmes or social media.
I have always been trying to learn what they are doing or thinking.
They always have a store of ideas.
They are extremely energetic, innovative and focused.
I try to share the efforts of the youth through Mann Ki Baat and their words more and more.
Many times there is a complaint that the youth ask a lot of questions.
I am saying that it is good that the new ones make a question.
This is a good thing because it means that they want to check from the roots of all things.
Some people say that there is no patience in the youth, but I believe that there is no time for youngsters to wed. This is the same thing that helps youngsters to become more innovative today because they want to do things faster.
We feel that todays youngsters are very ambitious and think a lot of big things.
It is good to see big dreams and achieve great successes.
Finally, this is the New India.
Some people say that younger generations want to do many things at the same time.
I say what's wrong with it
They are transparent in multitasking, so they do this.
Whether it is a social internship or a start-up or a sports or any other sector or a society that makes a big change.
Those youngsters who showed the courage to ask questions and dream a big dream.
If we throw the ideas of the youth on the ground and provide an open environment to express them, they can bring about positive change in the country and they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to Vinita ji has written on Mai Gov that in Mann Ki Baat tomorrow i. e.
He says that this day is special because we are going to enter the 70th year of adoption of the Constitution.
Vinita ji, thank you for your suggestions.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constituent Day.
The day to recall the great legends that made our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1944.
The Constituent Assembly took two years 11 months and one days to complete this historic task of building the Constitution.
Please imagine that within three years these great personalities have given us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
The extraordinary pace that he built the Constitution is still an example of time management and productivity.
It also inspires us to fulfill our responsibilities in record time.
The Constituent Assembly was the confluence of the great talents of the country, each of them was committed to giving a Constitution to the country so that the people of India should be empowered and the poorest of the poor should also be empowered.
The special thing in our Constitution is that the rights and duties i. e. Rights and Duties have been detailed.
The coordination of both of them will take the country forward in the lives of citizens.
If we respect the rights of others then our rights will be protected automatically and if we follow our duties in the Constitution, then our rights will be protected automatically.
I still remember that when 60 years of the Republic of India were completed in 2010, in Gujarat, we had taken out the splendor of the Constitution by keeping the elephant on the elephant.
It was a memorable occasion to enhance awareness about the constitution of the youth and connect them with the aspects of the Constitution.
We will complete 70 years as a Republic in 2020 and will complete 5 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us all move forward the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, talking about the Constituent Assembly, the contribution of the great man can never be forgotten which was at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
His Excellency Day is 6th December.
I salute Babasaheb on behalf of all the countrymen who have given the right to live with respect to crores of Indians.
The democracy lived in Babasaheb's nature and he used to say that India's democratic values have not come from outside.
What is the democracy and what is the parliamentary system - it has never been a new thing for India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he had a very emotional appeal that we have to protect our freedom after such a struggle till the last drop of our blood.
He also used to say that we may be Indians of different backgrounds, but we must keep the interest of the country above all things.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on November 23, all of us have celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and we are going to celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in the coming year i. e.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought for the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showcased the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony to the society.
Similarly, a train will also be run on the path of holy places associated with Guru Nanak Devji.
Recently, when I was holding a meeting related to it, I remembered Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara at that time.
It was a great loss to the Gurudwara during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, but the way the state government had renovated it in collaboration with the locals is still an example.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit the sacred place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Pakistan, Kartarpur.
My dear countrymen, after 50 applications, we will meet again in the next Mann Ki Baat and I am confident that today I got the opportunity to keep the feelings behind Mann Ki Baat in front of you for the first time because you have asked such questions, but our journey will continue.
The more connected with you, our journey will be deeper and will be satisfactory to everyone.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people that what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I would like to say that one thing that touches my heart in the talents of Mann Ki Baat, most of the people said that when we listen to Mann Ki Baat by sitting with everyone of our family, it seems that the elders of our family are sitting amongst us and sharing their own things with us.
When I heard this thing widely, I was very happy that I am amongst you and in a way I will continue to come and join you through Mann Ki Baat as a member of your family.
Your aspirations, my ambitions.
Come, let us move this journey further.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
About six and a half months before independence, the edition of the world's famous International Magazine, Time Magazine published on January 2, 1944 was a revelation of Sardar Patel on the mouthpiece.
In his main star, he had printed a map of India and it was not a map that we see today.
It was a map of India shared in many parts.
Time Magazine wrote that India was facing threats like division, violence, food crisis, inflation and power politics.
Time Magazine further writes that if anyone has the capacity to put the country in the form of unity and fill the wounds then it is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
How did he give direction to Bardoli Satyagraha
His authenticity and commitment to the country was such that the farmers, from the workers to the industrialists, all believed in them.
Whether it is Junagarh or Hyderabad, Trivancore or Razwada of Rajasthan, it was the Sardar Patel whose knowledge and strategic skills today we can see a Hindustan.
We naturally commemorate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel by seeing this nation tied in the bond of unity, our mother India.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be special. On this day, we will dedicate the Statue of Unity to the nation by paying tribute to Sardar Patel.
The height of this statue established on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is double from the Statue of Liberty of America.
It is the world's tallest Gaganchumbi statue.
Every Indian will now be proud of the fact that the world's tallest statue is on the earth of India.
The Sardar Patel, which was connected to the land, will now enhance the splendor of the sky.
I salute the families of our soldiers for their courage, but do you know why the citizens of India celebrate this Infantry Day
This is the same day when the soldiers of the Indian Army had landed on the land of Kashmir and protected the valley from the horsemen.
This historic incident also has a direct relationship with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was studying an old interview of Sam Manekshaw, who was a great Indian military officer.
He was recalling the time when he was Colonel.
During this period, in October 14, a military campaign was launched in Kashmir.
Field Marshal Manekshaw said that during a meeting, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had been naraja for the delay in sending army to Kashmir. During the meeting, Sardar Patel looked at him in his special apprehension and said that there should be no delay in the military campaign in Kashmir and solutions should be taken as soon as possible.
After that, the army personnel filled the airplane in Kashmir and we saw how the army succeeded.
On October 31, our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi ji is also the death anniversary.
Indira ji also paid homage to him.
My dear countrymen, who does not like sports.
Recently, I had two memorable visits.
Our Para Athlets of the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta earlier.
In this game, India won a total of 2 medals and made a new Vikram and enhanced Indias pride.
I was fortunate to meet them personally with all these talented Para Athlets and congratulated them.
Similarly, the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina got the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to know that our youngsters have performed the best in Youth Olympics 2018.
In this event, we also won 3 other medals in MICS events besides 13 medals.
You must be remembered that this time India's exhibition was best in Asian Games.
Look, in the last few minutes, how many times I have used the best of these words till now.
This is the story of today's Indian sports that touches new heights every day.
India is not only in sports but also in those areas which never thought about.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who has won the Gold Medal in Athletics for the country at the Asian Para Games 2018.
He is Divyang since birth.
When he was eight years old, he lost his father.
Then he spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he worked as a Weater in Dhaba on the banks of the road in Delhi to clean the buses of DTC.
Today, the same Narayana has been winning a gold medal for India in International events.
Not only this, look at the growing talent of excellence in Indias sports, India has ever won judo or junior level or any Olympic medal.
But Tababi Devi won a silver medal in Judo in Youth Olympics and saved history.
The 16-year-old young sportsperson Tababi Devi is a resident of a village in Manipur.
Their father is a labourer when the mother works to sell fish.
There was also a time before his family when he had no food money.
Even in such situations, Tababi Devi does not have the courage.
And he made history by winning a medal for the country.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that we had successfully organised Fifa Under-1 World Cup in 2019.
The entire world also appreciated it as a very successful tournament.
FIFA Under had also created a new record about the number of audience in the World Cup.
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches in different stadiums of the country and enhanced the courage of young players.
This year, India has got the privilege of organizing Men Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Cup will start from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian wants a sports or a sports sports or an interest in any sports, there is a feeling of hockey in his mind.
India has a golden history in Hockey.
In the past, India has received gold medals in many competitions and once the world cup winner has also been there.
India has also given Hockey many great sportspersons.
Whenever Hockey is discussed in the world, the story of Hockey will be incomplete without these great sportspersons of India.
The whole world is familiar with Hockey's magician Major Dhyanchand.
After them, the hockey has cut a big pilgrimage from Balvinder Singh Senior, Lesli Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, team India sportspersons are inspiring the new generation of Hockey with the success of their hard work and commitment.
It is a good opportunity to see thrilling matches for sports lovers.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only increase the enthusiasm of the Indian team but also encourage all the teams.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Men Hockey Team for this competition and assure them that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with them and their support and also convey my best wishes to all the teams of the world coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward for social work, they are becoming self-servicemen and are inspiring for all the countrymen.
But in the new era, new generations, new zeal, new zeal, new zeal and new dreams are coming forward today.
Every Indian will be proud to see the zeal and engagement they have for this work.
It has a fragrance of traveling from IT to Society, Main No Hum, Ahm not Ayushman, from Self to Samashti.
If someone is teaching children then he is teaching adults.
If someone is associated with cleanliness then he is helping a farmer and there is no reliance behind doing all this, but there is a sense of dedication and determination.
A young man learned Wild Chair Basketball to help the Wild Chair Basketball team of Divyangs.
This is the dedication and dedication that is the activity of this mission.
Will no Hindustani be proud of this thing
This feeling of 'Main No Ham' will inspire all of us.
My dear countrymen, this time, when I was watching your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I got a very interesting picture of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on MyGov: Please talk about how the customs and traditions of the tribals of India are the best examples of co-existence with nature.
There is a need to learn from them how to adopt their traditions in our lives for sustainable development.
I appreciate you for keeping this topic among the audience of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a subject that inspires us to look at our glorious past and culture, today the world is discussing environmental conservation, and is exploring new ways for balanced lifestyle - balanced lifestyle.
However, our India is not even free from this problem, but for its movement, we have to look at our rich history and traditions, and especially to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
Staying in harmony with nature has been involved in the culture of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like goddesses.
The people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship trees like Pipalo and Arjun in the Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi society has shown us the path of environmental protection.
They are specially acceptable to sacrifice their lives in terms of conservation of trees but they are not allowed to harm a single tree.
Mishmi of Arunachal claims to have a relationship with tigers.
They consider them as their brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland, tigers are also seen as forest guards.
The people of the Varali community in Maharashtra consider the tigers as a guest, for them the presence of tigers is prosperous.
There is a belief in the coal community in central India that their luck is connected to the tigers and if the tigers do not get food then the village will also have to be hungry.
The Gond tribe of Middle India stops fishing in some parts of the Kethan river during the season of conservation.
They consider these areas as a shelter of fishes and because of this practice they get a healthy and abundant fish.
The tribal community makes their homes with natural materials and it is strong as well as environment friendly.
A small disintegrated community in the united areas of the Nilgiri Plateau of southern India is traditionally made of things available at the local level.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is true that the tribal community believes in living with very peaceful and mutual coordination, but whenever someone is harming their natural resources, they are not afraid of fighting for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were the people of the tribal community.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought hard against the British rule to protect his wild land.
There are several examples of the tribal community that teach us how to live together with nature and how we have the wealth of the forests today, the country is the credit of our tribals.
Come, let us express our respect for them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who are doing some extraordinary work for the society.
Such works which seem to be ordinary in the first sight but in fact they have a deep impact on changing our mindset and changing the direction of the society.
A few days ago, I was studying about the farmer brother of Punjab, Gurubachan Singh ji.
A common and hard-working farmer was the daughter of Gurubachan Singh ji.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan ji had said that we will get married with simplicity.
Whether it is life or other things, there is no need to spend any money.
Some such things will be sought which may be difficult for the daughter's family, but you will be surprised to know that brother Gurubachan Singh was a straightforward farmer and what he said is the true power of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told him that you promise me that you do not burn the sports anymore.
You can imagine how big social power is in it.
This is a matter of Gurubachan Singh ji, but he shows how large his personality is and we have seen that there are many such families in our society which transform the individual context into the context of social interest.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh has made such an example in front of us.
I have read about another village Kallar Majra in Punjab, which is with Nabha.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurubachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and all those places that make their best efforts to keep the environment clean.
You are moving forward the Indian heritage of a healthy lifestyle as a true successor.
Just as Tiptippe lake is formed, small awareness and activeness and positive work always play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it is said in our scriptures: : : : : : i. e. God, all the three people have peace in the world, in the water, in the earth, in the sky, in the sky, in the fire, in the wind, in the medicinal, in the vegetation, in the vegetation, in the unconsciousness, in the entire Brahmind.
Establish peace at every place in life, in heart, in star, in particles of the world.
India has a special significance for this year on 11th November as the first World War ended 100 years ago on 11th November, that is, the end of the 100th year, that is, the end of the heavy destruction and loss of lives will also be completed.
The First World War for India was an important event.
In the true sense, we did not have to take anything directly with the war.
Nevertheless, our soldiers fought with bravery and played a very big role and sacrificed the highest.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when it comes to war, it is not behind anyone.
Our soldiers have shown their valour in the inaccessible areas and in the terrible situations.
It was the same objective behind all of them - the restoration of peace.
In the First World War, the world has seen a destruction talent.
According to estimates, about one crore soldiers and almost the same civilians lost their lives.
With this, the entire world understands the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today, peace and harmony does not mean to be a war.
From terrorism to change in conservation, from economic development to social justice, all need to work with global collaboration and integration.
The development of the poorest of the poor is the true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, our gesture is something about India.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is unique and the people there are extremely talented.
Our Honble India is now known for all its best works.
Ishaan India is such a region that has made great progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim has won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Awards 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
You will be happy to know that this award given for the best policy formulation in this field is similar to Oscar in that area.
Not only this, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for winning this award by leaving behind 51 eminent policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, the end of October is on.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for all these festivals.
I would urge you to take care of yourself in these festivals, take care of your health and also take care of the interests of the society.
This festival will also become an opportunity in your life to move forward as a mission.
Your progress is a major part of the progress of the country.
As much as your progress will take place, the progress of the country will take place.
My best wishes to you all.
