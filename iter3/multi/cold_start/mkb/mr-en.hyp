Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Deepjyotirnamostate enemies
I bow down to such Divya Jyoti.
To keep in mind this lamp, what can be the best idea that we will facilitate light all over the world, spread positiveness and pray to end the spirit of enmity.
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community participates in it but now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organisations of the country celebrate the Diwali festival with full joy.
In a way, India realizes it.
Friends, Festivals of the world used to attract tourism itself.
Our country, which is a country of festivals, has immense possibilities of tourism.
Whether it is Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, we should try to join the people of other states and other countries in the joy of festivals.
There are so many festivals in each of our states and every region. People from other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in increasing the festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, it was decided that in the last Mann Ki Baat, there was a lot to do in this Diwali.
I was saying that this is the honor of India's Laxmi that all of you will commemorate the success of India's women's strength and all the three achievements.
Immediately after this, there was a lot of inspirational stories in the social media.
Kodipka Ramesh in Warangal wrote on the Namo App that my mother is my strength.
When my daughters died in 1990, my mother took up the responsibility of five children.
Today we are five brothers in good business.
Ramesh ji, my bow to our mothers
Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for him there are Laxmis of India on Major Khushboo, who are the daughters of a bus driver and they are leading all women from Assam Rifles.
For poetry Tiwari Ji, Laxmi of India is his daughter, which is also his power.
He is proud of his daughter being a good painting.
He has also achieved a very good category in the CLAT examination.
So Megha Jain has written that a 92-year-old woman is providing free water to travellers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Meghazi has been very inspired by the humility and humility of Laxmi in India.
Many such stories have been spoken by people.
We must inspire that thing, inspire and do the same thing in your surrounding areas.
I am honoured to all these Laxmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the well-known poet of the 17th century, Sanchi Honmama had written a poem in Kannada language in the 17th century.
That feeling, the word that we are talking about every Laxmi of India, it seems that the foundation stone was laid in the 17th century.
These poems of Kannada are so beautiful words, so beautiful emotions and best ideas.
Our daughters, these are our pride and because of the glory of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and the future is bright.
My dear countrymen, 12 November 2019 this is the day that the 550th Prakash Festival of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Gurunak Dev ji is not only in India but in the whole world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters have realized in many countries of the world, who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Gurunak Devji.
I can never forget my visit to Venkuver and Tehran's Gurudwara.
There is a lot about Shri Gurunak Dev ji, which I can tell you, but for that there will be many parts of Mann Ki Baat.
He always placed the service sentiment in the highest place.
Guru Nanak Dev ji believed that no one can be able to make any difference to the service work done by selflessness.
He stood steadfastly against socially ill-effective practices such as insecurity.
Shri Gurnanak Dev ji delivered his message from far off the world.
They were among the most travellers in our times.
He went to many places and wherever he went, he won his hearts due to his humility, humility and simpleness.
Guru Nanak Devji had made several important religious visits which are called sadness.
With the message of goodwill and equality, he met people, saints and sages everywhere, whether north or south or east or west or west.
The well-known saint Shankardev of Assam also had inspired him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the water problem.
There is a famous place named Gurnanak Jira Saheb in Bidar, which is dedicated to Gurunak Devji, who always remembers us.
During a grief, Guru Nanak ji traveled in north, Kashmir and surrounding areas.
This led to a very strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Gurunak Devji also went to Tibet where people considered him a guru .
He is also worshipped in Uzbekistan where he had gone.
During one of our grief, he also travelled to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They lived in the hearts of millions of people who have followed their teachings and are still doing it even today.
Just a few days ago, the Ambassador of about 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
There he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and this incident took place on the occasion of the 550th Prakash Parva of Guru Nanak Devji.
All these envoys visited the Golden Temple and also got the opportunity to learn about the Sikh traditions and cultures.
After this, many messengers put photographs on social media and also wrote pride in the best experiences.
I would like to inspire us to bring his ideals and ideals to our lives, the 550th light festival of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that the date of October 31 will be remembered by all of you.
This day is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron male of India, who was the great hero of enlightening the country.
On the other hand, Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to bring people together and on the other hand, he would also have a good deal with those with whom he had a ideological difference.
Sardar Patel used to go deeply to small things and take care of them.
In fact, he was the Man of Details who called upon Tapashila.
At the same time, he was a part of the organisation skill.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from across the country were coming to participate in the Congress session in Ahmedabad.
The responsibility of all the systems of the session was on Sardar Patel.
He used this opportunity to improve the system of water supply to the city.
It has been ensured that no one will have water shortage.
Not only this, he was careful about going to the commodity or commodity of a representative at the session and we would be surprised to know what Sardar Patel had done.
He urged the farmers to communicate and make khadi pieces.
The farmers made pieces of pieces and sold to representatives.
Wearing their pairs in these pieces and keeping those pieces with us, the pressure of the representative's mind to go to the skull.
On the other hand, the sale of khadi has increased considerably.
Our country will continue to be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a remarkable role in the Constitution House.
They worked to determine the fundamental rights, which did not have any discrimination on the basis of caste and community.
Friends, As the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a very great and historic task to unite the institutions.
Sardar Vallabhbhai is the same thing that he looks at every incident.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patels efforts, his landmarks were discussed in the integration of the country.
He told Mudaliyar brothers, Arkot Ramaswamy Mudaliyar and Arkot Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliyar that he should take the people of Trivankor and travel to the tricolor there and throw the tricolor there.
The tricolor was thrown immediately after his order and the neighbouring country of Lakshadweep was destroyed.
After this incident, Sardar Patel said that Lakshadweep will get every necessary support for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing to Indias progress.
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope you will visit these beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the statue of unity built in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the country and the world.
This is the world's highest statue.
The statue of freedom of the United States has double heights.
The world's tallest statue gives pride to every Indian.
Every Indian has a pride of pride.
You will be happy to note that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists went there to see the statue of unity.
This means that everyday at least eight and a half thousand people will see the magnificence of the statue of unity.
He expressed his faith in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and said that there are several attractive centres like Electoral Gardens, Flower Parks, Jungle Safari, Nutrition Food Parks, Ekta Nursery for Children, which are continuously developing and encouraging local economy and people are getting new employment opportunities.
Keeping in mind the convenience of tourists coming, people of several villages are providing such facilities in their homes and homes.
Professional training is also being provided to those who provide home space facilities.
I am confident that the people there have now started dragon-fruit farming and will soon be the main source of livelihood of the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for tourism industry, there can be a topic of unity study.
We are all witnesses of how a place is being developed as a world famous tourist destination in a year.
There people come from all over the country and abroad.
Several arrangements like transportation, seizure, guide, environmental supplementation are being developed on one another.
There is a huge economic growth and people are creating facilities as per the requirements of travellers.
The government is playing its role.
Friends, Last month, the Time Month has made this place a pillar of unity among the 100 important tourist destinations in the world.
I hope that all of you will take some time from your valuable time to see the statue of unity.
But I urge every Indian who takes time for travel, to travel at least 15 tourist destinations in India along with the families, wherever it goes, it will remain my request.
Friends, As you know, every year from 2014, 31st October is celebrated as National Integration Day.
This day instructs us to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country by giving any price.
On 31st October, the run for Unity- Unity Run is being organized every year.
This will include people from every section of the society, every section of the society.
Run for Unity is a symbol of the fact that this country is one, it is moving in one direction and seeing a goal.
And nowadays, people are seeing a marathon and a width.
Run for Unity is also a similar provision.
We have to run here, we are connecting with the objectives of a Fit India and an India-Shreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not only the body but also the mind and culture have to run to take India to new heights for the unity of India.
For this, you can get information about the run for unity around the city where you live.
On this portal, there are places where run for unity will be organised across the country.
All of you will run on October 31 - for the unity of India, for your health.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has built the country in the midst of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a Sanskar in our lives and we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every walk, at every stage, at every stage, at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and vigilant to empower the unity and harmony of the country.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court had given its results on Ram Janmabhoomi.
Just remember that day, what kind of environment was there.
How many people had come to the ground.
How the interest groups used to play games to take advantage of that situation.
What kind of language was done to hypnotise the environment.
Efforts were also made to fill up sharpness in different voices.
On the one hand, everything was going on to burn the atmosphere for two weeks, but when Ram was born then the government, political parties, social organisations, civil society, representatives of all sects, saints and saints gave a lot of restraint reaction.
Efforts to reduce stress in the environment.
But I still remember that day.
These things should always be kept in mind and they give us a lot of strength.
This is the example of how powerful the sun of unity gives the country.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed on that day.
I also pay homage to them today.
My dear countrymen, today some stories are being heard from a distance in the households, one story of every village will be heard from the north to the south, from the east to the west, every corner of India will be the story of cleanliness.
Every individual, every family, every village, feels a pleasant experience for cleanliness because this effort of sanitation is an effort of 1. 25 billion Indians.
The wealth of their results is also 125 crore Indians.
But there is also a pleasant and entertaining experience .
I hear that I think that you should also tell you.
You can imagine that the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature falls from zero to 50 to 60 degrees.
In the air there is only the name of pranvayu .
In such a difficult situation, it is not even less than the ultimate challenges.
In such a scarcity, our brave soldiers are protecting the borders of the country, but they are running the Clean Siachen Campaign there.
I compliment the countrymen for this wonderful commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that it is difficult to get some disorders.
In such a situation, deletion and management of waste is an important task.
In such a situation, 130 tons of waste waste waste waste waste waste from the glaciers and its surrounding areas and how big is this service in such a delicate environment.
We all know that Siachen is such a part that is the source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, it means to ensure clean water for those living in the lower areas and also to use water of rivers like Nubra and Shayuk.
My dear countrymen, Festivals are a new echoing festival in all of us.
And in Diwali, especially in every family, buying something or the other, bringing something from the market.
As much as we try to buy local goods, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity.
And I urge you to buy the hands of our weavers and the hands of our khadiwali.
Even in this Diwali, we would have bought a lot before Diwali.
But there will be many people who will be able to get a little cheaper if they go after Diwali.
There will be many people whose shopping has been still there.
While greetings to Deepawali, I would urge you to buy local goods and buy local goods.
See how important the dream of Mahatma Gandhi can play.
But sometimes it becomes unconscious that there is a fire.
Somewhere there is wound .
I urge you all to preserve yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Every Indian, whether it belongs to any region, caste, religion, creed or language, is always ready to express his joy and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated Parakram Parv.
In 2016, we recalled the target-breaking attacks in 2016, when our soldiers responded to those who were hijacked by terrorism.
Our armed forces and exhibitions have been performed in different parts of the country so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation can understand their strength.
We can know how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen with their lives.
The day like Parakram Parv recalls the glorious heritage of our Armed Forces and inspires us to maintain the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
It is sure that our soldiers will give a warm answer to those who try to eliminate the atmosphere of peace and progress of our country.
We are committed to encouraging peace, but we are not committed to honour and value of the universality of the country.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
This was a phenomenon by our soldiers towards peace.
Even today, the speed of the United Nations is one of the most soldiers sent to different peacekeeping forces.
For decades, our soldiers have played an important role in playing peace in the world by wearing blue helmet.
My dear countrymen, the thing about the sky is different.
One of the best of the people in the Republic Day programme is the fly past, in which our air force shows the select of its capabilities by tracing aeroplane.
We celebrate Air Force Day on 8th October.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the air warriors and their families who have served the country.
The Air Force also ensured that the Indian soldiers and materials will reach the battlefield on time to protect Srinagar when the Pakistani terror attack started in 1947.
The Air Force also responded to the enemy in 1965.
Who does not know the freedom fighter of Bangladesh in 1971
In 1999, the Air Force has played an important role in eliminating Kargil from horse riding.
On Tiger Hill, the air force dust them overnight at the refugees of the enemy.
Be it relief and rescue operations or disaster management, the country is grateful for the commendable achievements of these brave soldiers of our Air Force.
Their work is marvellous to tackle the natural calamities and help the countrymen from the storms, floods to forest fires.
The Air Force has also set an ideal for ensuring women equality in the country. They have opened the doors of each of their departments for girls.
Now the Air Force is giving an alternative to the Permanent Commission along with the Short Service Commission, which was announced on 15th August this year from the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that along with men's strength, women's strength is also contributing to our armed forces.
The women are strong and the armed forces are also going on.
My dear countrymen, Abhilash Tommy, an officer of the Navy in the last few days.
The entire country was worried about how to save them.
You all know that Abhilash Tommy is a brave officer.
He is the first Indian officer to take a small name from any modern technologies to the world.
Since the last 80 days, he was looking for his speed in the sea to participate in the South Indian Ocean, Golden Global Race, but the terrible maritime storm created a crisis in front of him but the brave Indian Navy continued to swing for several days in the sea.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tommy and this courage, their strength, their resolve and the strength to win will definitely inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, I also know the significance of this day of 2nd October for our country.
There is another special significance on 2nd October this year.
Two years from now on, we will have several programmes worldwide on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The ideas of Mahatma Gandhi inspired the entire world.
Whether it is Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela, everybody got strength from Gandhi's ideas and fought a long way to give our people the right to equality and respect.
In todays Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss another important task of your worshipped Bapu, which more and more people should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
After that, when he stressed the freedom struggle in 1945, he prepared a revision of these ideas.
Pujya Bapu, farmers, villages, workers' rights, cleanliness, spread of education etc. have put their views before the country.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Pujaya Bapu was a folk collection.
It was the nature of Bapu that connecting people and mixing them.
Everybody had experienced this unique feature at all times.
He made everybody feel that the person is most important and important for the country.
The biggest contribution in the freedom struggle is that they have made this struggle a mass movement.
Reflecting the urgency of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom movement, the people of every section of the society have bowed themselves.
Bapu had given you an inspirational mantra.
Is it possible that he can get control over his life and part
This will help millions of people to get self-reliance, those who are hungry and their souls are unhappy.
Then you will find that your doubts have started decreasing and the ego has started ending.
My dear countrymen, Gandhijis mantra is equally important even today.
Today, the middle class is increasing in the country, its increasing economic strength, the increasing purchasing power, can we remember Bapu for a moment.
Whoever is fortunate, whose purchase will benefit directly or indirectly.
If the poorest of the poor benefits, then I will be more happy.
Keeping in mind this mantra of Gandhiji, when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji in the days to come, you must keep in mind that some country should be benefitted by your shopping and even those who have sweated and used their talent should benefit from them.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I am confident that this small step can make a big change in the lives of the poorest and the weakest person.
But this was achieved, India got freedom.
Like this, today we can feel that this small work can also contribute to me in the economic progress of my country, in the economic empowerment of my country and in the fight against poverty.
This is the true patriotism in today's era.
He said that all these fertilizer clothings have been made very hard, every dragon should be used.
The spirit of self-confidence towards the country and affection towards the people of the country was divided into the glory of this childhood.
Two days later, along with the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of the scientists.
As soon as the name of the scientific man is high, the feeling of immense reverence in the hearts of our Indians is blooming.
His glorious personality is always proud of every countryman.
The speciality of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he was very humble from outside but he was determined to be like a mountain.
His announcement of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is a recognition of his unique personality.
This was the result of his unsuccessful description towards the nation that during the short period of about one and a half years, he gave a mantra to the soldiers and farmers of the country to reach the heights of success.
My dear countrymen, today we are reminding worshipped Bapu and it is natural that we will not be able to speak about cleanliness.
The Swachhta Hi Seva campaign started from 15th September.
Millions of people participated in this and I was fortunate to contribute with the students of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school which was laid by Babasaheb himself.
People from all levels of the country participated in this workshop on 15th.
The institute also participated in this event.
School students, college students, NCCs, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Private Industries have made a huge contribution to cleanliness.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all this sanitation lover.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a successful story not only in the country but also in the entire world.
India is organising the largest global sanitation conference in history, Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Cleanliness Ministers from all over the world and experts from this region are together to share their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
The concluding ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October, 2018 at the commencement of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Bapu.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit that justice is justified on the roots of self-reliance, when justice was discussed, the spirit of human rights is included in it.
It is particularly necessary to ensure the freedom, peace and justice of the disadvantaged, the deprived.
The Constitution provided by Babasaheb Ambedkar to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was set up on 12th October, 1993.
NHRC will complete 25 years in a few days.
NHRC has worked to enhance human dignity along with protecting human rights.
Our dear leader, former Prime Minister of the country, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had made it clear that human rights are not an ideal for us.
In a symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, all the buildings of the Vedic times have been depicted: Sukhin.
NHRC has created a comprehensive awareness about human rights and has also played a commendable role in preventing misuse of them.
In this journey of 25 years, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence in the countrymen.
I believe that this is a hopeful thing for a healthy society and for the best democratic values.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up along with the work of human rights at the national level.
As a society, the importance of human rights is needed to be realized and brought into practice, this is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
Even this year, you should organise Run for Unity in your villages, in the city and in the metropolis.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb for unity because he worked for unity throughout his life.
I appeal to all of you that on 31st October, every section of the society, every section of the country, every part of the country, through the Run for Unity, it will be a great tribute to them.
My dear countrymen, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to you all for the sacred festivals of Navratri, Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today, the festival of Raksha Purnima is being celebrated throughout the country.
Greetings to all the countrymen on this holy day.
Rakshabandhan is celebrated as a symbol of love and faith in brothers and sisters.
Now Janmashtami will be celebrated soon.
The gathering will be reflected in the ecosystem like Hathi, Horse, Palaki-Jai Kanhailal Ki Govinda-Govinda.
The joy of going colored in the color of Lord Krishna is very comfortable.
Sir, Advanced Sanskrit-Dinamasti.
Sanskrit languages, Sarla etc. Sarve Vadanti.
Brothers and sisters, Besides Rakshabandhan, Shravan Purnima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
At the same time, we are also proud of the fact that from Vedas to Cultural Language, we have played an important role in the propaganda of knowledge.
In Sanskrit language and literature, there is a share of knowledge about every field of life.
Not only this, it is also said that in the Sanskrit language, the mantras that give a detailed answer to the challenge of todays global problem should be addressed.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Mattoor village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka still use Sanskrit language to speak.
We will be surprised to know that a special feature of Sanskrit language can create new innumerable words in this language.
It is said in Subhasita that how important is the Guru Namak in life , it is said that sometimes Aksharamastu , Guru : disciples are addressed .
My dear countrymen, Monsoon rain brings a new hope for our farmers who work hard and hard work.
Due to the severe heat, this rain is a boon for the reservoirs accumulated by sand, dried trees and plants.
But sometimes this hypertension brings destructive, devastating Mahapur.
There has been heavy rainfall in comparison to other places in the country.
I pray that the people who have been injured in this natural calamity should improve their nature as soon as possible.
But in the times of such a crisis, we also see humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everybody can help the people in their own levels, whether it is such a disaster in Kerala or in any other district of India.
He made tireless efforts to save the lives of the people stuck in the flood.
Whether it is air force, navigators, as well as army personnel, Border Security Forces, CISF, RAF, each of these departments have played an important role in the rescue and relief operations.
Let us pray that in this sacred period of Onam, the country, especially Kerala, gets the power to get out of this crisis as soon as possible and the development journey of Kerala gets a better momentum.
Once again, on behalf of all my countrymen, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and those places where there is such a crisis in the country that the entire country is with you in such a situation.
For the last ten years, he had gone very far from active politics.
But after 16th August, the country and the world have seen that even after the ten years of age, the common man in India had a lot of affection for Atal ji.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 191st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change has brought about two important changes in India's politics.
First of all, the size of the Cabinet of the States was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limit fixed under the Anti-Pacific Act was one-third, it was increased to two-thirds.
Clear guidelines have also been made to make the participants of the Parties.
Atal ji was a loyal patriot.
During his tenure, the time for the budget of the country was changed in the House.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time to budget in Parliament to 21 in the morning.
Some of the regulations in this code have made it possible to throw tricolor at public places.
So, more and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their national flag.
Atal ji has done a great job to bring our beloved tricolor to the people.
If there is any side in this regard then as a opponent, people are holding their own views.
I pay homage to all of you, by reiterating the resolve to fulfil the dream of a prosperous and developed India.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha in this session was 118 and 74 of the Rajya Sabha.
The Act will protect the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh gave only five days of hearing and punished the culprits.
In Rajasthan, in such a way, the courts of Rajasthan have decided to deal with the oppression of women.
The Act will play an effective role in preventing atrocities against women and girls.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
In this Monsoon Session of Parliament, all the members have put an ideal thing together.
For this, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country on the public level.
My dear countrymen, millions of Indians are now looking at the Asian Games in Jakarta.
The Asian Games are still in progress.
I would like to congratulate all the sportspersons who have won medals for the country.
The number of medal winners for the country has increased, especially our daughters are participating in it.
Let us look at our health because a healthy, healthy country will be able to create a prosperous and prosperous India.
Namaste Bhavti ji, I respect our feelings.
Everybody is surprised to see that Patna is the Rani Ki Bao built in the 21st century in Gujarat.
The land of India is an engineering laboratory.
Several engineers of India have been able to think about this thing.
We have got such a silver in our tradition that shares the legacy of great engineers.
This Ratna is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
Vishwaswaraiah.
The Krishnaraj Sagar Dam, constructed by him on the Kaveri river, is still benefiting lakhs of farmers and the people.
In Kutch it is called Bhunga.
My houses have seen 3-3 earthquakes.
I have experienced three earthquakes in this house myself.
But if you go inside, you don't see any harm.
This house has been built by our ancestors in accordance with nature and geographical structure.
After seeing that house, I thought that even before the ages, the engineers of that period had thought of the local situation and how they had constructed a house in accordance with it, so that we should also do the same.
Now, whenever we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think of the future.
Workshops should be taken at places.
What new things should we learn in the changing times
What should people teach
How to connect
Nowadays, disaster management has been a big task.
The entire world has to face the natural crisis.
In such a situation, how can the new form of structural engineering be
How will it be different courses
What should the students learn in this
Many such things should be considered at the time when 'Engineers Day' is celebrated.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivals.
At the same time, preparations for Diwali will also be started.
You will be meeting Mann Ki Baat and will continue to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
At the same time, we are working to take our country forward from our hearts.
With this spirit, my best wishes to all of you.
The people of some parts are still waiting for Varunraj.
India is vast and there is diversity in it, but in this country, Varunraj also shows the form of his choice.
In such a situation, the most important responsibility is that all of us should be the protector of nature, the protector of nature.
If we become natural, then the balance of natural things will be achieved automatically.
You must have seen this incident on television.
Actually in that cave it takes usually a few hours to return and return .
After coming out, these children resorted to a little height in the cave.
But they had to stay within 18 days, not one or two days.
And now we can imagine how their moments and moments would have taken place in the mental condition when there is a direct death in front.
On the other hand, these children were swinging up with the crisis and on the other hand, humanity in the entire world was united and manifestation of God's humanity.
In particular, after seeing everybody's very restraint behavior, I feel that it is a learning, understanding and understanding qualities.
Those whose children were stuck inside, their parents were not suffering from sorrow or their mothers were not suffering from sadness.
But with patience and restraint, the peaceful behavior of the entire society is a very important thing that we all have to learn.
A Thailand Navy personnel had to lose their lives in the entire mission of this help.
The whole world has seen the bravery of patience and patience of helping the people of the cave in a very difficult situation filled with water and darkness.
This incident showed that when humanity was united, such wonderful things happen.
But for this, we need to focus only on working peaceful and stable minds and for which we are working.
Just a few days ago, the beloved poet of our country Neeraj ji left us forever.
Neeraj ji had a special feature.
He had a lot of faith in himself along with hope, faith, determination.
Everything of Neeraj ji can be very inspiring and powerful to all Indians.
If we see this then these months of July and August are very important for the farmers and all the youngsters.
Because in this time there is a problem of entrance of colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam are coming out of school life and entering colleges.
The youngsters are taking steps on a new path of life and when their focus is removed from the question of cut-offs.
The attention of the students is now taken from the house to the habitat.
Students have come out of the umbrella of their parents and come under the umbrella of the professors.
I am sure that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about the beginning of the college life.
For the first time, we should leave the house and leave the village and go to the other side and get out of a safe environment and have to become ourselves.
Many youngsters have left their homes for the first time to give a different direction to their lives.
I would like to tell all of you that you should be quiet and enjoy this life.
It has to be practiced but the natural eagerness of exploring new things should be maintained in you while learning.
Old friends are a special value.
I am looking at the fact that a student named Asharam Chaudhari, among a very poor family of Madhya Pradesh, has achieved academic achievements by facing many difficulties in life.
The entrance examination of MBBS for AIIMS of ASHARM Jodhpur has been finalized in the first attempt.
Anushka Panda, the Divyang daughter of Tasanch Gurgaon, is suffering from a hereditary disease of Spinal Muscular Atrophy.
All of them have achieved that the whole world should keep looking at all the problems faced by their determinations and the problems faced by a bitterness.
If we look at the civilization then we will see many such examples.
Any good event in any part of the country is giving energy to my heart.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes fell on a news that wrote in it, "Two youngsters dreamed of Modi.
On reading the news, we realized that today our youth used technologies with smart and creativity and how they try to transform the lives of the common man.
The incident was such that San Jose City in America was considered a center of technology and once I was interacting with the Indian youth there.
At that time, I urged them to think about how you can utilize the spirit of yourself and how you can utilize the spirit of yourself for your India.
I used to urge Brain-Gene to answer the problem of Brain-drain.
The two IT professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji accepted this request and brought an innovative composition to me.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have together created a Smartgaon App using their professional skills.
This app is not only connecting the people of the villages to the entire world but can also get any information and information through this app on our mobile.
Residents of Taudhakpur village in Rae Bareli, Gram Heads Sarpanch, District Magistrates, Chief District Officers have created awareness among the people to use this app.
In fact, you say that this is a unique journey of Pandharpur.
Friends, This year Ashadhi was celebrated on 23rd July, on this day, Pandharpur is celebrated with devotion.
Pandharpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
The legends of great saints like Sant Gyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram, while roaming in the palanquins, roaming on foot towards Pandharpur, singing Tal Mridung.
Vithal, who is also called Vithoba or Pandurang, reaches Pandharpur for his visit.
It is a God who protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the victims.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are very devoted to Panduranga.
Go to the Vithoba temple of Pandharpur and describe the glory and beauty there .
Whether the medium of weight or disintegration has been used for it, the message of goodwill, love and brotherhood has been given from the literature of these saints.
The mantra of these saints is to empower the society to fight against darkness.
And he also had the power to abrogate the old evils from the society and the essence of compassion, equality and goodwill on the minds of the people.
Lokmanya Tilak is a sea of adventure and confidence.
The British tried untouchablely to prove the rivalry by running the royal revolt thrice in 20 years.
This is not a simple thing.
Today, I would like to tell the countrymen about a joyous incident about Lokmanya Tilak and his statues in Ahmedabad.
During that period, more than 40 thousand people were present in Ahmedabad for his welcome and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with Tilak.
During this visit, the personality of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel and Lokmanya Tilak was very impressed by the ideas.
Lokmanya Tilak died on 1st August, 1920, after that, Patel decided to make a memorial of Tilak in Ahmedabad.
Lastly, the statue of Tilaks was built and Sardar Saheb inaugurated this memorial by Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 1929.
My dear countrymen, one more say that this statue is also extremely rare, and Lokmanya Tilak is sitting on a chair and along with Tilak has written the Right to Swaraj Hamara Janmasdhi.
Public Ganesh Festival has become an effective medium of traditional faith and devotion to create a sense of harmony and equality in the society.
In that specific period, there was a need to fight against the British together.
And the festivals started by Tilaks have worked to unite all by breaking the walls of the castes and communities.
The popularity of organising these festivals has increased in the times of time, it is also seen that today's younger generation is also very attractive to the brave heroes of our ancient traditions and history.
Today in many cities there are pavilions of Ganesh festivals built in almost every street.
All the families of the streets together organise the Ganapati festival.
Even here, our youngsters can get a good opportunity, their leadership, festival entrepreneurs, programme organisers, coordinators can develop their qualities.
From the idol of Ganesh ji to the decorated items, there should be some environmental affection.
Today, every Indian needs to get better results of good governance and development.
I am talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Azad also brought his life, but he never bowed down to foreign rule.
The village of Chandrashekhar Azad is Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh and I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit this village.
I also got the opportunity to pay homage to the Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad, as if Chandrashekhar Azad was not a brave man who wanted to die by the bullets of foreigners, who had to fight for freedom till the end and sacrifice.
This is a special feature for them.
Once again I bow down to these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, in the 400-meter race of the Junior Under-20 World Athletics winner in Finland, India's mighty daughter and daughter of a landlord Hima Das has won a new history by winning a gold medal.
I have sent an e-mail to me from Indonesia as a reply to another daughter of the country, who is now preparing for the Asian Games at the same time.
In our e-mail, unity has been written that the most important moment in the life of an athlete is that moment when the player catches the tricolor in his hand.
I am proud of all of us, unity.
We are proud of you for brightening the name of our country.
In Tunisia, the World Para Athletics Grand Pricks 2018 has won Ektan Gold and Bronze Medals.
We should move forward, keep on sporting and developing.
My dear countrymen, several historical events have taken place in the month of August and several festivals also come in the month of August but during the monsoon season, illness is also being admitted to the house for some time.
Once again, I must meet Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, I am once again fortunate to interact with you through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Just a few days ago, Cricket had a historic face in Bengaluru.
I would have come to know that I would have spoken about the cricket casualties between India and Afghanistan.
The two sides showcased very good sports in this event.
Rashid Khan, one of the goals of Afghanistan, had done a good job in IPL this year.
I thank your Indian friends for providing a platform to our sportspersons to showcase their skills.
Whatever excellent, best in Afghanistan, represents the same.
We have experienced a sportsperson, a sportsperson.
Sports is a very good medium to unite society and showcase the skills and talent of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope you will continue to play and develop in a similar manner in the same way.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, the fourth Yoga Day was a different vision.
Be it the European Parliament, the United Nations Headquarters of New York or the Japanese Navy Fighting Ships, people were all seen doing yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic programme on Yoga was organised and I came to know that women have been guided by several asanas at this time.
In Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China jointly exercised yoga on the snowy mountain peaks of the higher heights.
It is working to connect everyone with the bonds of borders.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have done a very big festival of Yoga Day by crossing different kinds of caste, religion, region, color or linga.
If people from all over the world had participated in the programmes of Yoga Day, then why wouldn't they have a lot of zeal in India
Our country's security forces have been practicing yoga at all three places like the Army, the Armed Forces, the Naval, the Air Force.
Some of the brave soldiers performed Yogasanas on the window.
Some soldiers practiced yoga on the snowy mountains of Siachen.
The warriors of our Air Force were surprised by the warriors and the warriors were surprised by Yoga in the sky at a height of 15,000 feet from the ground.
It is a special thing to say that they have not practiced yoga in the air, but have practiced yoga in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports grounds, Yoga has been practiced all over the country.
The work of Yoga has been done by crossing the caste, creed and geographical boundaries across the world and we have been living with the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam since ancient times.
Our sages, Muni and Sant have always emphasized this idea.
Today, Yoga has proved it properly and has been shown by means.
Today, Velnas is working like a revolution.
It is our culture that we see the mother as a goddess, mother gives birth to us so that we consider her as a goddess.
Sometimes doctors give us birth again.
The role of doctors is not limited to medicinal treatment.
Doctors have medical knowledge as well as how their lifestyle should be, now the impact of the system is increasing and it has a good experience about what is the impact of our health.
Indian doctors have displayed their immense capabilities and skills and have created their own independent identity throughout the world.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I convey my best wishes to all our doctors and colleagues on the next July 1.
India has a rich history.
The Kabirvad of Gujarat will be a good destination for you and when I was working in Gujarat, when a large national session was held by the people of Saint Kabir's tradition.
Everyone knows that in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, Sant Kabirdas, a village of Maghar, had taken the sepulchre.
But why did Kabirdas ji choose this place for the samadhi
It was believed that those who died here in Magahar did not get a place in heaven.
And whoever suffers from Kashi, he goes to heaven.
Maghar was considered an absurd place but Saint Kabirdas had no faith in such things.
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through Sakhia and Dohas.
This was his ideal.
This is the ideal that we see from their creations.
This means that whoever understands the pain of the other, he is the true fakir and saint.
And whoever does not know the sorrows of others, he is intact.
Kabirdas ji had given special emphasis on social harmony.
He was going ahead of time and was thinking.
Knowledge of the people should be considered as the basis and respect them.
Even today, even today, the words made by Kabir are equally effective.
Today, when we read the things of Kabir ji then it feels that it is in the knowledge age of today.
We feel that their thoughts are relevant even today.
Now we are talking about Saint Kabirdas ji, I remember one of his two. He says, "Guru Govind Dou Khara, Kake can be implemented.
There is such a great guru, Jagatguru - Guru Nanakdev.
He showed homage to millions of people and has been inspiring from generations.
Guru Nanakdev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is to serve God.
Wherever he went, he worked for the welfare of the society.
He brought the system of social distinction free kitchen and such a kitchen can eat any caste, religion, community, and Guru Nanakdev has started the method of 'Langar'.
The 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated by Guru Nanakdev ji in 2019.
The terrible event of Jallianwala Bagh is going to be completed 100 years in 2019, which was about to blacken the entire humanity.
Peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice always wins.
Shema Prasad Mukherjee is his birth anniversary and in this programme I am Dr.
During the period 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee contributed a lot.
He was very enthusiastic and dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Come on, then, all of us are Dr.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video calls.
He said that he has got the opportunity to know about the changes in the lives of the people by crossing the files.
In remote villages, youngsters are providing services from pension to passports through Common Service Centres.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister used to collect sitaflags and make ice-creams.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of young people of the country are providing medicines at affordable rates along with running Jan Aushadhi Kendras.
I am very happy that the success of the common man is more than the success of the government and the success of the common man in this entire programme.
In such a disappointing environment, it gives us information about the hopes, new zeal and the events in our lives that have fallen in the lives of the common man.
The incident of a small girl from a small village in the remote and remote areas also inspires 1. 25 billion people.
I am very happy and inspiring to interact with the beneficiaries through video bridge with the help of technology.
A new joy, a new zeal, a new inspiration for the poorest of the poor.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people participated in the video bridge programme and they worked to give me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you.
On the other hand, there are professionals and technicians and on the other hand our farmers working in the field are brothers and sisters.
Now you will also think that agriculture and technology are both different businesses and what is the relationship with them
Their successful efforts were being made to increase the income of the farmers.
On the other hand, a chain has been prepared from crop production to its marketing, the role of farmers is important, while on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the participation of farmers in the profits received.
Friends
This work you have done in youth is indeed inspiring the youngsters.
One nation, one tax was the dream of the people of the country.
If you want to give the highest credit to improve One Nation, One Tax, then I will give it to the states.
GST Cooperative Federalism is a very good example in which all the States together decided for the country's interest and thereafter, tax reforms are possible in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and people with different political ideas come together in this meeting.
Prior to GST, there were 17 different types of tax systems in the country but now the same tax system has been implemented in the entire country.
GST is the victory of authenticity and it is also a festival of authenticity.
Earlier, several times there were complaints related to Inspector Raj in tax matters.
GST is perhaps the worlds largest tax reform.
Generally, a period of 5-7 years would be possible to improve such a huge population and stabilize the entire scheme.
Namaskar recently held 21st Commonwealth Games in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
The pledge of showing zeal, excitement, zeal, hope, aspirations, something that happens when there is such an environment, then who can be absent from it.
This was a time when people from all over the country used to think that who is playing today.
How many medals you will win and all this was very natural.
Our sportspersons also performed well by fulfilling the aspirations of the countrymen and won a medal after one step.
Be it Nambaji, Kusti, Bharatotalan, Table Tennis or Badminton, India has done the best.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze - India has earned 66 medals.
Every Indian feels proud of this success.
Winning medals is a matter of pride and joy for every sportsperson.
This is a moment of pride for all the nations and for all the countrymen.
Perhaps my words will be reduced to express that feeling.
But I would like to hear what I have heard from this sportsperson.
For this reason, there were many such things that were done for the first time.
Manika Batra won medals in all the competitions he participated.
She is the first Indian female sportsperson who won India the first gold medal in the personal table tennis competition.
India won the highest medal.
The 15-year-old Indian Nambaz Anish Bhav was the youngest sportsperson who won the Gold in the Commonwealth Competition.
Sachin Chaudhari, who won the medal in the Commonwealth Games, is the only Indian Para Power Lifter.
The sports competition was also special because most of the medal winners were women sportspersons.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting, nambaji, women sportspersons have performed excellent performances.
Everyone was eager about this fight, both the medals were received by India.
The sportspersons who participated in the competition came from different parts of the country and from small towns.
His friends also contribute to those who have raised their mindset in every situation.
In the last month, in Mann Ki Baat, I had called upon the countrymen, especially our youth, to Fit India and I had invited everyone.
Participate in Fit India, represent Fit India.
And I am very happy that people are participating in it with great zeal.
Many people have written letters and showed their support, have sent letters, have shared their health mantra on social media - Fit India story.
A household Shashikanth Bhosle has shared his shadow in the watershed lake - My weapon is my body, my welfare is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written: I feel happy and healthy due to the morning walk.
And they further say that for me-fitnesses comes with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt that Devnath ji is healthy in happiness.
While sharing his picture of mountaineering, Dhawal Prajapati wrote: Travel and mountaineering for me is Fit India.
I am very happy to see that many renowned persons are inspiring their youth in a very attractive way for Fit India.
Film actor Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
Many more youngsters have shared their experiences participating in Fit India.
I feel that such movements are very beneficial for all of you and for the entire country.
One more thing I will definitely say that without spending any money, the name of the Fit India Movement is Yoga.
The significance of International Yoga Day on 21st June has now been accepted by the entire world.
You will also get ready from now on.
Your city, your villages, your departments, your schools, your colleges should try to participate in the age of every person, be it a man or a woman or Yoga.
Today I want to talk to you to invite you for a new task and I have seen that many youngsters are learning something new at this time.
My young friends, I urge you to participate in a special internship.
Be it Sports, Human Resource Development, Department of Drinking Water, three-four Ministries of the Government of India have brought together the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018 initiative.
The students of the college, the youth of the NCC, the youth of the NSS, the youth of the Nehru Yuva Kendra, the youth of the Nehru Yuva Kendra, who want to change the society, want to become a part of it.
It is an opportunity for all of them to do something in the society with a positive energy and it will also strengthen cleanliness and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, you will also get the pleasure of doing something and I also say that those who are the best trainees who have done the best work in the colleges, who have done the best work in the university will be given national awards.
Not only this, the trainees who will complete this will also give the UGC two credit points.
I once again invite the students, the students and the youth to take advantage of this internship.
You can register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship on MyGov.
I hope your youth will definitely succeed in this movement of cleanliness.
Use these vacations as an opportunity to experience a new experience.
This group of youngsters has launched a major campaign for education of children living on roads and beds.
Initially, the situation of children who have been asking for a pilgrimage on the roads was so helpful that they bowed themselves completely in this work.
The mission, which started from 15 children of Gita Colony near Delhi, has now reached 2,000 children from 12 locations in the capital.
Youth and teachers associated with this mission have participated in this very great effort to make social changes by taking two hours from their busy day.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become inspirational for the farmers across the country.
With collaborative efforts, he has not only changed his own but also his fate.
In Bageshwar of Uttarakhand crops are mainly taken in Mandwa , Chaulai maca or java .
He started making biscuits from the crops of the farm and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative institution in Munnar village and have opened a factory to produce biscuits there.
Keeping in mind the patience of the farmers, the administration has also linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being distributed not only to about 50 Anganwadi centers of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani .
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institution has not only reached Rs. 10 to 15 lakhs but has also reduced the migration from the district due to employment opportunities for more than 900 families.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there will be war for water in the world in the future.
Everyone speaks this thing but is there no responsibility for us
Do we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility
Every person should be responsible.
Our ancestors have done this for centuries.
He has given priority to every drop of water.
They have discovered new solutions to save every drop of water.
Those of you who have got the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu may have seen that in some temples of Tamil Nadu, there are large inscriptions written in the temples regarding irrigation system, water conservation system and drought management.
Be it Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will see big inscriptions all over the country.
Even today, various varieties are popular as tourist destinations but we cannot forget that these live proofs of the water conservation campaign of our ancestors are also there.
The queen of Adlaj and Patna in Gujarat is the world heritage of UNESCO and its magnificence is worth seeing.
Vihiri is the only water temple in a way .
If you go to Rajasthan then you will definitely go to see the moonlight in Jodhpur.
It is Indias largest and well-known wheel and the most important thing is that there is a deficiency of water.
The period of April, May, June, July, when there is a good opportunity to storage rain water and if we are already prepared then you will get more benefit.
Manrega funds are also used in the work of water conservation.
In the last three years, everybody has made its own efforts towards water conservation and climate management.
In addition to Manrega funds every year, an average expenditure of Rs. 32,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water management.
55 of the total expenditure of Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent on water conservation of about Rs. 35,000 crore.
About 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted by such water reservoirs and water management measures in the last three years.
Under Manrega, the district administration has taken the responsibility of land and water conservation in large quantities.
The dry rivers of Sasur Khadri have been revived with the help of people from about 40 to 45 villages.
Be it animals, birds, be it farmers, be it agriculture, be it village, it is a big success.
I would say that once again in April, May, June, July, you should take some responsibility for water conservation and water conservation.
When there is a Mann Ki Baat, the message comes from all sides, letters come and phones come.
Ian Kumar Banerjee of Devitola village in north 24 Parganas district of West Bengal has written on MyGov that we celebrate Ravindra Jayanti every year, but many people do not know the philosophy of living with the peacefulness of the Nobel Winner Rabindranath Tagore.
Please discuss this topic in the Mann Ki Baat programme that people will get information about it.
I am grateful to Iyenji that he attracted the attention of all the companions of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was an individual full of knowledge and wisdom, whose writing has made a mark on everyone.
Rabindranath was a talented, multi-dimensional person, but he was a teacher every moment.
I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Music on the radio early in the morning and when I got the opportunity to listen to the poems of Anandloke and Aguner, Poroshmani.
You must have also been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet and his poets.
I pay homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
The holy month of Ramadan will start in a few days.
The month of Ramadan is celebrated all over the world with reverence and respect.
The collective purpose of everyday is that when a person himself is hungry, he also feels the hunger of others.
When he feels himself thirsty then he feels thirsty of others .
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings and messages of Prophet Mohammad.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood like them.
Once a person asked the prophets, what is the best thing in Islam
Prophet Saheb said, Whether you are familiar with them or not to provide food to the poor and the needy and to think of each one of them.
The dispatched Mohammad believed in knowledge and doing.
They had no ego of anything.
He used to say that egoism only defeats knowledge.
Prisoned Mohammad believed that a person is not due to this wealth but because of his sacred soul.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha who showed the strength of compassion, service and sacrifice, which guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha reminds Buddha of the responsibility of following the path shown by Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha is the inspirational power of equality, peace, unity and brotherhood.
These are human values which are the most needed in the world today.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar had to say that Lord Buddha has a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Babasaheb empowered millions of people, be it Dalits, be it afflicted, exploited, deprived.
There is no greater example of doing this.
Karana was one of the great qualities of Lord Buddha to understand the grief of the people.
It is said that the Buddhist monks travelled in different countries and took the rich ideas of Lord Buddha along with them and it is always happening.
The entire Asia has received the legacy of the teachings of Lord Buddha.
Several Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar have deepened Buddhist traditions and Buddhist teachings and that is why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which will connect the important Buddhist places of Southeast Asia to India.
I am happy that the Government of India is a partner in revival of several Buddhist temples, which includes the beautiful Anand Temple of Bagan in Myanmar hundreds of years ago.
Today, all over the world, struggles and human sorrows are seen and the teachings of Lord Buddha shows the path of destruction.
I convey my best wishes to all those who believe in the principles of compassion and devotion of Lord Buddha all over the world.
We seek blessings to Lord Buddha for the entire world so that we can fulfill our responsibility for the creation of a peaceful and compassionate world based on their teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the idols of Lafing Buddha, it is believed that Lafing Buddha brings good fortune but very few people know that Smayling Buddha is also associated with an important event in the defence history of India.
Now you are thinking about what is the relationship between Smiling Buddha and India's Armed Forces
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
The Paramunu test was conducted on 11th May, 1998 at Pokhran, Rajasthan.
The event is 20 years and the Buddha Purnima was tested with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias test was successful and thus India showed its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked as its military strength in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world that internal power is necessary for peace.
Similarly, when we are strengthened as a nation, we emerge with each other in a peaceful way.
This month is not merely important for the country as nuclear tests have been conducted in the month of May 1998, but it is important for the way these tests have been done.
This incident showed the whole world that the land of India is the land of great scientists and India can achieve new heights along with rigorous leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given the mantra of Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan, Jai-vigyan.
When we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of May 11, 1998, every young man should contribute to the creation of a powerful India, to build a modern India, to build a powerful India, to make a strong India.
Participate your strength in Indias power.
We can also get a new joy and new solution to take forward the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, I will visit the next Mann Ki Baat programme and I will be more grateful.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat March 2018
Today is a sacred festival of Ram Navami.
A few days ago, when all the heads of the ASEAN countries came here on 26th January, the artists of that country had also come here.
And it is a matter of pride that most of them have presented Ramayana in front of us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are not only in India but also on this land of the world, even today in ASEAN countries.
I once again convey my best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, I have also received letters, emails, phone calls and reactions from all of you in large numbers.
I have read what Komal Thakkar has written about the introduction of the online class of Sanskrit on May-Gov.
I read the response written by Shriyut Dhanshyam Kumar ji of Barkar village in Nalanda district of Bihar on the Narendra Modi app.
The concerns you have expressed on the devastating waterfalls of the land are very important.
Shreeyut Shakal Shastriji of Karnataka wrote that Ayushman Bharat is possible only when Ayushman is a land.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji says that I should talk about the health of the youth this time.
According to him, if we compare to other Asian countries, Indian youth are physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I thought that at this time I will discuss with everyone on the subject of health in detail and discuss a strong India.
The Government of India had shared all the photos and videos on the same day on the social media and Narendra Modi app.
Now you take that photo and retweet and get it to your friends.
Anga, Jaiesh and many other children from Chennai have written to me about the gratitude cards that they have given behind the book 'Exam Warrior'.
Anga, Jaiesh and all other children, I would like to tell you that due to these letters, I get tired of the whole day.
My minds got so many of these letters, so many phone calls, reactions and things that I can read.
Even though I have decided to tell the same thing today, I will have to say that for months and months.
More and more letters have been sent by children on this occasion.
Your plans have told me in the vacation.
Animals and birds do not get water in summers.
Farmer brothers and sisters have sent letters to the farmers' fairs and the matters related to agriculture in the country.
Some aware citizens have suggested measures for water conservation.
Since we have started this Mann Ki Baat with each other through radio, I have experienced a technique since then, more and more letters come on topics related to summers.
Prior to the examination, there are letters about the care of the students.
That is, things of mind change according to the weather and perhaps it is true that these things in our mind change the weather and why not change the life of anybody else
When I get to read in your letters how Ahmad Ali, the Rejuvenator of Karimganj, Assam, has built nine schools for the poor children on the strength of his will, then I see the rare will of our country.
When I heard about Dr. Abhit Mohan Chaudhari of Kanpur, he goes to the pavement and feeds the poor and also treats the poor free of cost then I get the opportunity to feel the brotherhood of the country.
Many travellers who travelled through their cabs have helped him a lot.
An engineer girl gave her first full salary.
It has succeeded in the magnificent efforts of Akher Sadul Laskar after depositing 12 years of money.
Today, due to his resolve and his hard work, he has built a rocket of about 30 beds in Punri village near Kolkata.
Today, the vision of the entire world to look at India has changed.
Today, when the name of India is taken with great pride, then it is behind that that, the sons and daughters of Mother India have been laid for males.
A positive environment of self-confidence has been created by hopes.
This self-confidence will fulfil our resolve of a New India.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for our farmer brothers and sisters.
Whether it is Mahatma Gandhi or Shastriji or Lohia ji or Chaudhari Charan Singh ji or Chaudhari Devi Lal ji, all of them considered both the farmers and farmers as an integral part of the economy of the country and the common life.
Also, Lal Bahadur Shastri also emphasized on the protection of trees, plants and plants and better agricultural structures.
In his speech in 1979, Chaudhari Charan Singh urged farmers to use new technologies and innovate them.
This state, which has a very low area, has made a big achievement.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced records during 2015-16 over the last five years.
He has shown that when the goal is fixed, if the resolve is to be fulfilled then he can fulfill it by his experience.
Brothers and sisters, In the budget of this year, an important decision has been taken to ensure that the farmers get the right price.
It has been ensured that the crops will be given more than one and a half times the cost of their production.
The cost of all the fertilizers used by the state government, all the fertilizers given to the state government, the interest given to the farmers, the farming of the farmers, the hard work of the animals, the hard work of the animals, the cost of the fertilizers, the prices of the animals, the seeds, the prices of all the types of fertilizers, the fertilizers given to the state government, the interest given on the capital, the farming of the farmers is not only on the rent but if the farmers work on their own or their families then the value of their labor will also be added to the cost of production.
Besides, the work of improving the agricultural market is also going on at a comprehensive level to ensure that the farmers get the right market.
Efforts are being made to bring together local markets, housing markets and global markets in the villages.
To ensure that farmers do not have to go far away to sell their goods, they are being modernized by providing the necessary infrastructure to 22,000 rural markets in the country and will be connected to the Agricultural Income Market Committee and e-NAM platform.
That is, arrangements are being made to connect agriculture to any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year is the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Besides, Swachh Bharat is our pledge, how can we bring together hundreds of crores of citizens and showcase the best tributes to Gandhiji
How should the concept of Gandhi 150 be Logo
Let us all come together to pay a commemorative tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and inspire him to reach our country at a new height.
Today, the country has moved ahead with a traditional approach in the field of health.
It was believed that the responsibility of all the health related works in the country was to be done by the Health Ministry earlier.
But now all the Ministries and Departments, be it Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Department of Chemicals Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs or Ministry of Women Child Development or State Governments are working together for a healthy India.
Resistant care of health is the most cheap and easy solution .
The more we are aware of the healthcare, the more we will benefit the person, the family and the society.
Besides, work is being done at a comprehensive level towards setting up of Healthcare Centres across the country.
Today, Yoga has created a new identity worldwide in the field of preventive healthcare.
Body remains healthy and strong by yoga
Today, Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home due to the commitment of all of you to Yoga.
This year's International Day of Yoga i. e.
In the last three years, people participated very enthusiastically in every International Day of Yoga in the country and everywhere in the world.
This year also, we will make ourselves Yoga and inspire our entire family, friends and others to do yoga.
We want to make Yoga more popular by accessing new, attractive methods to children, youth and senior citizens and to women and men of every age.
However, the television and electronic media of the country continue to do various Yoga programmes throughout the year.
But can some programmes to create awareness about Yoga as a campaign from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher but it is definitely a Yoga practice.
However, some people have made me a Yoga teacher by using their innovations and have made some 3D animated video of my yoga.
I will be able to practice the asana and pranayama together to all of you.
Today more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are available at affordable rates.
The work of setting up new centres is also going on.
I urge the beneficiaries of Mann Ki Baat to ensure that they reach the information of these Jan Aushadhi Kendras to the needy, that is, their cost of medicines will be very low and they will have a lot of service.
The cost of stent required for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
The cost of equipment required for knee implant surgery has been reduced to 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore households i. e.
The total number of seats in the existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being opened in different states to provide better treatment and better healthcare facilities to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be set up for each three districts.
We aim to make the entire country free of TB by 2025.
This is a very big task.
Every person needs to be awakened for this and you need help for it.
To get rid of tuberculosis, all of us will have to work together.
My dear countrymen, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary on 14th April.
Many years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had expressed the need for industrialization in the country.
He said that the industries will also provide employment to the poor.
Today, the Make in India campaign is being successfully launched in the country.
In such a situation, Dr. Ambedkar inspires us that India had dreamt of becoming an industrial power.
Today, India has become the fastest star in the world's economy and the largest FDI in the world is being made in India today.
The world is looking at India as a hub for investment, research and development.
The Smart City Mission and City Campaign have been launched to provide better roads, water supply, healthcare, education, digital connectivity in big cities and small towns of the country.
Babasaheb had a firm faith in self-reliance.
He was not acknowledged that someone should take life in poverty.
At the same time, he added that the poor will not get rid of their poverty by providing some astronomical facilities to the poor.
Today, initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Start Up India, Stand Up India are creating young researchers and young entrepreneurs in the country.
He had seen the water power as the nation's power.
It was Babasaheb's vision that several river pipelines and various commissions related to water are being set up.
Today, historic efforts are being made to develop waterways and ports in the country.
Ports are developing on different seashores of India and infrastructure of old ports are being strengthened.
In the forty decades, there were main issues of discussions, others, warfare, warfare and fascination.
Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation stone of 'Team India' in a way.
He discussed the importance of the Union Territory and stressed on the need to work together for the development of the country.
Today, we have taken the mantra of cooperative federal systems in every department of governance and competitive cooperative federal system.
And most importantly, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of backward classes like me.
He showed us that there is no need to be born in a respected family, not only in a respected family, but also in India, those who are born in poor families can see big dreams, they can try to fulfil it and succeed in it.
Many times, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was caught by several people.
This is an India that belongs to Ambedkar, the poor and the backward classes.
The Gram-Swaraj Abhiyan will be organised from 14th April to 5th May on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
There will be various programmes on rural development, poverty welfare and social justice across the country.
I urge all of you to join this programme in a large number.
My dear countrymen, in the coming days many festivals like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Baisakhi are coming.
Lord Mahavir Jayanti is a day to learn from his sacrifice and penance .
The life and teachings of Lord Mahavir, who gave the message of non-violence, are inspiring for all of us.
Greetings to all the nations on Mahavir Jayanti
The Easter said that he remembers the inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus, and gave the message of peace, goodwill, justice, compassion and compassion to humanity.
The festival of Baisakhi is celebrated in Punjab and West India in April.
Many thanks
We have seen that the color of the sea looks blue but in our daily life we feel that the water is colorless and it is not colored.
Whether it is the river or the sea or the water there is a colour, we have never thought of it
This question came in the minds of a young man in the 1920s.
This question has emerged as a great scientist of modern India.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his excellent work on light scattering.
His discovery is famous by the name of Raman Effect.
As Raman had discovered the light scattering on 28th February, we celebrate 28th February as National Science Day every year, he received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
This country has given many great scientists in the field of science.
On the other hand, there was a tradition of great mathematician Bodhyan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta, while on the other hand, there is a place of pride in healthcare.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Har Gobind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose, India is proud.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose is also known as the famous Boson particle.
I have got the opportunity to participate in a programme of Wadhwani Artificial Intelligence Institute in Mumbai recently.
It was very interesting to learn about the miracles in the science sector.
Through artificial intelligence, it helps in creating robots and specific work machines.
Nowadays, the machines are further smartening their intellect with their own study.
This technology can be used to ease the lives of the poor, the deprived and the needy.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I would urge the scientific community to use artificial intelligence to make the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters easier.
Can we guess the natural calamities through artificial intelligence
A few days ago, with the Prime Minister of Israel, there was an opportunity to inaugurate the ICCREAT in Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
There a young man had developed such a digital device that he could not speak, he wrote that his voice was transformed and he could interact with him as he spoke to a person.
I think we can use artificial intelligence in many such places.
The machine works as your wishes.
But what we want to do is dependent on ourselves.
The human objectives here are important, the use of science for human welfare, the use of science to achieve the highest heights of human life.
Thomas Alva Adison, who found the divine light of electricity, has suffered many times in his experiments.
Asked him about this, he said that I have discovered ten thousand methods of electric lightning, that is, Edison has made his own strength.
With Yoga, I am here today at Auroville, the workplace of Maharshi Arvind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and asked for a responsibilities for their rule.
As a great sage, he questioned every aspect of his life.
He discovered the answers and showed the path to humanity.
There is a feeling of frequent questions to know the truth.
This is a real inspiration behind scientific research.
You should not stay healthy until you get the answers to these questions.
I convey my best wishes to all those associated with our scientific and science sector on National Science Day.
My best wishes to our younger generations to be inspired to explore truth and knowledge, to serve the society with the help of science.
Friends, I have a lot of messages on the issue of complications, time of crisis, security and disasters. People are writing something or the other.
Punahun Rabindra Singh has written the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Mobile App on Business Safety in his counterpart.
He writes that the quality of safety is not as good as the factories and construction sites in our country.
On the occasion of the National Security Day of India on 4th March, the Prime Minister should take the topic of safety in his Mann Ki Baat programme, which will enhance awareness about the safety of the people.
When we talk about public security, two things are important, sustainability and preparation.
Safety is of two types one which is necessary during disasters and the other is necessary in the daily life.
We are not aware of safety in the daily life but it becomes difficult to achieve safety during the times of disasters.
If we are cautious, if we follow the necessary rules then we can protect our lives and save our society from a major accident.
We see that many things have been written about the safety of the workplace but they do not seem to be followed.
The municipalities, municipalities, who have firepower vehicles, have to go to different schools once a week or a month and make a mock drill in front of the students.
It will have two benefits, the Agricultural Force will also have the habit of being cautious and the new generation will also get education and it does not require a different expenditure, in a way it becomes a part of education and that is why I have always been asking for it.
If we talk about disasters and crises, then India is geographically eradicated.
This country has caused some natural, human-built, disasters and chemicals and industrial accidents.
NDMA is the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) which focuses on disaster management of the country.
NDMAs are rapidly running on disasters such as earthquakes, floods, storms, landslides.
Training and awareness play an important role.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people had lost their lives every year in the light of heat, after that NDMA launched a campaign to create awareness about it and organized workshops.
It shows that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
The brave soldiers of the National Disaster Response Force, the Armed Forces, the Armed Forces and the Armed Forces do not lose their lives during the crisis.
NCCs and Scouts also help in this work and provide training.
BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal also had a joint disaster management exercise, this was the first and comprehensive effort.
These children should become an integral part of their life.
Build my dear countrymen, under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the emphasis has been laid on creating energy from wealth and waste through biogas for the village.
The initiative has been launched and it has been named as Gobar Dhan and Galvanaizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
Energy is generated from sugarcane and biological fertilizers in some European countries and China, but it was not used in India with full potential.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, we are moving towards this direction.
Animal Husbandry, Farm Waste, Cooking Waste etc. have been aimed at utilising bio-based energy generation.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers and brothers and sisters of rural India will be encouraged to see see seeds and wastes not only as poultry but also as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help the villages to stay clean.
Farmer and animal husbandry will help in increasing income.
This will enhance employment opportunities by collecting garbage, transportation and sale of biogas.
A online platform will be set up for proper implementation of Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect farmers with the consumer and will get the right price for sugarcane and agricultural harvesting goods.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially the sisters living in rural India, to take initiatives, to create a Self Help Group, to make cooperative committees and take advantage of this opportunity.
I invite you to become a partner of this movement for clean energy and green employment and take initiatives to transform the waste wealth of our village and convert sugarcane into wealth.
Various art works have been prepared by using waste.
Workshops have been organised to train people about all aspects of waste management.
Everyone had innovative ideas about cleanliness, communicated and presented poems.
A festival environment was created about cleanliness.
In particular, school students took part in this event.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which this festival was celebrated for waste management and cleanliness.
Each year, 8th March is celebrated as International Womens Day.
Several programmes are organized in the country and in the world.
This day, women who have done remarkable work in different fields are honored.
Today, the country is moving ahead of women's development and under women's leadership.
I remember Swami Vivekananda's thoughts on this moment, he said that ideal women's concept is a complete freedom.
Twenty-twenty years ago, Swamiji's ideas expresses his thoughts about women's power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal partnership of women in every field of social and economic life.
We are part of a tradition where men are identified by women, the son of success, the son of Kaushalya, the son of Gandhari.
This is the dream of a New India that women are empowered, are strong and are equal partners in the development of the country.
A few days ago, a person had suggested me a good thing, he said that on March 8, several programmes are being held on Women's Day.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis 50 thousand Raj Mistry.
You can imagine how big it is.
The women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will convert the Swachhta Abhiyan into a habit of masses in normal life.
Brothers and sisters, Two days ago, I had told that after 70 years of independence in three villages of Eliphanta Islands, there was a pleasure among the people there.
You know that this island is 10 kilometres away from Mumbai.
The life of the people of Rajbandar, Morabandar and Set monkeys in three villages in Eliphant for 70 years has grown up.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and the people there.
I am glad that Eliphanta village and caves have emerged.
It is not just electricity but also a new beginning.
What can be a matter of joy than the life of the people of the country and the happiness of their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, We have just celebrated the festival of Mahashivaratri.
The speciality of this month is that the hustle-bustle of crops and hustle-bustle-bustle-bustle-bustle-bustle-bustle of the month of March.
We love this month for the festival of Holi.
Holi will be celebrated on 2nd March across the country.
Holi has a colorful significance as well as Holika Dahna has the importance of burning the evil tendency.
May this festival be pleasant in the lives of our countrymen.
Building my dear country very much thanks, blessings
Mann Ki Baat, January 2018
In the year 2018, we have been interacting with you for the first time through Mann Ki Baat.
Two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Day with great zeal.
The event was attended by the Chief Guests of 10 countries for the first time in history.
My dear countrymen, today I will mention the letter of Prakash Tripathi.
It is a pleasure to see that women are progressing rapidly in every area of India, are moving forward and enhancing the value of the country.
The honour of women from our country since ancient times, their place and their contribution to the society is a big thing and a new thing for the entire world.
There is a big tradition of great scholars in India.
Several scholars of India have a significant contribution to the creation of Vedas.
Lopa Mudra, Gargi, Maitreya are not known as many names can be taken.
This lady power keeps the entire country, the entire society and our family in the midst of unity.
Be it a great scholar like Lopa Mudra, Gargi and Maitreya of Vedic times, be it a saint of great knowledge and devotion like Akka Mahadevi and Meerabai or a brave battlefield like Ahilyabai Holkar or ueen Laxmibai, women power always inspires us.
Prakash Tripathy has mentioned several examples in his letter.
He has written that our brave defence minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, inspired the journey of Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft.
The three Dhadasi women, Bhav Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi, are now being trained in Sukhoi-30.
Just a few days ago, the Honble President started a new thing.
The President met a group of women who have done such extraordinary achievements for the first time in their respective fields.
Our women's power has done extraordinary work to break the series of conservation in the society and established a new record.
He showed that hard work, hard work, hard work and resolve, if there is a strong resolve, if there is any obstacle, if there is any obstacle then it can cross them and create a new path.
Now this path is inspiring not only our contemporary people but also to many generations.
This book is available in the e-book form of Narendra Modi Website.
Today, the women power of this country has a very important role in the positive changes in the country and the society.
Today, when you are discussing women empowerment, I want to mention a railway station here.
Now, we might have come to know what is the relationship between a railway station and women empowerment.
The first railway station in India is Matunga Railway Station in Mumbai.
There are women employees in all the departments in this station.
After observing the deliberations of the Republic Day, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media that all women had joined the BSF Bicker Continent.
These women were experiencing adventurous experiments and surprisingly surprised the guests from abroad.
Both words of empowerment and self-reliance are the same.
Today our women are leading.
They are becoming self-reliant.
But our tribal women and women of Chhattisgarh have created a new picture in front of the country.
The area of Dantewada district in Chhattisgarh is under the influence of Maoism.
The Maoists have created a very different atmosphere of violence, atrocities, bombs, guns and pistols.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running e-rickshaws in such a dangerous area.
The introduction of a society's life is due to the changes and improvements made by itself.
Continuous efforts are being made in our country against social evil and evil practices and methods.
A good effort was made in Bihar just a few days ago.
In order to eliminate social evils, more than 13,000 kilometres of human chains were created in the state, which was the longest human chain in the world.
In this campaign, people have created awareness among the society against bad practices such as child marriage, haunting etc.
The entire state has resolved to fight against evils like Hunda and Balviwah.
Youth, mothers and sisters participated in this campaign.
This human range started from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna was connected to the borders of the state .
Our society should be freed from such evils so that all the people of the society need to benefit from development in the true sense.
Let us all resolve to eliminate such evils from the society and create a New India, a powerful and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the State, the administration of the region and every person involved in the human categories.
However, after getting the information about Jan Aushadhi Kendra, he has started buying medicines from there and now the cost of his parents' medicines has decreased by 75.
This provides huge financial assistance to the common man, especially the senior citizens who are using medicines everyday.
Generic drugs to be purchased in this are similar to the standards set by the WHO.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable rates.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This not only provides cheaper medicines but also provides new employment opportunities to the individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendras and patients at Amrit Stores.
The only objective of these schemes is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country, which will create a healthy and prosperous India relationship.
My dear countrymen, Shriyut Mangesh from Maharashtra has sent a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
The separation of this picture will give me the attention to it.
In this photograph, a mother joined the Clin Morana River with her adornments.
I am aware that the people of Akola have started programmes to clean the Moran river in Swachh Bharat Mission.
Another painful thing is that wild grass was fountained in the river's character.
A large amount of garbage was thrown on the river and its shores.
The Swachh Morana Mission was launched on 13th January, before the Makar Sankranti, in the first phase, the two coasts of the Morana river were cleaned at four places in four kilometres.
I have come to know that till the time Morana river is not completely cleaned, the Akolekar will continue this campaign every Saturday morning.
It shows that if a man decides to do something, then there is nothing impossible.
Through the mass movement, it can bring about changes by doing a lot of work.
My dear countrymen, today there is a lot of discussion about the Padma Awards and you will definitely listen to it.
Every year there is a tradition of awarding Padmas, but for the last three years, the entire process of this award has been changed.
Now anybody can introduce any name for this award.
This entire process has been transparent due to online.
Now the importance of the work done by the person is being taken into account and introduced to give the award.
You must have heard that you will be happy to know the work of Arvind Gupta ji.
Aurobindo ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has spent his life in creating a sports game for young children.
They are constantly striving to understand the science of the children to use scientific experiments from the useless, fabricated things.
He visited three thousand schools across the country and showcased the paintings made in 18 different languages and inspired the children.
This is the case with Sitaviva Joddi of Karnataka.
He was addressed not only by the goddess of empowerment of women.
Sitava has contributed to transforming the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi over the last three decades.
In the seventh year of age, he was dedicated to himself as Devdasi, but Sitava spent his entire life for the welfare of the Goddesses.
Not only this, they have also done a great job for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard a lot about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh and Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor tribal family.
He was doing a simple job for swimming but he was a synonym of traditional tribal paintings and paintings.
He has been honored not only in India but also in the entire world.
They have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England, Italy.
The Padma Shri Award has been given to him by recognising the talent of Indias name Bhajju Shyam ji.
He has built more than 500 medicinal plants on the basis of his memories.
The Padma Shri Award has been conferred with the dignity of his social work by discovering the distinguished and discovering the distinguished personalities.
Today, I am delighted to mention another name here and the 75-year-old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal has also been selected for the Padma Awards.
Subhasini Mistry washed the utensils and sold vegetables in the houses of others to build the patient.
He was inspired to create a patient for the poor due to this crisis in life.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in the hospital constructed by their tireless hard work.
I would like to tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who have worked for the society, who have lived for the society, who have dedicated their lives to the society and who have worked for the entire life with some special objectives.
Such people are not working at all for respect.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Puja Mahatma Gandhi returned to India on 9th January from South Africa.
On this day, we have a unique bond between the Indians living in India and the world.
You will be happy to know that the Mayor of the Indian origin, the Members of Parliament and the Peoples representatives from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States and many other countries participated.
I would like to thank the European Union for giving this information to the people of the world through a remarkable work, for the identification of the people of the original Indian origin and through the direction.
Those who showed a new path to all of you, the date of Puja Bapu is on 30th January.
The path of peace and non-violence is the path of Bapu, be it India or the world, be it individual or family or society.
Namaskar
This is the last programme of Mann Ki Baat in this year and this is the last day of the year 2017.
In the entire year, we have spoken a lot of things together and shared a lot.
Everything used to provide new energy to me for the innumerable letters, reactions and exchanges of ideas that you have come from Mann Ki Baat.
Now this year is going to be changed in a few hours, but it will continue to be the maiden of our conversations.
In the coming year, we will also discuss new topics and share new experiences.
Many congratulations to all of you for 2018.
Just a few days ago, on 25th December, Christmas festival was celebrated all over the world with great enthusiasm.
We also see the emotions of service in the bibal.
The Sun of Man Haj Kam, NOT TO B Service, But To Service, And to Guivah Hiz Life, Az Blassingtu All Humankind.
In these tables, what is the festival of service, what is the greatness.
Anything that is in this world, be it religion, be it tradition, be it narrative but the invaluable form of humanity is being introduced through service.
We are talking about Nishkam Karma in our country. Nishkam Karma is not expecting anything.
We are also called 'Seva Parmo Dharma'.
The life-service is the Shiva-service and Gurudev Ramakrishna Paramhansa has said that the life-service should be done with a spiritual spirit.
My dear countrymen, this year was the 350th light festival of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The abnormal life filled with the bravery and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is an inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji gave the preachings of great values and he himself lived on the basis of those values.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji inspired the people through all the roles such as a guru, a poet, philosopher, a great warrior.
He fought against atrocities and injustices.
He taught the people to blame the bonds of caste and religion.
In all these endeavours, they had to face a lot at the personal level.
But he never gave a sense of feeling in his mind.
Every moment in his life, he kept giving a message of love, sacrifice and peace.
It shows how great and unique their personality is.
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to participate in the Prakash Festival organized here on the occasion of 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
January 1, 2018.
You will also be surprised that the new year used to come and even one January comes every year.
But whenever I say special, it is indeed a special thing.
And I urge all of you to register your names as a voter.
The whole of India is eager to welcome its 21st century voter.
As the 21st century electorate, we will also feel that we also get a honour.
Our opinion is the basis of New India.
The strength of the vote in democracy is the biggest strength.
Voting is the most effective means to bring about positive changes in the lives of millions of people.
We have the right to vote only.
So how should India be in the 21st century, what should our dreams be in the 21st century India
You will also be the manufacturer of India in the 21st century and it will start from January 1 with special significance.
I am confident that our dream of a New India will be fulfilled with the strength of the skills towards this energetic youth.
When we talk about New India, this New India should be free from evils such as casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
It should be free from cleanliness and poverty.
Peace, unity and goodwill should be our guide force in New India.
Let us discuss how the youth of New India should come forward and how a New India should be.
They should also set a way for us and those who have been connected with it will become such a big group.
We are also moving forward and the country will also move forward.
As soon as I have been interacting with you today, I have a thought that can we organise a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Can the youth of the age groups of 18-25 years come together and think about New India and find different ways
Before the year 2022, how can we fulfil our resolve
What can we do to create India in the dreams of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi used to form the movement of freedom as a mass movement.
My young friends, today it is the need of the hour that we should also create a mass movement for a magnificent divine India in the 21st century.
Today, there are innumerable new opportunities for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and succeeding.
I think that the youth of this New India should be able to get information about all these schemes and create an independent strong system.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, I was talking about the importance of positive significance.
The people who have positiveity and zeal are able to do any work easily.
People in English say that in the last Mann Ki Baat of the Pessimism Lids to Weekness, Optimism to Power, I used to urge the countrymen to share the positive moments that you have experienced in 2017 and welcome in such a positive environment.
People have given a lot of positive response to the social media, My Gov and Narendra Modi App and have shared their experiences.
Some people have done some special work in their personal life.

This is why the roads have become very good here and the business is shining.
My name is Dipanshu Ahuja.
I live in Mohalla Sadatganj in Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bewani.
We had a very serious problem of water in our region and in the last 40 years we were dependent on the waterways of Armi.
Now free climate has become for us.
Let us enter the New Year with the joy of such small things, let us take a pledge to move towards PRAGATION India from the start of the New Year.
Now we are talking about positiveness, so I am also enthusiastic to say one thing here.
Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak, who recently got the highest position in the Governance Services Examination in Kashmir, is very inspiring.
Terrorism and Kamali emergencies and gained the first place in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
He wrote the story of success.
Today Anjum has become an inspiration for not only Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Even though the situation is so bad, it has proved that it can destroy the disappointment of disappointment through positive work.
Recently, I got the opportunity to meet some of the girls of Jammu and Kashmir last week.
I was aware of the dreams of those who had the desired power and enthusiasm.
It was a lot of hope that in what fields they wanted to make progress in life.
I feel like talking to them, there is no despair in them.
He had enthusiasm, joy, joy, energy, huge dreams and resolves.
I also got a lot of inspiration from them during the time I spent with these Kashmiri daughters.
This is my youth today and this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to know about the temples of Sabarimala in Kerala when there was talk of not only of our country but also of the world's famous religious places.
Millions of devotees come every year to bless Lord Aiyappa Swami in this world-famous temple.
P.
Nobody is big in this campaign, nobody is small.
Every traveller understands a part of the worship of God, some or the other works as cleanliness.
No matter how big a celebrity is there, no matter how big a wealthy person is there or a senior officer who is working on a large post, everybody participates in this Punyaam Punkvanam programme like a common traveller.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
At the same time, there is a strong resolve for cleanliness as well as tools.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, all of you have resolved to make Swachh Bharat free of cleanliness.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level across the country towards cleanliness.
Peoples participation in rural areas is also changing.
The worlds largest Swachh Survekshan-2018 is scheduled from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine how much cleanliness level is in urban areas and how many successes are being achieved.
This survey will be conducted in more than four thousand cities and about 40 crore populations of the country.
It will be depicted whether in cities open defecation, collection of garbage, transportation of waste, scientific waste management or not, how many efforts are made to change the habits of the people, how many innovations are being made for capacity building and sanitation.
During this survey, different groups will check the cities.
They will interact with the people and understand their reactions.
The Cleanliness App is being used and analyzed to improve various services.
It is not just the government to keep cleanliness.
However, every citizen and citizen organisation is also a big responsibility to maintain cleanliness.
And I urge every citizen to participate in the Swachhta Survey.
And make a pledge that you do not want to ask for the cleanliness of your city, your streets and your society should not be behind.
I am confident that you must have felt the habit of classification of dry waste and wet waste and you will be using blue and green waste while waste.
Reduce, Reuse and Recycling principles are very effective for waste.
If the population of our city is more than one lakh then it should be our dream that if there is more than one lakh population in the entire country and if there is less than one lakh population then it should be the highest number in the area sequence.
And we should also make such efforts.
And all of us should have a dream of 'Our City-Our Efforts', 'Our progress and progress of our country.
Let us once again recall the revered Bapus resolve to fulfill the resolve of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, there are some such things that it looks very small but if we look at it as a society then it becomes our identity.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to share one such thing with you.
I realised that if a Muslim woman wants to go to Hajrayatra then she cannot go only to Maharam or her husband.
Specially, such bonds and rules are not even in Islamic countries.
But in India, only Muslim women did not get this right.
And I am very happy to note here that our government should take care of this thing.
I am confident and I firmly believe that the journey of Indias development will continue to move forward on the strength of our women-power and their talent.
And that is why our women should also get equal rights and equal opportunities along with men, we should continue to make efforts and we need to move forward with women and men on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26 January is a historic festival for you.
This year, 26th January, 2018 will be remembered with a special reminder.
This year, the Republic Day Celebrations will be the leading guests of all the 10 ASEAN countries.
This year, the Republic Day will be one or ten Chief Guests.
The year 2017 was special for both ASEAN countries and India.
The ASEAN has completed its 50 years in 2017 and the 25th anniversary of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2017 itself.
It is a matter of pride for all of our Indians to join the 10 great leaders of the world on 26th January.
Friends, Dear countrymen, today the days of festivals are being celebrated and our country is a country of festivals in a way.
Perhaps no day can be said that no festival is celebrated on that day.
The next year, let us all take a lot of joy, happiness and prosperity.
We all move forward with new zeal, new zeal, new joy and new resolve.
In the month of January, the sun's Uttarayana will start and this month is celebrated with Makar Sankranti, which is connected to nature.
Sankranta in Rajasthan, Magh-Bihu in Assam, Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all these festivals have a special significance.
All these festivals are ordinarily celebrated during January 13-17.
Thank you very much, dear countrymen.
Now we are going to say this again in 2018.
The Indian citizens will not be able to find out that they are not respected.
At that age, we are very bigger than all of us and are witnesses of different phases of the country.
I was fortunate to have a telephone conversation with Didi before my departure to foreign visits.
It was a lovely interaction between us in such a way that we should talk to our elder sisters with a younger brother.
I don't really talk about such personal speeches.
Let us know that Latadididi is also eager for every thing related to the country on this movement of life.
The spirit of satisfaction in his life is linked to Indias progress, is connected to the changing India, is connected to the new heights of progress.
Modi ji: Latadidi Namaskar.
I am talking about Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: I will be on a plane journey.
Lata ji: Okay, okay.
What should be celebrated on the birthday
And the achievement that we have achieved has been achieved through the means and penance.
I am really nothing.
Lata ji: Yeah.
I also keep getting your letters and I also keep getting your visits.
I do not want to distress you because I am looking at you, I imagine how many things you are working and how many things you have to think about.
Modi ji: My mother was very happy with your affection.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: but I will come soon.
Festivals will continue throughout the country for the next several weeks.
Your houses will be full of joy.
But you must have seen that there are many people around you who are deprived of the joy of these festivals.
It is said that the darkness below the light is called.
Most of these words are not just words but there is an order for us, a philosophy, a motivation.
Whenever you come to our houses, sweets, dresses, visits, then get out of this visit for a moment.
Make sure that the things that we don't use at least in our houses are more than required.
In many cities, many such institutions work with the start-ups of young partners.
They collect essential things like clothes, cereals, food from the houses of the people and find the requirements and reach them.
I laugh at the face of many poor families, I will double my joy of festivals, will shine on our faces, your light will be more illuminated and our Diwali will shine again.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi comes home in the form of good fortune and prosperity in Diwali and is welcomed in the traditional form.
Can we welcome Lakshmi in a new way this year
Girls have been considered as Lakshmi in our culture because girls bring fortunateness and prosperity.
Can we organise the honour of girls in our society, villages and cities this year
Can we make a programme for the honour of these Laxmis of India in Diwali this year
There will be many daughters and many sunsets around you who are doing extraordinary work.
Somebody is working to teach the poor children, somebody is working to create awareness about cleanliness and health, someone is working to serve the society by becoming a doctor or an engineer.
Our society should recognize such lakes, honor them and keep them proud.
The programme of such honour should be held across the country.
One more thing can be done.
The success of these girls should be shared with more information through social media and use the hashtag of Bharat Ki Laxmi.
We had launched the Selfie With Daughter Movement and it was spread all over the world, in the same way, we should also take the mission of India's Laxmi.
Promoting India's Laxmi initiative means empowering the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had previously said that the Mann Ki Baat programme has a great advantage that I am fortunate to have a direct or indirect interaction with many well-known and unique persons.
A few days ago, Alina Tayang, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, has sent me a leaflet and he has written in it, I read that letter before you.
I live in Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This year, when my test took place, some people asked me why did you read the book Exam Warriors
I told them that I did not read this book.
But again I bought this book and read it two-three times.
My experience was very good after that.
I felt that if I had read this book before testing, I would have benefited a lot.
I believe that if you are thinking about the new dimensions of this book then you must include some more mantras and other labourers for parents and teachers.
Many thanks to me for giving me thanks and thanks for reading the book Exam Warriors twice or three times.
My little friend has also given me an order to do something.
I will surely follow your order.
I will definitely try to write something for the parents and the teachers when the new text of this book comes.
But I would urge you all to help me in this work.
What are your experiences in the daily life
I once again express my gratitude to our little friend of Arunachal, student Alina Tayang.
My dear countrymen, through newspapers, through television you are getting information about the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country.
But you know that I am also a common man like you, a common citizen and that is why the impact of things that can be seen on an ordinary life is affecting me and also on my mind because I am also one of you.
Then I also heard the speech and saw the confrontation.
Just a short while ago, he was defeated by the Emperor Rafael Nadal of the Tennis world, who won the Grand Slam 19 times.
The audience of his speech was excitedly welcomed by the visitors.
He also complimented the awardees of Danil, Nadal, how he has inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis.
He praised the competitor Nadal and presented an excellent example of the sportspersons.
At the same time, on the other hand, winner Nadal also lauded the sports of Danil.
There is a lot like this that every class of people and every age can learn.
These are moments that are crossing the win or defeat when victory or defeat does not mean much.
The ideas of our ancestors were really commendable.
Vidya Vinay User Hartin Nervous Kasya Manujsya Mani Kanchan Says: Janayati Loksya Lochan Anandam, i. e.
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of all the people around the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, whatever I am going to say is going to tell you for your good.
The debate will continue, the differences between the parties will continue, but if some of the things are stopped at a rapid pace, then it will benefit a lot.
It becomes difficult after stopping the things that are increasing rapidly and spreading far away.
But in the beginning if we get awakened and stop it then a lot can be saved.
With this feeling, I think today, especially with my dear youngsters.
You all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit intoxication .
Because of nicotine present in tobacco the quantity of intoxication is more in it .
By consuming it in adolescence there is adverse effect on the development of brain .
But today I want to talk to you about a new subject.
You will be aware that recently e-cigarettes have been enforced in India.
E cigarettes are such electronic devices different from regular cigarettes .
A kind of chemical smoke is produced because of the heat of nicotine rich fried substances in cigarette , through which nicotine is consumed .
You will have a lot of information about the dangers of daily cigarettes, but an unconsciousness has been spread about e cigarettes that there is no danger due to e cigarettes.
Aromatic chemicals are used in it to prevent it from spreading like other cigarettes .
We have seen around you that there are young chensmokers in many houses but they prevent others from smoking and stop them.
E cigarette is different .
If someone smokes around you then you understand it from its dwelling itself .
If there is a pocket of cigarettes in someone 's pocket then also he understands only from vasectomy .
But e cigarettes are not such because many adolescents and youngsters are very proud of their books as fashion statistics and sometimes they are seen taking e cigarettes in their hands and then becoming intoxicated.
Youth generation is the future of the country.
Cigarettes have been set up to ensure that this type of drug addiction does not foster our youth.
These restrictions have been laid to protect the dreams of the family from deteriorating, prevent the lives of the children from natives and not to spread their hands in the society due to the habit of intoxication.
I urge all of you to leave this intoxication of tobacco and do not keep any uncomfortable about e cigarettes .
Let us all together create a healthy India.
Hey, do you remember Fit India
Fit India does not mean that in the morning and evening two hours we go to the gym.
For Fit India one has to stay away from all these intoxications too .
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of privilege for you that our country has been the birthplace and workplace of many such abnormal people who have spent their lives for the welfare of others.
India is the birthplace of many such extraordinary people, is the land of work and these are the people who have sacrificed their lives for the welfare of not only for themselves but also for the welfare of others.
One such great person will be honored on October 13 at Vatican City.
This is certainly a matter of pride for every Indian, Pope France will declare Maryam Threasia as a saint on October 13.
The work done by Sister Maryam Threasia for the welfare of humanity in our short life of just 50 years is a unique example for the entire world.
He was very compassionate about social service and education.
He set up several schools, habitats and orphanages.
He established the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Family, which is still fulfilling his life values and missions.
Once again I pay my homage to Sister Maryam Thressia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for the entire India, not for the whole of the world, that today when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians have resolved to be free from single usage plastic.
Today, the vision of countries around the world is encompassing Indias leadership towards environmental protection.
I am confident that all of you will be participating in the campaign to get rid of single youth plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing to this mission in their own way but a young man of our country has started running a mission in a unique way.
When I looked at his work, I interacted with him on telephone and tried to understand his new experiments.
Perhaps the interaction with them will be beneficial for some other people of the country.
Shri Ut Riputman Belviji is making a unique effort.
When I heard the word Plogging for the first time, it was also new for me.
You are implementing this entire programme in a innovative manner and in a special way that you will like the youth.
I convey my best wishes to you.
Friends, This year, the Ministry of Sports is also organizing the Fit India Plogging Run on the birth anniversary of respected Bapu.
Two kilometres plogging on 2nd October.
This programme is going to be held throughout the country.
We have heard about how to do this programme, what should be done in the programme.
With this mission, awareness about the health of the people and awareness about cleanliness is also increasing.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians have taken a step towards getting rid of single usage plastic, then India will take 130 crore steps together.
Ripudman ji, once again thank you very much.
I convey my best wishes to you, to your team and to your innovation.
I want to tell you a little about one thing.
In fact, I will definitely tell you about this in the next Mann Ki Baat program, but today I am telling you that you should get the opportunity to prepare.
We will be aware of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels birth anniversary on 31st October.
So we will start preparing for that from now on.
It's just going to talk about this, but it's still time.
Some people can start the exercise and some other schemes can also be prepared.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 we should visit 15 places in India.
Programme for at least fifteen places and one-two night stay .
Let us see India, understand, experience India.
We have so much diversity.
And when people come to the holidays on the occasion of Diwali, they definitely go to tour, so I once again request you to visit any fifteen places in India.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that today the World Tourism Day was celebrated on 27th September and some of the responsible institutions of the world present the tourism sequence and that India has improved its position in the competitive index of tourism.
And it has been possible only because of the cooperation of all of you, especially because of the importance of tourism.
If we make further efforts, we will certainly be able to get the top of the world's major tourist destinations when we complete 75 years of independence.
It should be enjoyed, enthusiasm should also be there.
Our festivals are celebrated together and celebrated together, so that editions are also achieved by this collectiveness, a new strength of collective life is achieved.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to interact with the children of Karnataka.
The Times Group's Vijay Karnataka newspaper launched an initiative in which he urged the children to send letters to the Prime Minister.
He has also written that if you give more information about the nature of children then it will be beneficial in the future to protect the environment.
The girl named Rida Nadaf of Laxmeshwara has written that she is the daughter of a soldier of the army and she feels proud of this thing.
Doesn't any Indian feel the pride of the army personnel
And you are the daughter of that soldier, it is very natural for you to feel proud.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has said that his school is 5 kilometres away from his village, so that he has to get out of the house soon and gets too late to return home.
He said that he is not able to play with his friends for a long time and should have a school near his house.
Brothers and sisters, I got the opportunity to save this letter from me by taking initiatives by a newspaper.
It was a very good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
On this day in 1949, the Constituent Assembly accepted the incident of India.
The implementation of the Constitution started on 26th January, 1950 and that is why we celebrate 26th January as the Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember members of the Constitution.
He worked hard for nearly three years to create a Constitution.
No area of life, no subject of nature has been left in it.
This is the identity of our state building, equality and sensitivity for all.
It is our duty to comply with our Constitution.
Be it citizens or administrators, everybody should utilize the Constitution as per the Constitution.
This is the message of the Constitution that no one has any harm.
The Moses Committee was one of the most important committees.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Committee.
He was playing a very big role.
He assured that every section of the society will be benefitted.
On 6th December, we remember him on his Mahaparinirvan Diwas.
Babasaheb has a great contribution in enriching and empowering the country.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 15th December.
Sardar Patel, who is a farmer's son to a iron man, also worked abnormally to build the country in a similar synonym.
Sardar Patel was also a member of the Constitution House.
He was also the Chairman of the Consultative Committee for fundamental rights, minorities and tribals.
But nine years ago, even the country cannot forget that there was a terrorist attack on Mumbai on 2611 this day.
I recall the brave citizens, police and security guards who lost their lives on this day.
Their sacrifices will never be forgotten.
He has been decorated to destroy human power.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world should unite and defeat terrorism.
Birth of this land, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi have given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to weaken and destroy our social structure.
And that is why it is the need of the hour to be more aware of the humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, on December 4, we will celebrate Naval Day.
The Indian Navy protects our maritime edges.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You must be aware that our culture has developed in the coastal areas of the rivers.
Whether it is the Indus river or the river Ganga or the Yamuna or the Saraswati, our rivers and the sea are important in both economic and strategic areas.
These are the entrances for the entire world.
This country has a unique relationship with the oceans of our land.
When we look at the history, 800-900 years ago, the King's navy was counted among the most capable naval naval navals during the Rasa dynasty.
In the expansion of the Maldives Empire, his Navy had promised to bring the empire as an economic power at that time.
Several examples of the expeditions and research journeys are still available in the confluence literature.
It would be very few people who have been allowed to include women in most of the navies in the world after a long time.
But in the navigation of the navigation, it was also 800-900 years ago.
These women were also involved in the war.
The shipbuilding of the Mars rulers had the latest knowledge.
How can the capability of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his navy be forgotten when the Navy is mentioned
The territory of Konkan with a maritime virtues was included in the state of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud-Janjira, Golden Durg related to Shivaji Maharaj were in the seashore or were standing in the sea .
The navy of Marathas was protecting these forts.
The Marathas were included in large and small boats.
Their naval personnel were eager to attack any enemy and protect themselves from the attack.
It is impossible to discuss Maratha Aramar and not mention Kanhoji Angre.
He gave a new glory to the Arma of Marathas and laid the foundations of Marathas in many places.
Even after independence, the Indian Navy has performed a series of phenomenons.
Whether it is the India-Pakistan war in Goa or the 1971.
The INS Sumitra of our Navy helped in quick rescue and supplied several fishermen safely out of water to Bangladesh.
In the month of May-June this year, when there was a huge flood in Sri Lanka, three boats of our Navy reached there immediately and they helped the government and the people there.
The warship carried out by the INS of our Navy on Rohingya in Bangladesh, helped mankind.
In the month of June, the Papua New Guinea government gave us the message of SOS and helped our Navy to save the fishermen on their fisherman boat.
On 21st November, the INS Trikand of our Navy flew to help in a merchant ship in West Galf during the maritime attack.
This year, the Ministry of Defence has decided to launch a special campaign from 1st to 7th December.
Throughout the week, children, elders, all of them have taken the nation's flag.
There should be a movement to express respect for the army across the country.
On this occasion we can distribute the flag of the Armed Forces.
If any of your introductions are related to the Armed Forces, their experiences, their dragonous actions, their paintings and photographs related to them can be posted at Harmedforcesflagday.
In schools, colleges, the people of the Armed Forces can invite more information about the work of the Armed Forces.
This is a great opportunity for our new generation to get more information about the army.
This is also the opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all the soldiers of our defence forces.
The fund is utilised for the welfare of the injured soldiers and their rehabilitation for the families of soldiers martyred in the war through the Military Welfare Board.
Let us also contribute to the morale of our Armed Forces on this occasion.
Let us also take care of them for their welfare.
My dear countrymen, World Soil Day is on 5th December.
I also want to tell my farmer brothers and sisters something.
Soil meaning soil is an important element of the earth.
Everything you eat is related to this soil.
In a way the entire food chain is connected to the soil.
Imagine what happens if there is no nutritious soil in the world
How's the stupid survivor
This was considered long ago in our culture and that is why we have been conscious of the importance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, on the one hand, the feeling of devotion towards agriculture, soil and respect should be completely natural in the minds of the people and the use of many scientific methods has also been nurtured by soil.
Two things are very important in the lives of the farmers of this country, the feeling of devotion to our soil and the scientific perspective.
We are proud of the fact that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and they are also aware of modern sciences.
I have heard about Tohu village, Bhoranj block and farmers of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The farmers there used to use chemical fertilizers in an imbalanced manner, so that the quality of soil was reduced.
The production was reduced and the farmers income was also reduced and the production of soil was also reduced.
Some aware farmers of the village knew the situation and then the farmers of the village tested their soil as they were advised to use fertilizers, nutrients and biological fertilizers.
You will be surprised to hear the results that the information provided to the farmers through soil health cards has shown positive results in the implementation of the guidance received.
The production of wheat in 2016-17 increased by three to four times and the income increased by Rs. 4 to 6,000.
If you take care of the crop then you should take care of the soil and if you take care of the mother Dami then it will also take care of yourself.
More than 10 crore farmers across the country have prepared soil health cards to provide better information about our soil.
We devote the mother of Dami but do you think how harmful the mother of this damsel is like urea
It has been proved by many scientific experiments that urea causes loss of land.
The farmer is the son of this damn mother and then how will she be sick to her mother
It is the need of the hour to revive this relationship of mothers and sons.
Can our farmers resolve to use urea for our farming till 2022, that is, 75 years of independence
Once the sons of Dami Mata and the farmers resolved that the health of the dam will be improved rapidly and the production will also increase.
There will be a real change in the lives of the farmers.
We are now feeling that global temperature rises and changes in the environment.
It was a time when the cold started before Diwali.
It is now coming to December and the cold starts completely.
It is our experience that the cold started and it does not feel like getting out of the bed.
However, in such a season, people with awareness work effectively and their examples inspire all of us.
But the determination and resolve was greater than all, it was powerful.
The eight-year-old son could not speak, but he took the base of Shitti.
Arising at 5 a.m. in the morning, the child was told to go to the house of the village and not to open toilets.
The effort of this child to teach cleanliness in at least 30-40 households everyday has made this village open defecation free.
Every minute gets some new learning.
Today they are doing good work in every field.
Be it sports, competition, social initiatives, our disabilities are not behind any matter.
You must be remembered, in the Rio Olympics, our Divyang sportspersons had earned 4 medals and won the World Head of Te-Twenty Crickets of the blind.
Several types of competitions are going on across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Para Aquatic Competition was organised in Udaipur.
There are no muscles in the 80 percent of their body but look at their courage, determination and hard work.
He also won the Gold Medals at the 70th National Para Aquatic Competition, and was selected by the Indian Sports Authority for 20-20 Paralimpics.
They include 32 Para watersheds and all of them will be trained at the Excellence Centre in Gujarat.
I salute Youth Jigar Thakkar and congratulate him.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
On this day, Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen and hope that this festival of Eid will inspire all of you to enhance peace and goodwill in the society.
Namaskar Prime Minister ji, I speak from Kanpur to Nirja Singh.
I urge you to recall the best ten of the things you have spoken through Mann Ki Baat in a year so that we can recall that thing and we can learn something new.
We have made very good information.
After listening to your speech, I feel like to put a lot in it and change it.
We always say that the old people of the village are in the villages, forget, do not let them forget happiness.
Whether it is a photo, a small story, a thing or a small drive, I invite you to welcome 2018 in a beautiful environment, we have to do it with good memories, we have to do it with positive ideas.
Whether it is on Narendra Modi App, on MyGov or on social media, share positive things with positive India.
Please illuminate the events that inspire others.
We all see the strength of these collective efforts and its impact together.
I will definitely try to reach out to the people of the country in the next chapter of Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I will once again interact with you all for Mann Ki Baat in the next month.
There will be an opportunity to speak many things.
Thank you a lot
The sixth festival after Deepawali is one of the festivals to be celebrated with dedication in our country.
In which traditional regulations are followed from diet to cereals .
The unprecedented festival of Chhathapuja is completely connected with the worship of nature and nature.
Surya and Jal, the Mahaparva are at the centre of Chhath Upasana, while bamboo and mud-building utensils and vermilions are useful in worship.
The world worships Ugavata, but in Chhathpuja, it also gives us the essence of worshipping them that are certain.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also included in this festival.
The cleanliness of the entire house, along with rivers, ponds, shores and pujas are very excited.
Surya Vandana or Chhathpuja is the festival of conservation, prevention and discipline.
Ordinarily, eating and eating something is being considered as a deficiency and a deficient feeling.
But after half of the morning in Chhathapuja, it is a special tradition.
This is the reason behind the demand of Prasad that the ego ends, the ego is such a feeling that the person becomes obstacles in the progress of the person.
It is very natural for the people to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am confident that Mann Ki Baat has been constructed with the people of the country in a hundred per cent connection.
Take examples of khadi and handloom.
I always request Gandhi Jayanti for handloom, Khadi and you will be happy to know what is the result of it.
I would like to say that on 17th October this month, on the day of Dhantrayodashi, a record sale of Rs. 1 crore 20 lakh was registered in the Khadi Gramodyog Bhawan Store in Delhi.
You might have been happy to hear that Khadi and Handloom are sold in such a large number of stores.
During Deepawali, the sale of Khadi Gift Kupan has increased by nearly 680.
The sale of khadi handicrafts and handicrafts has also increased by about 90 this year as compared to last year.
Today, the youth, the elderly, the women, the people of every age group like Khadi and handloom.
I can imagine how much the wealthy families, the poor families, the families who have been working on handlooms would have benefited from this business.
But with the experience of the past few years, I can say that Khadi for nation and Khadi for fashion have now replaced Khadi for transformation.
In the life of the poorest of the Khadi poor, the handloom becomes a means to make them empowered, empowered and empowered by changing the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is a big role for the village industry.
Shriman Rajan Bhatta wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he wanted to know about the experiences of my security forces in Deepawali and how our security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shri Tejas Gaikwad has also asked the Narendra Modi App to provide sweets to the security forces.
We also remember our brave security forces.
We feel that the sweets of our house should be reached to the soldiers of the country.
You must have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
This Diwali also brought a special experience for me.
I respect every soldier of the security forces, along with all the countrymen, for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice of our security forces, while facing the difficult and tough situations on the border.
When you get time, when you get time, you should understand the experiences of the soldiers, you should listen to their glorious story.
Many of you do not know that our soldiers are not only protecting our borders but also playing an important role in world peace.
Everyone is aware of the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace all over the world and their positive landscape.
And we believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is my family.
With this belief, India has been active in various UN initiatives since the beginning.
We all know that the proposal for Indias constitution and the proposal for the UN Charter is initiated by the words of Wui the Pipal.
India has always emphasized women equality and the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights is the same living example.
The exposure that was made in its international frame was replaced by the efforts of Indias representative Hansa Mehta, who was then accepted by All Human Bings R Barne Free and Equal.
If you want to see it then it changes a bit, but a powerful idea would be seen from it.
Indias contribution to UN Peacekeeping Operations is the role of India.
More than eighteen thousand Indian security forces have served in UN Peacekeeping operations.
Normally seven thousand soldiers were connected to UN Peacekeeping and this is the third highest number in the world.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served at least 50 operations in 71 Peacekeeping.
The effort of peace was made from some countries such as Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kango, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan.
In Kango and South Sudan, 20,000 patients were treated and saved innumerable people in the Indian Army Hospital.
The Indian security forces have not only protected the people of different countries but also won the minds of those people.
Indian women have also played an important and leading role in building peace.
India is the only country that a few people know that India has sent women police units in Liberia in the Peace Abhiyan Mission.
And this step of India will inspire the nations of the world.
After this, all the countries started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to hear that India's role is not only related to the peace movement but also provides peace and prosperity in 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have given the message of peace and harmony worldwide.
Peace Abhiyan, this is not a simple task.
Our security guards have to go to remote areas and do this work.
His memory blossoms in the hearts of every countrymen.
He was the only UN Piskeeper, a brave man who was honored with Paramveer Chakraan.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji made a special identity in Cyprus.
In 1989, in the 72nd year, he appointed him as the Fores Commander for Operation and served him to ensure independence of that country.
General Themaya, who was the Chief of the Indian Army, also led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and bowed down all in peace.
As a peace messenger, India always gave a message of peace, unity and harmony.
We believe that everyone should live peace, goodwill and move forward with the vision of a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our holy land has been adorned by such great personalities who have served humanity with selflessness.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call sister Nivedita, is also one of these extraordinary people.
Margaret Elizabeth Nobel was born in that Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of Nivedita.
The statement means that it is completely dedicated.
Later, he proved himself by doing his name as per his name.
Yesterday, Sister Nivedita was the 150th birth anniversary.
Swami Vivekananda's caravan was so impressed that he sacrificed his happiness and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was very distressed by the atrocities in the British Raj.
The British not only made our country a slave, but they also tried to make us psychologically punished.
It has always been going on to make our culture less written and inferior.
Brothers and sisters, Nivedita ji re-established the pride of Indian culture.
He worked to keep people together by awakening national consciousness.
He visited various countries around the world and raised voices against the opponents of Sanatan religion and philosophy.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanyam Bharti, his revolutionary poet Pudumri Penny, New Woman and women empowerment.
It was believed that his inspiration was Bhagini Nivadita.
Brothers and sisters, Nivedita ji also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
We have helped in research and propaganda through our writings and synthesis.
It is a beautiful feature of India that spirituality and science are helpful in our culture.
This is an excellent example of Sister Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
Hundreds of people lost their lives in Kolkata in 1899.
Sister Nivedita did not take care of her health and started cleaning the roads.
She was such a woman who could live a comfortable life but she was associated with the service of the poor.
The people took inspiration from them and helped them to serve them.
He taught the people of cleanliness and service from their cars.
He wrote on his commemoration that 'Hear Reposess Sister Nivedita Hu Gave Har All to India' - Sister Nivedita is resting here, who gave her all to India.
Undoubtedly, this is what they have done.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of your first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the heroes of building a New India.
It is our concern that earlier the diseases would be in old age and the diseases would come in the last stage of life and they are now seen in children as well.
Even in the youth, such diseases were absurd.
But now our lifestyle has changed.
These diseases are now known as lifestyle disorder .
There are such diseases in youth like physical activity and changes in food habits.
It is necessary that the society and the families should pay attention to this thing.
When you think about it, it will be reminded that there is no need to speed up anything.
It is just a need to change our habits, change our habits by regularising small and big things.
Instead of going to the liftons of the children, make the habit of climbing the jinna.
After dinner, try to walk with the entire family with the children.
Yoga for Young India
This Yoga, especially our young friends, will be helpful in self-confidence of neutral lifestyle and preventing lifestyle disorders.
The speciality of Yoga, which is 30 minutes before school, is that Yoga is easy and accessible.
And I say this for such a reason that Yoga can easily be done by any person of any age.
For ease, it can be learned simple technologies and it can be done for so much as possible.
For this, there is no need for special equipment and fields.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have received good news in the field of sports in the last few days.
Our sportspersons have brightened the name of the country in different areas.
In Hockey, India won the Asia Cup Hockey Trophy while playing a glorious game.
Our sportspersons showcased the best sports and on this strength, India became Asia Cup Champion after ten years.
Earlier, India was the Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to the hockey team and all of his team and the countrymen.
After Hockey, there is also a funny story in Badminton.
Bedminton Star Kidambi Srikantan won the Denmark Open Trophy and filled the country's pride.
This is his third Super Series Premier Award after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
Friends, this month the FIFA under Seventeen World Cup was organised.
Many teams from all over the world came to India and showcased their skills on the football ground.
I also got the opportunity to see a confrontation.
The sportspersons were very excited.
This big event of the World Cup was watching us all over the world.
I am happy to see such a big competition and the energy, enthusiasm and energy of the young sportspersons.
The World Cup was successful and all the teams performed the best.
Even though India did not get a glass but Indian sportspersons won the hearts of all.
This festival of all the worlds sports including India enjoyed and this entire competition became thrilling and entertaining for football lovers.
Footballs are indicating that the future is bright.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sports lovers.
My dear countrymen, I will have to do this programme of Mann Ki Baat everyday to justify the feelings of those people who write on the subject of Swachh Bharat.
Some young children send photographs of their efforts and there is a story of the youth.
Wherever there is a story of new initiatives related to cleanliness, there is a report of changes made by the passion of an officer.
Just a few days ago, I received a detailed report, in which there is a story of change in the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
At the same time, a voluntary organization named Eco-system Protection Organisation, launched a Swachhta Abhiyan at Chandrapur Fort.
In this campaign that lasted for two hundred days, people did not stop, they did not get tired, they did the work of cleaning the fort with a conscience.
I am pleased to see the photo and whoever sees this photo, whoever feels disappointed with the disappointment of the surrounding surroundings, even then I would like to tell you that the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled.
They will change their disappointment into confidence by seeing them.
My dear countrymen, all of you will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the next 4th November.
Guru Nanak Dev ji is not the first Guru of the Sikhs but he is Jagadguru.
He thought of the welfare of the entire humanity, and addressed all the castes together.
He stressed on women empowerment and women honor.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled 28 thousand kilometers and during this journey, he taught the truth of humanity.
He interacted with the people, showed the path of truth, sacrifice and duties.
The message of social equality has been given and this teaching has not only been spoken but also showed from our cars.
He started anchor and created service to the people.
The feeling of unity and equality of the people was awakened by eating together.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages of meaningful life - remember the spirituality, work, work and help in need.
Guru Nanak Devji created Gurbani to share his elements.
In 2019, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Dev ji's 55th Prakash Year.
Let us try to walk on the path of his message and teaching.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji.
You know that he had layed the foundation stone of unintegrated modern India.
Today we can learn a lot from the life of this great saint of Mother India.
The characteristics of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel are not only a transformative idea but also aimed at finding practical solutions from complicated problems.
He was an efficient expert in realizing the ideas.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done the work of investing India in a sequence.
To ensure that millions of Indians can be brought under the shadow of a nation and a Constitution.
He has been able to overcome all the difficulties with his decision-making.
Wherever we needed to honour, we respected it.
He used strength where the need to use strength was needed.
They set a goal and guided their determinations with that goal.
The work of keeping the country together could only be done.
He dreamt of a nation where all the folks are equal.
I feel that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's ideas are always inspiring.
He said, "No difference between caste and religion can stop us, all are the children of India, we should love the country and have a future on mutual love and harmony.
These ideas of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring for our vision of New India.
And his birthday is celebrated as 'National Integration Day'.
I urge all of you to participate in this festival of Run for Unity.
Dear countrymen, after Diwali vacations, with new resolves, with new determinations, all of you have come to life everyday.
My best wishes to our countrymen to realize their dreams.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
With the help of AIR, Mann Ki Baat has been completed for three years.
Today, it is 36th.
Most of them are inspired by me.
A lot of things are to improve the government.
There are also some individual complaints.
Some collective questions are taken into account and I take half an hour in a month, but people are sending things to Mann Ki Baat for thirty days.
It has resulted in sensitivity in the government.
It is easier to feel that the ability to look at all the levels of the society is now being observed and that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is an adventurous journey of feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
Perhaps I have got the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country in such a short span of time and I am grateful to the countrymen for that.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Acharya Vinoba always used to say, "An-Governmental, Non-Governmental" will result.
This thing has been kept away from the political color and at that time it has been tried to connect and connect with us with a stable mind instead of being awakened in the subjects which are angry.
I know that after three years, social researchers, universities, research intellectuals and media experts will definitely analyze this.
And I am confident that the thoughts made by such simplicity will be more useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future.
I had once said in Mann Ki Baat that we should not be able to eat and eat as much as it is necessary, it is necessary to worry about the food that is being used.
After this, I saw a large number of letters from the corners of the country.
Many social organisations, many youngsters have already been working on this thing.
I have noticed that there are many people who have been working to ensure that the food that is given in the stairs can be used together.
Once I saw the Selfie with Doter of a Sarpanch of Haryana and I told all of them in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only in India but also in the entire world, such a big mission of selfie with dotor has started.
This is not just the issue of social media.
This has become an event that makes every girl a new self-confidence, a new pride.
A few days ago, I was interacting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
I told the people visiting outside that wherever you go, wherever you go to the topic of 'Atulaniya Bharat', there were lakhs of photographs.
It has come from every corner of India and in a way it is a big settlement for those who work in the tourism sector.
Because of this Mann Ki Baat, I have experienced how big a movement can be created.
Today, I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat that has started for three years, when many incidents of the last three years have touched my heart.
Every moment it is being considered to go to the right path of the country.
I want to do something or the other for the welfare of every citizen of the country, for the good things of the society, for the progress of the country.
I have learned and learned from the countrymen in my three-year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
I bow down to the countrymen with my heart.
I had once talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat and said that Khadi is not a cloth but a thought.
I once again urge you to continue the campaign of Khadi.
If you buy khadi then we should work with this feeling that the lamp of lamps will shine in the houses of the poor.
This work will give strength to the poor of our country and that is why we should do this.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase production capacity, how to handle solar energy
The idea of how the systems that have been closed for the past 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years are now being revived.
The Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri was closed for 26 years in Varanasi Sevapur in Uttar Pradesh but now it has been revived.
Several organisations have been connected to it.
Many people have been provided new employment opportunities.
Our training center, which was closed by Khadi and Village Industries at Pampore in Kashmir, has once again started and Kashmir has a lot to contribute to this region.
Now the resumption of this Training Centre will help in modernizing the new generation, inclusion of cloth marketing and new things, I am very happy to note that whenever they meet the big corporate houses, they have already started giving khadi things.
People have also started giving khadi goods while visiting each other.
Cleanliness will connect the people.
Your Honble President started this work and the entire country joined in the same way.
Everyone has become a part of this cleanliness drive today, be it adults, men, women, city or Khedegaon.
Whenever I say that the Swachhta Abhiyan is now moving forward towards a pledge, we are all looking at it.
Everybody acknowledges this movement, collaborates and contributes to realisation.
I am grateful to the Honble President.
But at the same time, every section of the country has considered it as its work.
It is a matter of happiness for me that in the first four days, more than 75 lakh people have joined the programmes and more than 40 thousand people have been working continuously.
One thing is that we should clean somewhere, the other thing is that we should not be aware of cleanliness but if we want to make cleanliness then there is also a need for a ideological movement.
On this occasion, there were many competitions with the campaign of Swachhta Hi Seva.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the essay competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children took pictures.
Use of your ideas, we have drawn pictures on the topic of cleanliness.
Many people have written poems and in these days, the pictures that I have sent by my child friends and young children are posted in social media.
I never forget to thank the people of the media whenever I come to the subject of cleanliness.
These people have taken this movement forward with a very good sense.
They are also leading this cleanliness movement in their own way.
We can see how big service can be made through electronic media and printed media in our country, in this movement of Swachhta Hi Seva.
Just a few days ago, some of me took care of the 18-year-old youth of Srinagar, Bilal Dar.
No, there is nothing like that.
Bilal Dar works for cleanliness for the last 5-6 years from the age of 12-13 years.
The biggest lake in Asia is near Srinagar, if there is plastic in this pond, polythene, if there are bottles used, waste, waste, waste, everything cleanses the pond.
Bilal Dar is younger than age but it has become an inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we should acknowledge that future history is born from the womb of history and whenever the subject of history comes out, it is very natural to remember the great men.
This month of October is a month to remember many of our great men.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on 11th October is the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on 25th September.
This is the birth centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
Who was a center of all these great men
Nanaji Deshmukh was immersed in the work of Gramodya, leaving the political life and when the centenary year is being celebrated today, it is very natural for him to feel respect for the work of his village.
When former President of India, Mr. Abdul Kalam ji was interacting with the youngsters, he always spoke about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
He used to mention the work of Nanaji, and he himself went to villages to see the work of Nanaji.
Like Mahatma Gandhi, Deendayal Upadhyay was talking about the last person in the society.
Sardar Saheb had brought the entire country together.
Now we should also run for unity and take forward the mantra of unity.
We are very simple, naturally saying that the specialty of unity in diversity is India.
We are proud of diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I would like to repeat to my countrymen of India, especially to my younger generation that we are in a conscious condition.
There is summer holidays, Diwali days, it is a testimony to go out somewhere in our country.
People go out as a tourist and it is very natural .
But sometimes it feels a matter of concern that our people do not see their country and do not understand the diversity of the country.
I don't have any opposition to you in the outside country but sometimes you should also see the places of our country.
If we look at the life of Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, then it is recalled that when all of them visited India, they had seen India and at the same time they had a new inspiration to live for this country and to offer their lives for this country.
All these great men had made India a comprehensive tour.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to understand and understand India.
The value addition in tourism will take place only when we do not go to Paramulukha as a child, go to a student and try to understand their lives.
In more than four and a half districts, I have got the opportunity to stay in the night. And today, whenever I take care of this big responsibility in India, I am feeling a great deal of confusion.
It doesn't take time.
I appeal to all of you that this vast India is not just a declaration of unity in diversity, but also a bond of our traditional power.
There are many types of food habits with us .
We keep eating new things everyday throughout our life but there are so many types that the first thing will not come again.
Now this is a great strength of our tourism.
I am confident that if you go out anywhere then you will move forward my first campaign.
You must send photographs on Hash Tag Incredible India.
If you meet the people there, then send their photographs.
I am thinking that in order to promote tourism in India, there can be seven best tourist destinations in our State and every Indian should be aware of those seven special places in our state.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can we give some information about these places
Can you make this information available on the Narendra Modi App
Can you give this information on Hashtag Incredible India
I would like to tell the government that if all the people of one state are giving such good information then I would like to introduce the information that has come from every state and prepare the preaching literature about the seven things that have come from every state.
This means how to encourage tourism places through the intentions of the people in a way .
The Government of India will work on it.
Come on, join me.
From the month of October to March, you can also become a major, important partner to promote tourism of the country.
I am inviting you for that.
My dear countrymen, as a man, many things touch my heart.
The waves rise in my mind.
Some things are absurd on my mind.
In the end, I am a man like you.
The Indian Army has received two heroes in the form of Lieutenant Swati and Fund.
It is an extraordinary reason that both Swati and Nidhi were also martyred to serve Mother India.
You can imagine that if the world grows in such a small age then how will the state of mind be
But when the martyrdom of Karnal Santosh Mahadik, his wife Swati Mahadik faced this difficult situation, he decided to stand in mind and he was admitted to the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and completed his life to fulfil the dreams of his husband.
Likewise, Nidhi Dubey, his husband, Mukesh Dubey, was working as a hero in the army and was martyred for the motherland.
His wife Nidhi decided that we should be recruited in the army and they fulfilled their determination.
It is natural for every countrymen to feel respect for their mother-in-law and their brave organs.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and the festival of Diwali has come a big opportunity for the youth of the country.
This year, the FIFA World Chamber Competition is being held in our country.
I am confident that all around you will have to hear the announcement of football.
The generation of every age will be interested in football.
It is not possible that our youngsters are not seen playing in the fields of schools and colleges in India.
Come on, let us also make sports a part of our life if the whole world is coming to play on the land of India.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
Mother Durga is the time of worship.
How the entire environment has been burdened with sacred aroma .
My dear countrymen, greetings.
On the other hand, when the whole country used to celebrate festivals, on the other hand, it is natural to worry about the country when violence comes from any part of India then it is a country of Buddha and Gandhi.
The country of Sardar Patel, who has laid down his life for the unity of the country.
Our ancestors have accepted public life values and non-violence with equal respect.
We have been listening to non-violence Paramo Dharma since childhood.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be used in the name of faith, whether it is a communal belief or a faith in political ideals, even if there is faith in the person, if there is faith in the tradition, there is no right to take into account the law in the name of faith.
I would like to assure the people of the country that those who take the law, those who suppress the path of violence, whether they are individuals or groups, this country will never bear it and no government will bear it.
Everyone has to bend in front of the law.
Because of thousands of years of cultural traditions, seeing cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events, perhaps there should not be a single day in 365 days that will live without sanana.
Now we must have seen that our festivals keep on following the nature cycle.
There is a direct relationship with nature .
Most of our festivals are connected to the farmers.
So first of all, I would like to call you the best Dukkadam.
Yesterday the festival of Sanvasari was celebrated in the Jain society.
In the Jain society, the festival of polluting is celebrated in the month of Bhadrama.
On the last day of the festival of Paryushan, it is the day of Sanvasari.
This is a unique tradition.
The day of conscience is a symbol of emotion, non-violence and friendship.
In a way it also goes to the forefront of Shaksha-Vani days and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other a luxury Dukkadam .
We have been listening to this discussion and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say that pardoning is the specialty of a strong man.
Shakespeare has written in his drama the significance of the Shakti Bhav in the Merchant of Venice, Marcy is the two blessings, the first blessed with the gifts and the empowerment of God, both of them get the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, today the Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated in every corner of the country with great joy.
It is natural to speak on the public Ganesh Festival when it comes to the subject of Ganesh Chaturthi.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi goes on for ten days.
This Mahasana is considered a symbol of unity, equality and goodness.
Greetings to all the nations on the occasion of Ganeshotswa.
Recently, Onam was celebrated in Kerala.
One of the various festivals of India, Onam is the main festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for our social and cultural significance.
Currently these festivals are seen the reason for the attraction of tourism .
I will tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or the Durga festival in Bengal has become the attraction of tourism in a way.
There is also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think about what we can do in that direction.
The festival of Eid-ul-Juha will be celebrated all over the country on the eve of these festivals.
Congratulations to all the countrymen on the occasion of Eid-ul-Juha.
Festivals are a symbol of faith and faith for us.
The festivals of our New India have to be a symbol of cleanliness.
In the family life, festivals are connected to cleanliness.
The preparation of the festival means cleanliness is not a new thing for us.
But it needs to be a social habit.
Cleanliness should be an unprecedented part of the festivals not only in the house but in the entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state and in our country.
My dear countrymen, the interpretation of modernization is changing.
A big campaign like Eco Friendly Ganapati has been set up.
If you look at YouTube then the daughter of every household is making Ganapati, the soil is being brought and made Ganapati.
Somebody is colouring the vegetables, somebody is screaming the paper.
Different types of experiments are being done in every family.
And it feels sorry that when you know new experiments.
When the Swachhta Abhiyan was launched three years ago, it will take three years on 2nd October.
Its positive results are visible.
The toilets have reached around 67 per cent from 39 per cent.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation.
A few days ago, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water of floods decreased then dirt spread everywhere.
At present, worker from Jamiaat Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned 22 temples and 3 mosques affected by Purana.
The sweat sweated, all the people came out.
Excellent examples of unity for cleanliness, inspiring examples to each other, all the workers of Jamiaat Ulema-e-Hind were given.
And if it becomes our permanent feeling, then our country can go somewhere.
My dear countrymen, I challenge all of you that once again, 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, the Swachhta Hi Seva was earlier saying, 'Jal Seva is the Prabhu Seva' and 'Swachhta Hi Seva'.
Make an environment of cleanliness throughout the country.
Whenever you get the opportunity, whenever you get the opportunity, you should find the opportunity.
But we all come together.
Come together on the day of holiday or Sunday and work together .
Go to the nearby settlements but work with a movement.
I urge all NGOs, schools, colleges, social, cultural political leaders, government officials, artists and Sarpanchs to create a clean environment for 15 days before the 2nd October Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
A department has been set up on Win, where you can write your name and the name of the family after the construction of toilets, which we have helped.
My friends of social media can run a few constructive drives and actually work on the land of the world.
This campaign is being organised by the Ministry of Swachhta Sankalp Competition, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in which essay competition, short film making competition, painting competition are being organized.
In this we can write essays in different languages and there is no age bonds.
You can make short films with your mobile phones.
You can make a 2-3-minute film that will inspire cleanliness.
It can be in any language.
I invite everyone to join this cleanliness drive.
Once again, I would like to say that this time on 2nd October, Gandhi Jayanti, Clean 2nd October, and that is why from 15th September, Swachhta Hi Seva should reach home.
Some steps have been taken for cleanliness.
Please be part of this by working yourself.
You see how Gandhi Jayanti will shine on 2nd October.
You can imagine that after the 15-day Swachhta Abhiyan, when you celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, then you will be happy to pay tributes to the true meaningful Bapu.
My dear countrymen, I specially want to accept my blessings today.
I express my heartfelt gratitude and not because you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for a long time. I would like to thank you for this. I would like to accept the blessings that through the Mann Ki Baat programme, lakhs of people are being connected in the country.
I have the opportunity to understand the feelings of the people of the country.
I look forward to your message as much as you look forward to Mann Ki Baat.
I am eager because I learn something from all your things.
I express my gratitude to you for your contribution.
We are connecting our mobile phones and we become a part of such wrong habits.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, speaks to Aparna from Pune.
I would like to tell you about my friendship that I always tried to help the people but I was tired of seeing a habit of it.
I once went to the shopping mall with her.
We do not pay any feelings at large, but we share with our hard workers, they are unbelievable.
Do you not think that there is always a relationship with the sellers, small shopkeepers, vegetables and those who sell goods near their homes, when we talk to those who are suffering, we feel goods with them.
Not only this, he says that he has reduced the amount of two to five rupees and we are the ones who have gone to eat in a big hotel or even the bill does not see the bill.
For this, the question of money is not worth Rs.
He is poor and hence he has doubted his honesty that you don't have any difference in your life for two or five rupees, but how much of your small habits would you ever think about him
I am grateful to you, Madam has given me a message by calling a phone that touches the heart.
I am confident that my countrymen will also leave such behavior with the poor.
My dear young friends, on August 29, the entire country is celebrating as National Sports Day.
This is the birthday of the great hockey sportsperson and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand Ji.
His contribution to Hockey is incomparable.
I would like to recall this thing for this thing that I feel that the new generation of our country should be connected to sports.
Sports should become a part of our life.
If we are the young countries of the world then the youth of our country should be seen in the field of sports.
Sports is physical well-being, intellectual readiness, emotional co-operation.
What do I think more than that
Sports is a way that connects the heart.
I would like to tell you that the sports sector is important than the sports stations in the age of computers.
Play FIFA on computer but show some activity on the outside ground.
The joy of playing cricket in the open fields is different from the computer cricket.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out and you used to think that you would never come home.
Today the situation is such that when the children come home and see games or cartoon films on the mobile while sitting in the corners then the mother has to think that you will ever go out.
It was a time when you used to say the mother's child that this time has come for you to come that when will you get out of the child
Our youngsters are happy to note that FIFA World Cup is being organised in 17 years from 6-28 October.
Today, when I used to talk about sports, the event that took place in the last week, which I would like to tell the citizens.
I got the opportunity to meet girls of a young age and some of them were born in the Himalayas.
Sometimes 30-30 days spent in water, these six daughters will be the first incident in the world in the waves of the sea.
Who will be an Indian who will not be proud of such girls
I salute the courage of these girls and I wish them that they should share this experience to all the countrymen.
I will also provide a different place for the absence of Narendra Modi App.
Because you must read their experiences because it is a brave story of one kind, a story of adventure and I will be happy to tell you about these girls and my best wishes to these girls.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September, we all celebrate Teachers Day.
The birth anniversary of the former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President, but he was presenting himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
It is an important feature of the teacher to enjoy creative emotions and knowledge in our students.
Whenever we celebrate Teachers Day, can we make a resolve together
I will show the way to prove that every five years should be tied with a solemn pledge and we will be happy to enjoy life by enjoying a resolution.
There is such an incident in the life of every teacher that his efforts would have changed the life of someone.
If we make collective efforts then we can play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
I live in Mumbai for the Indian Research Centre of Harvard University.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is a matter of discussions not only of India but also of the pundits of the economic world.
This scheme was launched on 28th August, 2014 with a dream in the mind.
Tomorrow, this scheme is being completed for three years.
30 crore new families have been connected and bank accounts have been removed.
Today I am happy that the poor people of the society have been made a part of the economy of the country.
Now there has been an atmosphere of restraint.
He feels that the money will be used for the children.
Some good work can be done in this period.
Moreover, if the poor look at the RuPay card in their own fields then he feels like Shreemanta, this is a credit card in his field, I have a RuPay card.
He feels a respected experience.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Rs. 65,000 crore has been deposited in the bank.
This is their strength in those days and the insurance of the accounts that have been opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has also been brought down.
The Prime Minister's Life Jyoti Bima Yojana is one rupee, thirty rupees, this maternal secrecy has led to great confidence among the poor today.
If there is something on the main basis of the family due to the insurance of one rupee in many families then his family will get Rs 2 lakhs.
Today, it is not so much time that I will tell the people of the bank to upload my Gov.
My dear countrymen, again you have a good wish.
Thank you very much.
The mind of man is such that he feels very charming during the rainy season .
Animals, birds, trees, nature all get enjoyed by the arrival of rains.
However, this rain sometimes takes a virtual form and then it feels that there is a great strength to bring destruction in water.
Nature gives us life, nurtures us, but sometimes it is a terrible destruction that appears in natural calamities like floods and earthquakes.
Whatever changes are being made in the changing weather and environment, there is also a huge negative impact.
In the last few days, some parts of India, especially in Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal, are facing natural calamities due to heavy falls.
Flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Be it the soldiers of the Army, the people of the Air Force, the people of the NDRF, the NDRF, the Nuclear Forces, all of them bow down to the service of the disaster victims during this period.
Farming, waste, infrastructure, roads, electrification, connectivity are all affected by it.
People are also telling their problems.
Gradually, all of us can create a timeline for our work as per the estimation of weather so that possible losses can be avoided.
When I prepare Mann Ki Baat, I see the citizens of the country preparing it more than me.
On this occasion, I have received a lot of letters on the topic of GST, a lot of phone calls have been received and still people are expressing happiness over GST and also expressing satisfaction.
I also hear a phone call from it: Namaskar, Prime Minister ji, I speak from Gurgaon to Neetu Garg.
I heard the address of your Chartered Accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, GST started on the same date of last month in our country.
What can we say about the decisions that the government had expected and the results are being received after a month or not
I want to hear your thoughts about this.
The GST has been implemented for about a month and its benefits have also been seen.
I am glad that when a poor person writes a letter to me about how GST has reduced the prices of essential goods for the poor, how they have become cheaper.
In the remote mountains of Ishaanya, a person living in the jungles used to write about the same thing as he learns about it.
All these facilities are not only available but they are also getting support for economic pace.
The speed at which this transformation has been simplified, the speed at which it has been transformed, it has created an environment of faith in the entire country.
Economists in the field of economies, scholars in the field of management, learned research in the field of technology, will emerge as an ideal ecosystem of Indias use of GST.
For many universities in the world, this will be an example of a study, a hair-style.
Because there has been such a huge change in such a large scale and it is a big jump of success to implement this tax in such a large country with the participation of such millions of people.
All the decisions have been taken by the States and the Centre in collaboration with consensus.
Consequently, every government has preferred that GST does not have any slight burden on the cost of food grains of the poor.
You are well aware of what was the price of a goods before GST, what would be the cost of a new situation, all the information is available on the GST app on mobile.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries, all the departments, central and state government workers for this work.
GST is an excellent example of the victory of Indias collective powers.
This is a new historic victory.
And this is not just a tax reform but a new authentic culture.
In a way, there is a mission for social reform.
Once again I salute millions of Indians for their simplicity and ease of doing so.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
In a way, in the month of August, there have been several such incidents that are associated with the history of freedom.
This year we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But very few people will be aware of the fact that Dr.
Yusuf Meher Ali had given it.
We must know what happened on 9th August, 1942.
What can be a greater inspiration than this
The uit India Movement was an important struggle in the Indian freedom struggle.
This movement had prepared the entire country to take a pledge to get rid of the British rule.
This was the time when the Indian masses against the rule of the British, every corner of India, every corner of the country, whether the villages, the cities, the cities, the educated, the poor, the Smt.
Reflecting the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were bowing their lives in the struggle with the mantra of 'Karo Ya Maro'.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their education.
The great men like Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan had played a key role.
Two different forms of Gandhiji are seen in both the events of 'Aadhakar movement' and 'India Leave India movement' - 1920 and 1942.
The form of 'Aadhakar Movement' was different and such a situation took place in 42 years, the intensity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karo Yea Dear'.
It was a peoples support behind all these successes, it was a peoples strength, a peoples resolve and a mass struggle.
The whole country was fighting together.
Sometimes I feel that if I look at the leaves of history slightly then India's first freedom struggle was established in 1857.
This freedom struggle, which started from 1857, was initiated every minute of the country by 1942.
This long-term period awakened the spirit of freedom in the minds of the people of the country.
Everyone was committed to something or the other in that direction.
Generations have changed, but the resolution has not been moved.
The country was making every effort to liberate the rule of the British.
This was decisive for five years.
Now I want to connect you with this mathematics.
In 1947, we became independent.
Today, the year 2017 is going on.
This incident took about 70 years.
During the period, the governments will come.
The system has been made, changed, deaf and increased.
Everybody tried to free the country from problems.
Efforts have been made to ensure that there is a need for development in the country so that there is a need to overcome poverty.
There was also a lot of hard work in their own way.
The success was also achieved.
He also highlighted the expectations.
Like 1942 to 1947, it was five years of resolve.
Similarly, I see that the five-year period of the journey to achieve this pledge from 2017 to 2022 is now in front of you.
We should celebrate this 15th August 2017 as a resolution festival and when we complete 75 years of Independence in 2022.
Today, the announcement of 'Karenge Marenge' is not to be made but to connect with this resolve of a New India.
We have to live and fight this resolution.
This year, in the month of August 9, I will run a great campaign from Sankalp to its achievements.
Every Indian, social organisations, local systems, schools, colleges, different organisations - everybody should make a new pledge for New India.
A solemn pledge that we can prove in the next five years.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
We will be a part of this pledge festival and today we are not there anywhere else online.
Therefore, I invite my young friends, especially in the online world, to come forward to contribute in their innovative ways in the creation of a New India.
Use of technology, bring all things like video, post, blogs, articles, new concepts.
Let this campaign become a mass movement.
uit India uiz will also be started for young friends on Narendra Modi App.
This question on uit India is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history of the country and to the heroes of freedom.
I believe that you will propagate and propagate it at a wide range.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister of the country on 15th August, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort.
I am just the following.
Definitely send your views on MyGov or on Narendra ModiApp.
I read it myself and I will try to make this idea in the time I get on 15th August.
In the last three years, I have heard a complaint about my 15th August speech that my speech is far away.
I will complete it in more than 40-45-50 minutes.
There is a socio-economic in Indias economy.
And that economist never goes down.
Our festivals are not merely a matter of joy and joy.
Our festivals are also the medium of social reform.
But at the same time, each of our festivals have a direct relationship with the economic life of the poor of the poor.
In a few days, Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, then Ganeshotsav, then fourth Chandra, then Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Diwali are coming from one side and this is the time when the poor get the opportunity to connect their meanings.
And in these festivals a natural joy is also mixed.
And if you want to say about the economy then hundreds of families start making surveillance through small household industries several months before the festival of Raksha.
From Khadi to silk dragons, how many types of dragons are formed and nowadays people are giving more preference to homemades and household guards.
Business of thousands and hundreds of people is connected to the festival of Raksha Manufacturers, Raksha Manufacturers, Sweets.
It is directly related to that poor family that makes small lamps of soil.
But today, while talking about the economy of the poor people associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to issue the issue of environment.
And they have urged me to talk about the eco-friendly Ganesh Murthy in the context of Ganeshotswa, so that people will be able to choose the idol of soil from now on.
First of all, I am grateful to these aware citizens.
He urged me to issue this topic beforehand.
This year's public Ganesh festival has a special significance.
And I am sure that when I tell you this thing a long time ago, you will be connected to this resolution.
And this will provide employment to the poor artisans and poor artists who have made this statue.
Let us all strive to connect our festivals to the poor, to the economy of the poor, to enjoy our festivals as a festival of economic benefits of the poor, to get them from the festivals of economic enjoyment.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the festivals and festivals.
Our countrymen are proud of these daughters.
Just a few days ago, our girls showcased their sports at the Women's Cricket World Championship.
I got the opportunity to meet all those sportspersons this week.
I felt very good by talking to him, but I realized that there was a lot of admiration in his mind that he did not win the world.
This dragon was seen on his face, his tension was seen.
I told them a different analysis.
I said, "Look, now there is a time of fame media that it is expected to increase.
It is so much increased that when success is not achieved then the same aspirations change into vision.
We have seen a lot of games in which if the sportsperson of India is unsuccessful then the anger of the country is expressed on those sportspersons.
Some people leave their limits and say such things that are very painful.
But this was the first time that even though our daughters did not win the World Head, 125 crore people of the country took the burden of defeat on their shoulders.
In fact, the younger generation of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to brighten the name of the country.
Once again I congratulate the younger generation of the country, especially our daughters.
Every countryman should make a pledge and every countryman should take a pledge to prove that resolve in the next five years.
Come on, let us come together and move forward, let us do something or something.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Weather is changing.
This year the summer was also very strong.
However, the monsoon rains have fallen on time and the next move is going on smoothly.
There is a pleasant environment due to heavy rains in many parts of the country.
After the rains, there has been relief from the sunshine carpet in the last few days due to heavy rains.
And we all have seen that the arrival of monsoons will change our mindset.
The Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated in many parts of the country with great reverence and enthusiasm.
Now in some parts of the world, the festival of Lord Jagannath's Rath Yatra is celebrated.
The poor people of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath ji.
Those people who do Dr .
Babasaheb Ambedkar has been taught, he must have seen that he would appreciate the temples and traditions of Lord Jagannath, because it contains social justice and social harmony.
The Holy Month of Ramadan was celebrated with a holy reverence.
Now there is a festival of Eid.
My best wishes to all of you on the eve of Eid-ul-Fitrah.
The month of Ramadan is to donate Punya.
It is a month of joy and joy as much as you can enjoy.
Let us all come together and take the country forward by taking inspiration from these sacred festivals.
In this sacred month of Ramzan, a very inspired incident of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
The families of our nearly three and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in those small villages, in the same way the population of the brothers and sisters of our Muslim families is more.
During this time of Ramadan, the villagers have decided to build toilets together.
The government also provides assistance for this individual toilet and Rs. 17 lakhs were given under this assistance.
You spend this 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for converting this sacred day into an opportunity for the welfare of the society.
Their one thing is also very inspiring.
And most importantly, they have made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
You know that three states of Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana will also be declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration of these five states, the government and the people for fulfilling this work.
Then wherever the body and the body of the mind falls.
This is the subject of cleanliness.
These bad habits have become a part of our nature.
They have become part of our habits.
We have to make regular efforts to get rid of this.
Everyone will have to take care of it.
You will have to recall the best inspirational events.
And I am happy that now cleanliness has not been a government programme.
It is becoming a movement of the common man of the society.
And if the people sitting in the government also take this task forward from the peoples participation then its strength increases manifold.
Recently, an excellent incident came to me, which I would definitely like to tell you.
This incident is in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration of the country has taken a big deal of work in public participation.
A 100-hour tireless campaign.
And what is the goal
Construction of toilets in 10,000 households in 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that the people and the administration have successfully completed the work of constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages were defecated.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of the government, government officials and the citizens of that village in Vijayanagaram district.
The awakening of Prakash Tripathi's democracy is commendable.
And democracy is not a system but it is also a culture.
The consciousness of the inner mind is the price of freedom.
Regular awakening towards democracy is essential and hence we used to remember the democracies and move forward towards the good things of democracy.
It was the time of 1975-25 June that no democracies can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was transformed into tricks.
The opponent was pressed.
The dignitaries of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were suppressed.
The judiciary was unable to escape from that terrible shadow of the crisis.
The newspapers were being made completely unemployed.
Today, the students of the world and the people working in democracy are constantly making efforts to enhance the awareness of democracy by repeating the black period.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in a hurricane.
Atal ji had written a poem when he had completed one year. He had described his mindset in his poem.
My dear countrymen, the value of every Indian has raised pride in the world today.
21st June, 2017- The entire world is becoming Yoga sufficient.
From sea to mountains people welcomed the sun rays in the morning and morning through yoga.
There will be no Indian who will not be proud of it.
It is not that earlier there was no yoga practice but today, when Yoga has been built in the form of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for the connectivity of the world.
Most of the countries of the world have made this opportunity for Yoga.
The Great Wall of China in China, while people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level at Machu-Picchu global heritage site in Peru.
People practiced Yoga in the shadow of the IFFEL Tower in France.
In Afghanistan, in Herat, India gave a different dimension to Indias friendship by practicing Yoga on the Afghan Maitri Dam i. e. Salma Dam.
The Yoga Category was organised with Yoga Masters at the UN Headquarters.
In Ahmedabad in Gujarat, about 55 thousand people were simultaneously registering a new world record by doing yogasanas.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga Programme in Lucknow.
And for the first time, I was fortunate to do yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers used Yoga in Siachen where there was a temperature of 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Be it our armed forces, be it Border Security Force, be it ITBP, be it CRPF, everyone has made Yogasanas its share with their work.
On this Day of Yoga, I have said that three generations, because this is the third International Day of Yoga, so I am saying that the three generations of the family should send me photographs of Yoga together.
Some television channels also took this issue.
I have received several photographs related to this, some of them have been collected on the Narendra Modi App.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit my favorite programme.
The last few years in Kerala, P.
N.
A good programme is organised by Panikar Convocation, and people are observed to read books, reading month is celebrated to be awakened to read the books.
I recall the thing that I had settled in my meditation.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had made a tradition in the government that if we do not want to pay floral tribute then we should give a book or welcome to him.
It is also the handling of Khadi so that Khadi will be encouraged.
Whenever I was in Gujarat, all of us had become a habit but after coming here I had a habit.
But he went to Kerala and once again the habit was awakened.
And now I have started informing the people below the government again.
We can also make nature gradually.
The lives of flowers were very low.
Once he took it in his hand and then he keeps it.
But if you give a book then you would have become a part of the house and become a part of the family.
When I am telling this thing, how historical values were these things.
Last year when I went to England, the queen of Britain Elizabeth in London invited me for food.
How many years have Lotali, but ueen Elizabeth has taken care of the role given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I went, I was delighted to show me.
And when I was looking at him, he was asking him to touch him and look at him.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life and became part of his history.
I am sure that these habits do not change routinely, and whenever they say this, the vaccine has to be wealthy.
However, we have to say such things, we have to make efforts.
I cannot say wherever I have visited and whoever visits me, I will not let it go.
My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are many kinds of works.
I have been engaged in files but I have developed a habit for me that some of the letters I read everyday and this gives me the opportunity to join the common man.
Various types of letters are written, Various types of men are written.
Recently, I will be able to read a letter and I think I must tell you about that.
Arulmozhi Sarvanan, a resident of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, afar off South India, sent me a letter.
And what was the letter, he was writing that he thought of taking some economic initiatives in his family, keeping in mind the education of children etc. so that the family would get some financial assistance.
I took money from the banks under the Mudra Yojana and started working towards bringing some goods from the market and supplying them.
Some people asked, I have registered it myself, I would like to tell the people of the country that you should also get the opportunity to get this opportunity.
There is a new kind of arrangement to visit GEM.
Those who want to supply goods to the government, want to sell brooms, want to sell a dog, want to send a table, they can register their name on it.
Those people who register under EEGM, they see all the departments of the government.
Many things get cheap due to lack of agents .
This Arulamozhi Madmani has registered the things that can be supplied on this website of the Government.
And the letters he wrote to me are very interesting.
He has written that if he got money under the Mudra Yojana, his business started, what can I supply on E-GEM and I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office.
It was a new news for me that what would be the demand of the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
If Arunmozhi did not write letters to me, I would have often noticed that the e-GEM system is working far and wide, its goods can be purchased from the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country.
It has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
Government e-Bajarpeth-GEM
I want anyone who wants to sell his goods to the government in such a way that he should connect himself with it.
I believe that Minimum Government and Maximum Governance are the best examples and what is the goal of this - Minimum Price and Maximum Ease, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other, we can also take pride in the success of space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground for yoga, then our dreams are also to cross the horizons of the sky.
A few days ago, India has done a lot in the field of sports and science.
Today, India is not only on earth but also in space.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Small Satellites, including satellites at Cartosaat-2 Malica.
And these satellites included satellites from about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, USA, besides India.
And Indias Small Satellite Expedition will help in the field of agriculture and in terms of natural disasters.
A few days ago, this thing will be remembered by all of you, ISRO has successfully launched the GSAT-19.
And the satellites that India has launched so far were the most weighty satellites.
And the newspapers of our country had compared it to the weight of the elephant.
So you can imagine how many of our scientists have done in the space sector.
On June 19 the Mangal campaign was completed 1 thousand days .
You all know that when you succeeded in achieving the Mangal Mission, this entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
Photos are being sent, information is being provided, scientific information is being received and it is working for more time than a specified life.
On completion of one thousand days, it is important for our space travel to our scientific journey.
At present, we are also looking at the field of sports that our youngsters are enhancing their performance.
Indias Bedmintonist Kidambi Srikanth won the Indonesia Open Competition and enhanced the pride of the country.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him and his trainees for this victory.
A few days ago, P.
T.
Usha's Usha School of Athletics inaugurated the Synthetic Track.
As much as you encourage sports, you will also be able to sports.
Sports plays an important role in personality development.
Inclusive personality development, sports is important.
There is no shortage of talented sportspersons in the country.
If the children of your family are interested in sports then they have to give opportunity.
They should not be encouraged by lifting them out of the field and shutting them in the room .
They should also study and show shining performance in it, but if they are interested in sports, then they should encourage and encourage the school, colleges, family and surrounding people.
Everyone has to dream for the next Olympics.
It is difficult to forget the summer of this year.
However, it was awaited for the rains.
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the accomplishment of the holy month of Ramadan, I convey my best wishes to the people of India and the world, especially to the Muslim community.
In Ramzan prayer , spirituality and Dandharam are given a lot of importance .
We are very fortunate to have made such traditions by our ancestors and today India can pride this thing, we can pride the 125 crore countrymen that all communities of the world are in India.
This is a country where people who believe in God are also people who deny God.
There are also people who worship the idol and are also people who oppose the idol worship.
Every kind of ideals, every kind of worshipping system, every kind of tradition is here and we have imbibed the art of living with each other.
And finally, be it religion, sect or tradition, all these things give us the same message of peace, unity and harmony.
This sacred month of Ramzan will definitely help in bringing forward this path of peace, unity and goodwill.
I once again convey my best wishes to all.
I am very happy to say that many people gave me a response to this.
Everyone showed me the zeal of telling me about your mind in a personal way.
I have not read every thing, everybody's message has not been heard, so many things have come.
But if you look at these messages then some people are trying to learn music, some people try to put their hands on new words, some people are trying to learn new things by using Youtube.
Some people are learning Pakkala, some are learning dances, some are dramatic learning.
Some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
Some people are trying to understand the nature and live with nature.
I am very happy to note that I would like to hear you a phone call.
"I speak Diksha Katiyal.
When I had to read about the freedom struggle, I felt that how many struggles India had to fight for freedom, how many freedom fighters had to sacrifice.
I was very inspired by those who have achieved a lot in a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some message to the new generation about this.
I am glad that the younger generation is interested in learning about our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men spent their telephones for freedom, many youngsters climbed on the edge of Fashi.
And that is why today we are breathing in independent India.
You must have seen one thing that in the freedom movement, those great men who have worked for writing and study in the throat of the times, and their writings also strengthened the freedom of India.
I had visited Andaman Nicobar several years ago.
The cellular jail was also visited there.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote the book 'My birth anniversary' in Turunga.
He used to write poems, write on walls.
They were shut down in a small place.
How should those who have taken the presumption of freedom be resolved
When I read the book 'My birth anniversary' of Savarkar, I got inspired to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a sound lighting program which is very inspiring.
There is no such state in India, there is no linguistic gathering in India that no one of them has been educated for the freedom of black money in the clutches of Andaman and that cellular clutches.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - One Must Care Aboot a world one will not see.
It is our duty to worry about the world that we cannot see.
If you are very strong then open the windows of the room, open the door, breathe in the fresh air.
When contact with the five mahabhavs that have been formed by the five mahabhavs, there was a new consciousness in our body, a new energy appears.
You all have experienced this, but we never take care of it, we don't build it in a chain or in a chain.
You must see that when you are in touch with our natural situation, there will be a new consciousness within you.
And that is why the global mission to connect with the nature of 5th June is to become our own mission.
We are getting some benefits from our ancestors protecting the environment.
Now if we protect the environment then the future generation will benefit from it.
And if the orthodox sees one economy then it is the biggest guidance book of the environment and it was written thousands of years ago.
It was said to us that Mother Bhumi: Son Aham Prithivya.
In Vedas, it is said that the purity that is in us is due to the earth.
The earth is our mother and we are her son.
If we recall Lord Buddha, one thing is definitely visible that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the birth of his knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana had occurred under the tree.
But in modern words, it needs to be pursued with modern techniques.
Through Yoga, we have connected the world into a synonym.
The way Yoga connects the body, the mind, the intellect and the soul, it is bringing together today.
Today's lifestyle is making it difficult to live a life free of stress due to drive and increasing responsibilities.
This stressful state of mind has been seen since the age of a very young age.
Yoga has an important role in leading a stress-free life during this period.
Yoga is a way of ensuring health and strength.
Yoga is not just a exercise.
If you want to experience an interval with the health of the body and mind and thoughts, then it is possible through yoga.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders around the world.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to Yoga and some bakshas.
Gradually, the work will move forward in that direction.
I have come to know about this valuable imagination.
There is a lot of psychological information.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga this year, and on this occasion, you should urge the three generations of the family to do yoga together.
Azi-Azoba, mother-in-law, daughter-in-law should do yogasanas and upload their photographs together.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be such a beautiful mixture that will give Yoga a new aspect.
I am grateful for this idea and I also feel that the way we had launched the Selfie WithDaghter campaign and had got a very interesting experience, the pictures of the three generations of Yoga will be appreciated in the country and in the world.
You must send a collective picture of those three generations, where three generations are doing yoga, on Narendra Modi App, MyGov.
Yesterday, there will be a picture of today and tomorrow, which will assure the golden future.
I am inviting you.
The International Day of Yoga is still a three-week space.
In a way this is the movement of immunity health care .
I invite you all to participate in this.
When you all gave me the responsibility of your chief servant, when I had the opportunity to speak from the Red Fort on the first 15th of my tenure, I had spoken about cleanliness.
Since then, I have been reminded of my journey from different parts of India and what Modi is doing, where Modi is going and what Modi has done.
This is the reason why I had a very careful telephone and I would have thought about what they said.
But I am grateful to him for taking care of this thing.
You also hear this telephone.
Namaskar Modi ji, I am speaking Naina from Mumbai.
On Modi ji TV and social media, I always see that there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness wherever you go.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, as per your request, people have collectively taken cleanliness as a mission.
Big people are not only involved in this but also awareness about cleanliness has come in children.
Small children are often seen preventing elderly people from dirty roads.
The Swachhta Abhiyan that you started from the valleys of Kashi has taken the form of a movement with your inspiration.
You are true to say that wherever I go, wherever I go, the government system works for cleanliness, but recently it is seen to celebrate the festival of cleanliness in the society.
Five days before I reached there, seven days ago, a large number of sanitation programmes were taken up ten days ago.
Just a few days ago, I had visited Kutch in Gujarat.
There is a huge cleanliness drive.
But I did not know the relationship between these two things.
But after coming to this phone, I thought that it was true.
You can imagine how much pleasure I could have been remembered and the country is also looking at these things in a very bitter manner.
What else would be a matter of joy than this that cleanliness is connected to my visit
There is a habit of preparing the rest for the Prime Ministers reception but cleanliness has become an important thing in it.
It is a pleasant and inspiring thing for anyone who loves cleanliness.
Imagine it is very good but I have to think about it.
However, it is true that this movement should stand up and instead of paying a visit to memories, it is a good thing to get an unprecedented ton of garbage visited from the Swachhta Mission.
How big humanity will work.
Once we started to consider this waste as a wealth that many new methods of waste management will come to us.
Youth connected with start-ups will also take new schemes and bring new means.
The Government of India has decided to open a major drive for waste management with the help of the State Governments and the people of the cities.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, about 4,000 cities will be able to collect dense waste and liquid waste.
Two types of garbage will be provided, one of them is green and the other is blue.
Two types of wastes are produced - one wet waste and the other dry waste.
These waste wastes will be kept in four thousand cities and wet wastes should be kept in the dry waste blue waste and wet waste in green waste.
For instance, the garbage that comes out of the kitchen, the vegetables, the vegetables, the cucumber of the eggs, the drainage of the eggs, it is all wet waste and it should be put in green waste.
Other types of wastes include trash paper, lice, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, polythene, broken dung, rubber, metal etc.
I am sure that we should develop such a culture and we will always have to take new steps towards cleanliness and we will be able to fulfil the dream of the cleanliness that Gandhiji had seen.
Today, I am proud to mention one thing that even if a person determines his mind, he can create a mass movement.
Cleanliness is such a thing.
Citizens suffered about 80-90 weeks and changed the Versova seashore and thousands of tonnes of wastes were sold and then Versova seashore became clean and beautiful today.
Versova Residency Volunteer (VRV) had taken the entire responsibility of this work.
Brothers and sisters, I am told that under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Riyasi Block part of Jammu and Kashmir has become free of money.
I congratulate all the citizens of Riyasi Block, the administrators there and Jammu and Kashmir for giving an excellent example.
And I have also been told that the leading people of this entire movement were women living in that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He took a torch for awareness and inspired the people from the households and streets.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to those mothers and sisters, I congratulate the administrators of that place who have started making a block free of sugar.
My dear countrymen, from the newspapers, from TV Channels, from the social media, the present government's 3-year performance has been audited.
I see this process as a very positive sign.
This period of three years has been tested on every legislation.
The people of every group of society have analyzed it.
I believe that there are some errors that have been registered, somewhere have been supported, somewhere have been commended.
I am also grateful to those who have given vaccinational and important reactions.
If there is light on errors and deficiencies then it gets an opportunity to improve it.
This migration is very important for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and a good website has an impact on me as it will be on the minds of any common man.
It seems as if I am sitting in the house and sitting in the family and interesting in the things of the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have written this thing to me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, if you meet again then every corner of the country has been rained, the weather has changed, the results of the tests have come, the new students will start their life and the advent of the rain will come along with the advent of a new joy, new fragrance.
Let us all go ahead with love for nature in such a environment.
My best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Like a seeker, the contribution of the people who have been involved in the society, on the other hand, the government should not be able to look at it.
Every time the information that comes to Mann Ki Baat is a comprehensive analysis of the government.
What kind of information is there, what are the complaints, what are the experiences of the people
Normally it has been found that the nature of man is to give advice to others.
If there is cough in the railways , buses , someone will come and say that do this .
It is like giving advice, giving information, it is in our nature.
They are the people who give most of the information, they are those people who try to reach me, who actually do something or the other in their lives.
They are trying to ensure that something is better, they are trying according to their intellect, power, power and conditions and when I remember it, I felt that this is not a common information.
Some people also get information because they feel that if they hear the ideas wherever they are working then they can benefit many people if they get a comprehensive form.
And that is why they have a natural desire to mention it in Mann Ki Baat and all these things are very positive for me.
First of all, I express my gratitude to the people who have done something or the other for the society.
Not only this, whenever I mention something, it is very pleasant to remember something like this.
Last time, some people had informed me about Mann Ki Baat, food was being used and I had mentioned it.
And after that, many people from across the country used innovative imaginations to avoid food that is being used on Narendra Modi App and on May Gov.
I have never thought of it, today it has been working in our country, especially the younger generation for many years.
We have heard that some social institutions have been doing this for the past few years but I later understood that the youth of my country are participating in this work.
Many have sent me a video.
There are several places where the banking of poultry is going on.
In these poultry banks, people deposit their poultry, vegetables and take the needy from there.
The person who gives satisfaction, does not feel humiliated.
This is an example of how work is done in collaboration with the society.
Today is the end of the month of April.
States of Gujarat and Maharashtra will be on 1st May.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
The two States have strived to enhance the innovative summits of development.
We have contributed to the progress of the country and in both the states their lives keep inspiring us in the integral gardens of the great men and in every field of society and in reminding them of the establishment of the state, on the occasion of 2022, 75 years of independence, we should resolve to take our state, our country, our society, our city, our family.
We have to plan to take that pledge and move forward with the participation of all the citizens.
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports.
The summer in May-June in our country has been driven to experience this year in March-April.
And when I was taking the information of the people on Mann Ki Baat, people have informed about what should be done in the days of summer.
S.
Various friends like Kartik have expressed concern over birds.
He said that water should be kept in Varanda, Gatchi and I have seen that small children of the family like this.
Once they came to know why they used to feed the water 10 times a day and see if the utensils that have been kept in it have water or not and see whether the birds have come or not.
We feel that this game is going on, but in fact, it is a unique experience of awakening this feeling in the minds of small children.
You can also see that a little bit of animals and birds make a feeling of new joy.
A few days ago, Mr. Jagat Bhai has sent a book from Gujarat, Save the Sparrows and the number of skins that they are decreasing in it, but they have made a lot of descriptions in this book.
However, in our country, animals and birds, nature have been coloured with them in colour, but it is necessary that these efforts should be strengthened collectively.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Dharmaguru Syedna Saheb of Daudi Bohra Samaj had completed 100 years.
He lived 103 years.
And on his 100th anniversary, the Bohra community had launched a very big campaign to save the spectacles through Burhani prestige.
I had the opportunity to start it.
He had distributed about 52,000 Bird Feeders to the corners of the world.
He has got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, we are so busy, we are so busy, we are so busy, we are giving milk, vegetables, postmans, we forget that there are days of summer, if they want water.
Friends, Young friends, I am also supposed to have some gaps with you.
Sometimes I feel careful that many of our younger generations are enjoying a comfortable life.
Mother-in-laws are also combining them in a rescue situation.
Some others are also from the other side but most of the comfortable conditions are visible.
Now the tests have been completed and the schemes for enjoyment of holidays have been made.
Despite summer holidays, heat, it feels very good.
But I have to say something about how to get rid of you as a friend.
I am sure some people will definitely use and tell me.
If you use these vacations, if you make three proposals, then it is a good thing, but try to do something out of three.
New space, new experience, new skills.
Sometimes seeing something on TV or reading in a book or listening to acquaintances and feeling that thing itself , there is a difference of land and spirituality in both .
The experiment should be positive, comfortable and comfortable.
We are from the middle class families and are from the happy families.
Sometimes feel that I don't say that again, do it once.
Tadddan should go to the poor town with the time of evening, taking a football, taking a volleyball or taking any sports literature.
You will be able to play with those poor children, you will be able to see that the joy of sports has never been found before.
Whenever you get the opportunity to play with you, you have ever thought about the change in their lives.
And I am sure that once you go, you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many voluntary institutions are working serving.
Sometimes there are very hot camps .
Personality is of development, there are many kinds of development and can participate in it.
But at the same time, you feel that you have done this kind of summer, have done a course of personality development and you have reached the people of the society who have not got such a chance and should teach those who have learned.
You can teach them how to do.
I am also concerned about the fact that technology has come down to reduce the gap and to end the technological boundaries.
Every technologies have been busy on the other side.
Today the competition is the era.
Friends, The dream of becoming a lot of things in life is a good thing and the idea of doing something is a good thing and it should also be done.
But also see that the human element that is inside us does not shrink anywhere or we do not go away from human qualities.
Whether these aspects can be focused on skill development.
Trying to spend time with yourself, away from technology.
Whether it is a word of music, 5-50 in a new language, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati or Marathi or Punjabi.
If we see how many varieties, we can get some learners around us.
If you are not swimming then learn swimming, draw pictures, there is no good picture but try to put something on paper.
You will have to express the feelings that are inside you.
Sometimes we used to learn the small things that we say - whether we want or not.
You can see all these new experiments, this skill is such that you will also be happy and you will get out of what life has been built in a framework.
Do something outside Chakori, my friends.
This is the opportunity to make life.
And you are thinking that if all the tests are over, if they are learning on a new turn of carcass then it will not be a chance.
So, I tell you that if you are a pride of learning a magic, then learn the magic of the wives.
Keep showing magic to your friends and friends.
You will definitely benefit from this thing that you don't know.
The human power inside you will get consciousness and there will be a very good opportunity for development.
I say with my experience that we cannot imagine what we learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new towns, new villages, new complexes.
After going to one place, he stayed for three days and four days.
Then go to the other place and stay there for three days and four days.
You will be able to learn a lot from this.
Whenever you go, you must send me photographs there.
Have you seen new
Where are you going
You can share your experience using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a lot of opportunity.
New generations are almost free from cash transactions.
You can also earn from this scheme - you have thought about it.
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
If you are using Bhima App, which you are downloading, you are also using.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your accounts.
If you get 20 people in a day then you can earn 200 rupees till evening .
There can be earnings for traders as well as earnings for students.
And this scheme is up to 14th October.
You will contribute to the creation of Digital India.
He was a symbol of VIP culture in a way, but the experience showed that the red lamp was on the vehicle, it was on the car, but it was slowly dragged into the head and the VIP culture was deepened in the mind.
Now only the red light has gone, so no one can claim that the red lamp that has dragged in the head will have come out.
I have received a very interesting telephone.
He has also expressed his fault in this telephone but at this time it is estimated that the common man does not like this thing.
He feels a kind of impairedness in it.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I speak Shiva Chaube, from Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh.
I was very proud to hear the everry India is a VIP on a road, and it was also happy that today my time is equally important.
I don't want to be stuck in the traffic and I don't want to stay for anybody.
Therefore, I would like to thank you all for this decision.
Going to Red Divas through government decisions is a part of the system.
But we also have to remove it from our minds.
If all of us try to make awakening efforts together then it can be removed.
The idea of New India is to increase the importance of EPI instead of VIP in the country and when I call EPI in place of VIP, my feeling is clear - Everi Person Is Important.
Every individual has the importance, every individual has the importance.
If we accept the significance of 125 crore countrymen, if we accept the wealth of 125 crore countrymen then how big power will be united to fulfill the great dreams.
We all have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that we should recall history, our culture, our tradition.
It gives us energy, inspiration.
This year, we are celebrating one thousandth birth anniversary of the 125 crore patriotic saint Ramanujacharya.
Because of some or the other reasons, we were so obstacles, it became so small that I kept thinking for more than a century.
For other countries around the world, the centenary will be very important.
But India is such an ancient country that we have got the opportunity to commemorate thousands of years and even thousands of years old.
Imagine a little bit.
Even today, how many difficulties are there when it is said to break the social system.
How would it happen a thousand years ago
He himself had done it to those who believed to be untouched by their practices.
Thousands of years ago, he had made a movement to enter his temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that in every age, a great man has been born from our society to eliminate the evil practices of our society.
While celebrating a thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya ji, we should inspire him to awaken this spirit of social unity.
The Government of India will also publish a postal stamp in memory of Saint Ramanujacharya on 1st May.
I salute Saint Ramanujacharya ji, pay homage to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow's 1st May has another significance.
He is also celebrated as Labour Day in many parts of the world.
And when the topic of Labour Day comes out, there was talk of labour and workers then it is very natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar.
And very few people would know that we are grateful to Babasaheb for the satisfaction that the workers have received today.
Babasaheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb, Sant Ramanujacharya ji, I remember Guru Basweshwar ji, the great saint and social reformer of Karnataka in the 12th century.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to visit a function.
He was a programme to dedicate his voluntary collection.
In the Kannada language, he said, "What Kave Kailas" means that you can achieve the calash of Lord Shankar's house with your hard work, that is, by doing work, heaven is achieved.
In other words, labour is this Shiva.
I am speaking again and again about Shrava Jayate.
Today, when I talk about the workers, then it is very natural to remember Thangdi.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world.
Buddha's ideas are very relevant when the world is facing the problems faced by violence, war, destruction and weapons.
And in India, Ashoka's life is an excellent symbol of the journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that Vesak Day is celebrated on behalf of the United Nations on this great occasion of Buddha Purnima.
This year, it will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
On this holy occasion, I will get an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
He will get an opportunity to illuminate his memories.
My dear countrymen, I have always tried to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' in India.
And when we call 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' then it is not only in India but also in the global context.
Several projects are underway.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on May 5.
The capabilities and related facilities of this satellite will be very helpful in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
In most parts of the country, many families will be engaged in testing their children.
Those who have been tested, there will be some stress-free environment and those whose tests are still going on, there will be a little stress in those houses.
But this time I will say that in the last time I had told the students from Mann Ki Baat again.
They will definitely be useful for us during the examination.
Today is 26th March.
26 March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic battle against injustice is a unique victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of the Wang-Brothers.
Today, on this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day and wish that Bangladesh should be progressive, development and development of Bangladesh, I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a supportive partner of Bangladesh.
It is a good friend and we will continue to participate in peace, security and development in this entire department by shoulder to shoulder to shoulder.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memory is a shared heritage.
This national anthem of Bangladesh is also the construction of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913, he was not the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize, but the British gave him the story of 'Nighthood'.
In 1919, when the British killed a large number of civilians in Jalianwala Bagh, Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who had raised their voice against this incident.
This was the same period when a child of 12 years had a unique impact on this incident.
In the adolescent age, that child laughing in the fields, gardens, the dancer of Jallianwala Bagh had given a new inspiration to life.
In 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagat Singh, the boy of all of us, the inspiration of all of us, the martyr Bhagat Singh.
Three days before this day, on March 23, Bhagat Singh ji, his colleague Sukhdev and Rajguru were climbed by the British on Fasa and we all know about the incident on March 23.
At that time, on the faces of Bhagata Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, the service of Mother India was satisfactory and there was no fear of death.
He had sacrificed all the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes are still inspiring for us.
The story of the sacrifices of Bhagatasingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru will be incomplete.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit that place and I had experienced that there are special kinds of feelings in that land and I would tell the youngsters of the country that whenever I get the opportunity to go to Punjab, then you must visit the tomb of Bhagatsingh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagatsingh.
This was the same time when the rapidity of freedom and its expansion continued to grow.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru had inspired the youth for the armed revolution.
So, just a hundred years ago, Mahatma Gandhi had made Champaran Satyagraha on 10th April, 1917.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the Indian freedom struggle, Gandhiji's ideas and Gandhi style were seen during the Champaran Satyagraha.
This was an important turn in the entire journey of freedom, especially from the perspective of struggle.
This was the time when Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, the end of the mill workers of Ahmedabad and the deep impact of the thoughts and style of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the statue of Gandhiji.
Imagine a person returned to India in 1915 and only two years of work.
The country didn't know them, they didn't even have any effect.
You can imagine how hard they had to suffer and how hard they had to do.
Champaran Satyagraha was such an event in which Mahatma Gandhi's organisational skills, the power to identify the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, to organise the poorest of the poor, the uneducated persons against the British politics, to inspire, to fight, to bring them to the ground and that is why in such a way we feel the marvellousness of Mahatma Gandhi.
We could learn from him and that time was such that the big leaders who listened to the names of Gandhiji, Rajendrababu at that time that Acharya Kripalan had sent everyone to Kheda.
And the British did not know what the method of Gandhiji's work was, the struggle was also happening and the new construction was also happening.
There was a struggle on one side and another.
On the other hand, the work was to be done and on the other hand it was to bow to itself in constructive work.
This is the vision of a New India and a New India that will lay the foundation stone of a New India.
New India is not a government programme or a political party.
New India is an appeal to 1. 25 billion Indians.
There are many people who often go to the hospital, serve patients, there are many who run for blood donation as soon as they need.
Many people worry about the stomach of the hungry people .
Our country is multiple springs.
People's service, that is, Lord Seva, has been divided into our nerves.
If we look at it in a collective form, if we look at it in an organised manner then it is such a great power.
If every citizen resolves that I will follow the rules of transportation, if every citizen decides that it will be my responsibility, if every citizen decides that one day I will not use the petrol-dessel in a week.
You will see that the dreams of this country, the dreams of New India, the dreams of 125 crore countrymen will be fulfilled in front of our eyes.
The meaning of saying is that every citizen should follow the religion of his citizens and follow the duties.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude today.
In the last few days, an environment has been created in our country that people have participated in digital payments and digital movements.
Digital payments have grown in different ways after demonetization.
BHIM App has been started in just two or two months but about one and a half crore people have downloaded it so far.
My dear countrymen, we have to fight against black money and corruption.
25 billion Indians will resolve to transform 2.5 thousand crore digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
If they take this work on their minds, then there is no need to wait for one year.
This work can be done in six months.
2. 5,000 crore digital transactions, if you are going to fill the fees in the school then you will not be able to fill it in a digital manner, you will get digital payments in the air travel.
We can do this in everyday life.
In the last few days, several Digidhan Melas were organised for public education and public awareness.
There is a resolve to make 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been conducted.
There was also a Bakshis scheme in it.
About one and a half lakh people have been rescued under the lucky Consumer Scheme.
70 thousand traders have gained bakishes for them.
At the end, a big event will be held on the occasion of 100 days.
There is a system of massive disposal.
I am sure Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti will introduce BHIM App in the number of days that are still in his hands.
Let us participate in how cash can be utilised, how to reduce the use of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to say that every time I ask for information from the people for Mann Ki Baat, there are various kinds of information, but I have seen that there are information about cleanliness every time.
The Honble Prime Minister, my greetings, first of all, I congratulate you all that you have won in these elections by a large number of votes.
I would like to tell you about my mind.
I want to say that people should understand the need for cleanliness themselves.
I go through the river everyday where most people infect the river by putting garbage in large quantities.
This river flows from the Rispna bridge and comes to my house.
I want to say that we should bring this thing to light through a group or a News Paper.
Look at this, brothers and sisters, how much trouble is the girl who has learned in absurdity.
How much anger is she seen in the river after seeing the waste .
I consider it a good symptom.
This is what I want. I want to create a humiliation of dirt in the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Since the Cleanliness Movement has started, people have been aware of it.
Everyone has been positively connected to it.
Now this campaign has taken the form of a movement.
Cleanliness is increasing.
It is a different significance of awareness and active participation.
But cleanliness is more related to the habits than the movement.
This movement is a movement to change habits and to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can happen in a collective form.
The work is difficult but it has to be done.
I am confident that the feelings of new generations, children, students and youth of the country are indicative of good results.
I would like to tell all the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be the message of everybody.
Have you ever thought that how much narcotics we do in the food that we give.
Have you ever thought that it has not been put in such a scratch, if it does not spend food then how many poor people can fill their stomachs in it.
This is not a subject that has to be explained.
When the mother's child gets food at home then she says that the child, as much as you want, should be given as much as you want.
Some efforts are being made but the sadness of this thing is a social revolt.
This is an injustice to the poor.
The second issue is that if savings are saved then the family will benefit.
I don't want to speak much about this, but I feel that awareness should be increased.
I know some youngsters who run such a campaign.
He has prepared a mobile app.
Where such food is taken or there they speak to other people and they use food properly.
The youth of our country are making such efforts.
You will see such people in every state of India.
Their life also inspires us not to spend the food, increase the food as much as you want.
There are only ways to change vision and those people who are aware of health often say that keep a little empty stomach .
I would like to tell the countrymen that sadness is not a simple disorder.
A psychological environment has to be created and then the treatment starts.
Its first mantra is to emerge and open instead of pressing sadness.
Tell your colleagues, friends, parents, brothers and teachers openly what happened to you.
Sometimes the problem of loneliness is more in the students living in the hostel .
He does not come to the table of food.
Why does he do that
You know that this is the first step towards apathy.
If he avoids staying with the entire family, if he goes alone then it will not happen.
Look at those people with whom he woke up openly.
Inspire him to become a manifest by laughing and open the tumor in his mind.
This is the best solution.
Depression can be the cause of mental and physical diseases .
Just as diabetes invites all diseases, it attacks the apathy of fighting, adventure and decision-making capabilities and destroys this capabilities.
Your friends, your family, your environment can keep you away from apathy and if you are depressed then you can also get you out of that mind.
There is another way.
If we are unable to open near your nearby people, do one thing, go to such a place where the work of service is being done in the vicinity.
If you strive to understand their grief in service, then there will be a new confidence in our minds.
By mixing with others , serving someone and serving with selflessness the stress on the mind is easily lightened .
If seen then Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy .
There is a lot of use of yoga for freement of stress, freedom from pressure, happiness and joyfulness.
June 21 is the International Day of Yoga.
Let us also prepare from now on and celebrate millions of collective yoga festivals.
If you want to inform me about Yoga Day then you can reach me through my mobile application.
It should be done that we can create poems and poems on Yoga so that this topic can reach the people easily.
In the last few days, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
It is sure that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
He is responsible for the family, he is responsible for the financial responsibility of the house, which sometimes leads to injustice to the infant.
The Government of India has taken an important decision in this regard.
During the pregnancy, during the pregnancy, the mother-in-law who had received 12 weeks before this will now be given 26 weeks.
In this regard, two or three countries are ahead of us in the world.
India has taken an important decision for our sisters.
Its basic aim should be to take care of the newly born child who is the future citizen of this country.
If she was taken care of infants, she got the love of mother then this child would be the glory of the country tomorrow.
This will also improve the health of mothers and therefore the benefit of this important decision will be about 18 lakh women.
Let us get inspiration from the lives of all these great men, let us get the strength to resolve for New India.
Two days later, there is a Chaitra Shukal Representation, Year Representation, New Sanvasar, greetings to you for this new year.
It is time for the farmers to get the fruits of their hard work.
New Year is welcomed in different parts of our country.
The New Year is welcomed in Maharashtra in Gudhipadwa, Andhra and Karnataka in Ugadi, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmir Navreh, Sanvatsar Puja in Awadh region, Mithila region in Bihar and Satuwani in Magadh region.
India is a country with innumerable diversity.
My best wishes to you all on this New Year.
Many thanks.
Winter is over now.
The monsoon has entered the life of all of us.
As a fruit of summer season the peacock of Indian gooseberry starts seeing in spring .
At the same time, the yellow flowers of pomegranate in the fields renew the minds of the farmers.
The dried flowers of palsy indicate the holi .
Amir Khusro describes this moment of change in nature.
Amir Khusro writes, "The flower mustard is gross, Ambawa Foots, Tessu Fools, Coal Boles, Dar-Dar.
Whenever the nature is happy, the environment is pleasant then the humans also enjoy this season.
The festival of Basant Panchmi, Mahashivaratri and Holi fills the color of happiness in human life.
We will end the last month of Falgun in an atmosphere filled with love, brotherhood and humanity and we are ready to welcome the coming month.
The spring is the confluence of these two months.
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions of people of the country for this thing that whenever I ask you for suggestions and suggestions, I get a lot of information.
Thanks to Shawji, you recalled the prideful achievement of India.
Whether it is poverty eradication, prevention of diseases, connecting with the world, knowledge, information, technology has underlined its importance.
15 February 2017 is a glorious day in Indias life.
Our scientists have raised Indias mind in front of the world with pride and we all know that in the last few years, ISRO has successfully completed several missions.
In the last few days, ISRO has set up a global record in the space sector after successfully sending Mangalyaan to Mangalyaan under Mars Mission.
This success will not only be historic for ISRO but also for the entire country.
ISRO's Coast Effective Space Program has become a surprising world and the world has also lauded the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, In these 104 satellites, one of the most important satellites is Cartosat 2D, which is the satellite of India and it will be used for photographs, information, mapping, infrastructure development, development and urban development planning.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how many water resources are there in the country, how can they use them
It is also a matter of happiness for us that the leadership of this entire campaign was done by our young scientists , our women scientists .
Such a huge contribution of youth and women is a sign of great pride in the success of ISRO.
I congratulate ISRO scientists on behalf of all the countrymen.
For the common man, these scientists have maintained the aim of using space science for the service of the nation and are registering new records.
Even if you congratulate our scientists and all their teams, it will be less.
Scientists of India have done this.
The capabilities of this missile are that even from a distance of 2000 kilometers, a missile has come to attack India, but our missile will destroy it in space.
We are happy when we see a new technologies, a new scientific discovery.
Those who do not get the same answer, they are not healthy.
And if we observe the journey of thousands of years of human evolution then we can say that this development journey is not complete anywhere.
New science, new technologies are generated from it and every technologies, the form of every new science, the form of a new era.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have told Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should increase the attraction of science.
The country needs many scientists.
Todays scientific scientists can become a reason for a sustainable change in the lives of future generations.
A few days ago, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had organized a very different kind of competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Social useful discoverys were invited.
Sometimes to find answers, the problem also highlights the importance of science.
In Mumbai, there was an overwhelming storm in 2005, Mahapur came and there was a lot of difficulties in the sea.
Whenever there is a natural crisis, the crisis comes to the poor.
Two people worked with their hearts and developed such a way of housing that saves the house during such a crisis, saves those living in the house, saves the water from coming home and saves the diseases caused by contaminated water.
The system is also being technologically driven.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our life.
In the last few days, the emphasis on DG-Dhan has been increased.
Especially the younger generations have a habit of making digital payments from their mobile phones.
I believe that this is a good symptom.
In the last few days, we have received good support from the Bhagyavan Consumer Scheme and the Digi-Dhan Business Scheme.
It took about two months and every day 15 thousand people are getting Rs.
Through these two schemes, the goal of making digital payments in India a peoples movement has been welcomed across the country.
It is a matter of joy that today, under the DG-Dhan Yojana, 10 lakh people have been rescued, more than 50 thousand traders have got remuneration and more than Rs.
The scheme has more than 100 consumers who have received Rs. 1 lakh in the form of remuneration.
There are 4 thousand traders who have received Rs. 50-500.
Expressing happiness from Mysore, Shri Santosh has written on the Narendra Modi App that he received a thousand rupees award in the Bhagyavan Consumer Scheme.
But I think he has written an important thing to reach you.
He has written that he had received a thousand rupees bucket when he was reminded that the house of a poor woman had a fire and all the goods were burnt in the fire.
Santosh ji, our navy and our work are satisfactory to all of us.
We have done a very big inspirational work.
Bhai Sabir, a 20-year-old driver in Delhi, has now been connected to digital transactions and the government's lucky consumer scheme, he has got a discount of Rs.
A young student from Maharashtra is performing Pooja Namade, Pooja Namade, Podya Vidyakrama, how he uses RuPay cards and e-wallet in his family and how enjoyed he gets.
The award of one lakh rupees is so important for them, but they have taken up this work as a vendor and are connecting it with others.
This movement has a very important role in fighting against justice, corruption and black money.
Everyone associated with this work is an anti-corruption cadre of the country, against corruption.
In a way, you are a soldier of goodwill.
On 14th April, a huge amount of Rs.
There are more than forty-five days of silk.
Remembering them, we should teach at least 125 people to download the Bhima App.
You should learn how to share and share it.
Particularly teach those small and small traders around you.
On this occasion, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar and Bhim App, give special importance to this.
And that is why I would like to say that the foundation of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar has been laid by us.
BHIM App has to be connected to the households and connected to the households.
The movement that has started since last two-three months has resulted in a lot of success in several urban settlements, several villages and many cities.
My dear countrymen, the agriculture sector has a huge contribution to the roots of our country's economy.
The economic power of the village enhances the economic pace of the country.
I would like to tell you a very happy thing today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have filled the cereals warehouse by working hard.
This year, there is a record production due to the hard work of the farmers of our country.
All the records are telling us that our farmers have emerged as their previous records.
This year, the crop has been so much that everyday it seems that the pongals and bisakhis have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is more than eight percent of the previous sales in the name of our farmers.
This is an unprecedented success itself.
I especially thank the farmers of the country.
Thanks to the fact that along with traditional crops, the poor of the country should think about the production of pulses because the most proteins are available to the poor from the pulses.
I am happy that the farmers of my country listened to the voices of the poor and brought about two hundred nineteen lakh hectares of land for different pulses.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is a great service to the poor of my country by the farmers.
I have a request, a prayer, a prayer, my farmers are eligible for special gratitude for the way they produced and produced pulses.
My dear countrymen, in this country, some initiatives are being taken from the government, from the society, from the institutions, from the organisations and from each other in the field of cleanliness.
In a way, everybody seems to be aware of cleanliness in some way.
The government is also continuously making efforts.
A programme of senior officials of 23 State Governments led by our Secretaries of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which was the Department of Water and Sanitation, was held in Telangana a few days ago.
What is the significance of the work of hygiene, if there is no interaction in the shutdown rooms in the adjoining state of Telangana
Use of this a Toilet Pit Ampting Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 17 and 18 February .
The toilet pits of six households were evacuated and cleaned and the officers themselves showed that the twin pit toilet used can be used empty and used again.
He also showed how convenient the toilets constructed by using these new technologies are and there is no hesitation in cleaning and mental obstacles.
As soon as we clean up others, we can clean a toilet.
And this is the cleaning of the toilets and if we consider it as a fertilizer then it is black gold in a way.
We have been able to see how wealth is produced from waste.
A Standard Twin Pit Toilet for the families of six people, this model takes place in about five years.
After that, the waste can be easily removed and released to the other pit.
There was a dissolution of waste collected in the rocks for six to twelve months.
Nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium are full of nutrients and are considered to be the best fertilizer in the field of agriculture.
The way the government has taken this initiative, others have also taken such initiatives.
Now this special programme has been launched on Doordarshan.
The more such things will be spread in it, the more it will benefit.
Different departments of the government are regularly organising Swachhta Pandharavada.
In the second month of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will carry forward the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We are determined that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, the entire country feels a new energy, self-confidence is increasing.
We welcomed the achievements made by our Divyang sportspersons in Rio Para Olympics.
He is proud of the success of these Divyang colleagues.
I often believe that the Divyang brothers and sisters are powerful, are determined, are courageous, determined.
Every moment we can learn something from them.
Be it an issue of sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anybody.
Our women's team has won the silver medal in the Asian Ragbi Sevens Trophy competition a few days ago.
I convey my best wishes to all these sportspersons.
Womens Day is celebrated in the world on 8th March.
In India too, there should be a need to increase awareness and sensitivity in the family and society to give importance to girls.
This campaign is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Today it was not just a government programme.
Today, it has become a movement of social consciousness and public education.
In the last two years, the common man has been associated with this initiative.
This initiative has participated in thinking about this very important issue in every corner of the country.
The old customs that have been going on for years have changed the ideas of the people.
When the news is celebrated after the birth of the girl, then it is very pleasant.
In a way, positive ideas about girls are becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that the Kuddlore district of Tamil Nadu has been imprisoned under a special campaign for childbirth.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to the 'Mulgi Bacha-Mulgi Teacher' scheme, to ensure that the orphan girls get their education along with orphaned gatherings.
In Madhya Pradesh, the campaign for education is being undertaken for every household knock, in the village and in the household girls.
Entrepreneurs are underway to inspire the girls who have left the school to bring them back to school and inspire them for education in Rajasthan.
New ideas are being linked to it.
They have changed according to local requirements.
When we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we will have the same feeling: "Woman, Wo Shakti, Shakti, Woe India, Woe to the women of the country, no work, no work to the officers of the country, my dear countrymen, you all get the opportunity to interact with Mann Ki Baat.
You were also actively participating.
I am extremely grateful to you for your participation.
My dear countrymen, bow down to all of you.
On January 26, we celebrated our Republic Day with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
Recalling Indias Statehood, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens and our commitment to democracy, this festival is a festival that will educate democracy on generations.
But in our country, there is no longer as much discussions about the rights and duties of the citizens.
I hope that at every level, as many important duties are given to them.
On this day, at 11 o'clock in the morning, we pay tributes to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the nation.
On the 30th of January, at 11 o'clock, this two-minute soul should become a simple nature of itself as a society.
I congratulate the families of those brave soldiers who have been awarded different bravery awards on the eve of this Republic Day.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Special Service Medal, Special Service Medal.
I am particularly an appeal to the youth of the country and you are very active on social media.
Whether you can do one thing or the heroes who have received this honour at this time can you find the Internet and write two good words about them and reach their friends.
We are surprised, we feel proud and inspired when we know about the adventure of these heroes, their bravery, their valour and their valour.
On the other hand, on the other hand, we were happy to read the news of the joyous celebrations on 26th January, while the soldiers in Kashmir had lost their lives due to the defence of our countrys borders.
I salute all those brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
My young friends, you know that I always tell you your Mann Ki Baat.
The month of January, February, March, April is the time of a lot of misdeeds in every family.
Almost every household has a test of one or two children but all the families were buried under that test.
It seems that this time is appropriate for my students to interact with friends, their parents and teachers because for many years, wherever I go, wherever I meet, the tests of children are being taken care of.
A very strange psychological situation is seen in every household that the family is in anxiety, the students are taking care of, the teachers are in disintegration.
When I was told about this thing, many teachers, parents and students had sent me messages, sent questions, sent some information, the problems and difficulties you faced.
I would like to express my thoughts in my mind by reading those things.
I received a telephone message of creation.
Sir, I would like to tell you that on the day of the test, our homes, neighbours and neighbours are creating a very terrible environment in our society.
It does not happen to the minds of the students but we become sad.
I have to ask you so much that this environment cannot be pleasant
The dream is true, but it will be in the hearts of all of us.
There are very few people who are present in the examination.
Most of them used to be tested.
It is a real presurrection that you have to decide the pleasure.
The experiment which will be faced by the pleasure and joy, will get the same brown fruits and the presure that will be slaughtered will be the time for the future.
That is why I believe that you should face the tests as if it is a festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
The entire family should play the role of this festival with enthusiasm.
Seeing the picture will change .
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there are tests in all these three-four months.
These three-four months, according to their traditions, change the environment of your family in accordance with the time of the festival.
And that is why I will tell you that Smile More, Score More.
In stressful state all the doors are closed , nothing can go inside from outside and can not come out inside .
The process of thinking stops and these things are loaded.
And you don't have any knowledge, there is a shortage of information and hard work.
But if there is tension then your knowledge and your knowledge gets stuck under it and there is tension on it.
It is important to keep in mind the A Happy Mind this sector for a good work-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we don't look at the examination with the right point of view.
It is our mindset that if there is a question of life and death.
This is a test of what you have studied in the year.
Your entire life will not be missed there.
This is not a test of how you are living, how you are living, how you are living and how you have to live forward.
Besides the tests taken by the books in the class, you must have gone through several criteria.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering of the President of India, Dr.
J.
The biggest challenge I see before education in today's times is that it will become the centre of education.
Markets are getting a lot of importance.
This has not only increased the competition but also increased the stress on the minds of the students.
I want to know your ideas about the current practice of education and the future of it.
In fact, he has given a reply in his question, but Rishi wishes that I should share some of my views on this subject.
There is a limited use of qualities and properties.
If you believe in these things then Market will come back from you and you will never need to run away from them.
You will be able to use knowledge in your life, your address will be useful, your confidence, determination will be used.
Would you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger rivalry then see his mark sheet
Its experience, the successful journey in the field of knowledge and faculty is seen there.
That is why Markanch can sometimes stop us from going to the right direction.
Richa ji has also given the issue of continuous competition with others.
This is a very big mental battle.
I say that the examples related to sports are easier to understand.
The specialty of most successful sportspersons was that their competition is automatically competing.
Let us illustrate this thing.
Their journey has been that we can go ahead by defeating ourselves for twenty years.
It should be a marvellous thing because they followed the path of competing with others.
In every field of AYUSH, you should think about this thing as well as in every field of study. I could have practiced calmly for two hours before.
Earlier, it was late to get up early in the morning, should we get up soon
You don't have to sleep due to the stress of the test. Do you want to sleep now
He said, "My mother didn't have much learned.
Yet she used to sit with me and mathematics from me.
I will just tell the parents that they should focus on three things, accept, teach and give time.
The parents must have experienced that they are in the roots of many problems that are expected from the children of teachers.
Your weight will also be removed.
I was present there and I saw that he did not ask any question about the health of the patient.
He started listening to Vinodi kissing.
Within four-five minutes, all the air-climate changes took place.
A . . . keeps talking about the diseases going to meet the patient and keeps scared .
I want to tell my parents this thing and sometimes we are aware of what we have with children.
Have we ever thought of giving a happy, smiling environment to the children during the test
So do it, the environment will change.
I have come up with another big Kamali phone call.
He said, Namaskar Prime Minister, I cannot tell myself the name because my childhood was working.
I once tried to copy my childhood.
And when I tried to copy it, I was caught in it and many friends around me were very distressed.
These short-cut roads are the reasons for copying.
You must have heard this often.
I will also say that again.
The effects of copying will be seen in any way.
If the same creativity is spending that time on the issue of the test then perhaps there will be no need to copy.
A phone call has come to me, he says, "My name is Monica, and I am a 12th student so I want to ask you some questions related to board examinations.
My first question is about increasing stress during these tests and how can it be reduced
If I talk about playing and playing in the past days then your teachers, your parents will live on me.
He said that during the test time, how are the Prime Ministers who are telling the children to play
Because in sports, we have a common understanding that the focus on studies is decreasing.
This idea is wrong in the origin.
The root of the problem is there.
See the sky after falling out of your practice for two moments, see the trees of absorption, slide your mind and then sit in your room for study.
Whether it is for five minutes but give this rest time to yourself .
You will see that the work is going on.
Everyone likes this or not, but my experience tells me this thing.
For that there is no need to sit in the room.
Stay under the open eye, go to the glass, breathe for five minutes and then sit in the study.
Some people understand that if you wake up very late at night then it will be practiced very much .
But not.
Definitely take as much sleep as the body is necessary .
Your efficiency will increase.
When I go to the public meetings for the elections, my voice is sitting sometimes.
I had come to visit a folk singer during this meeting.
He asked me how long do you sleep
But it does not mean that we keep sleeping continuously.
If there is a situation then the people of your house will live on me.
It is a very big medicine to keep mind , mind , body aware .
Yes, young friends, you are engaged in the preparation of the tests and I am stuck in my mind.
Kunas Chouk, perhaps my speech will help you overcome the stress of your mind.
But at the same time, I will also say that I do not take care of the things I have spoken.
If you are gathering then do it or do not do it or else it will also become a burden.
I am also aware of the fact that I have told your parents not to put the burden of aspirations on children.
Keeping yourself trusted and consistent with our determinations, the tests should be overcome.
My best wishes are with you.
In order to cross every casualties, give that casualties the form of a festival.
And then no test will be done.
Go ahead with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, on February 1, 2017, the Indian Coast Guard is celebrating forty years.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the officers of the Coast Guard for their country's service.
The Indian Coast Guard, including 126 vessels and 62 aircraft, is considered to be the fourth largest coast Guard in the world.
As per our ideal tactics, the soldiers of the Coast Guard are ready to keep the countrys maritime borders and maritime areas safe.
Last year, the people of the Coast Guard have been proud to make our country clean along with their responsibilities.
Thousands of people participated in this.
He is really commendable for the safety of the seashores and for the sanitation of these shores.
Very few people would be aware that not only men in the coastal forces of our country but also women are doing their responsibilities and are successfully fulfilling their responsibilities with their shoulders.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard are aeronals, observers and are also handling the responsibility of the overcraft.
Today, when there is a question of coastal security at the global level, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the Indian Coast Guard on their 40th anniversary.
The festival of Basant Panchami will be celebrated on 1st February.
It is considered the time of the foundation of the school.
Not only this, this time is inspiring for the heroes.
The same inspiration is seen in the song of Meera Rang de Basanti Chola.
I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen on the auspicious occasion of this spring Panchmi.
My dear countrymen, while spreading Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani also keeps on innovating it with its innovation.
Mann Ki Baat gives you a great opportunity to join you.
My best wishes.
My dear countrymen, good wishes to all of you on the occasion.
Today is a day to give importance to service, sacrifice and work in our lives.
Jesus Christ has said that if we do not serve the poor then we should accept it.
St. Luke has written in the Gaspell, he has not only served the poor but also appreciated the service made by the poor and this is true empowerment.
A story related to this is very popular.
It is said in that story that Jesus was standing near the treasure of a temple .
Several Sirmans came and they did a lot of donor.
After that a poor widow came and she put a two copper copper coin in it.
Now, if you go to see it then what is the value of two copper coins
There was wonder in the hearts of the devotees standing there .
Then Jesus said that the widow has donated the most and others have given a lot but this woman has donated all that she has.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Varanasi, which was the land of Malviya ji.
I laid the Foundation Stone of the BHU in Varanasi, His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre.
Today is the birthday of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Our country will never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
He also highlighted the countrys pride in the field of nuclear energy under his leadership.
Be it a party leader, a member of Parliament, a minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji made an ideal in every land.
On the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I salute him and pray to God for his good health.
As an activist, I was fortunate to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are awakened in front of my eyes today.
When I tweeted this morning, I also shared it with an old painting and how Atal ji's affection in the form of a small worker would certainly be seen in this painting.
The people of the country will get the benefit of two schemes as they visit today on the occasion of the nightmare.
In a sense, two new schemes are being launched.
Everyone has to learn from each other and understand.
To encourage this process, to get the strength of mobile banking, the Central Governments Promotion Scheme for consumers and small traders is being launched from today.
The Bhagyavan Consumer Scheme is a scheme to promote consumers, while the Digi Dhan Business Scheme is a scheme to promote traders.
The scheme will start from today and the next 100 days will continue.
Every day, 15,000 people will get Rs. 1,000 each.
In addition, for such consumers, one day from a week, lakhs of rupees will be disbursed, after three months, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's Jayanti will be on that day, there will be a gathering in which crores of rupees will be saved.
The Digi Dhan Business Scheme is mainly for traders.
Businessmen should automatically participate in this scheme and include consumers to prevent their transactions.
Independent textiles will also be provided for such traders and these textiles will also be in thousands of numbers.
The traders will continue to do their own business and they will also get the opportunity to win the batch.
The scheme has been formulated by keeping all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class in the centre.
Those who buy more than Rs. 3,000 will not get the benefit of these bakshes.
The poorest of the poor can also buy goods, sell goods, provide money and beneficiaries of this Bakshis scheme by using USSD.
In rural areas, you can buy and sell AEPS through AEPS.
30 crore citizens can soon participate in the Bakshis scheme.
This is very simple, it is as easy as you send a message from the Votsop.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to note that the awareness about how to use technology in our country, how to make e-payments, how to make online payments.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased by 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a very big decision to promote this.
The businessmen can guess how big this decision is.
Those traders who exchange digital routes, will provide online payments instead of cash in their carbons, have been reduced from income tax.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Mr.
A committee has been constituted under the Chairmanship of Chandrababu Naidu.
At the same time, I have seen that the state governments have started several schemes on their own.
Somebody told me that the Government of Assam has decided to give 10 percent of the discount if wealth tax and trade allowances are paid through digital payments.
The branches of rural banks which will be able to provide at least two digital transactions through their 75 consumers during January-March, will be provided by the government of Rs. 50,000.
He also announced an outlay of Rs. 5 lakh under the Best Panchayat for Digital Behaviour by the Government of India by 31st March, 2017.
The Government of Assam has announced a levy of Rs. 5,000 to the first ten farmers who have been fully filled with digital means for purchase of seeds and fertilizers under the Digital Agriculture Shiromani Scheme for the farmers.
I congratulate the Assam Government and congratulate all the governments who have taken such initiatives.
Many organisations have made several successful experiments to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers of the villages.
Somebody told me that the companies related to the Gujarat Narmada Gulf, Fertilizers and Chemicals Restricted Fertilizers have set up POS machines where fertilizers are sold for the convenience of farmers, in just a few days, 35,000 farmers have purchased fertilizers through digital means and all these have been done in just two weeks.
It is a matter of fact that the fertilizer sector has increased by 27 per cent this year as compared to the previous year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, the scope of informal sector has increased in our lifestyle and most of these people are given wages, money or wages of work, cash payments and so that the labourers are being exploited.
80 per bbl, where one should get 100 rupees.
At the same time, they are also empowering the benefits of those other benefits.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easier for us.
The country like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have also made a lot of progress in the field of start-ups.
These are the golden days of the digital movement.
Our youth should empower this sector with new ideas, new technologies and new methods.
At the same time, all of us should join the entire strength in the campaign to free the country from time to time and from corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge the people to give their advice before Mann Ki Baat every month.
80-90 of the suggestions received on MyGov and Narendra Modi App are related to fighting against corruption and timely money.
When I saw all these things, I distributed them in three parts of Dhobal Mann.
It has been written in detail about the kind of problems and misconceptions that some people have given me.
The people of other types have written that even if such a good work is being done for the welfare of the country, such a sacred work is being done at some places, how new ways of discovery are being discovered.
The three types of people have written that this fight should continue to continue in support of what happened.
The number of people who say that corruption, black money should be completely destroyed and strict steps should be taken if needed.
I express my gratitude to all the countrymen who have helped me send a lot of letters.
Shri Gurumani Kewal highlighted that this step taken to prevent the behavior of black money is commendable.
We are fighting against corruption and black money as the army forces.
The words written on notes are wrong, the rate of sweets has increased, the notes of two thousand will be canceled, the notes of Rs. 500 and 100 will be canceled.
However, by listening to all these Afwas, the minds of the people of this country were stunned.
Not only this, many people landed in the field, they brought the true face of the people who spread their wisdom by using their skills and wisdom and proved that Afwa was wrong and brought to the truth.
I salute this strength of the people.
My dear countrymen, today I feel that when 125 crore Indians stand with you, nothing is impossible.
Janta Jannadan is the form of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for taking part in this magnitude of corruption and black money.
I felt that there should be widespread discussions in the House regarding the fight against corruption and black money.
If the House had worked then it would have been a good discussion.
It is completely wrong that some people are spreading all kinds of discounts to the political parties.
The law is equal to all.
Be it individuals, organisations or political parties, everybody should follow the law and everybody has to do it.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and timely money spend time in search of government error.
There is a question of repeated change of rules.
This government is for the people.
For 70 years, what power has been involved in this period of dishonest and corruption, how much will it be
When I decided to fight against such people, they started their daily efforts to defeat the government.
On the other hand, several citizens have also written letters of discussions on non-proliferations and different interactions.
The common man is giving more information than the information coming from the government system.
We have achieved success due to the awareness of the common man.
In order to provide such information, the government has prepared an e-mail address and it can be sent on it.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who have written such letters and have faith in their letters and blessings.
This is not a complete break.
This is the beginning.
There is no question of fatigue, there is no question of stopping and the blessings of 1.
You must be aware of the fact that Benami Property is a law in our country and the Act was enacted in 1988.
He was kept drowned in the basana.
We took it out and implemented the Effective Benami Property Act.
This law will show its impact in the coming days.
We have been the top priority to do whatever we have to do for the welfare of the people.
The World Banks Industry Report has improved Indias sequence.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have jumped 16 places in the World Innovation Index 2016 and have jumped 19 places in the World Banks Inland Performance Index 2016.
The evaluation of several reports is indicating that India is moving forward at a rapid pace.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of the Parliament gave rise to the citizens of the country.
Everyone expressed his feelings of anger in the functioning of Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their displeasure over it openly.
But in such a situation sometimes there are some good things and the mind gets satisfaction.
There was a good job in the Parliament's graveyard but the country did not pay attention to it.
Brothers and sisters, I am proud to say that my government has passed a legislative legislative legislative legislation related to the mission for the disabled.
I am grateful to all the MPs of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for this. I thank them on behalf of crores of disabled people of the country.
Our government is also committed to the Disabilities.
I have tried to speed up this campaign individually.
I wanted the disabilities to get their rights and to get their proper respect.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, by winning four medals in Paralympics, have renewed our efforts and confidence.
He enhanced the country's dignity due to his victory, as well as his capabilities embarrassed the people.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have an invaluable heritage like every citizen of the country.
I am happy to note that after this bill is passed for the benefit of the persons with disabilities, they will get more job opportunities.
Reservation limit has also been increased to 4 in government jobs.
The Government has recommended a new law in accordance with the ideas of the United Nations.
14 categories have been covered.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we will be proud of the fields of sports.
The Indian Cricket Federation has won 4-0 of the ongoing war against England.
Some of the young sportspersons were commended.
Our young sportsperson, Karan Nayar, has done a tri-discipline of K.
L.
He played 199 races.
Virat Kohli, the Karnadhar of the Kasoti Sangh, also led the Sangh as a good leader.
Indian Cricket Federation of Spinner Golandaz R.
Ashwin was announced by ICC as the Cricketer of the Year 2016 and the best customer.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all of them.
In the field of hockey, there has been a good news after 15 years.
The Jewish Hockey Federation has won the World Head.
After 15 years, the Jewish Hockey Federation has named the World Head.
Congratulations to the young sportspersons for this achievement.
This achievement is in the forefront of the Indian Hockey Association.
Our women sportspersons also performed well last month.
Indian women's hockey team won the Asian Alliance Competition and recently, Indian women's team earned bronze medals in the Asia Championship 18 years ago.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the sportspersons from the Cricket and the Hockey Team.
My dear countrymen, the coming year of 2017 should be the year of new joy and enthusiasm, all your resolves should be fulfilled and we should achieve new heights of development.
This New Year will also provide an opportunity to the poor of the poor to live a life of happiness.
I convey my best wishes to all my countrymen for the year 2017.
Thank you very much
Like every year, I went to India-China Sewer to celebrate Diwali with our Indian soldiers.
I celebrated Diwali in the higher areas of the Himalayas along with the soldiers of the ITBP, the soldiers of the Armed Forces.
Every time it goes, but the experience of this Diwali was different.
The same reflection was reflected on the faces of every soldier who dedicated this unique kind of Diwali to the soldiers of the Armed Forces.
Someone did poems, some paintings, somebody removed the cart, some people made a video.
That is, every household was watching the army and when I read these letters, I was surprised.
These letters are full of emotions and innovations.
At the same time, a information was received on May Gov, whether the coffee table book can be made by collecting the select things
A soldier from our armed forces wrote to me, Prime Minister, Holi of our soldiers, Diwali, every festival is on the border.
It seems as if we are celebrating Diwali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, in this Diwali, how will your feelings of our armed forces be limited to just a few occasions
I urge you to take this habit as a society, as a nation, as a nation, whether it is a festival or festival or the soldiers of our country to keep in mind.
When the entire nation stands with the Armed Forces, the strength of our army increases by 125 crore.
A few days ago, Sarpanch from the state of Jammu and Kashmir had come to visit me.
He was a member of the Jammu Kashmir Panchayat Summit.
He had come from different parts of the Kashmir Valley and had about 40-50 people.
I got the opportunity to talk to him for a long time.
He had come up with issues about the development of his village.
They had some demands and when our interactions began, the issues of adventurous Kashmir, the situation of law and order, the future of children came out.
In Kashmir, schools are set on fire, they are being talked about and I have seen that the sorrow they suffered, the sorrow they suffered.
He says that the future of children is not a school but also a network of children.
I urged them to look at the future of these children.
A few days ago, the board was tested by the children and girls of Kashmir, about 95 percent of the students and students.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to his parents, relatives and teachers and Sarpanch of all the Gram Panchayats.
Brothers and sisters, This time when I asked you for information for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that everyone has sent information on the same subject.
All of them were saying that we should talk about 500 and 1000 notes in detail.
I was also aware of the fact that in our daily life, we will have to face many new problems.
It cannot be easy to get rid of the diseases that we had faced for 70 years.
I can understand the problems faced by you.
500 thousand and such a large country, such a big country, such a magnificence, billions of notes and decisions.
The entire world is watching Barkains, every economist analyzes it.
In the entire country, the Central Government, the State Government, the Department of Local Self Help Institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than one and a half lakh post offices, more than one lakh banks, friends and nights have been associated with the spirit of dedication.
Despite many types of stress, all of them are very quietly working as a yagna of the service of the country and as a great transformation.
They start in the morning, when will the night be completed
Suddenly there was a need for money.
Several such incidents come out of TV, newspapers and discussions every day.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those colleagues who have worked hard and proved to be male.
The capabilities were identified only when success is achieved after misdeeds.
I would like to remember that when the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was started and the bank workers had taken the burden on their shoulders and they were showing the work that was not done in 70 years.
Today, once again, he has accepted the challenge and I am confident that the resolve of 125 crore Indians will give a new strength to the nation.
But the bad habits have spread so much that even today many people do not get their bad habits.
And still some people feel that this money of corruption, this black money, this money, this money, anonymous money, some of the roads and some of them will be brought back to the system.
They are exploring illegal ways to save their money.
It is sad that he has chosen the way to use the poor.
They are trying to save money by paying money or paying money to the poor by disillusioning the poor.
Today, I want to tell those people who do not want to amend or not to amend our wishes, not to adhere to the law, what will they do
But do not play with the lives of the poor by doing good work.
And the government does not want that our countrymen will be in trouble.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village, Taluka Tirali, J. Hadra, Madhya Pradesh.
It is commendable that you have shut down the notes of five hundred thousand.
I would like to bring such examples from Mann Ki Baat to the people that even after being absorbed, people welcomed this tough step for nation progress.
Because we say that good days will come but no one would feel that we will take such a big step.
The people of black money and corruption have got a good deal to see all these notes of 500 and thousand.
Every Indian will never have a better day than this.
It is so joyful that it is so proud that the common man of my country has a unique strength.
People go there, eat and get money after 2-4-6 days.
This is the strength of my country, which has a sense of service, sacrifice and authenticity.
During the election, I had taken up the 'Chaye Pe Charcha' initiative and this thing was done all over the world.
But I did not know that marriages are added to tea drink discussions.
In Surat in Gujarat, a girl gave only tea to the people who were married to her.
Once I saw in the news of TV, when I came late at night, I was looking at Dhekiyazuli in Assam.
Now, when a note of Rs. 2000 was received, what did they do
Nearby, four neighbouring women came together and they went to the market and bought them together and paid Rs.
See how changes are being made in the life of the fields.
Some people benefited from this campaign immediately.
I got information about the small towns.
It was reported from about 40-50 cities that due to this shutdown, people did not pay the money.
And you know that the poor people go and pay the money without paying the money two days ago.
These are not big people who are familiar with them, who knew that no one would think about them, they would not pay the money and they would be very tired.
Each municipality deposits 50 percent of the tax pay.
But this time, due to the date of 8th, all of them were running to deposit their old notes.
Last year, about three-seven thousand crore rupees were deposited in 47 civil departments.
You will be surprised to hear and enjoy it. 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited with them in a week.
But I congratulate the farmers of my country today.
I was recently taking stock of the crop production in this season.
The farmers have also discovered the path of difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions and has given priority to the farmers and the villages.
Small traders of our country send jobs and help in increasing economic conditions.
Just like the big malls, the small shopkeepers of the village can also do their business for 24 hours. No laws will stop them. I believe that big malls are available for 24 hours or why not
Under the Mudra Yojana, initiatives were taken to provide loans to them.
But due to this decision, the problem of them also becomes natural.
I would like to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is a chance to enter the digital world.
You also download the banks' apps on your mobile phones, you also keep POS machines for credit cards.
Let us learn how business can be done without any use.
You can see that the way in which big malls and technologies increase their business, a small trading system can enhance our business through a simple Ujjor Friendly Technology.
There is no possibility of any deterioration and there is a chance to increase.
I invite you that you can contribute a lot to create a cashless society or a cashless system.
There are technological roads, are safe, are compulsory and are faster.
I am confident that I would like to convey my best wishes to the labourers, the hard worker brothers and sisters that you are very exploited.
But Friends, You are my friends and friends.
We have a unique opportunity to serve Mother India and have got the opportunity to take the country to an economic height.
The older generation is not of this world as much as we have experience.
We knew what the App was used by the previous generations.
We know how online banking, online ticket booking are done.
There is nothing special in it.
But today the country wants to do the great work, which is your dream, the cashless society, it is true that 100 per cent of us will not be successful but have not started.
If we start the cashless society then the goal is not far away.
Wallet means e-packet.
Several cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards.
However, after the date of 8th, the poor have started using RuPay cards and their usage has increased by about 300.
Likewise, Priped Cards are available for mobile phones and Priped Cards are available to spend money in bank accounts.
This work is so simple that as we send Votsups.
It is also known that a very uneducated person should forward a well-educated Votsup.
Not only this, technology is becoming easier that there is no need for smart phones for this work.
Be it dhobi, vegetable seller, milk seller or be it present leaflet or tea seller, everyone can use it.
I have stressed on the need to simplify this system.
All banks are working on this.
And now, the online jurisdiction has been canceled and we must have read in the current letter of the last two-four days when we have removed the jurisdiction of such cards.
The technology that is required to spend online will be in our mobile phones.
Not only this, we should tell at least ten families about half an hour and two hours everyday that how technology is used and how our bank can download the app
We are leading this campaign to free the country from corruption, to free the black money, to free the people from problems and to get rid of problems.
I think that if the common man learns this system then he might get rid of work, and if all the youngsters of India are bowing themselves to this thing then it will not take a long time.
Within a month, we can stand as a modern Hindusthan in the world.
And you can do this work through mobile phones and you can go to 10 households daily.
I invite you not only to stop with support but also to bring about changes and changes by the army.
Let us take this fight to free the country from corruption and black money.
And there are many countries in the world where the youth of the country have changed the life of the nation and there was a revolution from the youth.
The country of Kenya has set up a mobile system M-Pesa, using technology, named M-Pesa.
This country has brought about a big revolution.
My youngsters, I reiterate that this campaign should be taken forward.
I invite you to work individually in schools, colleges, universities, NCCs, NSS, collectively and individual forms.
The most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji is taking forward the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It seems that sanitation is in their nerves and that is why on the birth anniversary of our fathers we remember the work of cleanliness.
He writes that one of the poems of Harivansh Rai ji, one of them, one of them, one of them, one of them, the tenderness of the earth, the life of the fun of the fun, the introduction of the Meera - Harivansh Rai vanshraya.
My dear countrymen, I have always been associated with you through Mann Ki Baat, through your thoughts, your emotions, letters, on MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
The Mann Ki Baat programme is spread at 11 o'clock but we will soon hear the translation from regional languages.
In every corner of India, the festival of Diwali is celebrated with joy and enthusiasm.
India is a country where 365 days of the year are celebrated somewhere or the other in the country.
The festival is the second name of the life of Indians. And it is natural for anyone who can see it from afar.
Since Vedas, the tradition of festivals of India has changed from time to time.
However, in all these journeys, one thing is recalled that this entire journey of festivals that are accomplished in India has been linked to its extension, its intensity, its impact on the people to the self-complete.
The main objective of this is to expand individuals and individuals, try to expand our limited ideas from society to Brahminds and achieve all these through festivals.
Our ancestors have incorporated the fact that if we consider the diet in the festivals of India then how the climate is there, how the food should be taken in the weather, how the farmers take the crops, how the day of harvesting will be included in the festivals.
Today the whole world is discussing the environment.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of care.
The tradition of the festival of India is only giving a version to each other from the children to the elders of the nature that increases the love of nature.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, we celebrate a festival of responsibilities towards everybody.
We take holidays on Sunday, but the older generations used to take leave on the day of amavasya and pornima.
This darkness is not a darkness due to lack of light but it is also a darkness of darkness.
It is an endeavour to brighten the blindness of the society by brightening the lamp on Diwali, to remove the infected blindness of the individuals, and to bring the light of positiveness through the same idea.
Even if the house of the poor is a utensil of soil, then it looks clean and shiny in the days of Diwali.
With this point of view, Insolvency is a mission of cleanliness.
But not only in the house but also in the entire area, cleanliness in the streets and cleanliness of the entire village is the need of today's time.
In that context, we should expand this tradition of cleanliness.
This festival of Diwali has not been confined to the borders of India.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different ways in all the countries of the world.
Many governments around the world, MPs and administrators want to participate in the festival of Diwali.
You might be aware of the postal stamps issued by the US postal service this year on Diwali.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his photo on Twitter on the occasion of Diwali.
The UK Prime Minister organized a grand event to gather all the societies on Diwali in London and also participated in it.
There is no such city in Britain that is not being celebrated with great enthusiasm.
What is the photograph that Singapore's Prime Minister has kept on Instagram and shared with the whole world proudly
The 16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament.
He told me that the Prime Minister of New ealand had recently visited New ealand to return to New ealand to participate in the Diwali celebrations.
I would like to say that this festival of light of Deepawali is a festival of inspiration to bring the global community from darkness to light.
In the festival of Diwali along with new clothes and food items of different taste , fried things are played with fatness .
Small children and youngsters love to bury them.
Small children, but sometimes they are dreaded with zeal, they invite a huge crisis by simultaneously trying to make a big voice together.
What are the things around us, the possibility of a fire
During the days of Diwali, news of such accidents, news of fire and deaths are a matter of concern.
During the days of Diwali, many doctors are busy celebrating Diwali with their families.
The festival of Diwali takes place in our country for a long time.
We also prepare Chhathapuja while celebrating the festival of Diwali.
The festival of Chhathapuja in the eastern part of India is a very big festival and this festival is considered to be the festival for four days.
This festival gives a very big meaningful message to society.
It is difficult to realise what Suryadeva gives us from all that we get from the direct and indirect Suryadevta.
Chhath Puja is a festival of the worship of Surya .
It is said that people in the world worship the rising sun.
But Chhathpuja is a festival in which the sun is also worshipped.
A big social message is also given through it.
In my future, it is a feeling of gratitude for the sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the security forces and I came to my mind that this year's Diwali should be dedicated to these security forces.
I invited the countrymen to the message to Soulgers for this mission.
Today, I would like to say that there is no feeling of immense love, pride and respect for the people of the country.
The way this feeling has been expressed, every citizen has come to the forefront of a rapid power.
Through the messages of all of you, the soldiers of our security forces have got new patience and new patience.
Be it schools, colleges, students, villages, poor people, traders, shopkeepers, political leaders, sportspersons and actresses have expressed their feelings.
Media has acknowledged the opportunity of expressing gratitude to the Armed Forces.
Today, when we celebrate Diwali, somebody is standing in the desert, somebody is on the summits of the Himalayas, somebody is protecting the industries and somebody is watching the security of the airport.
I can imagine how proud is the moment for the soldiers of my country.
Important sentiments have been reflected on the message to Soulgers Hashtag.
Ashwinikumar Chauhan has sent a poem and it feels like reading and showing me this time.
I speak Shivani Mohan.
Our Fauji builders are encouraging the message to solvers that you have launched on this occasion of Diwali.
My elders and sisters were also officers in the army.
Our entire family is full of soldiers.
We have several officers in the Armi Circle on the borders of the country, who are getting good messages and are getting a lot of encouragement.
I would like to urge the entire family and their wives to sacrifice a lot along with the officers and soldiers of the army.
Through your messages, the entire army community is getting a good message and I would like to convey my best wishes to you also.
Whether it is natural calamities, the problem of sustainment of law and order, whether it is to do two hands with the enemy or to bring the youth back in the wrong way - our soldiers are inspired by the nation in every front of their lives.
I would like to tell you about an event and I would like to inspire you to achieve the success.
We have an ITBP soldier in the security forces, Vikas Thakur, who is a resident of a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
The name of his village is Badhana.
Our youth had visited our village in the vacation of ITBP.
That is why Himachal Pradesh has become an open defecation free state in the true sense.
Very few people go to those villages.
The engineering students of the city located at a distance of some distance from the village had no toilets.
NCC Chhatra, NSS members and engineering students decided to build toilets in this village.
All the things required for the construction of toilets, potatoes, cements and all other essential things have been driven by these youngsters on their shoulders and have laid the foundation stone for the entire day and brought them to the village.
They worked hard to build toilets in the village and showcased a small village in the remote areas of the jungle openly.
That is why Kerala will soon become an open defecation free state.
Gujarat has announced that Sudha all Municipal Corporations-Mahanagar Municipal Corporations are more than 150 Open Defecation Free.
10 districts have been opened open defecation free.
Haryana is going to celebrate its Golden Festival on 1st November and he has decided to free his state from open defecation in a few months.
So far, 7 districts of the country have become Open Defecation Free.
Work is going on at a rapid pace in all the states.
I have mentioned only some states.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of all these states for their participation in this campaign and for their contribution towards eliminating the darkness of the country.
My dear countrymen, there are several schemes of the government and after the first scheme, the first scheme has to be stopped.
But generally nobody is aware of these things.
Ancient schemes continue to continue, new schemes continue to continue, the schemes that are coming are awaited and it continues to continue.
The houses in which gas is used for cooking and electricity is not required for kerosene.
He has taken a big decision to free kerosene from Haryana.
I am confident that Haryana will soon get rid of kerosene.
Only the mediators and the parties will be affected by this.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always been a guide for all of you.
It is the need of the hour to take care of the aspirations that have been created in the minds of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step from one side to get out of the crisis.
Even though our old ideas are anything, the differences between the sons and the daughters should be lost in the society.
Now there are free accessories for children and girls in schools.
This is the opportunity for our daughters to experience India free of discrimination.
It is not right to spread darkness in the village after the 21st century was destroyed.
In order to make such villages blind at the earliest, efforts are being made to provide electricity to them.
Successful efforts are being made to provide smoke free life to these five crore families.
Small traders, entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, barley shopkeepers, all such people were stuck in the evil cycle of public interest.
Many people have been freed from this evil cycle of interest through Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Accounts.
Direct money is deposited in banks through Aadhaar so that they reach the beneficiaries directly.
This is an opportunity to free the lives of the common man from the mediators and the parties.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great man of this country who dedicated his life to the unity of India.
You will be happy to have the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel on 31st.
Sardar Patel had spent his entire life in connecting the country and he was successful in his mission and brought together.
At the same time, Durdev said that Indira Gandhiji was killed on the same day.
You all know what happened in the country after their deaths.
Sir, I want to think that what can be done to prevent such a bad incident
My dear countrymen, this is not just a person's sorrow.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a big task of uniting the country after Chanakya.
This injustice to Sardar Ji on the birth anniversary of that great man who lives for unity is painful for all of us.
However, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
The unity of diversity is the strength of the country.
Whether it is a variety of languages, be it various castes, be it a variety of food, but the unity of diversity is the strength of India, Indias specialty, it is the responsibility of every generation.
It is the responsibility of every government to explore and establish unity in every corner of the country.
It is important to save the country from the ideas that spread the foothills.
It is our responsibility to make Sardar Saheb an India that has given us a great India.
The original mantra of unity is a strong foundation for Shreshtha Bharat.
The life of Sardar Saheb was started after seeing the struggle of farmers.
However, Sardar Saheb has taken initiatives not only for the struggle but also for constructive work.
I respectfully pay homage to Sardar Saheb and urge you to remember wherever you are on 31st October, to resolve unity.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is a festival of light in this series of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev and his teachings and teachings are not only for the entire humanity but also for the entire humanity.
The message of service, reality and Sarbat Da Bhala was Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace unity and goodwill were his original mantra.
In every teaching of Guru Nanak Dev, a campaign to free the society from discrimination, superstitions and evils was launched.
Guru Nanak Dev had chosen Bhai Laloo as his colleague when he had reached the extreme border of such disorders, such as touch, untouchables, caste systems and high-level disorders.
Let us move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' that inspires us to work against discrimination, inspires us to illuminate knowledge and distinction.
My dear countrymen, once again I congratulate you all on this Diwali, dedicated to the soldiers of the country.
My best wishes to all of you for your dreams, your resolve to be fulfilled, your life should be spent in happiness and happiness.
My dear countrymen, bow down to all of you.
We lost our country's eighteen heroes in the recent terrorist attacks in the Uri area of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our army.
They will immerse every such task and will embrace the efforts of the country to enhance the lives of 1.
But the army is not speaking.
Today, I would like to specially speak to the people of Kashmir.
The people of Kashmir are now becoming well aware of the anti-national forces.
And as the truth has started to know them, they have started walking on the path of peace by separating themselves from such ideas.
Every parents feel that schools and colleges should be functioning at the earliest.
The farmers feel that the goods and fruits produced in the fields will go to the markets across India.
It seems to be easier for economic transactions.
And since the last few days, this behavior has started smoothly.
We have to reach new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we can find solutions to every problem together, find ways and pave the way for the future generation of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of governance.
Government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I get the opportunity to know a lot of attacks through social media.
It gives an opportunity to understand the feelings and feelings of every kind of people in every part of India and it strengthens democracy.
A young man named Harsh Vardhan, who learned in the eleventh year, has recently put a different idea in front of me.
Then I made a pledge that I used to study for three hours every day.
It will be a citizen who will be useful for the country.
I am glad that Harsh Vardhan Bhai, while entrepreneurship in the environment, you can think quietly in such a young age.
But Harsh Vardhan, I also want to say that the entrepreneurship in the minds of the people of the country is a huge price.
It is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
This entrepreneurship indicates the determination to do something.
Everyone feels that something happens and something happens.
At that time, Lal Bahadur Shastri tried to touch this future of the country in an excellent manner.
And by giving the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan, the common man of the country was inspired to work for the country.
One more way to express patriotism in the voices of bombs and guns was shown by Lal Bahadur Scientists.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T.
Kartik has written on Narendra Modi App that his brave history for the Paralympics competition was the victory of human consciousness.
Shriman Varun Vishwanathan has written on Narendra Modi App that we should mention that we have done a very good job in our clutches.
Not only we are both, but every person in the country has been associated with his sportspersons from Paralympics in an emotional manner.
This paralympics and the performance of our sportspersons have brought about a complete change in the vision of humanity, towards the disabilities.
And I cannot forget what my victorious sister Deepa Malik Hin said.
When he won the medal, he said that this medal has defeated the disability itself.
There is a lot of strength in this word.
At this time, 19 athletes participated with three women from our country in the Paralympics competition.
In comparison to other sports, when the Divyangjan plays, the physical capabilities and the skills of sports are more important than that.
We will be surprised to hear that our sportspersons have won four medals and earned two gold, one silver and one bronze medal.
Devendra Jhajriya, who won the Gold Medal, won the second Gold in Bhalafake.
And it was not a disabled person when he was born, because of the shock of electricity, he had to lose one hand.
Let us think that the man who wins the first gold medal in the thirty-twenty-twenty years of age, and how much would he have done in his life as he wins the second gold medal in the thirteenth year
Mariyappan Thangvelu won a gold medal in a tall fly.
He will not live in a big city or even in the middle class.
In the 21st year of age, even though there was a physical obstacle, he won a medal to the nation on the strength of his resolve.
Theatre Deepa Malik has done at least in the flag hoisting of the window.
Varun C.
Bhati won bronze medals in a high flying manner.
Very few people will be aware of what kind of philosophy has been done by these Divyangjans in the Paralympics competition.
Not only this, I was surprised when I came to know that the sportspersons who were ranked fourth in the race to run in the Divyang sportspersons could not get medals, but he completed the race in less than the sportspersons who won the gold medal in the Sabal race.
I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward towards creating a simplified plan for Paralympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I have experienced a lot of wonderful experiences in the Navsari of Gujarat.
It was a great emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mahashibira for the persons with disabilities and many worldwides were registered at that time.
The world cannot see that Gauri had come from Shardul and the inaccessible jungles of Nang district and the entire Ramayana is facing it in the form of poetry.
And when I heard the people of that place, people were surprised.
On that day, I got the opportunity to dedicate a book and collected the success story of the lives of the persons with disabilities.
This experiment was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Record .
It is a matter of pride for all of our countrymen to be a three-three worldwide worldwide by persons with disabilities on one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we started the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu Ji.
And that day I had said that cleanliness should be a habit and every citizen should be duties and should create an environment of disintegration for cleanliness.
Now, on 2nd October, when two years are over, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in 1. 25 billion people.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today all of you can say that everybody has made an effort to move forward.
And that is why every person, whether it is a common citizen, a government office or a road, a bus station or railway station, a school or a college, a religious place or a hospital, a small child or a senior citizen, a rural poor, a farmer, everybody is contributing to cleanliness.
The media friends have also played a positive role.
I want you to move forward.
And that is why if you want to tell about rural India then till date, about two crore and fifty lakh toilets have been constructed.
In the states and states, in the district and districts, a narrow competition has been started in the villages.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve complete success in Open Defecation Free Village Campaign.
Congratulations and congratulations to those who have worked for this thing.
And I would urge the countrymen to free the country from this problem for the honour of mothers and sisters and for the health of children.
Let us take this pledge forward.
I would like to present a scheme especially for my young friends who use hali technology.
By calling on this 1969 number, we will be able to know the situation of building toilets in our city as well as request for construction of toilets.
We should take full advantage of this, especially the younger generation should take advantage of it.
The Government of India has also urged the corporate sector to move forward.
He should sponsor young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the district as a representative of Swachh Bharat Mission.
Fertilizers have been told to buy the fertilizers that will be produced from garbage.
The farmers who do organic farming have been told to provide fertilizers.
Those who want to improve the health of our land, those who take care of the health of the land, those who have suffered due to the use of chemical fertilizers, have been told to provide these fertilizers as required.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing specially to this work as a good messenger.
I am inviting youngsters to start new startups in the field of waste to wealth, wealth and wealth, develop machines and technologies.
This is definitely a work to do.
During the period 25th September to 3rd October this year, a special programme is being organised in Indoson, Indian Sanitation Conference.
The Ministers from all over the country, the Chief Ministers, the Mayor of the Municipal Corporations, the Commissioners will meet together and discuss only cleanliness and sanitation.
What can be the technology
What could be the economic policy
How can people participate
How can you create employment opportunities
All these topics will be discussed.
I see that new news about cleanliness is continuously coming.
Recently, I had read in the newspaper that students from Gujarat Technology University went to one hundred seven villages and started a campaign of awareness about toilets.
He worked for himself and contributed to constructing nearly 900 toilets.
Recently, we must have seen that a group under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh, from Devprayag to Gangasagar had swimmed 2800 kilometers away and gave a message of cleanliness.
Different departments of the Government of India have prepared their guidance.
Each department decides for fifteen days and pays attention to cleanliness.
In October, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayat States, Department of Rural Development will jointly formulate a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And in the last two weeks of October, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing and Ministry of Consumer Affairs will run the Swachhta Abhiyan in their respective areas during 16-31 October.
I urge the citizens to participate in the departments of which you have a close relationship with them.
You must have seen that the survey on Hally Cleanliness is conducted.
Earlier, in 73 cities, what is the situation of sanitation there was before the people of the country.
Now this work will be done in nearly 500 cities with more than one lakh population.
Because the citizens of every city feel that we are behind this thing and now I can do something better.
A competitive environment has been created for cleanliness.
I hope all of you will contribute to this thing.
The birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri is on 2nd October.
I urge you to buy Khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
I am also telling you that there should be only one thing of Khadi in your family so that the bankruptcy of bankruptcy can be implemented in the house of the poor.
Would you like to participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan as a citizen on Sunday, 2nd October
Two hours, four hours, we will take part in the work of cleaning and I will tell you that take a photo of it and share it on the Narendra Modi Apple.
If you have a video, share a video.
See, your efforts will give a new strength to this campaign across the country and will get new speed.
Recalling Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, the joy of giving them in life is something different.
And the response that he has received can be said to be a great inspirational event in the national life of India.
Several youngsters, small and big institutions of our country, the people of the corporate sector, the students, the volunteers organisations will commemorate the joy of living in many cities of the country from 2nd October to 8th October.
It is a mission to bring all the food items and clothes together to the needy.
It was a joy to see that the player on the faces of those poor children.
I feel that in the cities where this joy of giving is going to be celebrated, we should encourage the youth and help them.
My dear countrymen, today on 25th September, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyays Jayanti and his birth centenary is starting today.
Millions of workers like me have worked to explain to the political ideals that are working with them.
He pointed out that Indias root-related root-related royal philosophy of Indias cultural traditions.
The birth centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay is being started today.
The theory of Sarvajan Hitay-Public Sukhaya is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke about the interests of every person in the field.
How to reach the poorest of the poor
He presented the entire economic framework in these two words, work for every hand and water for every farm.
My dear countrymen, I started Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashmi.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the beneficiaries for the kind of commendation and blessings you have done during the completion of two years.
I am also grateful to the Akashwani because he has not only spread the message of Mann Ki Baat but also worked hard to reach the audience from all regional languages.
I am also grateful to the workers who have written letters on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, who have made the doors of the government, have shown the error in the work of the government and the AIR has taken care of such letters and have provided a platform for the problems of the people.
Therefore, Mann Ki Baat was not only a fifteen-two-twenty-minute dialogue but also an opportunity for social change.
What can be a matter of greater joy for anyone.
How will the festival connecting humans and humans
And that power will be the means of real power and then we will all together celebrate the festival of victory.
Let us take the mantra of unity and take the means of this power.
To take the nation to a new summit, celebrate the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja along with peace, unity, goodwill and celebrate the victory of Vijaya Dashmi.
English rendering of PMs interaction with Mann Ki Baat on Akashwani
My dear countrymen, Hockey's magic on August 29 is the birth anniversary of Dhyanchand.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay homage to Dhyanchand ji and I would like to recall his contribution on this occasion.
He played an important role in winning the Hockey Gold in the Olympics Games in 1928, 1932, 1936.
You all know the name of Bradman for cricket lovers.
My countrymen, as soon as the time of Mann Ki Baat is coming closer, there is a lot of information on MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
In addition to the cricket, the Indians have such a compassion for other sports, such awareness and awareness.
Giving this message to me, he became a source of inspiration.
Sachin says that in the Mann Ki Baat of this time definitely talk about Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar.
The medals that you have received were received by the girls.
Our daughters have proved that we are not less than anybody.
One of these girls is from north India, one from South India, someone from East India and someone from another part of India.
Therefore, it seems as if these girls of the entire country have taken the name of India to brighten.
My Govt Summit Takur writes that we can do better than this in Olympics.
He said, "Congratulations to Honble Modi sir on winning two medals in Rio.
But I would like to pay my attention to this thing. Is it really good for you
And the answer is, no
We need to build a long pack in the sports sector.
Our mother-in-law is focusing on health practices.
The society also believes that sports is a time-frame.
We cannot ignore that we cannot work as per our expectation.
It has been said in some cases that those sportspersons who were doing good work in India, they were not able to show them there and only two medals were received in the medals.
One more thing is true that if you don't get medals, you will know that for the first time, Indian sportspersons have shown some good duties in many games.
Look at the same time, his innovation in NEMBAGI was at the fourth place and he was medal at a very low gap.
The same thing happened in Tennis, Sunia Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
After Ush, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar was eligible for the final round of the Track Field.
You will definitely be happy to see that the women's hockey team reached the Olympics after 36 years.
In the last 36 years, for the first time, the hockey team of men was able to reach the Nock Out Fairy.
Our team is strong and is part of the gathering that Argentina, who had won the gold medals, lost one match in the entire competition, who was defeating them
The performance of some sportspersons was good for example Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhaknal, Atanu Das.
My countrymen, we have to do a lot but if you keep doing something and doing something then you will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
This Committee of the Government of India will undertake a vigorous study and study of what is done on sports worldwide.
We will formulate a framework committee on what we can do.
We have a visionary plan for 2020, 2024, 2028.
I also urge the state governments to set up such committees, what can we do in the field of sports, what can we do in the field of sports
And I am confident that we have 65 per cent of our countrymen and 65 per cent of our countrymen, together we will achieve the best situation in the sports world.
This resolve is to move forward.
Our countrymen, on 5th September, Teachers Day
I have been giving time to the students on the occasion of Teachers Day for a few years and I was spending time by becoming a student of them.
I was learning a lot from these students too.
For me, September 5 was a Teacher's Day and on Education Day.
So, there is a feeling in the mind that you should express my feelings in the Mann Ki Baat.
The place of mother in life is the place of teachers as well.
I have also seen teachers who are more concerned than themselves.
They live their lives for their disciples and students.
At present, after the Rio Olympics, there is a discussion with Pulela Gopichand on all sides.
They are sportspersons, but they are examples of how excellent teachers are.
The contribution of teachers in the lives of all of us is always felt.
On September 5, the former President of India, Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, on his birth anniversary, and the whole country considers this day as a teacher day.
Even though he reached any place in his life, he tried to live on the grounds of his own teachers.
And my own letters are very bad.
Whose handicrafts have been seen so that respect has increased in my mind.
If you have a photo with your teachers on Narendra Modi App, you will remember it, if you are inspiring then you must share it.
Keep in mind that the contribution of teachers from the point of view of the students will be valuable for you.
Friends, Ganesh Festival will be held in a few days.
We all feel that our country, our society, our family, every individual, their lives are disintegrated.
When you think of Ganeshotsav, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak.
The tradition of the public Ganesh Festival is to give the people of Tilakas.
We should discuss the subjects that touch social life and create programmes that inspire the society to get new inspiration, new energy and their self-sufficient right is my birth and I will be able to achieve it.
Ganesh Festival was organised not only in Maharashtra but also in the corners of Hindustan.
Public matters are discussed, essay competition and sequence competition are organized.
From this, social topics are touched by the artistic artistic framework.
A kind of public education campaign is being launched through the Ganesh Festival, Lokmanya Tilak gave us the inspirational mantra that Swarajya is my birth rights.
Now we have the right of Suraj, we move towards Suraj, we have our priority. Can we not give the message of this mantra from the public Ganesh festival
I am inviting you.
It is true that festivals are the strength of the society.
Festivals bring new awareness among the individuals and society.
Life is impossible without festivals but it is expected to change as the demand of time.
On this occasion, I have noticed that some people, especially on the Ganeshotsav, Doorgapuja, have a lot of worries and concerns about the environment.
The statue made from POP is not environmentally friendly.
Others have also said that this pain has been intensified in the way they have finished.
I pray to all of you that like ancient times, the idols of the dynasty and Durga Mata of Shadu should be used and should not follow our old traditions.
Conservation of environment, conservation of our river ponds, protection of the lives that are evacuated from pollution, is Gods service in a way.
I don't know what kind of feelings you will take of these issues, but I don't say it alone but it is the same thing for many people.
In some opinions, the idol of Pune, Abhijit Dhondfale, the foundations of Kolhapur, Nisarg Mitra, Science Prabodhini.
Environment friend Ganesha Festival is also a social service.
Durga Puja has a lot of time.
I convey my best wishes to you all on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be depicted by a saint on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor of India.
Mother Teresa, who has served the poor people of India throughout his life, gets a saint's title then it is natural for all Indians to be proud.
The event will be held on 4th September, wherein a delegation of officers under the leadership of the Government of India, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will be held on behalf of 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, there is a big change.
Jan Shakti is the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to bring people together with the help of five State Governments to clean Ganga and clean Ganga.
On 20th of this month, the Chief Ministers of the village were invited at Allahabad on the banks of Ganga.
I convey my best wishes to all the chiefs who have come from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for coming to Allahabad for this pledge.
I congratulate all the Ministries and Ministries of the Government of India, who have fulfilled this idea.
I also congratulate the Chief Ministers of all the five states that they have taken a certain step in the cleanliness drive of Ganga by bringing people together.
Somebody wrote from English, somebody wrote from Hindi and somebody wrote from Chhattisgarh that there should be toilets in his house.
He asked for construction of toilets.
Some children have written that this year I have not celebrated the birthday but make toilets sure.
This work was done by these children from seven to seventy years of age.
It was so impressed and emotional that on the second day when we went to school, the parents wrote a letter to the teachers and there was a belief in that letter that Amuk should make toilets in the house till a date.
Congratulations and congratulations to those students who tried to make this idea, and congratulated the parents for their efforts and decided to make toilets in their minds.
A sixteen-year-old girl from this district, Mallama, called Satyagraha against her family.
Look at the features of this village leader Mohammad Shafi
He deposited Rs. 8,000 and made toilets within a week.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have this pledge.
Some Indians have made their goals.
However, everybody has been connected in that form, everybody has contributed to it.
There are reports everyday - what do they try
The Government of India asked the people to make a film on cleanliness for two-three minutes and send it to the Government of India.
I would like to tell TV channels that you should also have such competitions.
The idea of innovation can also strengthen the cleanliness drive.
My invitation is to you, my countrymen, I have always wished that India has always been associated with neighbouring countries.
However, this is not the channel of ordinary radio, it is an important step.
Our neighbour is Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are today connected with the same cultural tradition.
They will interact with each other and exchange ideas and enjoy the joy of both the Bangladeshi people.
All India Radio has contributed to peoples contacts.
The President inaugurated the Channel.
Thanks to Bangladesh for working with us for this programme
I convey my best wishes to all the All India Radio friends that they are contributing to the foreign policy too.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the smoke of Prime Minister but in the end I am a man like you.
Sometimes the emotional events touch me more.
Some of these emotional events also give new strengths, inspire and inspire the people of India to do something or the other.
He wrote to me a 84-year-old IG pension teacher.
Though I have told you not to declare my name, I feel like telling them the name.
In a letter, he said that when we urged us to quit gas subsidy, we left the subsidy and then I forgot it.
However, a few days ago somebody came and gave me a letter and thanked me for the Give it up.
For me, this letter of Prime Minister of India is not less than Padmashree.
Friends, I have tried to give a letter to those who have left the subsidy on LPG.
I am trying to give letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job, your campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of smoke and I will be a retired teacher in a few years.
I am sending a payment of Rs. 50,000 so that the poor mothers will get rid of the smoke.
We are aware that a mother who is supposed to pay a pension of a common teacher, who gives Rs. 50,000 to the poor mothers for gas connections, the question is not about Rs. 50,000.
The question is of the spirit of the mother and the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters, which strengthens the confidence of my country's future.
He did not write this letter to me as Prime Minister but he wrote a simple letter: Modi Bhaiya
Several flood situations have occurred in some parts of the country.
The state government, the central government, the local autonomous institutions, the social institutions and the citizens have helped.
In August 2016, all the political parties together approved the GST Bill, which had a political opposition, not a single opportunity against each other.
Its credit goes to all the political parties and if all the parties start walking together then it is an example of how big it was.
Similarly, in relation to what happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together put together an issue in a voice.
Those people who try to create such an inconvenience by moving forward, they will have to answer it sometimes to innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is big and has been destroyed with diversity.
As a citizen, as a citizen, as a society, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen the unity and then the future of the country will be brightened.
I have full faith in the power of 125 crore people.
This morning, I got the opportunity to stay with the youth of Delhi for some time and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports will color every young man in the color of zeal and hope.
You all know that in a few days the world will have a big sports festival.
The name of Rio is going to be repeated in our ears.
Our hopes will be very much, but the people of the country have been able to enhance the confidence of those sportspersons who have gone to rio.
We should do something or the other to encourage our sportspersons from wherever we are in the coming days.
The sportsperson who reaches the Olympics reaches there only after hard work.
This is a kind of hard scenario.
Winning and greening are important but it is more important to reach that sports and that is why all of you will be greetings and best wishes to all the sportspersons who have come to RO Olympics.
Today, I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poem lover, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of Punjab Central University, has sent a poem.
Many of you will have poets, who have written poems, maybe write poems, some people will do those words, they will do it in every language, but the poem that Suraj has sent to me is sharing with you.
This young man has reminded me of the death anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam ji.
The whole country and the world had paid tributes to him, but when the name of Abdul Kalam ji comes, the words of science, technology, Missile come forward and the pictures of the future capable India come to the forefront and that is why Ankit has written that what is your government doing to realize the dreams of Abdul Kalam ji
Ankit ji is right to say you
And if we want to go with him or go ahead with him, then we have a research and innovation. And these two things are the life of technology.
If research is not a new manufacturing, the same way the stored water produces smell, the technology also becomes a burden.
If we live in the world without research, innovation, without innovation, then the government has taken some steps to sweeten the attraction of science, research and innovation in the new generations to become timeless in this world and in the changing era.
And if I say Let us to innovate then I mean AIM.
10 lakh rupees will be given to those schools where such a ticketing lab will be constructed and Rs. 10 lakh will be given to take care of them for five years.
On the other hand, India is facing many problems.
We see problems and problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find technology-based answers.
We have called upon the younger generation of the country through Atal Grand Challenges that if we see problems, problems, then find it through technology, research, innovation and bring it to us.
The Government of India is giving a special prize to the technology that has been recognised on problems and difficulties and I am delighted to know that when we told about Tinkering Labs.
My dear countrymen, my dear countrymen, a few days ago, I was worried about the misery of myself and the news of the floods is also coming.
The State Government and the Central Government are working hard to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to help the victims of floods.
Even though there is some difficulty due to the rains, the mind of everyone is happy, because the centre of our entire economic growth is rainy and there is a farming on it.
Sometimes such diseases occur that we have to regulate for birth .
But if you are awakened, be cautious, if you are trying then the way to escape from it becomes easier.
He looks upon the V.
I urge you to work with the government, hospitals, doctors, but also to keep yourself aware of the fact that you should not enter your homes, your departments and your family, so that there is no disease from water.
Dear countrymen, I want to take care of ourselves towards another crisis.
Today life has become very fast and due to continuous running, we do not get time to think about ourselves.
If you are sick then it feels that you get better at the earliest and for that antibiotics are taken.
We don't walk through shortcut.
Complete the course of those pills .
Even after leaving half an hour those bacteria will be benefitted , even after taking more than necessary bacteria will be benefitted hence the number of days the course of taking pills has been proved .
It is necessary to fulfil it, but it is necessary to complete the course.
In the medical language it is called antibiotic registrations that how to use antibiotics should be followed by its rules .
In the last decade, the maternal mortality rate has come down, but even today the lives of pregnant mothers can not be saved in large quantities.
During pregnancy the quantity of blood is less , the infections occurring during delivery , high blood pressure , no one knows who does not get any problem .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign, its name is Pradhan Mantri Safe Maternity Abhiyan.
Through this campaign on 9th of every month the pregnant woman will be tested free of cost at the government health center .
In order to save the lives of both mothers and children, I urge you to provide free service to the poor mothers on 9th.
My doctor brothers and sisters cannot give 12 days of a year to the poor
There are thousands of doctors, they have written letters that they have taken the work forward by appreciating me and calling me.
Thousands of doctors are such that they believe in me.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worrying about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is being discussed in a collective manner in the country and the world.
Shukracharya Nitin has said that there is no such vegetation in which there is no medicinal properties.
The tree that donates the tree also preserves it in the world like it.
But in todays generation, there are some people who follow these ideals and bring them into practice.
The Parvat of Mahabharata has said that the trees also perform the responsibility of the child in the world and Sonal has taken a pledge to fulfil the wishes of not only our parents but also the entire society.
Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junnnar taluka of Pune, Maharashtra, has done a different motivation in her natives.
The temples should start the tradition of planting plants in the dry rainy season .
The plantation can easily become a mass movement.
I constantly tell the farmer brothers that if we damage the land due to tied on the edges of our farming then instead of timber or wood can we cultivate
Today, in order to build houses in India, to make wood stuff, buildings of crores of rupees have to be brought from abroad.
If we plant such trees in our farming fields, which would be useful for the work of wood and houses, after 15-20 years we can also sell it by the permission of the government, we can get the new means of income and we can save India from importing wood.
In the last few days, a lot of campaigns have been implemented in several states using the weather weather, the Government of India has recently agreed upon a CAMPA (Campa) Act and more than Rs. 40,000 crore funds are going to the states for plantation.
I was told that the Maharashtra government has planted two and a half crore trees in the entire state on July 1, and has resolved to plant three crore trees next year.
The government has set up a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Maru-Bhumi have done a big forest festival and have resolved to plant 25 lakh trees.
25 lakh trees in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they can know how big they have taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase the greenery by 50 by 2029.
The Green India Mission, which has been launched by the Central Government, has been launched by the Railways in the Green India Mission.
Gujarat has a bright tradition of the Suddha Forest Festival .
This year, several projects like Amravan, Ekta Forest, Shahid Forest in Gujarat have been undertaken under the Forest Festival and a campaign to plant crores of trees has been undertaken.
I cannot mention all the states but everyone is commendable.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa a few days ago.
When there is a foreign visit, there is talk of international policy trade, there are discussions on security and some MoUs are to be signed.
But for me the journey of South Africa was like a pilgrimage in a way.
South Africa says that it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nellson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and compassion fall on the ears then the faces of Gandhi and Mandela come forward to us.
During my visit to South Africa, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi was known as Sarvodaya.
His visit will always be remembered.
Equality and equal opportunities are not such a mantra for any society and government.
Both the paths of equality and mood take us to the bright future.
We all hope for a good life, want a good future of children, everybody's needs are different, forwards are different, but the road is the same and that is development, equality, equal opportunity, equality, morality.
Let us be proud of those Indians who showed this original mantra of life in South Africa.
He informed me about an incident, the Prime Minister, I am speaking a sculpture from Bengaluru.
A few days ago, I had read an article in the newspaper that a woman supplied and lost Rs. 21 lakh due to a slaughtered e-mail.
As a woman, I was sorry about it.
I want to know your thoughts about this.
Everybody knows that if you know the things that you love on your mobile, e-mail, then the messages that you have taken such money, you will pay such money and take such money.
If some people are fascinated then some are fascinated with greed.
These technologies are spreading fossils across the world.
Sometimes we are in love.
I feel that we should be cautious of this fascination, be cautious, if such a scarcity comes then we should tell them in our friends and groups and should make them a little cautious.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to meet many people during the Parliament session.
Our parliamentarians bring people from their respective departments, meet them, tell them about them and tell their problems.
But I had a pleasant experience on this day.
Some of the students of Aligarh came to me.
The zeal of children and daughters was worth seeing, they had brought a big album with themselves.
Artificial paintings have been depicted at the station, colored.
You must go to Aligarh and see this station .
This is an example of this that peoples participation can bring about change.
Thanks to all those who have done this kind of work in the country, special congratulations to my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with the rainy season, there is also a season of festivals in our country.
Festivals are celebrated in temples and pilgrimages.
You will also be connected to these festivals at home and outside.
Raksha Bandhan is a special festival of our hardships.
Like last year, can we not give the festival of Raksha Bandhan to our mothers and sisters as a gift of Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Vital Jyoti Bima Yojana
Think that you should visit the sister so that her life will get real security.
Not only this, if there is a woman who is making food in your house, who cleanses his house, who is a daughter of a poor mother, you can also visit this festival of Raksha Bandhan on the occasion of Suraksha Bima Yojana or Vitan Jyoti Bima Yojana.
My dear countrymen, many of you are such people who were born after independence and I am the first Prime Minister of this country, who was born in independent India.
We can inspire us for 75 years and 70 years of Indias independence, create new zeal, hope, and this opportunity can be for the resolve to do something for the country.
The festival of freedom is not a government programme, it should be the people of the country.
It should be a festival like Diwali.
I hope that we too will do something better to connect with the inspiration of patriotism.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, I get the opportunity to interact with the people of the country from the Red Fort.
There will be some things in your mind, you will have such a desire, that things should be explored from the Red Fort.
You will feel that as your representative, as your Prime Minister, I should say that from the Red Fort, you must write me and suggest something and suggest new ideas.
Let me invite you, let me remind you of the heroes who sacrificed their lives for freedom, let me remember the great men who lived for India and let us move forward with a pledge to do something for the country.
Once again I have got the opportunity to say Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat is not a ritual for me.
I am keen to interact with you myself.
And I am happy that I can reach the common man of the country through Mann Ki Baat.
I express my gratitude to the Akashwani for the successful efforts made by the Akashwani to translate the translation of Mann Ki Baat in regional languages at 8 pm.
And I am happy to note that those citizens who listen to my Mann Ki Baat programmes, they bring their feelings to me through letters and through MyGov website and Narendra Modi App.
I am beneficial to run the suggestions made by the government.
How active should the government be for public welfare
How much priority should the work of public welfare be given
That is why my interaction with you is very important.
World Environment Day is on 5th June.
There are discussions on environmental issues around the world.
The main concept of Environment Day has been concluded by the United Nations that iro Tolerance for Elligal Wildlife Trade (JWT) will not only discuss the trade of wildlife but also talk about trees and water.
This is the reason why you might have seen that the Himalayas in the regions of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir had already been hit in the jungles near the Himalayas.
Therefore protecting the forests and saving the water is the duty of all ours.
He interacted with the Chief Ministers of each State for about two or two hours.
They heard what they wanted to say.
Some states, especially Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, have used technologies.
We have to bring these successful measures to other states of the country through NITI Aayog.
Peoples participation is the main reason for success to overcome such problems.
And that is why water harvesting is equally important.
And that is why the drop more crop - every drop - more production, micro-irrigation - micro-irrigation, low water pike.
It is a matter of joy that in many states, sugarcane farmers are now using soft irrigation and micro-irrigation.
I also learned from them that many states have a big goal, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat, have done a lot of work in the field of hydro irrigation.
They are trying to bring two to three lakh hectares of land under micro-irrigation every year.
If this mission is implemented in all the states then it will not only benefit the agriculture but also increase the storage of water.
Our brother-in-law Mission Bhagirathi in Telangana has tried to use the water of Godavari and Krishna rivers in a better way.
With the help of technologies, efforts are being made to restore ground water through Niru Pragati Mission in Andhra Pradesh.
In the peoples movement in Maharashtra, people are providing financial assistance along with labour.
I am sure that this movement will actually beneficial to protect Maharashtra from future water storage.
The State of Chhattisgarh has undertaken the Jansurajya-Jalsurajya Abhiyan.
A big campaign has been taken to revive the ancient canals of Rajasthan and Gujarat as a watershed.
However, water storage in some parts of the state has been stored.
A big work is being done by constructing chequehams and small bondages there.
This is really a pleasant experience.
But there is a lot of water that is why we stay neglected and if there is no water on the end of the monsoon then how will it go
And water is not limited to farmers only.
This is a matter related to villages, poor, labourers, farmers, urban, rural, Smt.
So, when the rains are coming, water should be the issue of our priority and when we celebrate Diwali this year, how much water has been saved during the rainy season
You will see that your joy will grow many times.
And this is not just the government but also the work of the common man.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a modern India.
We want to make India transparent.
Those who are going to reach India from one end to the other in the same way.
We have to change our old habits to do this.
Today, I want to touch a topic in which you help me, we can successfully move towards that direction.
But now the time has changed.
The entire world is moving towards a cashless system.
We can get money and send money through electronic technology.
There is no fear of going to the pocket pocket pocket in this field.
He will be registered on his own.
It will be a bit difficult to use this method but once the habits are made, it will be easier.
This is possible because in the last few days, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was launched, the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country were opened.
On the other hand, Aadhaar number has also been found and mobile phones have now come to the hands of almost every Indian in India.
Therefore, Jan Dhan, Aadhar-Mobile-Jam (JM).
We can move towards cashless systems and cashless society by coordinating with them.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given with the Jan Dhan Department.
In the coming days, it will be useful for both card credits and debits.
And a small instrument has also been made available, which is P.
Oh.
It is called the Paint of Cell, through this machine you can pay for others using Aadhaar numbers, RuPay cards.
One of the initiatives taken by the Government of India is how to pay money through POS
The second initiative we have taken is that bank on mobile.
Exchange of money through your mobile phones will be very easy.
In a way, this is the step taken by the bank in this direction.
The activities are underway for the services of the bank in the post office.
If we have learnt to use this system in practice, then there will be no need for direct currency, there will not be any need to be taken in the amount.
Behaviour will continue to happen on its own and it will lead to transparency.
Unexpected behavior will stop the behavior of two numbers.
The result of timely money will also be reduced.
Therefore, I would urge the countrymen to start this thing.
You can see that once this system started, we should move forward in a smooth manner.
Had anyone felt that 20 years ago from today, such a mobile phone would be in our hands.
Gradually the habit of staying without it is not possible .
It is possible that the non-cashless society can be shaped gradually as much as possible.
But it will be better if it comes to light in a short time.
We should encourage our sportspersons who are participating in the Rio Olympics and their confidence should increase.
The Chief Minister was the candidate.
But he was also the Minister of the Government of India.
Whether they get nutritious food according to the requirement or not .
Whether they are the trainees for their physical health or not .
I am delighted to see whether the results of the election will take place or the possibility of responsibilities as the Chief Minister, I am so aware of your work as a sports minister in such a situation.
Our sportspersons feel that when 125 crore Indians are standing with you then it becomes a great force and their self-confidence reflects.
Last time I had taken the topic of FIFA Under Seventin World Cup.
I came to know about it from all over the country and during this time I can see that the atmosphere of football is being created all over the country.
Many people are preparing their own unions by taking initiatives.
I have received several information about the Narendra Modi App.
It is possible that many of them would not be playing but I had a pleasant experience for sports in the hearts of thousands of youngsters in the country.
We are close to the relationship between Cricket and India, but I have seen how much interest in football
Everything should not be counted as victory and defeat.
With sportspersons, India should create its identity in the world.
I urge the countrymen to do something to create an environment of zeal for your partners associated with the sports sector.
New results have been coming from somewhere or the other since last eight-ten days.
I am not talking about the results of the election, I talk about those students who have studied and tested the year after year.
It is now clear that the results of the 10th-Baravi have started to come together and our daughter is singing the rituals.
It is a matter of joy.
We have to move forward with confidence.
But I have come to the forefront of a new kind of question and I never thought about it.
After reading this, I felt very tired.
He said that when I visited the house after getting 89. 33 percent of the market, I had thought that I would be appreciated from all sides, the rains of congratulations will take place.
But I feel like a bitch on my mind.
I have read your letters with pride, I feel that this pain can be of millions and millions of students like you.
Because the environment has become such a thing that the error has been discovered more than enjoying what has been found.
This is the second form of negative mood.
I would like to urge the people of the neighborhood and the parents to accept the results that your children will take.
Otherwise, there will be a day that you will get 100 of the qualities and even then someone will say that it is true that you have got 100 of the qualities but you have done a mute and you have become better.
Therefore, it is necessary for every thing to have a limit.
Santosh Giri Goswami of Jodhpur has also written this letter.
He says that the people close to him are not ready to accept their results.
They say that something else has been done well, something else has been done well.
I would like to tell you that in such a situation you will not let yourself be balanced.
Everybody expresses hope, listen.
Stay firm on our determinations and try to do something better.
But if you do not take satisfaction about what has been achieved then you will never be able to create a new architecture.
And that is why I would urge you to sing the singing of the success that has been achieved.
Those who do not get good qualities in the field of sports, goes ahead in the field of music, goes forward in the field of arts and goes forward in business.
God has given some skills to each other.
Just recognise your internal capabilities, focus on it, you will make progress in your life.
There was a time when Santur Vadya was an integral part of the folk music in the Kashmir Valley.
But Pandit Shivakumar, who handled this plaintiff and today he became an important phrase in the world music.
In the field of Sanai-India music, Sanai was limited to the suit.
During the period of kings and kings there was a place of sunrise at the entrance of the court .
However, Ustad Bisimilla Khan took this word and kept Sainai at this height of the best of the world.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I remember that the expenditure on medicines in the poor families of our country is going to bring the financial slaughter of that family.
And it is true that the cost of not getting sick is very less but after getting sick the health becomes like before but it is very much spent.
Why shouldn't we have our lifestyle like this that we don't have a disease, we don't have any financial burden on our families.
One is, keeping cleanliness is the most important way to stay away from the disease.
Who can do the biggest service of the poor is that cleanliness.
And secondly, the subject for which I constantly request is Yoga.
Some people are also called Yoga.
June 21 is the International Day of Yoga.
The whole world is an attraction of Yoga, admiration and the world has adopted it.
This is an invaluable visit to our ancestors, which we have given to the world.
The world suffering from stress gets the strength to live a balanced life through yoga.
It is easier for the people associated with Yoga to be healthy, balanced, creation of a strong will, concentration in every work.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just a programme.
And sometimes a collective environment can change the life of a person.
I hope you will do something about this on June 21.
The culture of the entire office changes and the environment also changes.
Can we use the day of June 21 for Yoga in our lives
Can we do yoga in our social life for this
I urge you not to stay behind.
It is very important for India to be healthy.
My dear countrymen, I am constantly associated with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Many days ago, I had given you a mobile number and you could listen to Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call on it.
But now it has been made easier.
Whenever we want to listen to the language by giving a missed call on this number.
Namaste.
We are determined to do many things during the period of holidays.
The program takes place and during these vacations the season takes place as a mango, it also feels that if a bit of ammunition is done in the afternoon then it will be barren.
But this time, due to the severe summer, this pleasure has been enjoyed.
It is natural to have an environment of care throughout the country.
And whenever there is a continuous duration in it then the water streams stop.
Sometimes due to hypertension, sometimes due to narrow roads and obstructions, waterfalls occurring due to obstructions, water storage is less than the capacity of the reservoirs.
And the water conservation capacity decreases for years.
Despite this, I have seen that the citizens also make a lot of efforts for this.
Awareness is seen in many villages and the true price of water is that which has faced the crisis of hydroelectricity.
And there is a sensitivity to save water and there is also an efficiency to do something about it.
Just a few days ago, I was told that the Hivere Bazar Gram Panchayat in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and the villagers have handled water in a very sensitive manner.
He decided not to finish such crops that take more water, yield or banana.
It feels very easy to hear but it feels that it is not easy.
How many people have resolved together
He also took initiatives in terms of Tushar Irrigation, Cyclone Irrigation, Water Resources, and so that the village is standing firmly to overcome the shortage of water.
I would like to tell you about this small village in Hivere Bazar but I would like to congratulate all those villages and those villages for their good work.
He built about twenty seventy-two farms.
As a result, the level of ground water has increased, the level of water has increased.
He said that when the crops need water, they got water and said that there was a lot of water.
The income from farming increased by 20 percent.
With the increase in water level, water quality improves.
But many such initiatives are being implemented by the citizens who never come forward.
If the government has taken a good mission then sometimes it gets fame, but if you look around you then you will see how people try to guide this problem through innovative measures to overcome the drought.
It is a human nature that whenever there are so many problems, if there is a good thing then the feeling of all the troubles is removed.
In the rainy season this year, it was likely to be 106 to 110 percent of the rainy season.
It is still time to get rains, but it will be a good rainfall.
Can we take a campaign from now on to save water in the village
The farmers need soil and it is useful for crops in the field.
And if we drive the village underground into the field then it will be beneficial for agriculture and the capacity to store water in the fields will increase.
There will be water in our wives.
Today, there is a crisis of water and the situation of drought, but the next month is in our hands.
The concerns about them are positive because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
A lot of money was spent for several governments and several schemes.
The Ganga gives us a blessing, the Ganga gives us employment, the Ganga gives us a new strength to live.
As the Ganga flows, it gives a new momentum to the economic developments of the country.
A Bhagirath brought us the Ganges but to save it, millions of Bhagiraths are needed today.
This campaign will never be successful without public participation.
Several efforts are being made at the government level.
Efforts are being made to collaborate with the states on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to participate in social and voluntary organisations.
Several steps have been taken to keep the flow of Ganga, to keep the surface of the Ganges clean and to prevent industrial pollution in the water of the Ganges.
In the utensils of the Ganges, in the canals everyday dense waste is flown in large quantities.
To clean this waste, work is done with the help of trash skimmer to clean the waste of water at places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna.
All local administrators have been asked to make it available and they should use it to clean garbage.
And recently, I was told that where these efforts are being made well, there are three tons to one tons of waste everyday.
That is, it is true that in such a large quantity, the dirt that is being produced has stopped from increasing.
In the coming days, there has been a plan to set up a trash skimer at some places and people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamune will be experienced soon.
To prevent industrial pollution, a work framework has been set up with paper industry, liquor manufacturing factories and sugar factories.
I still think that it will have a good results.
The elimination of drunken fluids falling from the paper factory is now on the way to close.
This is the symptom of we are taking steps in the right direction and awakening has also increased in a way.
And I have seen that if a person from the southern part of the Ganges meets me then he must say that Saheb, Ganga will not be cleaned.
This belief of the common man will achieve the success of the Ganga Cleanliness Mission.
Citizens are donating the work of cleaning the Ganga.
This work is going on in a better way.
My dear countrymen, today 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayat Raj Diwas in India.
This date was the beginning of the Panchayat Raj system in our country.
And gradually the Panchayat Raj system spread across the country is working successfully as an important component of our democratic governance system.
I am fortunate that on 14th April, I have got the opportunity to visit Mahu, the birthplace of Dr. Ambedkar.
I have got the opportunity to bow down to that sacred land and today on 24th, I will celebrate the Panchayat Raj Divas in the state of Jharkhand, where our tribal brothers and sisters live in large numbers.
And at 3 pm, he interacted with all Panchayats across the country.
This campaign has done a big job to create awareness.
How will the democratic institutions be empowered at the village level in every corner of India
How will the village be self-reliant
Foodgrain initiatives have been taken in some villages.
The awareness that has come from villages is that India-Udaya.
Indo-Uday's base village Uday is the same.
Therefore, if we focus on Gram Uday then we will not be able to achieve the desired results.
Shermila Gharpure from Mumbai called and expressed concern over her mind.
I am speaking from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpur.
I have a question about school and college education.
There has been a need for reforms in the education sector for the past several years.
Not getting available proper schools or colleges or lack of quality of education .
Even after completing education, they do not know many basic things, so that their children are left behind in the world.
What are your ideas about this
Today, every family has the biggest dream of mothers and daughters that is the education of children.
And I believe that the families of those families who are aware of this awareness are seen on the school.
Every government in our country has focused on education and every government has made efforts in its own way.
But more than the importance that is now expanded, it is to improve our education system.
We have done a very big task of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Now quality education from the Literacy Mission should be our priority.
Today, we have to pay attention to the calculated framework as a result.
The priorities were seen on how many children came to school.
We will have to focus on better education and proper education for those children who have come to school.
You must have seen this government's budget as well, an effort has been made to give good education.
In this budget, we will see that 10 Government Universities and 10 Private Universities have been told to come out of government control and come at a challenging, competitive level.
Do you want to work to become the best universities and best universities
This scheme has been launched with the aim of giving them complete freedom.
At the same time education is as important .
The citizens have been thinking about one issue since last few days.
He writes on the Web Portal MyGov, some of them write on my Narendra Modi App and most of them write the youth.
Honble Prime Minister Namaskar, I am speaking from Bijnor to Mona Karnwal.
The sports sector is also very important for the youth of today's age.
They should have a conservation, a good leader, so that they can develop inclusively.
I wish you to encourage more and more youth and the government should also encourage NCC, NSS and Bharat Scouts and Guides.
One day I came to my mind that before talking to you, you should talk to all these clutches.
And when I asked them when such a meeting was held earlier, they replied that this is the first such meeting since independence.
Therefore, I express my gratitude to the youngsters and young friends who have requested me for all these works.
A lot of work is being done at our own level, but if our organisations work in a collective form, then how big results can be achieved.
It is true that I myself was the cadet of NCC i. e.
I have got the benefit of this childhood and I also believe that there should be new consciousness in such organisations.
In this meeting, I put some issues in front of him.
Many things have been spoken to him.
How can many youth organisations bring innovations in their activities and programmes
If you write this on my Narendra Modi App, then I will go to the right place and I feel that after this meeting all these things will get a speed.
I think it will be myself and it will be ourselves to join with all these people.
My dear countrymen, I want to tell you one thing that you will take part in thinking.
I think this is a matter of awakening all of us.
You must have seen that the state of our country is such that how much gas cylinders will be given during the last several elections.
And every political party used to think that if you want to reach the middle class, then the gas cylinder is an important topic.
This is a common experience.
But it was never thought of going out of this chain.
Today, my countrymen, I am happy to share my views in front of you.
I chose a different path and that was the way to believe in the masses.
Sometimes we must have more faith in our people than that of political leaders.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
In our country, Grants are a right-wing equation.
I would especially urge all the political classes to say today that at least one thing should be done to keep faith in the people everywhere.
We will get the result that we have never thought.
We have to go to this direction.
And I always think that as I came to my mind, why should I take a child for third and fourth class jobs
Believe those who have been tested and have received qualities.
Sometimes I feel that you should declare that there is no ticket check on this one road of the railways.
It cannot be ruled by the government but it can also create an environment of faith.
And there are no political leaders who have created this environment, they have been prepared by one crore families of the country.
Every breaking neus on every newspaper and the news channel is painful.
Is there nothing better happening around us in this country with a population of 100-25 crore
Please change this situation.
Ravi ji has expressed his heartfelt sorrow but I think that this anger is not on me but on the situation of mischief.
You must be remembered, our former President Dr.
I have seen the attack that some television channels make a special time for positive news.
In today's times, a positive atmosphere is being created.
Everybody feels that a good news should be available to the people.
It is true that the greatest person, the best thing, the best things, the best words and the best ways will be spoken, the result is more than that of positive news.
It is true that if we focus more on goodness then we will not have a lot of place for bad things.
The darkness will be removed by Deep Petav.
And that is why you may be convinced that the government has started a website called Transforming India.
Not only the government but also the citizens are well-being.
And this is the portal on which you can send a good news of yourself.
You can contribute.
Raviji has given you good information, but please don't stay on me.
The Kumbh Mela is the speciality of our country.
Kumbh Mela can become the center of attraction for tourism .
Very few people of the world knew that for such a long time, millions of people come on the banks of the river.
Festival is celebrated in peaceful and peaceful environment .
In view of such events, in order to manage programmes, people are going to set up new parameters in terms of participation.
I have been watching the pictures of Kumbh for the last two days.
I believe that the tourism department of the Government of India should compete with the tourism department of the state government and urge people to take up the best pictures.
Not only should cleanliness be there but people who return from there will take the message of cleanliness.
I feel that the Kumbh Mela is a religious, spiritual fair but we can convert it into a social festival.
I am glad that in the same way, I am glad that this thing in your mind has added an unprecedented relationship to my mind.
I and you are always waiting for Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen a lot of letters, reactions, phones, there are many things, there are information, inspirations, everybody is doing something or the other, one feels a feeling and there is a lot in it that I have to include but there is a limit of time.
Yet, I would like to share yourselves with you once again in the midst of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have remembered that last time I had discussed some of the books of Premchand ji and you would have decided to share some of the books you read through the Narendra Modi App.
Some people have advised me to talk about some more books.
But I should acknowledge that I cannot give time to keep books in large quantities.
But it has been a benefit that I get the opportunity to know about the subjects of several books that you send.
But I feel that this is the last one month's experience that we have to take this initiative forward.
We have made a corner of books on the Narendra Modi App and when you read a new book, you will write there, discuss it and you will also be able to introduce a good name for the copper of these books.
And I feel that today the minds of Indians have been destroyed on the subject of water.
Several effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods.
Media has launched several innovative missions on water conservation.
Whether it is the government, the NGOs or the warfare are doing something or the other.
The rural people have worked to give a definite direction to a waterfall flowing from the mountains by working hard.
And that is also a pure indigenous system.
This has not only prevented soil dust and crop losses but also provide water to the fields.
You all will be happy to know that the beautiful state of the Northeast is Meghalaya, which is the first state in the country to formulate water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
Farming of such crops is being promoted and farmers do not have any losses in Haryana.
Several fairs are held on the occasion of festivals.
Do not use these fairs for water conservation
People from every section of the society go to the fairs.
In these fairs, we can give a very effective message of water conservation, showcase, drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama drama in a very simple way.
In fact, this month, World Children Winners Games were organised in Moscow.
This is a sports game in which the youngsters educated from cancer are those who have come out of their lives with cancer.
The competition was organised in the event, such as Nambaji, Intellectual, Cyclone, Running, Football and Table Tennis.
All these 10 winners of our country won medals in this competition.
Some of these sportspersons have won more than one medal.
Sanjiva Haripura of Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Mahendrakumar Dada of Kolkata, P.
A number of people from different parts of the country have written to me on Narendra Modi App and My Gov and urged me to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, the year 2019 has been very fond of India with the vision of space progress.
Our scientists had left ASAT space in March and thereafter Chandrayaan-2.
But there could not be much discussions on big and important events such as ASAT in the polls.
We have achieved the capability of launching a satellite at a distance of 300 kilometres in just three minutes with the help of ASAT missile.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve unsuccessful success and now on July 22, we will be proud of how the entire country has taken its steps from Chandrayaan-2 to Sriharikota.
The photographs of Chandrayaan-2 have filled the countrymen with respect and joy.
Chandrayaan-2, this mission is special in many ways.
Our understanding of Chandrayaan-2 will make it more clear.
This will give us more details about the moon but if you think that if I have learnt two big things from Chandrayaan-2, then I will say that these two things are Feth and Fearlessness.
We should believe in our talent and capabilities, we should believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to hear that Chandrayaan-2 is completely Indian.
He is an Indian in both heart and spirit.
The entire indigenous system is a mission.
When there was talk of innovative zeal and innovation in new areas then our scientists are the best and are of global standards.
The second important fact is that there is no need to be scared of any crisis.
It is unprecedented that the techniques that our scientists have left all the technological questions in the field of Chandrayaan-2 by doing the day of the night in record time.
The world has seen this great tale of scientists.
It should be a matter of pride for all of us and the time to reach Chandrayaan has not changed.
We have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but we have the ability to overcome it.
I am confident that the Chandrayaan-2 Mission will inspire the youth of the country to innovate science and innovation.
Finally, science is the path of development.
Now we are awaiting the duration of the month of September when lander-vikram and rover-technologies will land on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I invite the youth and the youth of the country to know about a very entertaining competition - a quiz competition.
I urge young friends and students to participate in this uiz Competition and make your participation more entertaining and memorable to the competition.
I specially urge schools, governors, enthusiastic headquarters and teachers to work hard to win their school.
The most thrilling thing is that the Government of India will take the maximum qualities of students from every State to Sriharikota, and in September, when they land on the surface of the Chandrayaan Moon, they will get the opportunity to witness the moment.
This will be a historic event for these victorious students, you will have to participate in the uiz Competition, you will have to achieve maximum qualities, you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have taken a look.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given momentum to the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time and has always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the journey that started five years ago has been introducing new standards of sanitation with the participation of many.
We have achieved an ideal situation in the field of sanitation, not just but the methods that have achieved the success of cleaning from open villages to public places are the strength of the resolve of one hundred and thirty crore people but we will not come here.
This campaign is now moving forward from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh is a military engineer and has returned to India to serve Mother India, leaving his job in America.
He took a long time ago to make Delhi not only clean but also beautiful.
He started with his team from garbage in Lodhi Garden.
Through Street Art, many parts of Delhi are decorated with beautiful paintings.
When he started showing his art from the walls of overbridge and school to the bedroom, the people also got the support and this silsila started in a way.
You must be remembered that during the Kumbh Mela, the paintings of the road used to be decorated to Prayagraj.
I realized that Yogesh Saini and his teams also played a very big role in it.
There is no sound of colors and silks, but the indradhanusha that is produced from them proves to be more effective than thousand words and we also experience it in the beauty of Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of making wealth from garbage in our society.
We have to move forward towards making gold from garbage.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting response on May Gov.
This was the reaction of Bhai Mahmod Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote, "Mann Ki Baat" programme is good to hear.
I am delighted to say that I played an active role in organizing the Bank to Village programme of Community Mobilization in my State in Jammu and Kashmir.
At the same time, there should be an online monitoring of the programme.
I believe that this was the first such programme in which people directly interacted with the government.
Bhai Mahmood Aslam ji sent this message to me and after reading it, my eagerness to know about the bank to Village Programme increased and when I had detailed information about it, I felt that the entire country should be aware of it.
This programme imagines how much the people of Kashmir are eager to connect with the mainstream of development.
Literacy, gender qualities, health, sanitation, water conservation, electricity, water, child education, issues related to senior citizens were discussed.
Friends, This programme was not just a government formality, but the officers returned to the village all day but this time the officers also conducted a camp in two days and Panchayats, so that they got the opportunity to stay in the village.
Under Khelo India, children were playing games.
Sports literature, Manrega's Job Card and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Certificates were also found there.
The people of Kashmir participated openly in this festival of development.
It is a matter of joy that in the remote areas such as Bank to Village programmes, the government officials had to go to the remote roads to reach where they had to climb the mountains sometimes for one and a half days.
The officers also visited the border panchayats, where there is a constant fear of bulletborne from across the borders, not only in Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts, but also in extremely sensitive areas.
Some officers were so heavy that they stayed in the village for more than two days.
It is very pleasant to have a large number of people participating in the villages and to make plans for you.
It is also clear that people are trying to create hatreds in the path of development, they are looking forward to doing hard work, they can never succeed in their own aims.
My dear countrymen, Honoured by Gyanpeeth Awards, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre has presented the month of Shravan in one of his poems.
In this poem, he said, Hodige Madiga is married, the land of drag is dragged. That is, the bonds of rain and water streams are drowned and the earth is drowned by their beauty.
In the whole of India, different cultures and speakers celebrate the month of Shravan with their own methods.
Whenever we look around in this season, it seems as if the earth has made a shawl of greenery.
Everywhere a new energy is transmitted.
In this sacred month many devotees visit Kavad Yatra and Amarnath Yatra, while some people fast regularly and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami.
During this period, the festival of Raksha Purnima, which is a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters, is also celebrated.
If the discussion of Shravan Month is going on, then you will be happy to hear that this time, the most emotional participants have participated in the Amarnath Yatra.
Since July 1, more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the sacred Amarnath cave.
More than the devotees who participated in this journey for 60 days in 2015, have participated in only 28 days.
I also appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
The people who come back from the journey are filled with the feelings of affection and affection of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I am also told that since the time the journey of Chardham has started this year in Uttarakhand, more than 8 lakh devotees have been visiting Kedarnath Dham in one and a half months.
For the first time, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there after the terrible disaster in 2013.
I urge all of you to visit the areas where you used to see natural beauty during monsoons.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country there is no greater teacher than tourism and pilgrimage.
I extend my best wishes to all of you to communicate new energy, new hopes and new hopes in this beautiful and comfortable month of Shravan.
Similarly, the month of August is reminded of the uit India Movement.
I wish you to make special preparations for 15th August and find a new way to celebrate this festival of independence.
When we look at TV, we see a single aspect of the rain-floor, accumulated water, accumulated water, accumulated water, accumulated water, accommodation, accommodation and accommodation of our farmers, accumulating birds, flowing waterfalls, a cluster of greenery, we will have to leave ourselves with family.
Rain, freshness and joy brings together both Freshness and Happyness.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat, wherever you want to stay, it feels very difficult to do but there is a limit of time.
I convey my best wishes to all of you in East.
My young friends, you are busy in the test.
Today, we will be often awaiting the co-operation between India and Australia.
India has fought against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
It is time to create a new revolution in this sports world.
And you see that there is a nutritious environment for football, hockey, tennis and junky as a cricket in India.
You might have seen that India is hosting the FIFA i. e. FIFA i. e. the World Football Competition in 2017 next year.
24 teams from all over the world are going to play in India.
On the other hand, I see that the attraction of football in the youth is increasing, be it EPL, Spanish Ling or Indian Superlig.
To know about these things, they take time to see them on television.
How will the competition of governance, academic institutions and social organisations be associated with sports
You see that all this has happened in the field of cricket.
But we have to create this environment for other sports as well.
This is a golden festival to identify India.
My dear students, you must have decided about tourism and tourism in these holidays.
And I came to know that the work that we have not gathered to our tourism department, our cultural department has not been possible, which the state governments have not been able to do and the government of India have not been able to do.
India is filled with diversity.
Perhaps there is no such district in India where I have not visited.
I specially congratulate Coal India.
And I am glad that nearly ten thousand people have visited the coal mines of Sawaner near Nagpur as a tourist.
Some efforts are being made by both tourists and tourist destinations.
All efforts are being made even though there is no scientific method.
Would you also pay special attention to this
I am sure my young friends will definitely help me in this work.
Production of abundant employment through tourism sector is possible.
India is far behind in comparison to the world in terms of tourism .
But if we decide to emphasize the tourism sector, then we can attract the world towards India.
The big part of the tourism sector worldwide can attract our country and provide employment opportunities to millions of youngsters of our country.
Whether it is governance or institution or society or citizen, we all have to work together.
Let us try to do this.
My young friends, the needles have come and I don't think that the same thing has happened.
If you are not able to swim then you will be able to learn to swim in these socks.
If there is no cycling in these sockets, you cannot drive a cycle in these sockets.
Even today while typing on computer I do with two fingers , why should I not learn to do clean typing
There are many skills for our personality development.
It will increase so much that after the school starts after the holidays, after the college starts, you will go back there and tell your friend that if I learned this in this holiday then you will say that if you don't learn anything.
My time has come and you have learned a new one.
Friends, this will be discussed mutually.
There have been several information on MyGov in Mann Ki Baat.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi, Namaskar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji.
In the last holidays of summer we had told that leopards also have a problem of heat , so keep water filled in a utensil on their balcony or glass for leafying .
I have done it like that and I am happy to say that this has made my friendship with the icons.
He called me and reminded me of a funny work.
I was remembered last time and I had said that during summers, keep the birds filled with water in the mud utensils outside you.
He told me that he did this throughout the year and had a friendship with many icons.
Mahadevi Varma, the great poet in the Hindi literature sector, loved birds very much.
He had written in his poetry, he would not let you go away, fill the courtyard with the donors and fill the hood with salt and sweet salt.
Let us also do this thing that Mahadeva ji had said.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to you for taking care of a very important issue.
Have you ever given them water during summers
I express my gratitude to the crafts and I am grateful to you and you have made a sensitive subject in a very simple manner.
Yes, this is the habit of India.
But I am grateful to you for seeing this thing by Barkai.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard a lot like Digital India-Digital India.
Some people think that Digital India is the world of the youth of the city.
But this is not the case.
You will be happy to hear that a Kisan Facility App has been prepared for your service.
If you download the Kisan Facility App in your mobile phones then you will be able to facilitate a lot of information about agriculture, climate etc.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I hope that this Kisan facility will be downloaded on their mobile phones.
My farmer brothers and sisters, summer is the time of holiday for others but summer is the time for farmers to sweat.
He waits for the rain.
The time before the open season of farming is very important for the farmers.
But our countrymen should also think that what will happen to us by water.
If the ponds, water flowing drains, the way for water coming in the ponds, where some waste has been stored or some waste has been stored then the water flow stops and as a result the water storage decreases gradually.
First of all, if the water was saved, the pond was filled, the river drain was filled, then even if it was not rained then it would be less damaged.
You must have seen this time, we have decided to produce 5 lakh farming.
Emphasis has been given to create water resources to store water through Manrega.
There will be so many such villages across the country, so many progressive farmers, so many aware citizens who have done this work.
However, there is a need to work even more today.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Today I will tell you one thing that the Government of India had recently organised a magnificent exhibition on agriculture.
I have seen how modern technologies have been cultivated.
But it is yet to reach the direct farm.
Now the farmers are also engaged in reducing the use of fertilizers.
This mantra should be followed by the use of scientific methods and bring forward our agricultural sector.
I hope that we will complete the work that is required for water conservation in one or two months of your hand.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
Victory on diabetes is a declaration of World Health Day of the year.
It is said that in 2014, the institution of diabetes patients in India was about 6. 5 crore.
3 percent of the death causes have been found to be diabetes .
The entire world is worried about diabetes, so on 7th April, on World Health Day, the concept of victory over diabetes has been demonstrated.
We all know that our lifestyle type 2 is the main cause of diabetes .
If you want yogasanas then do yogasanas.
Otherwise do the exercise of walking , running .
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
We sometimes feel hesitant to examine health related matters.
And it is reminded of the fact that diabetes has shivered our body a long time ago.
This means that this is a disease which can be tested quickly.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of work in this regard.
I would urge you to enhance tuberculosis or diabetes.
Therefore, I urge all of you to get rid of tuberculosis to overcome diabetes.
The birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, especially on 14th April.
His 150th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country.
A Panchtirth- his birthplace in Mahu.
In London where he took higher education, Nagpur where he took a look.
I am fortunate to visit Mahu at the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Babasaheb has given us a lot to be a good citizen.
We can pay tributes to him by following the path shown by him, by becoming a good citizen.
In the last few days, Vikram Sanvasra will start and new Vikram Sanvasar will come up.
They are celebrated in different states in different ways.
You can hear on your mobile phone.
We just want to give a missed call.
You make a missed call, do it according to your convenience.
If you want to hear the earlier programme of Mann Ki Baat then you can listen to it and hear it in your language.
I will be happy to be with you through this.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
How can the youth of India enhance their interest in sports
We should also participate in this.
He sent photographs of such places, Photo uploaded that he was really happy to see them.
If you want to see something, then you can first make the vision of seeing it.
He wanted to reach the place where no one has gone before.
Western Coal Fields Ltd. Sawaner, near Nagpur, has coal mines.
When people go to tourism then they buy something or the other and spend something .
He will spend more if he is a poor person then he will spend more.
I put an issue in front of you to think.
Would we collect a new art, a skill in these soils to achieve a new thing in our personality
Why not increase your strength
Do you like to paint but do not come
Hey, let's start, let's go.
Definitely use vacations for personality development, to learn new arts and to increase skills.
There are innumerable areas.
The architecture of Mysore, Kuke has put a sensitive issue in front of us.
If you ask them a question then they will answer them and tell you about it.
And if you use it once then see what is your use in it
And even then, if you want something then you should complain to me about it.
Let us save water in villages.
How can you save the drops of water in the coming rains
How will the water of the village be in the village
I welcome this idea.
We have sickened our landscape due to hypertension of fertilizers.
But if you use the best spices then will you want to eat the food
I don't like that food.
But today we have become careless about tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, you are listening to my Mann Ki Baat on the radio.
Your minds will now have the idea of testing.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I feel as much as you take care of your children's tests.
But if we change our vision to look at the test then we can become anxiety free.
I had told you in the backdrop of my Mann Ki Baat programme that your experience and your information should be sent to me on Narendra Modi App.
I am glad that the teachers, the students who have achieved great success in their lives and the interests of the society have written to me several things.
Today, I want to talk to my parents, students and teachers from the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Whatever I have heard, what I have read, what I have been told, I will tell you about it.
But I am confident that this 25-30 minutes interaction will certainly beneficial for those students who are going to face the examination.
My dear students, Friends, If I start talking to you, today's Mann Ki Baat, from a world famous Opener, what will they be useful when I reach the summits of success in life
Their experience will definitely be useful to you.
I know that the tests will start in a few days.
Some of you are under stress.
I have only one message.
Your parents will expect you, your teachers will keep you, other members of your family will keep your friends.
If you go anywhere then how is your preparation for all the thoughts
How much qualities will you get
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of hopes from me.
In the last 24 years, there were several difficult moments and many times there were good moments.
But the expectations of the people were always there and they were increasing and as the time was going ahead, they were expected to grow.
And for that I needed to find a solution.
Then I thought that I myself kept my hopes and myself decided my own goal.
My attention was focused on Chandu and then all the goals were achieved by you.
Friends, What was Tendulkar ji saying
Don't go under the weight of hopes.
You have to make your future.
Why do you spend your time in comparison to others
You will see that no one can stop you from going forward, and if you achieve more success than that of the earlier achievements, then you will not need to depend on others to enjoy and get satisfaction.
You will experience the self-confidence.
Friends, Exam is not a game of qualities and statistics.
Where did you go , how much did you get
Don't get stuck in this area.
It is known from these tests, whether our dynamics are correct, it is understood from these tests.
And that is why if your dreams are immense, then the test will be a festival of joy itself.
And that is why what will happen this year
Do not keep yourself limited at all .
Let us move ahead with a greater goal and even if you get less than expected success, you will not feel disappointed, you will get inspired to work with greater zeal and greater strength.
Thousands of citizens have written small issues from my power and their mobile phones.
In fact, throughout the year, 365 days should be favourable to our daily routine, to our dreams and concepts.
Mr. Prabhakar Reddie asked me to sleep on time and urge me to wake up early in the morning and expel the study.
Prabhakar Reddie says that there should be timely access to the testing center with entrance sheets and other necessary things.
I might not have done the courage to say that because I am not serious about sleeping.
And there is a complaint of many friends that I don't take enough sleep.
During the test, I would like to talk about sleeping for you to test in a state of stress-free situation.
Do not you do this
I am sure, I will not do it.
It is an important reason for the strengthening of the foundation of success.
Not only this, daily routine also worsens.
And therefore don't understand any thing small, crazy.
Please, look at it.
The negative impact of those who are under this stress falls on their results.
And on the strength of the study I have done, I will leave the question paper with any confidence and determination if any question paper comes.
Let us know from them the path of achieving success by giving a blanket to this test.
Namaskar, I am Vishwanathan Anand.
Let me start with your best wishes for testing.
I will now tell my experience about how I go to my examination.
I am aware of the fact that the tests are like the problems that are coming later in your presence.
You should rest properly, you should take a calm sleep at night, you should eat abdomen, you should not be hungry and the most important thing is that you should remain calm.
All this is like the left of the wisdom.
When you are playing, you don't know what kind of penalties are coming forward, you don't even know what kind of question is going on in the examination.
That is why if you are calm and you have eaten the stomach , you have got sleepy then you will know that your brain remembers the right answer at the right time .
So it's quiet.
Do not give much stress to yourself , do not keep very expectation .
This is important, look at this as a challenge - what I have taught me in a year can I solve this question
Recall the most important thing at the last moment, remember what you don't remember, when you are examining, you will probably remember something with teachers or students and this will help you to remember a lot about that subject.
If you quench the questions that you seem to be difficult then you will remember that they are new questions for you and then when you examine it then you will be able to quit it better.
So stay calm and take good sleep at night, do not show very confidence but do not stay disappointed at the same time.
I have always seen that this test is better than you were afraid.
And while sporting international intelligence, you must have seen them how they sit firmly.
It is true that it is difficult to say that but it should be tried.
You don't talk to friends, goes alone, stays like a comezon gallery, if you keep snatching the book till the last moment then your mind will not remain calm.
If the water is calm then things can be seen very deep but if the surface of water gets melted then nothing can be seen below .
At that time it feels the inner tension.
Then I think it would be better if you take some rest.
For this, I have developed a mechanism myself.
I breathe deeply, breathe deeply, three times, five times deeply.
It takes 30 seconds, 40 seconds or 50 seconds for all this, but after this my mind becomes calm and my mind is ready to understand the subject.
It is also possible that my experience will also be useful to you.
Rajat Agrawal has said a good thing.
Whatever my power writes, at least half a day, we should spend our time with our friends and our families in joy.
And what do you do
Friends, do not do this.
If you have ever visited any place with your mother-in-law then remember that moment, get out of the study, test and give it for at least half an hour.
It is a matter of understanding that Rajat ji had said.
Friends, What will I tell you about Shanti
Today, before you are given a test, a person has sent a message to you that is basically a teacher and has become an essay teacher today.
He is trying to communicate the epics of Ramcharit Manas by connecting this great scripture with the present times.
The priest Murari Bapu has described the students as a club.
Friends, Today I want to tell you another thing.
G.
But one thing is certain, be it a student, it is as if Yoga is a gurukilli in the journey of development of intuition in life.
Take care of this.
I have full faith in it.
My young friends, you have a lot of time to go to the examination center, do you feel that you should go and sit on your back
Otherwise stress arises in the mind .
If you understand the information then you will not have time to regret it.
I have also seen that this question paper has changed the form of question paper.
Rao has underlined the issue of patience in his message.
Even in the Minimum Words, the beautiful message of Kamali has been sent by Rav Saheb.
R.
Rao speaks.
I am fully aware that there is restlessness due to competitive examinations.
Don't care.
I tell all my young friends this is the best of you.
But at the same time, keep in mind that there are many other opportunities available in this country.
Deciding what you want to do in your life and do not leave it, you will succeed.
Don't forget that you are the lakes of this world, like trees and mountains, you have the right to stay here.
You need that of selflessness, dedication and dedication.
With these qualities, you will succeed in all the tests and other efforts.
I convey my best wishes to you for what you want to do.
Many blessings.
In the past, how is a scientific method of telling the issue
It takes half an hour to say that he tells me in three minutes.
This is the power of science and this is the power of scientific mind.
I am very grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring children across the country.
He spoke of dedication, determination, diligence.
Friends standing steadfast.
If you stand firmly then you will also be afraid of fear.
And the golden future will wait for you to be accomplished by your hands.
Ruchika Dabus has sent a message to me.
And this is true, the secretariat also said that positive vision and positive conditions of mind are created by this, positive energy.
Do not think that inspiring students only get inspiration.
At any moment of life, on any turn of life, on the best liberalization, the truth inspires us too, gives us a lot of inspiration, and at the time of crisis, a new path can be achieved.
We read in the course of learning about Thomas Alva Adison, the Janak of Power Divya.
But Friends, Have you ever thought about how many years they had spent for this discovery
Even though he did not take any special education on the subject of mathematics, he stressed on various fields such as mathematical classification, statistics.
K.
Rolling himself had said that this power was important for him.
In todays times, the test is not only of the students but of all the families, schools and teachers.
Vijay Jindal has said that the parents should not bear the burden of their expectations.
And when we see this, we are not just absorbed, but also absorb the hands of those people.
We want to make progress at the rapid pace of science.
This is the reason why today is the National Science Day.
He became the standard of the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
And in his memory, on 28th February, we celebrate as National Science Day throughout the country.
Curiosity is the people of science.
Every generation has to pay attention to scientific thoughts in every mind, every one of the attractions of science, every generation has to pay attention to new research.
New research is not possible without the participation of science and technology.
Today, on the occasion of National Science Day, new innovations should be encouraged across the country.
I am Sir C.
Friends, Sometimes it takes a lot of time to achieve success and when success is achieved then its vision of looking at the world also changes.
You must have heard that in the last few days there has been a big and important discovery in the science world.
Scientists from all over the world have worked hard, many generations have come and they have spent some time.
This discovery envisaged theory of the great scientist Instein of the last century, not only this, but also a great discovery in the field of physics.
It is a matter of fact that all humanity will benefit the entire world.
We are very proud to be an Indian that our sons and skilled scientists of our country shared in the process of exploration.
Our scientists will make efforts to further pursue this new discovery in the coming days.
India will be a part of international efforts.
And my countrymen, a significant decision has been taken in this regard recently.
The Government has decided to set up Laser Interfameter Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) in India to achieve the next foundation of this research.
There are two such centres in the world and the third will be in India.
Indias participation will give a new strength to this process.
India will be actively participating in this great scientific discovery of human welfare on the thrust of limited resources.
My dear countrymen, I would like to tell you one number.
You will be able to hear Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow by giving a missed call on this number.
You can also hear in your mother tongue.
81908 81908 is the number to give Missed Collection.
Friends, Your tests are going on and I also want to visit tomorrow.
125 crore Indians are going to take my test.
Bus, I was tested tomorrow that the Parva will start you.
And when all of you succeed, the country will succeed.
Friends, then many good wishes to you.
Being free from the stress of success and misery, go ahead with a free mind.
In the last consignment Mann Ki Baat, I have spoken two things.
Recently, we have celebrated Christmas and now we have started preparing for a new year.
India has been eradicated with diversity.
Festivals are relevant.
Sometimes it feels that India is a country where the economy is based on festivals.
What is the greater joy of the world be it terrorism, global temperature rise, natural crisis or human-built, all humanity, peace and peace
You know that I utilize technologies a lot and I get immense information about various subjects.
I always see the portal MyGov.
People go to different places to celebrate Christmas holidays.
Tourists will get all the facilities in the tourism sector but Savelishwarkar says that where there are tourist spots, dharamshalas, religious places, there are special attention to cleanliness.
And in the same way, we say that the guests come to our houses and we clean the house and decorate the house.
Therefore, we should take special care of our tourist destinations, religious destinations.
Dipassingh Malviya lives in Bhojpura village in Sihore district of Madhya Pradesh at an age.
I felt that it came to my reading and could reach you.
Deep Singh Malviya, who lives in a small village, decided that if someone provides toilets in the village then he will not be able to work for construction, he will make toilets free.
Assuming that the construction of toilets is a sacred work, Deep Singh built 100 toilets in Bhojpura village.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Deep Singh Malviya.
This country is progressing rapidly due to the hard work of many people.
When every Indian knows that all the people have been attracted to Yoga, and the entire world celebrated International Yoga Day and the entire world is connected then our hearts believe that this is our Hindusthan.
This belief, this feeling is created in our minds when we have a vision of a vibrant form.
The subject of cleanliness is now being discussed in a way in the households.
The participation of the citizens increases in them.
It is a great advantage that the government employees who are working to provide electricity to the villages will get satisfaction, the work of changing the lives of a village will be enjoyed by the media that they are taking care of them, whether it is the farmers or the poor or the women or the youth.
If you don't want to reach this thing, then it is their right to get it and that they should not lose it.
All of us should try to reach the right things, good things and the useful things of the common man.
Doing this is a service in a way.
I have made a small effort on my side.
I cannot do all this alone, but when I say, I should do anything.
We have to reach 1. 25 billion Indians.
How can I reach without your help
In the language of the common man, we can reach them and inspire them to get their rights.
My young friends, on 15th August, I had a primarily discussion on the theme Start-up India Stand-up India.
After that, the work started in every account of the government, every department.
Can India become the world capital in start-ups
In a new way, start-ups will be an excellent opportunity for the youth of our states, be it the manufacturing sector, the service sector, the farming sector.
There is a need for new ideas, new experiments, new innovations, and the world will not move forward.
Start-up India, Stand-up India scheme is a big opportunity for our youth.
My young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India will present the entire work plan of Start-up India Stand-up India.
But it is not at all, we have to change it as the requirements of India.
Our young friend hopes that a poor person is falsified, embarrassing or embarrassing the hard work of this person.
I urge the State Governments to take initiatives in this regard.
On 16th January, I will interact with you in detail.
I will always welcome your information.
Dear young friends, 12th January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Like me, millions of people of this country have inspired Swami Vivekananda.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as the National Youth Festival from 12th January, 1995.
This year, the event will be held in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
I know that this year's theme is the Indian Youth of Development, Skill and Hormone.
In his school, Excellency India Day, Ease of Doing Broadcasting India Day, he expressed his feelings from the telephone.
When Yoga comes to meet those people who work in the society then many thoughts come in mind.
Now it is true that every word has such a different importance.
This year, the Government of India had launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, but I would not be able to attend the programme of Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially due to Mahapur in Chennai.
But I was thinking about going to that programme.
I felt that in our country we should use the name Divyang instead of this word of disabled persons.
These are those people with whom there are only or more parts that have divineity, the transmission of Divya Shakti, which are not like us.
I liked this word very much.
The people of my country will now propagate the word "Divyangjan" instead of "Divyangjan"
I hope that we will take this idea forward.
We have started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan on that day.
Implementation of the necessary infrastructure reforms directly and indirectly and facilitate access to the people of Divyangjan.
There are ramps at schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, railway stations, ease parking, accessible ventures, brailleps and many things.
They like this.
You should also join it in your own way.
My dear countrymen, the government schemes continue to come and continue but this scheme is not just artificial but also an awareness.
We have to reach the last component in a better way.
They should not breathe in files .
The Government of India has made a few days ago to provide the benefits of the scheme to the common man, to the poor and the needy.
Grants are given to the gas cylinders in our country.
This amount is worth crores of rupees but we did not have the system to ensure that it has not reached the beneficiaries in time.
The government has changed it a bit.
The worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme (DBT) has been implemented with the help of Jan Dhan Bank Accounts and Aadhaar Cards and the amount of subsidy has been deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
I would like to express my pride to you that this initiative has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest and successful Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme in the world.
The scheme is known as Pahal.
Nearly 15 crore LPG holders have become beneficiaries of Pahal scheme till the end of November.
This subsidy has been directly deposited in the bank accounts of 15 crore people.
There is no need for any of the recommendations, no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, opening of Aadhaar cards on the other, opening of Jan Dhan accounts on the other and preparing the list of beneficiaries of the State Government and the Central Government together, connecting them with Aadhaar numbers and accounts numbers.
A few days ago, Manrega, which provides employment opportunities in the village.
There were many complaints about this.
I am sure that about 35 to 40 schemes are now being included under the Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a golden moment of Indian Republic Day.
The centenary of the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar is the silver festival.
In the Parliament, a special discussion was held on the Constitution for two days and it was done very well.
We should continue this initiative with all the parties to discuss the importance of destruction, the importance of destruction, the original destination.
Can you do the work of connecting people with power and power with the people on the occasion of Republic Day
The Constitution has given us a lot of rights. It should always be discussed and it should be done.
It is our sacred duties to vote on the walls, which are written on the walls.
Why doesn't it happen in the lives of every day as our duties are discussed during the vote
While celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, on 26th January, what is happening to organise essay competition, poetry competition and poetry competition in schools, colleges, villages and societies in the city
If 125 crore Indians have taken one step after a duty, then a big history can be achieved.
I want to know your ideas.
Please send your article on my portal MyGov.
I want to know what the youth think about the duties of my country.
And I don't speak this at the government level.
We build the statues of the great men with great devotion, but then we are indifferent to take care of them.
On the other hand, the preparations for the basket will also be started.
Festivals have a special significance in society.
Sometimes these festivals are sorrowful and sometimes new.
But sometimes during these festivals if there is a crisis then it is very painful .
Natural calamities are continuously coming from every corner of the world.
There are reports of natural calamities that we have never heard or did not think.
We are now feeling how fast the impact of climate change is happening.
In the last few days in our country, the manner in which there is heavy rainfall and the way it has been damaged in Tamil Nadu and other states have also been affected.
Many people died.
I have condoled the sadness of all those families who have been suffering from this crisis.
The State Governments are working with full strength to provide relief and rescue.
The central government also always works with shoulders.
At present, a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I am confident that even after this crisis over Tamil Nadu, he will once again start moving forward with confidence and the role he has in the development of the country will be overcome.
But when we see the crisis all around, we need to make many changes in it.
15 years ago, natural calamities were part of the Agriculture Department as natural calamities were confined to this place.
Today, the form of this is changing.
It is necessary to increase our capabilities at every level.
For this, the government, the society, the citizens, all the small institutions will have to work with the point of view of science.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I interacted with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and suggested that we should jointly study a joint study for the preparation of the SAARC countries to combat disasters.
I am glad that the workshop on Sark Countries and Excellent Measures was held in Delhi.
It's a good beginning.
I was telephone from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
I am speaking from Jalandhar district of Punjab, Lakhwinder Singh.
We cultivate organic farming here and also guide many people about this farming.
I am a question that those people who set fire to porridge or cow plants in the field do not remember how bacteria in the land can guide them and how to get rid of pollution in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab
I am very happy to hear your questions.
First of all, because you are organic farming farmers and you are not only doing organic farming yourself but also the problems of the farmers are well known.
Your concern is going on but it is not just happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of people from all over India and in the traditional way we burn the remains of crops in such a way.
But the pain that you have expressed is the right thing.
The first measure on this is that we should train our farmer brothers and sisters in this regard and tell them the truth about the fact that if the remains of the crops are burnt then the time and hard work will be ready for the next crops.
But this is not true.
We destroy it but if we make these ruins small pieces then it will be a dry fodder for animals.
Secondly, after burning it, the upper level of the earth burns.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for a while, think that our bones should be strong, our heart should be strong, our kidneys should be good, everything should be good but if the skin of the body burns then what will happen
We can not live even if the heart is alright .
The way the skin of our body burns then it is difficult to stay alive in the same way the skin of the mother damp does not just burn on the skin of the crops but also burns the skin of the mother .
Animals will be used as a fodder, not only save their land but also if they put the fertilizer produced in the same land then it will benefit twice.
The water in those skins is sufficient for that crop and even today their skins have become valuable.
They are now getting income from these knees.
Earlier, those knees that had to be spent for cleaning have also become a means of income and demand is increasing.
Dear countrymen, the upcoming 3rd December will be celebrated as International Disabilities Day throughout the world.
27th November was celebrated as "Indian Organ Dan Day".
Film actor Ravina Tandon and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.
Organ donation can save many valuable life .
Angan donation gives immortality in a way .
When an organ from one body goes to the other body then that organ gets a new life but that person also gets a new life .
What can be the best of this
A National Registration on Patients, Organ Dents, Organ Transplants has been launched on 27th November.
I am confident that this area will also be widely awakened and in the true sense the needy will get the best help because this help cannot be achieved until any organ doesn't donate.
As I said earlier, December 3 is celebrated as Disabilities Day.
Physical and mentally handicapped persons are also adventurous and capable .
When such persons are neglected, they are suffering.
Sometimes a vision is shown on them.
But if we change our vision of seeing them then we will know that these people can inspire us to live their lives.
You can inspire to do something.
If there is a small crisis on us then we are crying.
And then we can see that the crisis over me is very small.
How would they live their lives
How do you do work
And that is why all these are inspirations for you.
It is a power to overcome their resolve, their way of living and the crisis.
Javed Ahmed, I would like to tell them today that it is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, Javed Ahmed was shot by terrorists in Kashmir.
A part of stomach and intestine also lost .
There was also a serious injury to Mankaya.
He lost his strength to stand on his feet, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped persons
In public places, how can the disabled be facilitated in the government office
They are working on these things.
Whether Javed's life is not enough to be inspiring in every corner of the country
I recall Javed Ahmed's life work, his dedication and dedication on 3rd December.
I am not only referring to Javed because of less time but in every corner of the country, many such inspirations are brightening.
They are giving new light to live a life, showing new paths.
Be it the middle class, the marginalized middle class, the poor, the Dalit, the disadvantaged, the disadvantaged, the government and the government system continue to have a constant relationship with the government and the citizens and the ethos of a citizen sometimes have a bad experience of some government employees and it changes their vision of looking at the government system throughout the life.
It is also true but lakhs of people in this government do such good work in service and dedication which never looks at us.
Last year, both Bill Gates and Milinda Gates were jointly addressed.
They do a lot of social work in India.
Whatever he has earned after his pension and his entire life, he is spending on working for the poor.
When they come to India, they appreciate the aspirations of the workers who have got the opportunity to work with them and say that how dedicated and hardly these hope workers are.
He tells them how much enthusiasm they have to learn innovations.
A few days ago, the Government of Odisha specially honoured the Independence Day of ASHA worker.
And a hope worker from this village, Jamuna Mani Singh decided that I will not let anyone in Tedagaon die due to malaria.
Going to every household and knowing that there is a little fever.
There will be many more such Jumna Mani.
There will be millions of people who will be around us.
We see them with a bit of respect.
Such people become the power of our country.
How do we become a big partner of the happiness and grief of the society
I salute all these ASHA workers through 'Jamuna Mani'.
My dear young friends, especially for the younger generation, who are active on internet and social media.
Not only this, they also show to others, they can live and it can happen that we will have to add something to it.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
I invite you to participate in the formation of this nation.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is worried about climate change.
Climate change, global temperature hike is also being discussed, care is also there and it has been approved in the form of a standard before doing everything.
The temperature of the earth should not increase anymore .
It is the responsibility and care of everyone.
And the first way to prevent temperature rise is energy savings.
The National Energy Savings Day is December 14.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
I had once said that on the night of Purnima, the lamps of the road should be closed and darkened and stayed in the light of the moon for hours.
The light of that moon should be experienced.
On seeing a woman named Noorjahan in Kanpur it seems that she did not get the opportunity to get a lot of education .
But he is doing such a thing that no one might have thought about it.
It is using solar energy to enhance the lives of the poor.
He is fighting with darkness and shouting his novels.
He has set up a committee of women and started a plant of solar powered solar power and paid Rs 100 per month.
So how are the entrepreneurs like us being helped
Industry, Income, Empowerment.
In fact, the speed at which I have to go is yet to come.
But the beginning has improved.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
And I am happy to note that there are 24 lakh women out of 66 lakhs and there are Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other Backward Classes who are striving hard to walk on their feet with respect to their families.
Abhishek has himself spoken of his enthusiasm.
I also have a lot of news.
Somebody has just told me that there is someone in Mumbai as a Shailesh Bhosle.
I had said during my Swachhta Abhiyan that the Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new entrepreneurs and showcase them by doing it.
And I am told that in such a short span of time they have returned Rs. 2 lakhs to the bank.
He is working to make balls.
All our banks should be more sensitive and they should help the poor more.
In fact, these people run the economy of the country.
The people of small industries are the economic powers of the country.
We want to further strengthen it.
But we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, I had discussed Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
These are the things that should maintain consistent awareness in social life.
The National Awakening Vyam (NAV) is the award of freedom.
How should the programme be the framework
I had told you about sending such information.
I was told that there was a lot of information.
But I am expecting more information.
I expect a very special scheme.
There can be many such things.
I am confident that your information will definitely be useful.
But I would urge you to exercise.
In order to keep the body healthy , use some time of this excellent season for exercise .
Then there is a shadow season, then make the habits of shadows skinned.
Congratulations to my countrymen again.
Once again I meet you with Mann Ki Baat.
The 5th one-day Cricket between India-South Africa is being played.
The name of this Cricket Malike is Gandhi-Mandela Series.
Both sides have won each of them two-two combinations and therefore, the importance of final combination has increased.
My best wishes to all sportspersons.
Today, I would like to convey my best wishes to the friends of Kannur Akashwani.
I would like to convey my best wishes that whenever I started Mann Ki Baat, many people visited it, the 12th students of Kerala also joined the Shraddha Thamban.
I once again want to talk about Kerala.
The students of St. Mary Upper Primary School of Kochia Chittor in Kerala have sent me a letter.
Initially, I did not understand why these children made me a map of India by the thumbs.
When I read his letters, I realized that he had given a big symbolic message.
So that the organ donation becomes a spirit and tendency.
Those girls have written a letter and wrote to me that in your Mann Ki Baat programme, challenge people about organ donations.
The 80-year-old Basantarao Sudke Guru ji of Maharashtra has started a continuous movement.
He says that organ donation should be a festival.
A lot of messages come to me from the phone too.
Devesh in Delhi has given me a message.
I think this is very important.
More than 1. 5 lakh people need kidneys, hearts and liver every year in our country.
But in our country with 125 crore population only five thousand transplants i.e. the surgery of organ transplants is done .
Every year one lakh eyes are needed but only 25,000 people get eyes.
When four eye lashes are needed then we can only give one eye.
Efforts have been made to guide the states.
Some states have worked well to speed up the efforts of organ donation by reducing the paperwork.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the top of the organ donation.
A very social institution, a lot of NGOs have given a different direction by doing a good job.
National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTO) has been set up to give importance to organ transplant.
It is the best that the joy of liberating Ten Taken Bhujitha.
Last month, we all had seen on TV that Delhi's G.
A life was saved.
Dear countrymen, now we have celebrated Navratri and Vijaya Dashmi.
We will celebrate Diwali after a few days.
Celebrated Eid, celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi.
But we will be proud of one more festival among these people, so that the country will be proud of it.
The India-Africa Foren Summit is scheduled to be held in New Delhi from 26-29 October 2019.
Such a big event will be held in India for the first time.
54 African countries and UN leaders have been invited.
The population of India is as much as the population of Africans.
If both the populations are together then it will be one third of the world's population.
And it is said that the landscape of both the countries was together millions of years ago.
Later, it was divided into two parts due to the Indian Ocean.
And let us see that we are trying to meet the people and come together.
On this occasion, the Government of India has made a big programme by the HRD Minister.
An essay competition has been taken in the schools of the Affiliated Schools of CBSE and the programme of writing poems has been made to increase their participation.
Approximately 1600 schools participated.
It included outside schools of India and India and thousands of schoolchildren had written about the desire to strengthen India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace from Porbandar to the Memorial of Mahatma, which is a mobile exhibition, is roaming from Porbandar to Northern State to Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of schoolchildren have seen this exhibition and people from villages also saw this exhibition.
They knew how great Mahatma Gandhi played in the relations between Africa and India, the impact of the personality of Mahatma Gandhi was on these two landscapes.
Well, I see that India-Africa is a summit but it is an opportunity to connect people.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the children of Garimala and the Ministry of HRD over 1600 schools.
I had made a proposal in the context of Adarsh Gram Yojana on August 15 last year.
Last month, a workshop was held in Bhopal where the ideal village is being organised, the artists there, some Parliamentarians there, the Government of India and all the States together discussed the ideal Gram Yojana.
How new things have been remembered, some enthusiastic things have been reminded of.
He has selected the Parsi Gram Panchayats in Kunti district of Jharkhand for an ideal village.
The successful attempt to make public awareness with infrastructure and systems in the Adarsh Village was made in this Parsi village of Jharkhand.
I congratulate the Honourable Parliamentarian Shri Yut Karya Mundanji.
I got a report from Andhra.
The Parliamentarian of Andhra, Ashok Gajapati Raju ji, had a lot of consumption in the Adarsh Gram Yojana and he chose Dwarapudi Gram Panchayat as an ideal village in Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
Nearly 550 adult inspectors were taught by those children and witnessed them.
See, there is no budget in the society, no circular, no special system but how many changes are brought about due to the will power, it is being seen by the Gram Panchayat.
Our respected Parliamentarian Shriyut C.
L. Ruwala, this is the Parliament of Mizoram.
He has chosen Khwalahilang village as an ideal village.
This village is very famous for production of sugarcane and jaggery.
How to make the village a centre of economic perspective, how to market the production of the village.
Ruwala ji, who is trying to make a self-reliant village along with the ideal village, is congratulations.
My dear brothers and sisters, is Mann Ki Baat and will never be such a thing about cleanliness
My dear countrymen, I would like to recall you that the media had launched a special drive on the occasion of Diwali last year, where the cracks had fallen after Diwali were shown to the people from channels.
Before the festival, we are worried about the accidents that are not happening but we should do it even after the festival.
And for this, I specially want to congratulate the media world of India.
On October 2, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I have joined the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan by India Today Group to participate in the Swachhta Sammelan.
I was looking at what kind of efforts are being made by him in giving clean India awards.
How people are working like One Life, One Mission for this.
How many places are there in our country which have been kept so clean.
Since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan started, I have seen that Andhra Telangana's e-Nadu and especially Shriyut Ramuji Rao are very old but their enthusiasm is not less than the youth.
He has connected 51 lakh children in about 55-56 schools to Andhra and Telangana.
Whether it is public places, stations, religious places, parks, many places have been campaigning for cleanliness.
Now this news shows the strength to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat itself.
ABP News started the programme called Bharat Desh Hai Mera and made people aware of cleanliness and trained the countrymen.
NDTV will create a Clean India campaign.
In Meghalaya, where our Governor Shri Yut Shanmukh Nathan wrote a letter to me, he mentioned the village Mavallayanong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last few years, this village has taken a pledge of cleanliness.
It is said that almost every generation is dedicated to this sanitation that a few years ago he had received the Cleanest Village Award in Asia.
This is important, we all have to believe that our country will be clean and it will be done by the efforts of the countrymen, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to say 100 crore Indians with pride.
My dear countrymen, I had said this on 15th August from the Red Fort, there are some things where corruption has been stolen and housed.
We are listening to all these reports and that is why I was thinking about what is the need of an Interview for small jobs.
I have never heard that this world is such a psychological psychologist who can fully recognize a person in one or two minutes.
And with this idea, I had announced that we will stop the seizure of childhood for this small job.
My dear young friends, I would like to express my pride today that the government has completed all these processes and the posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government will no longer be filed on time.
This Rule will be enforced from 1st January, 2016 and where the recruitment process is in progress, we will not be able to spend but it will be implemented from 1st January, 2016.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
I had announced an important scheme in the previous budget.
Gold has become an important part of social life in our country.
Golden power can become, gold can become economic power.
And every Indian must contribute to it.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the Gold Bank and the bank will give you interest in the same way as you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier we had to keep gold locker and also pay the rent of the locker .
Now keep it in the Gold Bank and the bank will give you interest.
Now the countrymen, cannot become gold wealth
The second thing is that this bond is a paper in Sovergin Goldband, but the value of that paper is gold.
On the day when you return this paper, on the day of return, you will get the same money as the price of gold.
I am happy to say that we are bringing gold quins.
The Gold uin, which brought the Ashok Chakra, was nearly 70 years after independence, but till date we have been using the Foren Gold uin.
Gold billion bonds are also used abroad.
We will also provide it to the common man before Dhanteras in the coming weeks and we are starting a golden coin of five grams and 10 grams of Ashok Chakra.
Along with this the gold coins of 20 grams will be available for the people .
I am confident that new schemes will bring about new changes in the direction of economic development.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Iron Man Vallabhbhai Patel.
Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel recalled that Indias map comes out.
This great man has contributed a lot in the unity of India.
India is full of diversity.
It is our beauty and beauty that many creeds, many sects, many quotes, varieties and varieties are filled with the country.
If there is no diversity then we could not be proud of the beauty and beauty of this beauty.
Therefore, the mantra of unity is the mantra of diversity.
Peace, goodwill, unity is the real root of development.
In the last few years, on 31st October, the RAN-For-Unity programmes are being held across the country.
Ekta ki daud is also a synonym of development.
Give tribute to Sardar Saheb.
Let us take the mantra of unity forward.
Brothers and sisters, Now you have been preparing for Diwali and cleanliness will be done in the house.
You are buying new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different forms in our country.
I convey my best wishes to you for the Pawan Parv of Diwali.
Due to bursting of bursting fires arise , due to cracks there is a lot of damage to children .
I would like to tell every parents to enjoy Diwali but do not let the accident happen, there is no harm to the child of our family and you have to think about it and clean it.
My dear countrymen, I will be visiting Britain on the second day of Diwali.
The Government of India and the State Government of India will provide scholarships to the children of those sections of the society, whether it is tribal or backward.
I am confident that when our children will be taught in Britain, Babasaheb's place will be an inspirational place, I say that Babasaheb has given this message to the country for a few years.
You can imagine how happy the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar is being added to the wealth of 125 crore people like me.
I will get another opportunity in London and will unveil the statue of Lord Vishwaswara.
Many years ago, the world needs to study the work done by Lord Vishwaswara for democracy and for the Empire of Women.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Vishwaeshwar on the land of London is an excellent example of how many years ago the great men of India are thinking of vision and vision.
My dear countrymen, you were associated with Mann Ki Baat.
He was interacting with the officials of the Government.
Some people write their problems and try to solve problems.
We should learn many languages in a country like India.
I got the opportunity to learn some languages, but how can I learn so many languages
But I am grateful to the Akashwani that this Mann Ki Baat is spreading in his regional language in every state at 8 pm.
Congratulations to my dear countrymen again.
Jai Hind.
On 3rd October, I will get the privilege of saying Mann Ki Baat for the first time.
Democracy has a great significance.
I have a basic idea in my life and that is why I have a lot of faith in the peoples power.
But I can say that what I have learned from Mann Ki Baat, what I have experienced, that the people's power is immense.
Our ancestors used to say that Jannadan is a part of God.
I can tell the experience of Mann Ki Baat that there is a great strength in the thoughts of our ancestors because I have experienced this thing.
I would like to ask for information from the people for Mann Ki Baat and I would like to see only two or four information.
But in the number of lakhs people were active and sent information.
This is a great strength.
When people were looking at it, they also felt that the feeling of apathy and apathy of girls will change.
It was a silent revolution.
Keeping in front of the tourism team in India, I will tell the citizens, Incredible India, Incredible India, you have taken tourism on the gallery.
People from every part of India sent photographs in the number of lakhs.
The tourism departments of the Government of India or the State Government have never felt that we have such a rich heritage.
All the things have come on one platform and the government has not spent one rupee in it.
It was people who made it all.
Today, I can say with joy and satisfaction that the sale of Khadi has doubled in the last one year.
I used to say that while speaking in the Mann Ki Baat, I would have seen the paintings of the poor, the children are crying and their poor mothers.
Do they not get gas cylinders
If the government works in the hands of this society then the government can work as a catalyst for social transformation.
Every small thing considered itself as a small issue and tried to connect itself to the nation.
What can be a greater joy than this
I would like to make a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
He urged the citizens of the country to get your questions, your information, your proposals from the phone to me.
I will pay attention to it in Mann Ki Baat.
I am glad that more than 55,000 telephones have come from across the country, be it Sicily, Kutch, Kamrup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There is no such region in India from where citizens did not telephone.
It is a kind of pleasant experience.
The people of all the age groups expressed their views and thoughts.
Some of them have heard myself, I feel like my team works on proposals on the rest of the issues.
You might have taken one-two minutes to telephone, but for me, the delivery, ideas and issues that have been received from it are important.
The entire government will definitely work on this.
I am aware of the importance of radio for such blind persons.
I am looking at a new vision and many of his good things, good issues and issues are sufficient to be sensitive to the government.
I would like to inform the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi that the people of India from this Mann Ki Baat should urge them to use the soil windows more in Diwali.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to stay with the soldiers of the army for two-three hours.
Armed Forces and Air Forces protecting water, land and sky.
The war with Pakistan was completed 50 years in 1965.
We were only listening to those moments of pride, the occasion of pride, the adventure and sacrifice of our soldiers, but also the techniques of photographing, artefacts are not available, but through this exhibition, the moments of the campaign and the sacrifice of the soldiers are felt.
Whether it is the battle of Hajifir, whether it is the north or the Chamida or the sight of the victory at Hajipir Pass, the thrill of the organ stands on the organ and the pride of the Indian Army comes to the heart.
If you want to create history then you will have to understand the smaller issues of it.
Because of history, our bonds remain intact with our children.
If the history is broken then the possibility of creating history gets complete rest.
A younger child has given an order to the Prime Minister, but he forgot to say the name of his own.
It will be a matter of satisfaction that on 2nd October, I have announced the campaign in the context of Swachh Bharat and I can tell you that for the first time in the Parliament, the issue of cleanliness is being discussed.
There was also a vaccine on our government.
I also have to hear a lot that Modiji used to say a lot of things about cleanliness but what happened
I don't feel bad to hear this, but I see a good thing that there is a discussion about Indias cleanliness in the Parliament of India.
And on the other hand, on the other hand, when this younger child of Parliament and on the other hand speaks of cleanliness, there can be no such thing for the country.
This movement is going on, it seems to be awakening about ideas, cleanliness and cleanliness.
This will also make the government functional, it will be imperative to work and work.
In the year 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in India, we have worked towards bringing the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi to the forefront.
What do you want to say, Mahatma Gandhi
At one place, he said that if there is a time to choose one of the two freedoms and sanitation then I will give priority to cleanliness, cleanliness for Gandhiji after independence was more important than independence.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi, MyGov.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly inspired by the lives of great men.
The evaluation of this great man was not the work of his own.
All those who live for the country and those who die for the country are inspiring us.
This day will give us the opportunity to remember all these great men.
Deendayal Upadhyay on 25th September, Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jaiprakash Narayan Ji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
You will take any date, you will find the names of any great person associated with that date from the point of view of history.
I once again urge you, especially for 2nd October.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of the revered Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi.
The work that the government cannot do by giving a big deal of money to the government is due to the help of your small actions.
This is the Jan Shakti and that is why I once again urge you to do this.
Dear countrymen, my heart is filled with happiness due to one thing.
Chandra Bose had arranged all the arrangements with the daughter of Subhash Babu.
Chanda Bose and his family members took this thing in their minds and in the last few weeks, there was a clear report that Subhas Babu's fifty-thirds of his family will be coming to the residence of the Prime Minister.
You imagine how pleasant it will be for me.
They will get the opportunity to visit the Prime Minister's residence together for the first time.
But I am more happy than that because I will get the privilege of doing what happened before the Prime Minister's residence.
More than 50 persons of Subhash Babu, family members, people of different countries, all the issues will be enjoyed.
How joyful is the moment for me.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to awaken the younger generation about the voter registration, which will increase the participation of the youth in the coming days and will help the younger generation to choose and run the government in the future.
I hope the youngsters who have not yet registered their names in the voter list will be registered and they will definitely vote.
The seventh student of Kshitij Pandey visited me in the Anaras Hindu University, the seventh edition of the Central School.
Dandaga is self-confidence with him.
In this young age, I have seen the interest of physics and it would have been reading a lot.
The daughter of Sadavrat Patel, who lives in Sunderpur, Varanasi.
On the other hand, his father said, "No, if he takes the book in his hand, then in the evening, if he opens his mouth, history, then he makes all the faces of the evening.
We are surprised to all the families that I have been very impressed.
Sometimes I don't know that such children are prideful, but I don't know about Sonam.
I feel that Deva has given a power.
In my visit to Kashi, two children have come to meet.
Likewise, my visit to these two children will be remembered.
Through Mann Ki Baat, many people are providing new work to me.
Seeing this, what do you say is Sandeep Haryana, Sir Mann Ki Baat, once a month, you should do it every week because you get a lot of inspiration by listening to your speeches.
Sandeep ji, what have you done from me
Once a month, I have to do a lot of work even when I have to do it, I have to plan it on time.
At present, there is one place in the month.
Mann Ki Baat was completed in a way.
You know how much to use Subhashbabu radio
They started their radio centres from Germany and used to inform the people of India about the freedom movement from this radio centre.
He started a weekly newspaper of Azad Hind Radio.
He used to broadcast the radio through English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathas, Punjabi and Parshi Urdu languages.
I have also been talking about Mann Ki Baat for a year.
Keep sending your information, ideas, proposals.
It also benefits the government.
Reforms are initiated.
Your contribution, your contribution is valuable for me and is invaluable.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
Citizens of South India are celebrated on the occasion of Onam and the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan yesterday.
Considering the issue of social security, the Government of India has launched several new schemes for the common man.
I am happy that in a short span of time everyone has accepted this scheme.
I had requested my sisters to visit these security schemes on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I have been told that since the beginning of this scheme, 11 crore families have been connected to them and I have been told that about the benefits of these schemes have been given to the mothers and sisters.
I convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan.
Today, when I talk to you, it has been a year since the Jan Dhan Yojana has been implemented in large numbers.
The banking sector is also an important part of the economy and it has been strengthened to ensure that this system reaches the house of the poor.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
You will be happy to note that in this year, one lakh 31 thousand economic literacy camps will be organised to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
Not just opening the accounts.
Thousands of citizens are now eligible for overdraft facilities under this Jan Dhan Yojana.
It is believed that the poor can get money from the bank.
Once again I congratulate all of you and urge the poor brothers and sisters of the bank to tell them that they are not with your bank.
This bank is yours, do not leave it anymore.
I have brought the bank to you and now it is your task to keep it away.
The entire country was restless due to the recent incidents in Gujarat, the storm of violence and it is adventurous that if something happens in the land of Gandhiji and Sardar then the entire country is at the forefront.
But in a short span of time all my well-being brothers and sisters of Gujarat have brought the situation under control.
He played an active role because the situation would not get spoiled and once again Gujarat started on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and brotherhood have to walk on the right path and the path of development and shoulder to shoulder to shoulder.
Development is the answer to our problems.
I have got the opportunity to meet the learned persons of the Sufi community.
I have got the opportunity to listen to his thoughts and tell you the truth that I would like to hear some music.
I came to speak to all the scholars about their words, their way of speaking, the generosity and harmony in the Sufi tradition.
I feel very nice.
It is often a real need to reach the world in the real form of Islam.
The Sufi community that has been associated with love and compassion will reach far away the message that will benefit the human society, Islam will also be good and I will also tell others that we should understand the tradition of any community, the Sufi community and the Sufi tradition.
I am fortunate that I will get another opportunity in the coming days and I will get this invitation.
The scholars of Buddhist traditions from all over the world will come here in Bodhgaya and will discuss the well-being of humanity, welfare and global issues.
I am delighted to have received an invitation to visit Bodhgaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodhgaya.
I am very happy that I will get the opportunity to visit Bodhgaya with such scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Today I once again want to tell you the issue of my mind.
I had also asked this topic from Mann Ki Baat before this.
You must have heard me from Mann Ki Baat in my speech in Parliament, from the public meetings.
Every time I came here to say that the Government of India is opening upon the land acquisition law that is underway.
This means that the situation before the formation of my government has been re-established.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to assure that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just an announcement for us.
This mantra is the welfare of the villages, the poor and the farmers.
Therefore, on 15th August, we were told that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be set up.
We are implementing this decision quickly.
The war of 1965 was completed 50 years two days ago and when the subject of the war of 1965 came out, it was adventurously reminded of Lal Bahadur Scientists.
I salute all those who have won the war of 65 and salute the heroes.
We will always get inspiration from such incidents of history.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi community last week, I had a pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to interact with the nominee scientists across the country for hours.
I am happy to learn that India is doing excellent work in the field of science and in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing well.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that it is inspiring for me and it will be inspiring for me.
And I saw that many young scientists were speaking enthusiastically and many dreams were seen in their eyes.
Last time I was telling you that students should move towards the field of science.
After this meeting, I feel that there is a lot of opportunity and there are many chances.
I would like to say again that my young friends should look at science and inspire our educational institutions for this.
I have written about skill development.
Shriman Prakash of Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu has stressed on the needs of good teachers for primary education.
Emphasis is on the reforms in the education sector.
I would like to say one thing especially to my young friends.
In a speech from the Red Fort on 15th August, I used to say that this childhood for jobs at the lower level is for how this interview is for.
And when the letters come for childhood, every poor family, widow mother gets anxiety, who will get the recommendations, who will get the help of this job
I don't know what words are used
Everyone had a run-up and perhaps it was a reason for corruption at the lower level.
I am delighted to say in my 15th August speech that the government has taken several steps to ensure that it has been 15 days in such a short span of time.
Notices are being sent and this decision is going to be implemented almost for smaller posts.
It is unfortunate that every year in our country about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children die immediately after delivery and delivery.
This is worrisome and terrible.
There has been a lot of improvement in this regard.
But now we have to save our mothers and infants.
We are watching the television but not paying attention, the newspapers are published but we are not seeing it.
Along with clean water it is necessary to keep small things clean at home.
Life is very valuable.
It is not right that ignorance of ill water, apathy of sanitation is a cause of death.
Dengue testing is done free of cost at around 514 centers across the country.
The time of Rakshabandhan to Diwali is the time of many festivals in our country.
Let us share with the cleanliness of every festival, see this quality of sanitation will come in your own nature.
I always say that we will not get the privilege of of offering the lives of our country but it is certain that the privilege of living for the country is certain.
Two youngsters of our country, two brothers, Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
How everybody is trying to take the country forward, and this is the fact that he is proud to hear.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth due to lack of understanding.
But my experience in the youth is different.
Sometimes we know and learn new things by talking to them.
I have met many youngsters who have said that I am taking the message of Sande on Cycles.
One day in a week, Cycle-Day is determined.
He said that the happiness of being a good and young man for health, environment is being enjoyed.
In our country, the number of bicycle users in many houses is increasing.
I am happy to note that these are good efforts to save the environment and to maintain health and today two youngsters of my country have flagged off India in the US so that youngsters of India are also thinking about it.
Today I specially congratulate the Maharashtra government.
The memorial will inspire us to work for the Dalits, the exploited, the victims and the deprived.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for these two initiatives that are proud of Ambedkar.
We can bring the country forward by putting the shoulder on the shoulder.
My best wishes to you all, my best wishes.
It will definitely help our farmer brothers and sisters for the harvesting of Kharipa.
I remembered one more thing that I should enjoy my heart.
The cereals and oilseeds have always been broken in our country.
The poor people have rice, in food and vegetables, there is little oil.
I am glad that the cereals that have been launched this year have increased by 50 percent in the production of cereals and about 33 percent in the production of oilseeds.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, this date of July 26 has been recorded in the history of our country as Vijay Diwas.
The farmers who are associated with the land of this country are also the soldiers.
During the Kargil war, one of our soldiers broke down on hundred enemies.
The war of Kargil was not just a war against the borders, but every city of India, every village was involved in it.
It was a fight for those mothers and sisters who were fighting enemies in the younger son, brother Kargil.
The youngsters who had not left the henna for the marriage had fought this war, seeing their brave young kids, those who felt young again, who fought it with their fathers' fingers, who did not even learn to walk.
With the sacrifice of all these people, India can speak to the world today.
We launched MyGov Mission on July 26 in a few months after our government came to power in 2014.
We have launched this website to enhance their participation in democracy to connect every citizen to the development work.
And today, after a year, I am happy to say that about two crore people visited the MGOV website.
He said that about 5. 5 lakh citizens have registered a response, and especially more than 50 thousand citizens have registered information on PMO APLICATIONS.
Is it appropriate that such people have difficulty taking the tickets of the train
If we see this thing then it looks small at the top, but the government did not think about it.
However, the government had seriously considered the issue of Akhilesh and today a different system for ticket reservation has been implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
A new logo is created, tow lines are formed, programme policies are identified and there are very positive information on MGOVs.
It is felt that new winds are flowing in the governance system.
One feels a new consciousness.
MyGov has started coming to my address on 15th August.
Sumitra Raghavchari has suggested a lot from Chennai.
I believe that it is a good idea that the people of the country should suggest issues for what should be in my speech on August 15.
I am confident that you will definitely make good information.
I take care of one thing, it reaches you.
I don't want to instruct anybody, I don't want to reverse the responsibility of the central government, the state government or the local autonomy.
Just two days ago, I saw the scene of an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver was disturbed for about ten minutes and wounded.
Hoshakot Akshay of Bengaluru, Amay Joshi of Pune and Prasad Kakunje of Murbidri in Karnataka have expressed concern over this issue.
One person dies every four minutes in road accident.
However, I urge the parents to drive a couple of children, whether they are running a couple of jobs or if they are teaching them all, they will get information from their homes and the parents should pay attention to them.
In this regard, the government has taken several new policies and has taken initiatives to train the citizens about road safety, be it the system of road safety or the issue of immediate assistance to the accident victims.
Keeping in mind all these things, we are going to introduce the Transport and Security Bill.
We are thinking of taking several important steps to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan in the coming days.
Cashless Treatment is a cashless treatment for highways from Gurgaon, Jaipur, Badoda, Yeth to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon, Mondia.
This means that we are giving priority to the accident victims to get medical assistance in 50 hours after the accident, whether it is close to paying attention or not.
In order to provide information about the accident, 1033 Toll Free Telephone numbers will be available across the country.
There is a need to pay more attention not only to the accidents but also the life of one living and everybody is more important.
Sometimes I say that the workers should be compassionate.
In the last few days, I felt that I should talk to you about it.
But how to bring awareness in the work taken by the hand
Vijay Biswal has showcased how his love and art capabilities are associated with his work.
There is a possibility that he will be spoken about his paintings and I got another information about it.
The entire group of government officials in the Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has touched me with a different task and a different mission.
I liked the work of those officers who started the mission of Operation Malayudh, and we will feel that something is different.
But he gave a new turn to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, it is a matter of great importance.
Near Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh there is a field named Keshla .
The people of this village tried to drive and build toilets.
Now no person in this village goes to the open for toilets and when the construction of toilets is completed, then a festival was celebrated by Keshla village.
This is an excellent example of how to change the values of social life, how to change the mindset of the people and how the citizens of the country are taking the path of progress.
Bhavesh Deka from Guwahati has written about questions related to the North-East.
However, people of the North-Eastern region are active.
He will visit the village and speak to the officials of the administration there. He will also interact with people representatives and citizens.
The Central Government will do whatever it is possible to solve these problems.
A good endeavour is an attempt to move away from Delhi to the east and the East Policy which I say is not the same.
My dear countrymen, It is a matter of pride and joy for all of you to achieve the success of the Mangal Mission.
We are aware of this news but we don't care about it.
I always tell these officers that the IAS officers of the Government should go to a school and college near about two-four hours a week and interact with the students there.
This is difficult, but it is necessary to do this.
During the test, there is no electricity, so do not get stuck in the study of children.
If you want to start a small business and industry in the village then there will be electricity.
At some places, one has to go to another village to charge the mobile.
We have started this thing.
Today, I felt like talking to you on different subjects from Mann Ki Baat.
My best wishes to all of you for the same.
I will definitely be useful for sending your information and new ideas for 15th August.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
I feel sure that there is something less.
We were listening to many things in the form of a dream of 130 crore Indians in a very luxurious environment.
Sometimes your things were becoming inspiration for our people.
You will imagine how the period of holidays will have gone.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month, at 11 o'clock in the morning, your visit was made.
Every moment I feel that I do something like Miss.
And whenever I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I used to speak the same thing, and that word may be mine, the voice may be mine, but that story is yours, the male is yours, the ultimate is yours.
I used only my words and my words.
There was a feeling of absolute vacancy in the mind.
Once you have come to mind, now the elections have been completed, you will soon come and talk about four things.
But then I thought that, no
It is our Sunday programme and it should continue.
But this Sunday was just awaiting a lot.
Small, simple, simple and light things are also responsible for bringing about changes in life in society.
This is a part of it in a way and this order gives birth to a new energy, pure consciousness and in a sense it is necessary to move forward by keeping this order in mind that it gives strength to the new India.
He said that in the last few months, many messages have come and innumerable people have been missing Mann Ki Baat.
Whenever I read this message, I feel sorry.
This is my journey from Aham to Vayam.
This mortal interaction with you for me was a part of my spiritual journey in a way.
Many people have asked a lot of questions about why I visited Kedarnath in the Dhamadhumi of Elections.
You have the right to ask such questions.
And I can understand that you will also have a curiosity to know the answers to these questions.
The only thing that Mann Ki Baat has been given to me was a feeling of slight vacancies and I feel that in the valleys of Kedar, in that single cave, the opportunity of filling the basket must have been given to me.
As many people have expressed their desire to know about the visit of Kedar, I feel ever since your efforts to strengthen a positive thing.
The letters that come to Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are available are different from the routine, that is, the daily government work.
Sometimes you have sent letters to me because of inspiration for me.
Sometimes you do some words to give a basket to my thought process.
I understand the challenges faced by the country and the society.
At the same time, people also say what is the answer to these problems.
In the letters, people face their problems and also write what is the answer to it.
The answers to the pair of questions, which new ideas, direct or indirectly appear.
Mann Ki Baat is like a silver for the country and the society.
Today, my heart is full of joy.
In the past, I had finally said that now you have met three-four months, some people had taken out the political meaning and said, "How much confidence is Modi ji, how much is it that he has.
This self-confidence was not of Modi.
So this belief was the foundation of your faith.
All of you are taking the form of faith.
And that is why I had said in Akher's Mann Ki Baat that now I will come to talk to you after a few months.
And you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
If we come with this emotion, then the Mann Ki Baat sequence will continue as before.
The movement was not limited to the jails.
There was anger in the minds of the people and the hearts.
Democracy was one of the kinds of turmoil in the minds.
Whenever you get food from time to time, you don't understand what hunger is.
Just like that, they understand the importance of democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country used to feel that we can imagine something during the climate change.
Even if anybody smiles that we never used to use, then he feels sorry and suffers.
Some arrangements have been made in the Constitution of India, the democracy has taken place here.
There is also a need to reduce the social system.
There is also a need for laws and regulations and rights and duties.
But India can proudly say that for us there is a greater edition of democracy than laws and rules.
Democracy is our culture.
Democracy is our heritage, our tradition.
And we have become small and big by enclosing this heritage.
That is why the country had called for a full election not for us but for the protection of democracy.
We have simplified the precious democracy that we have received.
More than 61 crore people have given the right to vote in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
But if the world's interest is to be decided then I say that if one leaves China then more than the population of any other country, people have the right to vote in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States, is almost double.
More than the population of the entire Europe, there are total voters in India.
You can imagine how big means and manpower are required to run this election.
Millions of teachers, officers and employees have been able to cross the elections due to their day-night hard work.
Nearly three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces were responsible for the success of this great democracy.
At the same time, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also laid down their hard work.
You can imagine how much of the total elections were there.
A single voter should not be deprived of his voter, to ensure that all eligible voters have the right to vote.
In the remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, the polling stations are being set up for a single female voter.
We will be aware of the fact that the officers of the Election Commission had to travel for two-two days to reach the remote location.
Besides, it was a matter of pride in this election.
I extend my best wishes to the Election Commission and every person involved in this election process and bow down to the well-known voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from me many times that I have been asking for books or books.
We can all give books instead of flowers while welcoming.
On hearing this, people have started visiting books and welcoming them.
I have recently visited a book titled 'Premchand Ki Popular Kahaniyan'.
I loved this visit.
However, I couldn't get a lot of time but I got the opportunity to read some of his stories once again during the journey.
Premchand has illustrated the society in his stories, while reading it, the painting of that time has to be produced in front of his eyes.
Every description he wrote, every thing goes to life.
Their stories seem to be incorporated by the whole of India.
While reading the story of Nasha, he wrote, my mind was about the question of economic inequality in the society itself.
I remembered the period of my youth.
Our youth had debates overnight over the economic inequality of the society.
The mature of a child's sensitivity, the immense mother in her mind, the maturity of the ideas in such a young age.
When a 4-5-year-old Hamid comes out of the fair, human sentiments reach the summit in the true sense, it will finally make the vertical reader very emotional.
In this narrative, the life of a poor farmer is getting a very vibrant picture.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village settled in a very dense forest of Idukki.
The primary teacher here is P.
Murlidharan and a small tea shop runner P.
V.
The library was started by both Chinnathambi and his hard work together.
At one time, these two books were to be tied up and they used to take books in their villages of the jungle.
Today this library is working to show a new direction to everybody along with the tribal children here.
In Gujarat, this campaign of Gujarat has succeeded well.
Millions of people from all ages participated in this campaign and read books.
In todays digital era, during the times of Google Guru, I urge you to keep books for some time in your daily work.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are not only thinking of the present times but also think of the future challenges.
When I was reading your response to the Narendra Modi App and Mayagov, I remember that many people have written a lot about the water problem.
Besides the Pawan Gaurai of Belgaum, Sitashu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Vijay Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related challenges.
If you are equal to the mother of water, you should get blessings from the mother of the mother, then keep your grace on yourself.
Due to the deficiency of water in many parts of the country there is an adverse effect every year .
We save only eight percent of the water and therefore we need to solve this problem.
Just as we all have discovered the answers from the peoples participation, from the peoples power, just as one hundred thirty-three crore people of the country will find answers with the help of all and determination.
Keeping in mind the importance of water is the highest, the new Jal Shakti Ministry is now being set up in the country.
This will facilitate speedy decisions on all issues related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to do something very fast.
I have written letters to Sarpanchs from all over the country and to the Prime Ministers of the village.
To save water, to keep water storage, do not drop the drops of rain, to save the rain water, the heads of the village should talk to the village members and the meetings.
We have resolved to save every drop of water in villages and villages and save rain water.
In this Mann Ki Baat programme today, I would like to listen to you about a Sarpanch.
The people there have once again proved to play an active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the Gram Pradhans, all the Sarpanchs and those who have shown their activity to save water.
Several structures across the country have made such a pledge for water conservation.
In a way, the entire village has got the opportunity to work.
The people of the villages have now come to the competition to build a water temple in their villages.
I have already said that if a collective endeavour is made then it is a very positive result.
There cannot be a single specific fomrula to overcome water storage across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country.
But all the goals are the same and that is water savings, water conservation.
Work is being done to improve drainage lines in Punjab.
These works will solve the problem of water swallowing.
The Themaipalli of Telangana is being constructed here and the lives of the people of the village are changing.
The small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan have brought about a big change.
I was reading about the collective efforts made in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I have also read that the women of Garhwal are working together with Renwater Harvesting in a very good way.
I am confident that whenever we all strive together, we are making strong efforts then it is impossible.
The water will be saved at the same time when everyone will participate in the work of water conservation.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I have been asking the countrymen for three things.
I will be the first request to start a mass movement for water conservation as the countrymen have made the Swachhta Abhiyan a movement.
And I am confident that water is a prasad given by God.
Earlier, we used to say that the touch of the iron was made of gold.
I say that water is perishable and water touches a new virtue.
A awareness campaign should be started to save every drop of water .
Make the society aware, connectivity to society.
I urge all of you to share the traditional methods of water conservation.
If one of you has got the opportunity to visit Porbandar at the birthplace of worshipped Bapu Ji then he would have seen this place and there is another house behind the house of worshipped Bapu Ji.
That is why I always say that if someone goes to the Kirti temple then you should definitely see the water collection .
Let us make a list of more and more methods related to water conservation and encourage people to save water.
We can share your information using Janshakti for Jalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you for another thing.
He told me through Twitter how the Presidents of many countries, Prime Ministers, dignitaries, ordinary citizens, celebrated Yoga Day in our country.
On that day, the whole world looked like a happy, happy family.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Wouldn't those who do such service be recognised and welcomed them
The Prime Minister's Award was announced to promote Yoga in 2019 and contribute excellently in the development work.
This thing is inspiring.
Now the subject of Yoga is going on, but Indians are not behind this sector.
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger has also been honored and these institutions have been dedicated to Yoga for the past few decades.
My dear countrymen, this journey is being started today, new feelings, new feelings, new resolves, new strengths, but I will be waiting for your consultations.
If you come then you will continue to meet and keep talking.
I hear your feelings and keep yourself in mind.
Sometimes they try to live that feeling.
Your blessings should be like this.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Once again, I will meet the next month at Mann Ki Baat.
Thanks to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
There has been a strong feeling of consciousness in the minds of the people of the country after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in the terror attack in Pulwama.
My heartfelt condolences are being expressed about the martyrdom of the brave soldiers and their families.
The feelings of strong hatred against such terrorist violence are in the hearts of all of us and myself. The feelings of humanity in the hearts of every countrymen and humanity are in the hearts of humanity all over the world.
I salute all the brave sons of the country to sacrifice their lives for the protection of Mother India.
Our Armed Forces have always shown unique adventure and valour.
Where they have shown unprecedented ability to establish peace.
He has worked to respond to the attackers in his own language.
You must have seen how the action was taken within a hundred hours.
Ramniranjan ji, the father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, who showed his faith in such a painful occasion, would inspire all of us.
We will send our second son to the army to fight the enemy and if necessary, we will fight ourselves.
The entire nation salutes the bravery of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, the wife of Prasad Sahu, Meenaji.
He has also decided to recruit one of his own children in the CRPF.
When a village of Gumla in Jharkhand, the martyr Vijay Shoren, who was laid in the tricolor, was told that his sinful child would be admitted to the army.
This is the feeling of every young child in India today.
This feeling is visible from the houses and houses of our brave and brave martyrs.
Our single brave martyrdom is not an exception that there is no family exception.
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyrdom Vijay Maurya or the mother-in-law of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six-year-old son of the martyr Hemraj of Kot, the stories of every family of the martyrs are inspiring.
We do not need to look at the old events of history to know what is the penance.
These are examples in front of our eyes.
These examples are the source of inspiration for Indias bright future.
My dear countrymen, you have been waiting for the National Military Memorial for the past several years.
That is why it is natural for the people to have a curiosity and eagerness in their minds.
Mr. Onkar Shetty, a resident of Udupi, Karnataka on the Narendra Modi App, expressed happiness over the completion of the work of National War Memorial.
It is a memorial that will conserve the story of the great bravery of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to build it by thinking that there should be an inspirational monument in the country.
We decided to set up a National Military Memorial and the work was also started.
Tomorrow, this National Military Memorial on 25th February, we will deliver millions of countrymen to our army.
The country will make a little effort to repay our debts.
This new monument is being built near India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti Bhag.
I am confident that visiting this National Military Memorial is a pilgrimage to visit a pilgrimage.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the country for the supreme sacrifice of the soldiers after independence.
The construction of this memorial will showcase the indomitable adventure of our immortal soldiers.
The theme of this National Military Memorial is based on four central circles, from the birth of a soldier to the martyrdom.
Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the martyrs.
After this, the defence cycle is reflecting the security.
There are rows of dense trees in this cycle.
These trees are the symbols of the soldiers and are also giving a message to the people of the country that the soldiers are on the borders and the people of the country are safe.
Whoever will come here to know the bravery of these brave soldiers, whenever they are protected by the country, we should be alive, we should develop the country so that they will be able to get the information of the soldiers who sacrifice their lives for the country.
Our Armed Forces, Police and Armed Forces in the development of the country are not really possible to express their contributions in the words of great and precious contributions.
I am sure all of you should express gratitude to the men and women police personnel who are constantly working for our security.
I hope all of you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
It will also inspire others to visit this holy place and they will also be eager to visit this holy place.
On this occasion, when I was reading the reactions from you, I would look at Atish Mukhopadhyay ji's very pleasant response.
He has written that on March 3, 1900, the British had attacked Birsa Munda.
And Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata on 3rd March.
Both have come from a very different family background but both of them have enriched the tradition, heritage and history of Jharkhand.
Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat are a tribute to the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have not only created Jharkhand but also the name of the entire country has been bright.
The entire country is grateful for his contribution.
Today, if our youngsters are inspired as a guide, then they are Lord Birsa Munda.
When the British slept Birsa Munda, they were completely hiding and hiding.
Do you know why the British had to accept the path of such a miracle to catch Munda
Because they were scared of the British Munda, who made such a big empire.
Lord Birsa Munda has just destroyed the British government, which is decorated with guns and cannons with the help of our traditional blessings.
In fact, if people get such an inspiring leadership then the collective will become stronger than the strength of the armed forces that are in front of the enemy.
Lord Birsa Munda fought with the British not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
They have done something in their oppression.
In the dark life of the deprived and exploited, the sunlight was brought like the sunset .
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed the age of 25 years.
Like Birsa Munda, the son of Mother India has been in every part of the country.
But unfortunately, the stories of the sacrifices, bravery and sacrifices of these great people have not reached the new generations.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda realizes us, then a personality like Jamshedji Tata has created a big institution in the country.
India must become a centre of science, technology and industry for a bright future.
Not only this, he established several world-class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jamshed ji Tata and Swami Vivekanand ji had once met in the ship during their visit to the United States.
The foundation stone of the Indian Institute of Sciences was laid by this discussion.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Morarjibhai Desai was born on 29th February.
We all know that this date comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai, a simple and peaceful personality, was one of the most eminent leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai is also the record of presenting the budget for the most time in Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai led India in that difficult times when the country was in a democratic crisis.
Morarjibhai Desai was bowing himself to the movement against militancy to protect democracy.
He had to pay a huge price in his old age.
During that time the government used to put them in the tricolor and put them in the tricolor.
He became the Prime Minister of the country when he was elected by the Janta Party in 1977.
Accordingly, the fundamental rights obtained under Section 20 and 21 of the Constitution will not be violated even during the period of evasion.
This incident was revised by Morarji Bhai for the way democracy was killed in 1975.
Once again I pay tribute to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, people were very eager about the Padma Awards every year.
In such a situation, we feel that those people who work in the grassroots areas should be honored with selflessness and their work.
Many people have been making positive changes in the lives of people in different ways by taking very hard work.
Those people who are working with selflessness in the service of public service, social service and all of them are Karmayogis.
It is a real worker and is far away from the world of fame and they do not believe that your name has come or not.
He believes that the message of 'Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam' is a direct world in a way.
Today, I want to talk to you about such people.
Khatri is working to bring these rare paintings to the new generations.
I had visited former US President Barack Obama as an architecture of Tri of Life made by Abdul Gafur.
Among the standards of Padma Awards, Shabbir Syed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gomata.
The way he dedicated his entire life to the service of Goddess, he looks different from his work.
Despite the age of centuries, many people of the world are training Yoga.
So far, he has made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers and Jamuna Tudu, who is known as Lady Tarzon in Jharkhand, has worked with two hands with timber mafia and naxalites and saved 50 hectares of forests from erosion.
Because of the hard work of Junabai ji, the villages of that area are now planting 18 trees after the birth of every child in their home.
He has worked towards how women empowerment and farming can be benefitted.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women from their region to become financially self-reliant by connecting them with Self Help Groups.
This change in the list of award winners is a new image of Hindustan which is changing in a way.
My dear countrymen, today I will tell you here that I have just come here with a heart-breaking experience.
Nowadays, wherever I go to the country, I try to talk to the beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, PMJAY or Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme.
I have noticed that this scheme has brought about a big change in the lives of the poor.
If a poor person is not able to get the treatment done without money, then you must give it information about this scheme.
This scheme is for such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the season of examinations in schools will start now.
The tenth and twelfth examinations will be launched in the next few weeks in the country on various examination boards.
Congratulations to the parents of all the students and all the teachers on my behalf.
A few days ago, a very big programme like 'Pariksha Pe Church' was organised in Delhi like the Town Hall programme.
The Pariksha Pe Dialogue, especially on various subjects related to the exam, was interacted with him.
This will facilitate the benefit of the students.
All students, their teachers, parents can see the entire recording of this programme on YouTube and my best wishes to all the exam warriors for the upcoming test.
My dear countrymen, there is talk of India and there is no talk of festivals or festivals.
This is the reason why thousands of years old culture and traditions that have benefitted us.
My dear countrymen, I had visited Kashi a few days ago and I got the opportunity to spend some time with the Divyang brothers and sisters in this visit to Kashi.
And it is a pleasant surprise to hear the miracles for me.
The manner in which I speak in Mann Ki Baat, the youngsters with disabilities will be able to imagine the same way.
I am very happy that people only listen to Mann Ki Baat and leave it.
I have really been very impressed by the power of that Divyang New Yuvaka.
My dear countrymen, My dear countrymen, connecting with you all through the Mann Ki Baat programme is a unique experience for me.
In a way, I interact with crores of families every month through radio.
Many times, while speaking to you all, while reading your letters or from your telephone, I feel that you all consider me as a member of your family.
This is a pleasant experience for me.
Friends, Elections are one of the biggest festivals of democracy.
In the next two months, we all are busy in the polling booths.
I myself will also be a candidate in this election.
After honouring a strong democratic tradition, Mann Ki Baat will be held on the last Sunday of May.
This means the month of March, the month of April and the entire month of May.
After the election of all your feelings in this period, with a new belief and with the strength of the blessings of all of you, we will once again start a programme to interact with you through Mann Ki Baat and will continue to make Mann Ki Baat with you for many years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveswar has taught us that Kayakve Kailas means that he should work hard and follow his responsibilities, that is, the residence of Lord Shivaji is like living in Kailashdham.
His fame was a scholar who wondered in English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He used to live for the entire life to get food, luxury, education and spiritual knowledge.
I have been fortunate to receive the blessings of the supreme Swamiji several times.
In 2007, the President of India, Dr.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for Pujya Swamiji this time.
This poem of In Giving, U Risew Happiness Alliance Will Blace, All Ure Action Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life and mission of Siddhganga Monastery in a beautiful way.
Once again, I pay homage to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country, which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our democracy - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
It is natural for every country to be proud of the efficiency that the Election Commission manages on 25th January, which is celebrated as National Voters Day, the massive elections that are being held in India, the people of the world are surprising and the skills that the Election Commission manages.
Every citizen of India, who is a registered voter in our country.
Nobody leaves it to ensure that there is a registered voter, he will get the opportunity to vote.
We hear that the polling stations are being set up at a height of 15,000 feet from the sea level in Himachal Pradesh, while arrangements are made on extremely remote islands like Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Imagine, just for a voter.
It is natural to be proud of the Election Commission when he hears this thing.
This is the beauty of our democratic beauty that the Election Commission's staff should go to remote areas and arrange for a vote in order to make it an opportunity to utilize its voter.
I appreciate the Election Commission, which has been continuously striving to strengthen our democracy.
I would urge the younger generation to say that if they are eligible to vote, they must register as a voter.
At the same time, it is my duty to vote.
We have to realize this responsibility.
This should be our spirit, our tendency.
This should be our edition.
I urge the nominees of the country to make the people aware of the mission that you all get the voter registration together or the people can vote.
I hope that a large number of young voters will be registered and their participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is multiple springs.
One of these great men was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary with a different way.
I am fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who have contributed to Indias freedom struggle on Netaji's birth anniversary.
We know that many rooms and buildings were closed since independence in the Red Fort.
Dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army, has now been transformed into a very beautiful museum in the Red Fort.
The Museum dedicated to Yaad-e-Jallia and 1857 ATEN FIFTI consumption, India's First War of India, and this entire complex has been dedicated to the nation as a Kranti Mandir.
There is a fragrance of our glorious history in each of the museums.
Thai Thai Thai in the museum inspires us to see the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle in history.
At this very place, the British Rajvati had run the ruins of Bharat Mata's brave son-in-law Karnal Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurubaksingh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was visiting the memories related to Netaji in the Red Fort, the Kranti Temple, the members of Netaji's family visited me a very special cap cap cap cap.
Netaji used to finish that hat.
I gave that cap to be kept in the museum so that the people coming there should look at the cap and inspire patriotism from it.
In fact, the bravery and patriotism of our heroes needs to be in different forms to the new generations.
A month ago, I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December.
In a programme, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place where Netaji Subhas Bose had hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted in the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone would be surprised because there is a tradition of 15th August.
On this occasion, the establishment of the Azad Hind Government was 75 years old.
Subhas Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled association.
A brave soldier who played a key role in the freedom struggle.
Let's go to Delhi, let me eat, let me give you a lot of bright announcements like Azadi Dunga and Netaji got a place in the hearts of every Indian.
For many years, there was a demand for bringing the benefits related to Netaji to all and I am happy that we could do this thing.
I remember that day when I had come to the Prime Minister's residence of Netaji.
Together, we all expressed our gratitude on several issues related to Netaji and paid tributes to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy that several places related to the great heroes of India have been made to develop in Delhi.
Be it 26, Alipur Road related to Babasaheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir.
If you come to Delhi then you must see these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and this Mann Ki Baat then I would like to tell you a story related to the life of Netaji.
I have always considered it an important medium for connecting Radio people, as well as Netaji was not very close to Radio and he was also selecting Radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu launched Azad Hind Radio and interacted with the soldiers and people of Azad Hind Fauj through radio.
Subhash Babu had a different style of commencement of his address on the radio.
Earlier, he used to say that Is Subhas Chandra Bose Speeching to You Over the Azad Hind Radio and this was a new zeal in the audience.
I am told that this radio station was spreading the weekly news, which was given in many languages like English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, West and Urdu.
The Radio Station is being run by a resident of Gujarat, M.
Vyas played an important role.
The programmes being spread from Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes gave great strength to our freedom fighters.
A painting museum has been set up in this revolution temple.
Efforts have been made to present Indian art and culture in an extremely attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 centuries old paintings and artefacts there.
The excellent art works of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravivarma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Gemini Roy, Seloz Mukherjee have been performed in the museum.
And I would urge you all to visit there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you are thinking that art discussions are going on here and I tell you about the best art works of Gurudev Tagore.
So far, we have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and musician.
But I would like to say that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made paintings on many subjects.
They have also drawn pictures of animals and birds, they have also depicted many beautiful natural paintings and not only that, they have worked to reflect many human characters through arts.
And the special thing is that he has not given any name to many of his paintings.
He was convinced that his painting observer himself would understand the meaning of that painting, his message from paintings would be understood from his vision.
His paintings have been performed in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope you will definitely go to see their paintings in the Kranti temple.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have given the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and works.
Sant Ravidas ji used to give a big message from a bit of silver.
He said that the species of Haijo Ketan cannot be associated with human beings, even if the bananas are soaked, then the leaves below the leaves, then the leaves below the leaves below the leaves below the leaves below the leaves, but the entire tree is finished.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every human being then it is not right to share it on caste, religion and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life through his messages.
It will not be wrong to say here that he described the world as the true meaning of the dignity of labour.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I should highlight Indias space programme and its future aspects.
I would like to urge the students to take juice in space programmes and think out of the sky. I would like to appreciate this message that I have given you this idea and specially to your children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad when I was fortunate to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai has played an important role in Indias space programme.
Our space programme contributes to the innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students are reaching space today.
On this 24th January, our students have made a artam-set launch.
The sounding rockets made by the students of the University in Odisha have set up a number of records.
The number of space drives that have been launched since the independence of the country till 2014, almost all the space drives have started in the last four years.
We have also made a global record of 104 satellites from the same spacecraft.
We will soon showcase Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is utilising space technologies with the best means to preserve survival and wealth.
Whether it is a cyclone or rail and road safety, it is helping in space technology.
Our fishermen have been given navy devices, which are helpful in economic advancement along with their security.
We are using space technologies to enhance the distribution and accountability of government services.
Under the Housing for All, about 40 lakh houses have been tagged in about 23 states under the Housing for All.
At the same time, about three and a half crore wealth under Manrega has also been able to make jeo-tags.
Our satellites have become a symbol of the growing power of the country today.
We have the same contribution to our excellent relations with many countries in the world.
South Asia Satellites has been an unprecedented initiative so that our neighbouring friendly countries have also visited development.
Through our unlimited competitive launch service, India launches not only the developing country but also the satellites of the developed countries.
The sky and stars of children are always very attractive .
Our space programme provides an opportunity to the children to go ahead with the limits that have been impossible till now.
Our children have a vision to look after the stars, explore and inspire new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that those who play will open and this time a lot of young and young sportspersons have come out openly in Khelo India.
About 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 sportspersons at the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
When the sportsperson performs the best at the local level, he will perform the best globally.
In Khelo India, the sportspersons from every State have done well at their own level.
The life of many sportspersons who win medals is a tremendous inspiration.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
Sonali Helvi Satara, the captain of the Women's Customs Association under the 21 years of Maharashtra, was a child-in-law and encouraged her brother and her iron golden skills.
It is often seen that there is no encouragement in sports like Kabddi.
Nevertheless, the golden junk was selected and performed excellently.
Innovation of 10 years of Asansol, Khelo India is the youngest medal winner of the Youth Games.
The daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, Akshata Baswani, won a gold medal in Hin Weightlifting.
Their daughters are farmers in Belgaum.
When we talk of creating India, then New India is the resolve of youth power.
The stories of Khelo India are saying that not only big cities but also youngsters from small towns, villages, towns, children, Young Sporting Talents are contributing to the creation of a New India.

Definitely put your clean beautiful toilets on social media along with Myeljatgarh.
Friends, On 2nd October, 2014, we started a journey to ensure that all of us together keep in mind to free the country from clean and open defecation.
Today, India is moving towards getting rid of open defecation long before 2nd October, 2019, so that I can pay homage to the fathers on their 150th birth anniversary.
Dhansul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about examinations and test warriors.
Thank you for presenting this issue.
For many tests, the first part of the year is the season of examinations.
All the students are engaged in the work related to examinations from their children to teachers.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
Today, I would like to talk about Mann Ki Baat, but you would be happy to note that after two days, on 29th January, at 11 o'clock in the morning, I will interact with students from all over the country, parents and teachers will also participate in the programme.
And many foreign students will also participate in this event.

We can also see the same livelihoods through social media and Namo App.

The year 2018 will end.
And that is why experiences are benefitted and self-confidence is also created to choose.
What can we do so that we can change our lives and contribute to the society and the country ahead.
Congratulations to all of you for 2019.
You must have decided to keep in mind any memories of 2018.
It is also important that how India will remember as a nation in 2018 as the strength of one hundred thirty crore people.
And we are also prideful of all of us.

My dear countrymen, in December, we have met some extraordinary Indians.
Dr. Jayendran died on 19th December in Chennai.
Dr. Jayendran is known as the most affordable treatment for the poor.
People say that he was ready for the service of the patient.
On this website, I have read a lot of articles about the work that inspires his society.
Similarly, on 25th December, Sulagitinaras Samma died in Karnataka.
At the beginning of this year, he was honored by Padmasri.
There are many persons like Jaichandran and Sulagitti Narasamma who have dedicated their lives for the good of the society.
While we are talking about healthcare, I would like to learn about the social efforts made by doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, some of our party workers have told me that some young doctors in the city are providing free treatment to the poor patients by organizing camps.
The heart lung critical care of this place is taken every month , in these camps there is a facility of free treatment of many types of diseases .
Today hundreds of poor patients take advantage of these camps every month .
The enthusiasm of this young doctor who is sickly serving the patient is really worth mentioning.
Today, I am proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has been successful due to collective efforts.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people have launched Swachhta Abhiyan in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I'm still themeterindia.
I am sure that this will make more and more people aware of our heroes who have transformed the society.
It is easy to spread negativeness .
However, many good works are being done in our society.
And this is happening due to the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports is an important thing in every society.
When sports are played then energy is also generated in the minds of those who see it.
We see many things like the fame, identity, respect and respect of the sportspersons.
But sometimes there are many such things that are more than the world of sports.
I am going to tell you about Kashmir's daughter-in-law Hanaya Nisar and she won the gold medal in the Karat in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag, Kashmir.
Hanaya practiced and practiced Karata with hard work and chicken, learned and proved himself.
I pray for the bright future of all the countrymen.
Many congratulations and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, 16-year-old Rajni had a lot of discussions about this girl.
Rajan said that his parents have made a lot of sacrifice and hard work to reach here.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work every morning before the Rajni and his emotions were raised.
When Rajan expressed his desire to learn against Mushti, his parents collected all the resources that were possible and enhanced his enthusiasm.
The Rajni had to use old gloves to practice the roots because the financial condition of her family was absurd.
Despite all such obstacles, the Rajnis were not able to get away.
He has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini and congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha Rani for helping Rajini and enhancing her enthusiasm.
In this month, a 20-year-old daughter of Pune, Vedangi Kulakarni has become the fastest Asian world migrating through cyclone.
It used to run around 300 kilometres of bicycles daily for 159 days.
You imagine 300 km cycling daily
His quest for cycling is indeed worthy.
Whether we get inspiration from listening to such achievements or not.
Especially when my young friends listen to such incidents, they also get inspired to do something by crossing the barriers.
If we determine that there is power in the resolve then all the problems fall on their own.
No problem can be obstructed.
When we hear about such examples, we also get a motivation at every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, there will be many festivals like Lohdi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi of enthusiasm and happiness in January.
On the occasion of all these festivals, the color of traditional dances will be seen somewhere in the whole country, and somewhere the joy of sweetness will burn the iron.
After this the day starts increasing gradually and the season of swimming starts in winters .
Many congratulations to the farmers of our food donors.
The spirit of unity in our festival diversity - Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is in our festivals.
We can see how many of our festivals have been united with nature.
In the Indian culture, society and nature are not different, there are individuals and unity.
The best example of our close relationship with nature is the festival based calendar.
It is not only the festivals of the year but also the information about the planet-nakshatras.
From this traditional calendar it is known how old our relationship with natural and astronomical events is .
According to the speed of the moon and the sun the third of the festivals is fixed according to the moon and the sun calendar .
It depends on those calendars which calculate the calendar.
Festivals are also celebrated in many parts as per the condition of Nakshatras.
All the festivals are celebrated according to the lunar calendars, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishnu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisak, Bihu are celebrated according to the sun calendar.
Rivers and water conservation have special significance in many of our festivals.
Sixth is a festival of worshipping the sun in rivers and ponds.
Lakhs of people bath in sacred rivers even on Makar Sankranti .
Our festivals teach us social children too.
On the other hand, they have a mythological significance and on the other hand every festival is easily inspired by social brotherhood.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of 2019 and wish you all to be happy with the coming festivals.
My dear countrymen, there are many such things in our culture which we can take pride and show the world proud and one of these things is our Kumbh Mela.
People from all over the country come there and are always connected to the Kumbh Mela.
In the Kumbh Mela, the people of faith and devotion are drowned.
At the same time, millions of people from all over the country have come together.
The tradition of Kumbh Mela is realised and blossomed with our great cultural heritage.
This year, from 15th January, the world famous Kumbh Mela is being organised in Prayagraj, which you might have been eagerly waiting for.
Since then saints and saints have started reaching Prayagraj for the Kumbh Mela .
Last year, UNESCO has placed the Kumbh in the list of marvellous cultural traditions of humanity and can imagine its global significance.
A few days ago, the Ambassador of several countries had come to see the preparation of the Kumbh Mela.
At that time several nations were flagged off at the same time.
There is a possibility of people from more than 150 countries coming to the Kumbh in Prayagraj.
With the divine divinity of Kumbh, Indias magnificence will grow all over the world.
The Kumbh Mela is an effective medium of finding itself and every person coming here feels different experiences.
This is a great academic experience especially for the youth.
I had myself visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparation of the Kumbh Mela is going on at a rapid pace.
The people of Prayagraj are also excited about the Kumbh Mela.
This year, the Kumbh Mela is also focused on cleanliness.
If we take care of cleanliness along with cleanliness in Kumbh organisation then its good message will reach far away.
This year, after the sacred bath of the Bhakti Triveni Sangam, Akshayvata will also be performed.
This Akshayavat, a symbol of the beliefs of the devotees, was closed in a fort for several years, so the devotees could not see it despite their desires.
But now the fort of this Akshayavat has been opened for all.
I would urge you that when you go to Kumbh, you will definitely upload some photos on social media showing different aspects and colors of the Kumbh Mela, more and more people will be inspired to visit this Kumbh.
This Kumbh of spirituality becomes a great philosophy for Indians in India.
This Kumbh of artistics should also be the Mahakumbh of the creative powers.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of enthusiasm in the hearts of all our countrymen about the Republic Day celebrations of 26th January.
There is an unprecedented relationship between revered Bapu and South Africa.
Mohan, Mahatma came from South Africa itself.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and stood gravely against the description.
He also established Finics and Tolstoy Farms from where voices were raised for peace and justice all over the world.
The year 2018 is also being celebrated as the centenary year of Nelson Mandela and is also known as Madiba.
Nelson Mandela is one of the ideals of the war against discrimination throughout the world.
He had received the courage and inspiration from the respected father for so many years.
He considered Bapu as his ideal.
Both Bapu and Mandela not only inspire the whole world but also inspire us to create a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, Just a few days ago, there was a DGP Summit in Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat, where the world's tallest statue is the Statue of Unity.
Detailed discussions on how steps should be taken to empower the security of the country and the countrymen.
At the same time, I announced the inauguration of Sardar Patel Award for National Integration, which will be honoured by those who have contributed to national unity in any way.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He always strived to keep Indias integrity uninterrupted.
Sardar Patel believed that India's real strength is united in its diversity.
Honouring his feelings and paying tributes to him through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the holy day of Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna, North India was his workplace for a long time and he sacrificed his life at Nanded in Maharashtra.
Janmabhoomi Patna, Karmabhoomi in North India and the last of life in Nanded.
In a similar way, he received his blessings throughout India.
If you look at his life then you can see the reflection of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of the Father Shri Guru Teg Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji received the post of Guru in his nine years of age.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice in the form of a legacy from Guru.
His personality was calm and simple but whenever he tried to smile the poor and the weak, whenever he was injusticed, Guru Gobind Singh fought for the poor and the weak.
He used to say that it is not right to show his strength by fighting against the weaknesses.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that it is the biggest service to remove human sorrows.
He was an excellent triangle, and was enlightened in many other languages including Gurumukhi, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, there are many good things in the country which are not discussed at large.
The Indian Food Safety and Standards Authority (IFSA) is implementing this.
The work of promoting safe and healthy habits of food is underway.
India will be prosperous only when India is clean and healthy.
Nutritional food is the most important thing for good health .
In this context, F. S.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him for this initiative taken by him.
I would like to appeal to you all to participate in this initiative.
I would like to say that you should also participate in this and especially show these things to the children.
It is necessary to get the importance of diet from childhood itself .
My dear countrymen, this is the last programme of 2018 and once again I meet you in the year 2019.
Be it a person or a nation or a society, the inspiration is the foundation of the progress of that life.
Let us move forward with new inspirations, new zeals, new resolves, new achievements and new heights. Let us change ourselves and change the country.
On 3rd October, 2014, on the sacred occasion of Vijayadashmi, all of us together started a journey through Mann Ki Baat.
The only man was the dragist.
There is no clothing on the dhaba.
On the side of the road, he had prepared a very small tape like a tape.
At that time, there was a discussion on the radio.
In the remote areas of the country, from villages across the border to metro cities, from farmers to youth professionals.
Recently, AIR has also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen the objectives of the survey that some objectives are very different and careful.
Out of those people who have been surveyed, about 70 of them are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
The Mann Ki Baat is a big contribution to the people to increase the positive sentiment of the society.
This is a glimpse of the positive sentiment of the people of our country.
Many people have also realised that the spirit of voluntaryism has increased due to Mann Ki Baat.
There is a change that people are coming forward with great zeal and zeal for social service.
I am very happy to see that the radio is now increasing popularity due to Mann Ki Baat.
But in this journey only radio has not been a single medium.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
The apprehension that you have presented is absolutely equal.
In fact, if a leader has been given a Mike to speak and lakhs of people have lived to listen to it then what else should happen
What words were used again and again.
The learners have concluded that this programme is not related to politics, when I started the Mann Ki Baat programme, while I was determined that there was no politics in it.
I got all this inspiration from you people and from you.
What is the expectation of the beneficiaries from the phones that have come in online text, in the letters that have come before every part of Mann Ki Baat
Modi will come and go, but this country will remain immortal, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will continue to live.
Somebody writes a letter from a remote area of the country and tells me that people should not be very favourable to sell vegetables with small shopkeepers like us, auto rickshaw drivers.
Now a campaign like Selfie with Dotter can be started in a small village in Haryana state and can spread not only across the country but also abroad.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government statement.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India.
If you want to give a simple answer to the questions you have asked then you will say that nothing is preparing.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple task for me.
Because every time I have letters from the people before Mann Ki Baat.
People also record their message in their voice by calling on this number.
I try to read more and more letters and text before every part of Mann Ki Baat.
Every moment my countrymen and my countrymen have lived in my mind and that is why whenever I read a letter, the situation of the journalist and the feelings of the letter become a part of my thoughts.
In such a situation, the letter is not just a piece of paper.
It is my voice in Mann Ki Baat, but all examples, emotions and inspirations are of my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people who have not been able to name Mann Ki Baat till date but they are sending letters.
Efforts are also made to ensure that the letters which cannot get a place in Mann Ki Baat and the concerned departments should take care of them.
With his hard work, Mann Ki Baat can reach more and more people.
A team of Akashwani prepares every part of it for spreading in different languages.
Some people listen to Mann Ki Baat in the territorial languages spoken in the style.
He becomes Narendra Modi for those 30 minutes.
I congratulate them and thank them for their talent and skills that they have shown.
I urge all of you to hear this programme in your local language.
However, many of the topics discussed in Mann Ki Baat were taken up by the media.
There are many topics such as cleanliness, road safety, drug-free India, Selfie with Doter, which media has created a new concept and made it a campaign and worked forward in that field.
Without your cooperation, the journey of Mann Ki Baat was incomplete.
Sometimes our predecessors also stand like a big crisis in communication.
I give priority to understand what the front person has to say without acceptance and reaction.
The Communication Gap between the elderly, the elderly, the elderly and the adult girls of the family has always been discussed.
In fact, in most of the households, Kumaravayin is also limited to discussing children and children.
In this, for a long time, there is discussion on the study of children or their habits and their livelihoods.
I always strive to learn what they are doing or how these children think about.
Finally, this is a New India.
Some people say that the younger generation has a desire to do a lot of things together.
I say what is bad in this
These youngsters have shown the courage to think about questions and to see a big dream, the same youth has brought about this change.
My dear countrymen, Vineeta ji from Gurugram has written on Maygave that I should talk about 'Sanvidhana Divas' that is going to be held on 26th November in Mann Ki Baat.
They say that this day is very special because we have accepted the constitution and it has now been 69 years since we are going to enter the 70th year.
Imagine that within three years, these great wonders have created such a comprehensive and detailed incident.
The way these great people have created such a pace of destruction, this work is an excellent example of the management and productivity of the house even today.
The special thing in our Constitution is that the rights and duties i. e. Rights and Duties have been described in detail.
In the lives of the citizens, these two combinations will take the country forward.
If we respect the rights of each other, then our rights will be protected by ourselves. Similarly, if we obey our duties in the Constitution, we will be protected by ourselves.
I still remember that when India's Republic was 60 years old, in 2010, we had made a glorious beauty visit by putting an elephant on the elephant in Gujarat.
In order to create awareness about the constitution of the youth and to make them aware of the important aspects of the state legislation, we have made efforts to connect them with the state legislation.
And in our country, we will ensure that there is peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, we can never forget the contribution of the great man at the time when discussions are held on this issue.
This was a great man, a revered Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His Mahaparinirvana Day is on 6th December.
There is no new thing for India, what is the democracy and how the parliamentary system is.
He said that this freedom we have received after such a struggle is invaluable and we have to protect our blood from the drops.
He said that India First is Dr.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on November 23, all of you celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and next year we will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Gurunak Devji always thought of the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony to the society.
All State Governments and Union Territories have also been instructed to celebrate this programme in large quantities.
Thus, the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji will be celebrated in all the countries of the world.
At that time I remembered Lakhpat Sahib Guruvda.
During the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, this guruvadar had suffered a lot.
But in collaboration with the local people, the manner in which the state government has worked for the rejuvenation of this guru, it is still an ideal thing.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit the holy place of Gurunak Dev Ji in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
But this journey will continue.
The more people will be connected to all of you, the more it will be your journey will be better and pleasant to everyone.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of the people that what do I get due to Mann Ki Baat
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On 31st October, the Ladke of all of you is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and every year, the youth of the country is ready to run for the Run for Unity.
I urge all of you to participate in this race for listening in large numbers.
Approximately six months before independence, on 27th January, 1947, Sardar Patel's photograph was published on the back of the world's famous International Month Time Month.
This was a map of India which was divided into many parts.
There were more than 550 institutions in the country.
Even though the juice of the British of India was over, he was trying to leave the country after breaking it into many parts.
Time menstruations were writing that India is facing threats like violence, food grains, inflation and power politics.
He further wrote the Time Month that if anybody has the capacity to fill the country with a single voice, then it is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This statement of Time month was going to open several other aspects of the life of iron man.
How did he make arrangements for rescue operations after the floods in Ahmedabad in the 1920s, how he gave direction to Bardoli Satyagraha.
They have merged all institutions in India.
Whether it is Junagarh or Hyderabad or Trivankor or Rajvati-Sardar Patel in Rajasthan, we are able to see India together with the ideological maturity and strategic skills.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel by seeing this nation built in the bond of unity.
The birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, which will be celebrated on 31st October this year, will be even more special on that day, while paying tribute to Sardar Patel, we will dedicate the statue of Unity to the nation.
The height of this statue built on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is double from the height of the Statue of Liberty statue in America.
This statue is the world's tallest pillar.
Every Indian will now feel proud that the world's highest statue is on the land of India.
Sardar Patel, who belonged to the earth, will now enhance the glory of the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, Yesterday, all of you have celebrated Infantry Day.
This is the same day, on which the soldiers of the Indian Armed Forces landed on the land of Kashmir and protected the Gulf from the horses.
This historic event has a direct relationship with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old address from India's great army officer Sam Manikshaw.
Fild Marshal Manikshaw reminded him of the time when he was Colonel.
On 31st October, our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi is also the death anniversary.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, paid homage to Indira ji.
My dear countrymen, who does not like sports
Spirit, Strength, Skill, Stamina are very important in the world of sports.
The youth of the country who have these qualities will not only make the country progress in the fields of economy, science and technology but also in sports.
Our Para Athletes, who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018, got the opportunity to visit.
India won a total of 72 medals in this competition and won a new record and increased Indias honour.
I am fortunate to meet all these talented Para Athletes personally and congratulate them.
Similarly, the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 winners in Argentina have got the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to hear that in Youth Olympics 2018, our youngsters have done the best.
In this competition, we have won three more medals in MICS besides 13 medals.
You must be remembered that Indias performance in the Asian Games of this year has also been excellent.
See how many times I used the best and most glorious words till now while speaking for a few minutes.
This is the story of Indian sports, which is reaching new heights every day.
India is not only in sports but also in such areas which have never been considered.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur, who has won the Gold in Athletics for the country at the Asian Para Games 2018.
They are Divya from birth to birth.
When he was eight years old, his daughter turned away.
Then eight years was taken out in an orphanage .
After abandoning the orphanage, he worked as a Veter to clean the DTC bus and to drive the roads in Delhi.
Today, he is winning the Gold for India in the Narayan International Competitions.
Not only this, look at Indias excellent performance in sports, India has never won any Olympic medal at Judo at a senior or junior level.
However, Tababi Devi won a judot silver medal in young Olympics and made history.
The 16-year-old young sportsperson Tababi Devi will live in a village in Manipur.
Their daughters are labourers and the mother works to sell fish.
Many times his family had such a time that he had no money for food.
In such a situation, the morale of Tababi Devi has not fallen.
And they made history by winning medals for the country.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson and his stubbornness are the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, you have successfully organised the FIFA 17th World Championship in 2017.
He praised the entire world for taking a very successful sports event.
A new record was created in the FIFA Under Seventin World Cup in the number of audiences.
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football units in different stadiums of the country and increased the enthusiasm of young sportspersons.
This year, India has got the privilege of organizing Men Hockey Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will start in November, 2018 and will continue till 16th December.
Every Indian is playing a game or sporting it in any sports, there is a spirituality towards hockey.
The history of India in Hockey has been written by gold.
Earlier, India has got gold medals in many competitions and once India has been the World Champion winner.
India has also given hockey many great sportspersons.
When Hockey is discussed in the world, the story of Hockey will remain incomplete without this great sportsperson of India.
Hockey's magician Major Dhyanchand is known by the whole world.
After that, the Hockey has made a big journey from Balwinder Singh Cineer, Leslie Glorius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj village.
Even today, Team India sportspersons are inspiring the new generation of Hockey with the success of their hard work and dedication.
For sports lovers there is a good opportunity to see adventurous games .
He should visit Bhubaneswar and encourage not only Indians but also other associations.
During this time along with enjoying sports you can also see the Sun Temple of Konark , Lord Jagannath Temple of Puri and several world famous visiting and sacred places along with Chilka lake .
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Men Hockey Team for this competition and assure you that 125 crore Indians stand with them and support them.
I extend my best wishes to all the world's teams coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the kind of people who are coming forward for social work are inspiring and enthusiastic for all the countrymen.
But in the new era, the new ways, new generations, new hopes, new zeal and new dreams are coming forward today.
A few days ago, I had visited a programme where a portal has been launched, its name is Self-For Society, MyGov and the IT and electronic industry of the country have started this portal that enthusiastically encouraging their employees to provide them such opportunities.
Every Indian will be proud to see the zeal and spirituality they have for this work.
There is a fragrance of the journey from IT to society, not me, not the age of ourselves.
Somebody is teaching children, somebody is teaching senior citizens, somebody has been engaged in cleanliness, some helps farmers and it is a selfless feeling of dedication and determination.
A young man learned Wheel Chair Basketball to help the Wheel Chair Basketball Association of Divyangs.
This spirit is dedicated, it is an initiative that has been done for special work.
Wouldn't any Indian be proud of this
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I was watching the people's information for Mann Ki Baat, I got a charming text from Puducherry to Shri Manish Mahapatra.
He has written on MyGov that please address Mann Ki Baat the best example of the traditions and customs of many communities of India with nature.
We need to learn from them how to sustainable development we need to accept their traditions in our lives.
I compliment Manish ji for keeping this topic in mind.
This is the subject that inspires us to see our glorious history and culture, today the world is discussing environmental protection, and is looking for new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
We have not been able to get rid of this problem even in India, but we have to get rid of it, we have to see our rich history, traditions, and we have to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities, especially.
It has been a part of our tribal culture to collaborate with nature.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like goddesses.
In the Bhil tribal communities of Central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship trees like Pimpal and Arjun with respect.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Vishnoi society showcased us the way for environmental protection.
It is not for them to sacrifice their lives especially on the protection of trees, but it is not for them to harm a single tree.
Mishmi claims to have a relationship with tigers in Arunachal Pradesh.
They also consider them brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland tigers are seen as the protector of forests .
The people of Warli community of Maharashtra consider the tiger as a guest and the presence of tigers for them is prosperous.
The Coal community of Central India believes that their own luck is connected to the tigers, the tigers do not get food and the villagers will have to stay hungry.
In the reproductive season of Gond tribal fishes in central India fishing stops in some parts of the Kethan river .
In the remote areas of Nilgiri plains of south India, a small hijacking community is built by traditionally available items at the local level.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is true that the tribal community insists on living in a very peaceful and mutually peaceful manner, but if anybody harms their natural resources then they are not afraid of fighting for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were of the tribal community.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought strongly against the British government to protect our wild land.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who have done something unique for the society.
This kind of work seems to be a fool, but in fact, the change of our mindset has a very deep impact on the direction of the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmers of Punjab, Bhai Gurbachan Singh.
An ordinary farmer, Gurbachan Singh ji, was married to his child.
Before marriage, Gurbachan ji had said that we will do it in a simple way to marry the bride's mother.
There is no need to spend much on top and other things.
We have to celebrate this festival in a simple manner.
But he suddenly said, but I have an end.
Nowadays, when the subject of marriage comes, it seems normal that something is going to be demanded before, something that will be difficult for the families of the brides.
But you will be surprised that this was a simple farmer, he said that what he had put in front of the fathers of the bride is the real power of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji said to him that we will never burn the barley in our fields.
You can imagine how big social power is there in this.
And we have seen that there are many such families in our society who transform personality into the context of social interest.
The family of Shri Gurbachan Singh ji has put such an example in front of us.
I have read another village in Punjab in Kallar Majra, which is near Nabha.
Kallar Majra is also discussing that instead of burning the cereals, they are mixed in orange soil and the technologies that are required to be used for it.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurbachan Singh Ji.
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and all those who are making the best efforts to keep the environment clean.
You are leading the Indian tradition of a strong lifestyle as a true heritage.
Just as the sea is formed by drops and drops, small activity and awareness and positive activity play a big role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen , it has been said in our books : Dya : Peace : Internal peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Visvadeva : Peace : Brahm Shanti : Visvadeva : Peace : Visvadeva : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace
Establish peace in life, in heart, in you, in every corner of the world.
Peace: Peace: whenever there is a discussion of world peace, India's name and contribution will be seen reflecting in golden literature.
India has a special significance for this year's 11 November as the first war on 11th November ended 100 years ago.
The event is about 100 years, that is, a century will be fulfilled for the devastation and human losses that took place during that period.
The first war for India was an important event.
In fact, we didn't have to give anything directly to that war.
Yet our soldiers fought bravery and played a very big role and sacrificed the highest.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when there was a war, they were not less than anybody.
Our soldiers have shown valour in the remote areas.
The same purpose was to re-establish peace.
In the first great war, the world has seen all the destructions.
According to the estimate, about one crore soldiers and so many people lost their lives.
This is why all the world knows the importance of peace.
The interpretation of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Peace and harmony today is not just a war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, all need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true reflection of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-Eastern India has something different.
The natural beauty of the North-East is unique and the people here are very talented.
Our Northeast is known for the best work.
North-Eastern India is such a region that has made a lot of progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim has won the Future Policy Gold Award for 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
The award is given by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) attached to the United Nations.
You will be happy to hear that the award given to make the best policy is with Oscar in that area.
Not only this, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for winning this award by pursuing 51 nominees of our 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October has ended.
There is a feeling of a huge change in the weather.
Congratulations to all the countrymen for this festival.
I urge you to take care of yourself during these festivals, take care of your health and take care of social interest.
This festival is an opportunity to make new decisions.
This festival should be an opportunity in our lives to make a resolve to move forward in the mission mode.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
The more you progress will be the progress of the country.
