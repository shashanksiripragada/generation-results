I have spoken three things to use them. If you do all three things then it is not good, it will be sure that the use of jewelry will be done.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages and new areas.
Then go to another place and give it three-four days there too.
This will give you the opportunity to learn a lot.
I would also hope that whenever you go there, share some photographs with me.
Have you seen new
Thousands of years ago, he campaigned to enter their temples and made them enter the temple.
We are really fortunate that in every age, great men have been born in us to overcome the evils of our society.
In other words, 'Sharam is Shiva' and I repeatedly say 'Sharmev Jayate'.
My best wishes, thanks.
In every corner of the country, most of the families are engaged in exams for their children.
The most interesting thing about Gurudev Rabindranath was that he was not only the first person in Asia in 1913 to be the Nobel Prize winner, the English also divided him into a nit mode and when the British had distinguished in Jallianwalabagh in 1919, Rabindranath was one of the great personalities and the others who had had a deep impact on the minds of the Government of India.
The vision of Jalivanawalabagh Square in the minds of a small child playing in a rocky condition in Kishore, a new motivation awakened and in 1919, the 12-year-old daughter-in-law Bhagat was the source of our inspiration - Shahid Bhagat Singh.
Today, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh had given his friend Sukhdeva and Rajguru to the British government in a hurricane and everyone knows that the incident on 23rd March was the spirit of serving Bharatmata (Maa Bharati) that day in the mouths of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
He dedicated all the dreams of life to the service of Mother India.
And these three brave martyrs are a source of inspiration today.
We cannot describe the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
There can be a good start for India.
75 years of Indias independence will be completed in 2022.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you today.
We can do this in our daily life.
See, brothers and sisters, There is a lot of pain in the minds of a student of the eleventh class.
No matter how many fools are being seen in the minds of the foam and waste.
I remember it a good symptom.
This is what I want to say that there should be a nation towards cleanliness in the minds of 1. 25 billion people.
Once there is a nation that is unsatisfactory, we will start doing something or the other against cleanliness.
It is a good thing that the travellers are spreading their lives, suggesting me and also telling me that they have failed by making a lot of efforts.
I know some youngsters who have launched such a campaign.
We don't even know about this kind of incident in our surroundings. Perhaps we are bothering to talk openly about it.
Whoever feels depression himself does not say anything because he remembers himself ashamed.
If he does not want to stay alone with you, then you will not let it happen.
This is an excellent way.
It will be the third year.
Millions of collective yoga festivals should be celebrated.
If you want to give some suggestions about the Third International Yoga Day then you must give me a mobile app and be my guide.
Make sure that the poems and poems of Yoga can be communicated as people can easily understand it.
I would like to say something to the mothers and sisters because today there is talk of health and there is a lot of discussion about health.
A few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
The working women in our country, their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing. It is welcome.
But they have some special responsibilities.
Earlier, the workforce women were given 12 weeks of maternal elimination during their pregnancy and now they were brought to 26 weeks.
There are probably two-three countries in the world who are ahead of us in this direction.
India has taken a very big and important decision for these sisters.
In the Narendraodi app, through Twitter, in the letter...
Whether it is a struggle with poverty, to protect from illness, to communicate with the world, to propagate knowledge or information, technology or science has created a special place for itself.
It is also a matter of great happiness that this is the 38th successful inspiration of the PSLV.
This is an important success in the defence sector and you will be happy to know that only 4 or 5 countries in the world have this capacity.
Two persons have worked very well for this and they have developed such a house that can save the house in such a situation.
Our country has received a lot of support in the last few days, 'Loki Urjak Yojana' and 'DG Dhan Business Scheme'.
More than 4,000 businessmen have been awarded Rs. 30,000.
They are understanding and encouraging with great zeal.
A young friend of Maharashtra, Puja Nemade, a graduate student, how he is using Rupay Card, e-allet etc. in his family and feelings about how much joy is being received by him.
And the prizes of one lakh rupees are so important for him but he has now taken this task as a campaign and inspired others for this work.
I urge the people of the country, especially the youth of the country and those who have received the awards under the scheme of Digi-Dhan Business scheme to take the leadership of this movement, whether you are the Ambassador or Ambassador of the country.
You are in a way of sanctity.
This is not just the production of pulses but the biggest service of the poor of my country.
We know that when a citizen of our country does something good, the entire country feels a new energy, the confidence of the country increases.
We all welcomed the performance of the Divyangjans of our country in Rio Paralympics.
This month, India lost Pakistan in the Undoor-20 World Cricket Finales and increased the glory of the country for the second consecutive world champion.
I once again congratulate all the team players.
The country is proud of this achievement of our Divyang friends.
I am very grateful to you for your partnership.
So, today when I talk to you, my eyes are drawing towards both the Mohans.
Today, when we are talking about festivals, India is preparing for another big festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but in the entire world.
We saw his entire life that he served the people of the community in South Africa who had been the heat of distinction and that time it was not a common thing.
He served those farmers who were discriminated in Champaran.
He lived not in language but in his life.
I believe that perhaps 130 crore people have imagination and 130 crore programmes.
It is that Nand Lal Bose, whose artistic arts enhance the audience of our Constitution.
It provides a new identity to the Constitution.
Once again, on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I hope for some pledge from every Indian.
For the country, for the society, for others, something or the other should be done.
This is the best, true and honest task towards Bapu.
The sons of Mother India, you will be remembered that for the last few years, we have been launching the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign across the country in about two weeks before 2nd October.
This time on 2nd October, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we should not only dedicate to him an open India but also to lay the foundation stone of a new mass movement against plastic all over the country.
I am happy to note that I am sure that I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I s
This means that water, food and integration are three ratnas on the earth.
But wicked people call stones as Ratna.
The glory of food in our culture is very high.
However, we have transformed the knowledge of food into science.
It is essential for women and children, especially because they are the foundations of our future in the society.
Under the POSHAN Abhiyan, nutrition is being made a mass movement in modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and wonderful systems.
Once one thing was brought to me.
This was a very good step that could be done in all the regions.
Friends, There are many such small things that can effectively fight against malnutrition.
Due to lack of awareness, the poor families and the affluent families are also affected today.
The month of September will be celebrated as a Poshan Abhiyan across the country.
There was a time when language was transformed and there was a small cordless device in the ears of Bear Grills.
After this program, many people are getting to talk about Jim Corbett National Park.
You should also visit places related to nature and forest life.
I have already told you that you must visit North East India once in your life.
On the 15th of August, I had requested you to visit at least 15 places in the next three years.
Last month, I got the opportunity to release the Tiger Report.
The number of tigers in India is now 2967.
But this is a New India, where we have fulfilled the goals very well.
I remember the Gir forests of Gujarat when I released the Tiger related data.
I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat at that time when the lion's residence in the Gir forest was being confined.
But now we have to go ahead of the conservation and think about the emotions.
We have to keep ourselves healthy and also keep the country healthy.
I know that all these missions will also take place in social media.
Let us move forward with a new spirit, a new resolve and a new energy.
I will wait for you and your opinions.
Let us all move forward to fulfil the dreams of our freedom fighters, to fulfil the dreams of Gandhiji-Swanta Sukhaya.
Let us move forward by making our inner joy as a service.
Thank you very much.
When I had announced about this, many teachers, innovators, students sent me a message, sent questions, suggested problems and talked about difficulties.
The strength of the society is felt only during the festival.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot see the exams in a proper way.
Lage, as it is, the question of life and life.
The exam that you are going to give is an exam of your reading course throughout the year.
This is not a test of your life.
You know his experience, his knowledge, his success.
Therefore, the burden of this number is sometimes preventing us from going to the right place.
Because it is usually a feeling that if the students want to sports, then their attention is lost by studying.
I don't know whether it would be true for everyone or not, but I have realized that this time it will be very beneficial for Deep Breathing.
No, don't yes, take the body as much as you need, which will not destroy your reading time.
This will help in enhancing reading power.
Your concentration unity will increase.
You will feel satisfaction.
Your skills will grow over a large scale.
Whenever I convene election meetings, I have a necklace.
A folk singer came to meet me.
Your youngsters, you have prepared for the test and I have binded you in mind.
Therefore, as much as I advise your parents not to generate weight, it is also being implemented on me.
Let us make an exam a festival to pass every exam.
After that, the examination will never be tested.
Please move forward with this mantra.
"Man Ki Baat" provides me a great opportunity to connect with you.
Congratulations to Bahtu Bahu.
It is said in his stories that Jesus stood near the house of a temple.
Today, in the form of a gift, the people of the country are going to get the benefit of two schemes.
Two new schemes are going to be started.
In the entire country, be it villages or cities, be it studying or illiterate, how can cash-free transactions be done without any cash.
Therefore, to create e-Payment practices, the Government of India is going to launch the Incentive Scheme for Small Businesses from today.
In order to encourage the producers, the scheme is to promote 'Laki Gharak Yojana' and 'DG Dhan Business Scheme' to promote businessmen.
Everyday, 15,000 people are going to get awards for writing thousands of rupees.
This award will be a part of the scheme with 30 crore people.
In the last few days, cash transactions have increased by 200 to 300.
The country like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youngsters have made a lot of progress in start-ups.
This digital development is a golden opportunity.
Our youngsters, with new emotions and ideas, with new technologies, with new systems, with new systems, we must be associated with the entire campaign to free the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I appeal to the people of Mann Ki Baat every month before their suggestions and their ideas.
Whenever I saw these things, I would say that I divide them into three parts.
This law will also work on its own in the coming days.
Whatever we have to do for the benefit of the country, for the welfare of the people, we are prioritized.
India is ranked third in 2016-18 as per the Investment Report.
The participation of students in such a large number of board exams indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to reach new heights of development through education, for the bright future.
I congratulate the students for their enthusiasm and congratulations to their parents, their friends and friends, their teachers and the faces of all villages.
Brothers and sisters, This time, I am telling the people of Mann Ki Baat that the opinions of everyone are unanimous.
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation, there is a lot of efforts to mislead you.
Their capabilities were identified.
Today, once again they have accepted this challenge and I am confident that the resolve and inclusive efforts of 1. 25 billion people will reflect this nation as a new energy.
But the evil is so wide that even now some people do not have any bad habits.
Even now, some people feel that the money of this corruption, the money of this black money, the amount of money, the money of this benami will be taken back to the system.
They have moved on the way to protect their wealth.
It is a matter of sadness that they also liked the way they used to the poor.
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, by collecting money in their accounts or by doing some work by them.
A lot of laws have been made for Benami property and there will be a lot of difficulty in the system.
The government does not want any problem for the people of the country.
Mr. Ashish from Madhya Pradesh praised the war against corruption and black money, and said in the telephone: Agya Bazar, my name is blessed.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village in Tirali Tehsil of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
This is the strength of my country, in which there is also the truth of service mood, sacrifice mood.
During the election, I was discussing 'Chai' and it was spread all over the world.
The people of many countries of the world also learned to discuss in tea.
There was no festivity, no jewellery, because there was some financial difficulties due to the closure of the note.
It was also honoured by the pilgrims.
Surat's Bharat Maru and Daksa Paramar - they have contributed against corruption, against black money, to the war that is going on, it is inspiring.
I bless the newly married Bharat and Daksa and convey my best wishes to them for converting the wedding occasion into this great yagya and converting it into a new occasion.
Friends, You are my real sepoy.
I know that all of you are active in this great task.
Once the people used Rupee cards, the poor will bless you.
He told the common man that he might be free from all concerns.
I believe that if all the youngsters of India are engaged in this work then it will not take much time.
In a month, we can stand in the form of a new modern India in front of the world.
We should take forward this struggle to free the country from corruption and black money.
People from afar will feel that Indian people are the other name of the festival and it is natural.
Deepawali's Deepawali is a shadow of darkness in the Deepawali society, the darkness of the individuals who are individuals are free from these is the festival of Deepawali's Deepawali.
We all are well aware of the fact that if we go to any place in India, go to the house of the rich, go to the poorest of the poor, we can see the cleanliness drive in every family on the Deepawali festival.
I mean to say that the festival of light is going to be a source of inspiration for the world to move from darkness to light.
When we are celebrating Deepawali, somebody is standing in the lake, somebody is engaged in the security of the Himalayas, somebody is protecting the airport.
Besides, I would like to say that along with the army officers and soldiers, his family members also sacrifice a lot.
In a way, the entire armed forces are getting very good messages and I want to make you appy Diwali too.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the army are not only on the border but also on every field of life.
It is the need of time to fulfil the hopes that have been created among the poor people of the country.
In the 21st century, the darkness of the villages will not run anymore.
Sardar Saheb has given us an India and the responsibility of all of us is to make it a Best India.
The basic mantra of unity creates a strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
Sardar Saheb was not only a person in the struggle but also a creative person.
On this Ekta Diwas, on October 30, wherever we are, we will be committed to remembering Sardar Saheb and unity.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is a festival of light in this festival of Deepavali.
My dear countrymen, once again dedicate this Diwali to the soldiers of the country.
My dear countrymen, salute all of you.
A few days ago, we have lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I bow down to all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
Citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the power of anti-national forces and soon after knowing the truth they have come out of the path of peace by distinguishing themselves from such people.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would also say that the attraction of the people of the country has a huge value.
This time, a few people would have known how this disabled person has shown his valour in Paralimpics.
Not only that, I was surprised to note that among the Divyangs who had stayed in the fourth position and had not received any medals, they took less time than the Gold Medal among the Commonwealth Competitioners.
Congratulations to those who have done this work, congratulations to those who have tried to do this.
I urge the countrymen to free the country from this problem for the respect of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children.
Let us move with our resolve.
They worked hard and contributed to the construction of about 9,000 toilets.
The ordinary citizens of this country, the common man inspires me somehow.
What is the aspirations of the common man of this country
To celebrate Navratri and Durga Puja with peace, unity, harmony to take the country to new heights of improvement.
He played an important role in bringing India a gold medal in 1928, in 1932, in the Olympics Games in 1936.
We all know the name of the cricket lover Bradman.
The reading of these messages of the people has become a source of inspiration for me.
A Shri Ajit Singh has written in the NarendraodiAp: This time, tell us about their participation in the education and sports of daughters in Mann Ki Baat because they have won medals in Rio Olympics.
Thousands of people have almost shown this kind of thinking.
It will not be acknowledged that we have not performed our hopes.
In some events, it has happened that our sportspersons did not reach the same level and only two medals were received in the medal list.
But it is also true that despite not getting the medals, Indias sportspersons have performed very well for the first time in many games.
Something like this is associated with Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna in Tenniser.
Many sportspersons are examples of Aditya Ashoka, Ayurveda Naal, Atanu Das, whose performance was good.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
If we do what we have done, we may have to be resurrected again.
I have announced the formation of a committee.
They dedicate their lives to their disciples, to their students.
The contribution of teachers in our lives is always felt.
There he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only that, he used to say that the best teacher is the one who is never in the inner student.
You will also have experiences like me.
Your teachers will change the vision of all teachers and their pride will increase.
It is our responsibility to enhance the pride of teachers in the society.
We all hope that the lives of our country, our society, our families, every individual will be lost.
We are still living in a free India.
Therefore, we should move forward in the direction of the Surajya by taking this mantra of 'Swarajya Our Rights' at the Public Ganesh Festival.
May the State be our priority.
Can we not propagate this message through public ganesh festivals
Instead, why should not the village use the Ganesh statue built on the ground of Pokhari
The idol built in the Plaster of Paris has adverse effects on the environment.
And with him, many more have expressed this discourse.
I also urge all of you to use the idols of the soil, why should we not revive our ancient traditions
The Lord Ganesh destroyed the rebellion.
So we are persuaded to create such genes which will create a rivalry.
From saints, from Muni sages, from great men, we are always learning something or the other.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the friends of the airplane that they have contributed to the foreign policy of the country.
My dear countrymen, you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Minister but I am a human like you.
You can imagine that an ordinary teacher, an aged woman, a poor mother, is giving 50 thousand rupees to get rid of smoke and gas connections. This is not a small thing.
More than 50 thousand rupees is not big, it is the feeling of mothers and the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters.
Those people who are trying to create disturbances in Kashmir by foiling these small children, they will have to be responsible for this child.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen and enhance the importance of unity, whenever the country can enhance its future.
I believe in the strength of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Today, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, we used to think about pearls but today the rains are also enjoyed and the news of floods is also coming.
Sometimes such a disease occurs due to which we have to live for the entire life.
But if we are aware, be cautious, be careful then it is very easy to escape from it.
Keep an eye on cleanliness, observe observation and safety, give special attention to the children.
We must understand that the first attack on the dengue prosperous area.
You might have seen television reports, but sometimes we nurture eternal moods in taking steps to take care of them.
Nearly 3 crore women are pregnant every year in our country, but some mothers die during death.
My doctors and sisters cannot do this work for the poor for 12 days a year
In Gita, Lord Krishna said, "Ashwatha: Sarvathanang" means that I am Ashwatha among all trees.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims visited the Ambaji Temple in the month of Bhadrava.
Those who know about the land of Rajasthan can understand how big it is.
This year, Gujarat has launched a campaign to plant crores of trees by taking several projects like forests, unity forests, martyr forests etc. as a forest festival.
I cannot mention all the states but they are greetings.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa in the last few days.
This was my first visit, there is a policy in foreign travels, business discussions are being discussed, security discussions are being discussed.
But what I want to say is that this time I got the opportunity to meet such great personalities who have sacrificed their youth for equal opportunities.
The Indians, but wherever they went, they were ready to sacrifice their lives.
Let us proud of these Indians who have made our lives in life even in South Africa.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to him for giving me a message to industrialist Burma.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country who has been born in independent India.

My best wishes and my best wishes.
This becomes the reason for the economic activities of the poor people of the society.
He did such an extraordinary work that the news paper was published by him.
But there are millions of Deep Singhs in the country who are doing some good work in their own way.
When we look at a huge form, such emotions are created.
Who can forget the incident of Mother Yashoda and Shri Krishna when the child Krishna had opened his mouth and when Mother Yashoda had visited the whole world, he felt that strength.
I couldn't do everything myself.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedarnath, I am able to experience your efforts to emphasize on positive things.
The letters for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are being received are completely different from the official work.
People have asked something, but I have not seen anything like this for myself in the last five years.
And you have given me the opportunity to say again.
That is why the entire country has given a whole election not for its own interest but for the protection of democracy.
Their hard work has resulted in more votes than last time.
You will be surprised to know that the employees of the Election Commission had to travel for two days to reach there.
Voting centres at the top of the world are also in India.
The Centre is at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahole-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Though these stories are about a hundred years ago, but the relevance of these stories is similar to that even today.
I had a different experience after reading these things.
As reading is going on, I would like to say that in one of the media, I was studying about the library of Kerala.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village in the dense forests of Idukki.
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I will also urge you to extract some time and place your daily life.
A few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I wrote a letter to Sarpanch and Village Heads of the entire country.
In order to save water, collect every drop of rain, they should organize a village house and interact with the people of the village.
Come on, we are talking like this.
Let us sit together and serve the responsibility of life by using Mann Ki Baat.
On seeing the motor, the identity of the National Army Memorial will be such a place where people will come here to get information about the great martyrs of the country, express their gratitude and research on them.
Last year in October, I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
This is also a reflection of our thinking in which we believe that the country should express gratitude to those men and women police personnel who are unnecessarily engaged in our security work.
These two great personalities have not only brightened the name of Jharkhand but also the entire country.
The whole country is grateful to him for his contribution.

He has done a big job by connecting this rare painting with modern youth.
You will be surprised to know about Tao Porchon-Lynch of the United States.
I realized how many changes are being made by this scheme in the lives of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to you for this sacred festival of Shivratri.
I myself will be a beneficiary in this election.
Recognizing the healthy democratic tradition, the next Mann Ki Baat will be the day of the end of May.
That is, after taking all the feelings of the month of March, April and May these three months, I will start talking with you through Mann Ki Baat with the strength of your blessings with a new belief.
I once again express my heartfelt thanks to you.

But I want to say that Gurudev was also a painter.
The Dohas of Saint Ravidas are very famous.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi.

He used to say, "Man Changa to Kathauti My Ganga" meaning if your mind and heart are sacred then God himself lives in your hearts.
The message of Saint Ravidas has affected the people of every section of the society, be it the queen of Chittor, be it the queen of Chittor, be it the queen of Miraba.

From the beginning of this year, he was honored with 'Padmashree'.

Wouldn't we inspire us to hear about such achievements
The people of Prayagraj are very excited for the Kumbh.
He got the strength and inspiration from Bapu to live in jail for so many years.

I have spent nearly 40-45 years of royal life and have travelled to most of the districts of the country and have spent a long time in remote districts of the country.

Let us take this journey forward.
