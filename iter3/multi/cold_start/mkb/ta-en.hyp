Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
In particular, it is not that only the Indian community participates in it.
Now many governments, citizens and social movements are also celebrating Deepawali with full humility and enthusiasm.
In a way, it can also be said that there is a country of India.
Friends, There is an attraction of festival tourism in the world.
There are many possibilities for tourism in this festival.
Whatever the festivals like Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu should be our efforts, we must collectively share it.
Various festivals are held in every state and every part of our country, in which people from other countries have a lot of nations.
Therefore, the role of Indians living abroad is very important in expanding the festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we decided to do something different on this island.
We all had said that on this island, we would celebrate the strength and achievements of the women of India, that is, we would respect the people of India or not
In a few days, many stories inspired by the social media have started drowning.
Ramesh ji has said that his mother is his power in Namo App.
In the year 1990, at the time of my father's time, my mother accepted the gold to maintain five children.
Today, we are sitting in good work with five brothers.
Ramesh ji, my best wishes to your mother.
The next time, Githika Swami, who is very interested in the tweet, has said that Major Khushboo Kanwar is the mother of India.
As regards Kavita Divadi ji, the mother of India is her daughter and she gives her power.
The mother is very proud of her daughter being a lovely painting.
Moreover, he has got good values in the legal entrance election of CLAT.
People are sharing such information.
You must read, get inspired, share something that is in your greetings like those who are present in it, and I convey my respect to all these saints of India on this occasion.
We see that the foundation of this was laid by him in the 17th century.
My dear countrymen, this year will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji all over the world on 12th November.
The impact of Guru Nanakdev ji is spread not only in India but also in the entire world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters are living in many countries of the world, who have dedicated themselves to the higher objectives of Guru Nanakdev.
I can't forget that I went to Gurudwaras in Venguwar and Tehran.
Several things have been shared about Shri Guru Nanakdev Ji, but they will need a lot of parts of Mann Ki Baat.
Nanakdev ji believed to have served more than all.
Guru Nanakdev ji believed that selfless service was worthless.
He made a strong voice against social evils such as evil.
The message of Shri Guru Nanakdev ji spread across the world.
He was one of those who travelled in his time.
He went to many places, wherever he goes, through his simplicity and work, he will win the hearts of all.
Guru Nanakdev ji had taken several important visits, which are called Udasi.
He took the messages of harmony and equality from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from all sides, from all places to the people of all places, from the sovereignty and pilgrimage.
It is believed that the renowned sacred Shankardev ji of Assam was also inspired by him.
He made a pilgrimage to the holy land of Haridwar.
It is said that Gurubagh, a sacred place of Kashi, lived in Guru Nanakdev in Gurudwara.
He has also visited pilgrimages like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanakdev ji has travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During his visit to Pithar in Karnataka, Guru Nanakdev had resolved the water conservation there.
It reminds us that a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Sahab is in Bihar, which was dedicated to him.
At a time, Guru Nanak ji traveled in the north, Kashmir and nearby areas.
This led to a strong link between the Sikhs and Kashmir.
Guru Nanakdev visited Tibet and the people there accepted him as a Guru.
He is also worshipped in the country of Uzbekistan.
As part of his pilgrimage, he has visited a large number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He took a place in the minds of millions of people, he was following his teachings with full compassion and is still following it.
A few days ago, government ambassadors from about 85 countries went from Delhi to Amrudesharas.
They visited the Golden Temple and all of them took place on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
On this day, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man of India, was born, who was the daughter of the country who joined the country.
Sardar Patel had a wonderful talent to integrate the people, while there was a ability to consolidate with those who had a difference of opinion.
He's actually a man of Detail, sympathetic.
Besides, there is expertise in organisational activities.
The creation of plans and formulation of strategies has given him the art.
When we read about Sardar ji's functioning, we can know how strong his plan was.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country came to attend the Congress Conference in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the arrangements of the conference were imposed on Sardar Ji.
He used this opportunity to improve the city's drinking water network.
He asserted that no one should have water deficit.
He interacted with the farmers and urged them to make cash paise.
At the same time, there was a substantial increase in leather sales.
Our country will be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constitution.
He was of the importance of determining the basic rights, which has not led to any inequality on the basis of caste and religion.
Friends, As the first Home Minister of the country, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji succeeded in a fascinating attempt to integrate the embankments in a big history of gold.
In fact, while we talk about Sardar Patels efforts, we only talk about his contribution to some specific areas in integrating the country.
With Sardar Patel received this news, he did not delay a moment and immediately undertaken a serious action.
He was ordered and immediately flew off, and when he was watching, the enemy's evil willingness to capture Lakshadweep was thrown into soil.
After this incident, Sardar Patel called upon the brothers to ensure that all necessary assistance is being made for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep has been contributing significantly to Indias progress.
This is an attractive tourist spot.
I am confident that all of you will visit its beautiful islands and seashores.
My dear countrymen, the statue of Unity was dedicated to the nation and the world in recognition of Sardar Ayya on 31st October, 2018.
This is the world's largest statue.
This is a statue of two shares higher than the statue of independent goddess in America.
Every Indian is proud of being the world's highest statue.
Every Indian's head is proud.
I am happy that more than 26 lakh tourists have come to see the statue of unity in the same year.
Similarly, every day 8500 people have seen the pride of unity.
It is observed that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has faith and dedication in the hearts of these people.
Now there are several attractive centres like Sapathikuli Gardens, Battambuchi Gardens, Forest Culture, Children's Nutrition Park, Unity Narsari, which have improved the economy of the region, new opportunities for employment for the people.
Friends, This idol of unity can be a testimony for all the states for the country and for tourism sector.
We all are witnesses how one place can become a world-renowned tourist destination within a year.
There are people from our country and those from abroad.
A number of such organizations are developing one after another, transportation, shelter, guides and environment friendly organisations.
I also urge you to go to see the statue of Unity by extracting your priceless time.
But at the same time, I reiterate my request that every Indian who travels and his family should visit at least 15 places in India and stay there at night.
Friends, You must be aware that from 2014, we are following 31st October as a nation unity day.
On this day, it gives us the message of saving the price of unity, unity and security of our country.
On the 31st of October, the event of unity is being organised every year.
This will include all sections of the society and every section of the society.
In this way, this drive is being implemented not only for physical, but also for inner and friendly, for Indias unity and to touch new heights.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel joined the country with the help of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a fortnight in our lives and in a diverse country like India, we must keep on inclusive of this mantra of unity at every stage, at every stage, at every stage, at every step, at every step, at every step.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very constructive and awakening to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around us, there will be many examples of those who are engaged in sustainable activity to promote mutual harmony.
But in many times, the efforts of the society, its contribution, and the memories are not very quickly disappeared.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court gave its decision on Ramjanmabhumi issue.
But after the decision on Ramjanmabhumi was made, the then government, political parties, social organisations, representatives of all religions and saints and sages were very quiet and middle-class comments.
This is an attempt to reduce the pressure in the environment.
Those days, those moments remind us of our duties.
This is an example of how much harmony is to the nation.
He is also 125 crore Indians.
But there is a pleasant experience and fun experience.
I heard that why shouldn't share with you, I share.
Just imagine that the world's highest battlefield is 50-60 degrees below the temperature.
There is only a name of life in the air.
In such a opposite situation, living among such challenges is not less than any warm act.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the boundaries but also organising a Clean Siachen movement.
I extend my appreciation to the people of the country for this wonderful responsibility of the Indian Army and express my gratitude to them.
It is difficult to miss any thing in the winter there.
In such a situation, it is very important to analyze the cup wages and make arrangements for it.
If there is such an environmental system then it is a life of rare species like snowy animals and there are rare animals like ibex, brown bears.
My dear countrymen, festivals are not a new awareness in the lives of all of us.
Moreover, on the day of Deepawali, especially on the occasion of buying something new, bringing something from the market, it is almost happening in every family.
I had once told you that we should try to buy local goods.
What is the need to go to the local level if we get the necessary material in our village
What is the need to go to the district level if a thing is available at the regional level
The more we are trying to buy the locally available goods, Gandhi himself will be a great opportunity for 150.
I reiterate my request to buy something or the other in the hands of our weavers, the dressed clothes of our weavers and the dressers.
I urge you to convey my best wishes to Deepawali and also to make us more interested in buying local goods.
Through this, we have to show how important contribution we can contribute to fulfill the dreams of Gandhiji.
Once again I convey my best wishes to Deepavali.
On the day of Deepa, we burn a variety of drunkennesses.
However, sometimes it is harmful because of our carelessness.
It hurts.
Therefore, I would like to ask you to protect yourselves and also celebrate the festivals.
My best wishes to Deepawali.
Thank you very much.
He is always ready to express his happiness and express his support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated the success of the bravery of the Parakram Parv.
We were reminded of the accurate attack in 2016, and our military responded strongly to the conscious war against our nation in the radical war.
Our soldiers have organized exhibitions in different parts of the country to inform the citizens of the country, especially the youth of our country about the power.
See how talented we are, how our soldiers keep their lives alive and protect our countrymen.
One day such as the Parakram Mount reminds the youth of the glorious tradition of our soldiers.
Moreover, we are inspired to ensure unity and unity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, a brave Rajasthan.
It has now been decided that those who are trying to contribute to the peace and development environment of our country, our army will give them a strong response.
India has given its commitment to maintaining peace and dedication.
In the two world wars of the 20th century, more than one lakh soldiers have sacrificed their great sacrifices for peace, even in those wars, we have no connection.
This is also a warfare by our military in the direction of peace.
Our brave soldiers have been wearing blue helmets for years and have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world.
My dear countrymen, things related to heaven will be different.
In this regard, it is not surprising that Indian Air Forces are attracting the attention of every countrymen by expressing their energy in the sky.
They have given us a security feeling.
On the occasion of Independence Day, aeroplane is one of the aspirations of the people with imagination and willingness of the Paradise, in which our Air Force will showcase their strength with depression.
We are celebrating Air Force Day on 8th October.
In 1932, our Air Force, which started a small start with 6 airplanes and 19 Air Forces, has now been ranked among the most powerful and powerful Air Forces of the 21st century.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Air Forces and their families who have provided their service to the nation.
In the year 1947, when the Pakistanis attacked in an unopposed manner, our Air Force decided to protect Sri Nagar from the invaders, and landed the weapons and war basements of Indian soldiers at the right time.
The Air Force gave a strong response to the enemies in the year 1965.
Tell me who doesn't know about the 1971 Bangladesh freedom struggle
In Tiger Hill, all the enemies were hiding at night as well as raining at night, they covered the soil.
The country is grateful to the Air Force for the excellent functions of our Air Force, be it rescue and relief operations and disaster arrangements.
Their feelings are marvellous to tackle all the calamities ranging from cyclone, heat, flood and forest islands and help the people of the country.
Air Forces have made a symbol of gender equality in the country and have opened doors for women in each of their departments.
Now there is a transformation of women to join the Air Force and sustainable work with short-term work and I had made this announcement on 15th August this year from the Red Fort.
We can proudly say that the contribution of women's power not only to the military forces of the Indian Army, but also the contribution of women's power is increasing.
Women are powerful, but now they are becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, in the past, one of our navy officers was facing the struggle of Abhilash Tommy and Live Sava.
The entire country was worried about how to save Tommy.
You know Abhilash Tommy is a very compassionate officer.
He was an individual, the first Indian to travel to a small boat without any modern technological help and visit the world.
Over the last 80 days, he was moving forward to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the southern part of the Indian Ocean, without reducing his speed in the ocean.
He was a marvellous example of compassion, psychologicalism and compassion, and a few days ago, when I brought the aspiration out of the sea and talked to him through a phone.
I have already met Tommy.
I pray for the good health of Abhilash Tommy, his compassion, his tradition, his perspective, his persistence, the power of fighting, will definitely inspire our youth.
My dear countrymen, every child of the country knows the importance of our nation on October 2.
There is another significance on October 2 this year.
Now, on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we are organising several events all over the world.
The ideas of Gandhiji have inspired the entire world.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another important work of devotional farming.
In 1941, Gandhiji started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
Later, when the freedom struggle in 1945 was intensified, he prepared a compilation of those thoughts.
He put forward his views on various matters such as protection, cleanliness and dissemination of education, the rights of respected farming, farmers, villages and workers.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Everyone has experienced this in the most unique form of his individuality.
Everyone is very important for the country, he has created a feeling of inevitableness for every person.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was to convert it into a mass movement.
In the freedom struggle, all sections of the society and all sections of the society took their own initiatives.
What does she say, "I give you a coffee sweetness, whenever you feel doubtful, you are in yourselves, take this synthesis - whoever is poorer and weak, see that man, remember his face, listen to your mind, whatever you have to do, how much it will be be beneficial for him.
This will illuminate his life and future
My dear countrymen, this protection of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class of the country, the increasing economic power of the people, the buying power of the developing people...
If we go to buy something, can we remember her for an hour
Could you remember that defence of bread
Happiness in the face of whom
Who will benefit directly or indirectly by buying you
And if it benefits the poor, then my joy shall be strengthened.
Keep in mind the mantra of Gandhiji, when we all buy something, when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, whenever we buy everything, whenever we buy everything, we should do something good, especially whoever thinks of making this thing, whoever invests his money, whoever sows his capabilities in it, all of them should get some benefit.
He might have been unaware of how this would happen, but this happened and India got freedom.
Just like this, today, we can see how to contribute to the power of the poor to fight against poverty in the economic development of my country.
But today, I think that this is the real patriotism that will be the correspondence that we can give to the harvest.
He said that all these rocks are dried with very difficulty and every filth of them should be used.
And it came to pass, that the nation was taught, and the foolishness among the people of the country, and the small idol was mixed in every nerve of the gentleman.
We are going to celebrate two days after the birth anniversary of Shastri ji along with a dedicated tear.
His desire to be Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is a symbol of his narrow personality.
As a result of his unhealthy integrity towards the nation, he was able to give a mantra of success to the soldiers and farmers of the country in a short span of about one and a half years.
Millions of people have joined themselves in this movement and I got an opportunity to serve with the children of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
The foundation for that school is the respected Baba Saheb.
All kinds of people from all over the country were engaged in this service on 15th.
Even the organisations have contributed very enthusiasticly.
School children, college students, national students, national welfare programmes, youth organisations, media groups and corporates all served in a big way.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those who want cleanliness for their contribution.
Come on, let's hear a phone call.
But if you didn't call on the phone how it was for you after toilets, you might have been able to see the attention of the people associated with this movement.
I express my gratitude to you in a special way.
My heartfelt countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in our country but also in the world.
This time, India is organising the world's largest Swachhta Sammelan in an unforgettable history.
At the Mahatma Gandhi International Swachhta Sammelan, Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, Health Ministers and departmental experts from all over the world share their experiences and tests on cleanliness together.
The Closing Ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Cleanliness Conclave will be held on 2nd October this year at the inauguration of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Brothers.
The Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar has a number of suggestions to protect the basic rights of the poor.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 1993, in accordance with this vision.
The commission has been set up and completed in a few days after 25 years.
The Commission is not only protecting human rights but also working to improve human dignity.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, the close leader of our hearts, said that human rights are not a foreign principle for us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Authority, the policy of the Vedic times, Sarve Pavandhu Sukina: is recorded.
The Commission has made widespread awareness about human rights, but has contributed to preventing its misuse.
This 25-year visit has created a hopeful and hopeful environment to the people of the country.
It provides a healthy society and a reliable democratic values.
Today, along with the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions are also operating.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and follow it in practice and this is the source of progress for all and all.
My dear countrymen, in the month of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji and Rajmata Vijayraje Scindia ji are coming to the beginning of the birth centenary.
All these gentlemen have inspired us, we will remember them.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar ji is coming and I will talk about this in the next Mann Ki Baat, but if I want to mention it today, then for a few years, Sardar ji's birth anniversary is being organised in every small town, region and villages of India on 31st October.
This year we have to make efforts to organise this drive for unity in our villages, regions, cities and cities.
The drive for unity is the best way to think of Sardar ji, because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge all of you to give strength to our efforts to unite every section of the society, every unity and unity of the country through the drive for unity on October 31 this will be a special tribute to him.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, Rakshabandhan is celebrating the festival all over the country.
My best wishes to all the nations on this auspicious day.
Rakshabandhan has been inspiring the love and faith between the sisters and brothers.
This festival is also a great example of social harmony for centuries.
There are many special stories in the history of the country that have been associated with two different regions or faith of the people of religion.
After a few days, Janmashtami is coming.
All over the environment, elephants, horses, teeth-jay Kanhaiyalal ki and govinda-Govinda are singing the voice.
The joy of commemorating in Sri Krishna devotion is all the joy.
Our youth would have been making arrangements for Teh-Handi in many parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen, Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
My heartfelt gratitude to you, sister Sinmai, for introducing a special thing.
Friends, Besides Rakshabandhan, we are celebrating Sanskrit Day on the occasion of Chiravana Purnami.
I extend my best wishes to all those who have dedicated themselves to bring this great treasure to the people of Marukoti and to the common man.
There is a significance of every language.
Everyone in India is proud of the ancient language of Tamil language in the world
Similarly, from Vedic times to today, we all are proud of the contribution of cultural language and knowledge to the spread of wisdom.
The wisdom, which is connected to every field of life, is inspired in Samskrit language and its literature.
Whether it is science, technology, agriculture, well-being, aeroplane, architecture, architecture, music, management, economic or environment.
It is a pleasure to all of you to know that the people of Madur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are still using the culture as a case language.
The possibility of creating individuals of the IR thousand words, i.e. prefix, 22 seats, i.e. sufix and societies, is in Sanskrit.
That is why any adventurous feeling or matter can be described in accurate manner.
We always remember Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji.
We are celebrating his birthday as Teacher's Day throughout the country.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the coming Teachers Day.
I also convey my best wishes to the teachers in science, education and the spirit of dedication to the students.
My dear countrymen, this rainy season has brought hopes to our farmers who work hard.
It is natural that there is more rainfall than other places in some places.
We all have seen how worst the lives of the people were affected by the severe floods in Kerala.
While we cannot fulfill their sorrow, I am confident that 125 crore Indians stand shoulder with you in this moment of sorrow.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity should get better quickly.
Everyone is determined about how to reduce the difficulties of the people of Kerala and how to share their sorrows.
We know that the soldiers were the heroes of rescue work in Kerala.
They did not leave any attempt to save the Sikh people in the flood.
All the Air Force, Navy, Army, Border Defence Force, Central Industries Defence Force and Expedition have contributed to this movement.
In particular, at this time, I would like to mention the hard work of the NDRF Surats.
Yesterday, the festival of Omam was celebrated and we urge all of us to expedite the impact of this disaster to strengthen the country, particularly Kerala.
Once again I assure all the people of the country, the people of Kerala and all the people of the country who are suffering from disasters that the entire country is close to you and is helping you.
My dear countrymen
This time I was watching the suggestions for Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen that the people of the country have written more about what it is - that is, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, the beloved of all of us.
Ghaziabad's Kirti, Swadi Vatsa, brothers of Kerala, Praveen from West Bengal, Dr.
MyGov and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have asked me to talk about the diversity of the life of Atal ji, Akhilesh Pandey of Bihar's Kadihar.
On August 16, the country and the world heard the time of Atal ji and drowned in sadness.
He pursued the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, he had been away from extreme politics for the past decades.
He did not get a place in the news, he lived away from public life.
Though the New Year is a big gap, the country and the world have seen no gap in the minds of the common Indians after the 16th of August.
The love, compassion and grief that Atal has emerged for them in the country shows his vast personality.
In the past few days, Atal ji's most important qualities were emerged in front of the country.
The people recalled him as the best member of the Parliament, a well-known speaker, and recalled him as the Prime Minister of the people.
Atal would have been grateful to them for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
But today I want to tell you about another dimension of Atal ji's broad governance, and to touch it, the political culture that Atal ji gave to India, the efforts made to change it and the striving of it in an organised manner will be very beneficial in the days to come.
It's sure.
India would have been grateful for the 91st Constitutional Amendment in 2003.
This change has led to two significant changes in Indian politics.
Firstly, the number of ministers of the States should be only 15 percent of the total number of members of the Legislative Assembly.
Secondly, in accordance with the anti-party law, he raised the size of one-third of the previous members and made two-thirds of the members.
Further, clear norms have been enacted to ensure the post of members of the party's attack.
For decades, there has been a political culture of establishing a large number of cabinets in India, and these big cabinets were established not to share the work, but to maintain the political leaders.
Atal ji changed this situation.
Due to this activity, money and expenditure were saved.
Moreover, there has been improvement in performance.
It was possible only by a procedure like Atal ji, and the healthy tradition of our political culture started living.
Atal ji is a real patriot.
During his tenure, it was changed when the budget was submitted.
Earlier, the budget was submitted in the evening at 5 o'clock in accordance with the British methods.
In 2001, Atal ji made the time to submit the budget from 5 pm to 11 in the morning.
Like this, today you are watching discussions about conducting elections at the same time with the central government and the state governments in the country.
On this occasion, I dedicate to Atal ji on behalf of us and on behalf of us on this occasion that we are committed to fulfilling his dream of a fulfilment and developmental India.
When the talk about the Parliament arises, it is spoken about the confrontation, shouting and dissolution, but if it happens well, it does not speak much about it.
A few days ago, the monsoon session of Parliament was concluded.
You will be happy to know that the creativity of the Lok Sabha was 118 percent and the creativity of the Rajya Sabha was 74 percent.
All the MPs tried to make the monsoon session more useful to cross party differences, resulting in the passage of 21 bills in the Lok Sabha and 14 bills in the Rajya Sabha.
The Monsoon Session of the two Houses will always be remembered for social justice and youth welfare.
In this session, several important bills were passed for the welfare of the youth and the backward classes.
This initiative will help in achieving the objective of social justice.
Amendment Bill has also been passed to protect the rights of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will further protect the interests of the lower and tribal communities.
Moreover, the crime prevents the evils of the wicked, and gives confidence in the minds of the underprivileged.
Any civil society cannot bear the injustice committed against women's power.
The country is not ready to bear the victims of sexual oppression
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and has made strict punishment.
You might have read a few days ago that a court in Mandsore, Madhya Pradesh, had tried to prosecute the case within two months and sentenced the girl to death for two offenders, including sexual penalties.
Earlier, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh completed the investigation in just five days and punished the culprits.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have given judgments quickly in such cases.
The Act will enhance the crimes committed against women and girls.
When we move forward on the welfare of the country, we can transform the lives of the poor, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the underprivileged and the underprivileged.
This time in the rainy season, a special model was set up in collaboration with all.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Parliamentarians of the country.
In today's days, the attention of millions of people is also on the Asian Games in Jharda.
Every day, in public newspapers, televisions, news and social networks, it is that any Indian soldier has won the medal.
Asian sports competitions are now going on.
I would like to congratulate all the sportspersons who have won medals for the nation.
I convey my best wishes to the sportspersons who are participating in the competition.
India's sportspersons, especially in the shooting competition and mortality competition, but our sportspersons are also receiving medals in the fields of Wushu competition and boat competition.
These are not medals - the testimony of the hopes and dreams of Indian sportspersons and sportspersons.
Our women are also present in the increasing number of medals for the nation, this is a very positive symptom.
As much as the medal winners will be among the young sportspersons of the age group of 15-16.
My best wishes to all on National Sports Day.
We all have seen building houses and buildings with bricks, but about 1200 years ago, you can imagine that a vast mountain has been engraved as a single mountain, a very special, broad and wonderful temple, which has been imagined, but this temple has also happened, that is also the temple of Kailashnath in Ellora of Maharashtra.
Indias land has been an engineering testing platform.
Several engineers have emerged in India, they have achieved what they cannot imagine and have given examples that are known as marvellous in the engineering world.
Millions of farmers and common people are benefiting from the Krishnaraj Sagar Dam, which was constructed by him on the banks of the River Ganga.
He is considered to be a sacred person in these parts of the country and the country also gives him respectfully.
In his memory, we are following the 15th of September as Engineers Day.
The engineers of our country have made a single seal all over the world on the path shown by him.
While we talk about the wonders of the engineering world, it is reminded of an incident that took place in 2001 when there was a terrible earthquake in the Kutch region of Gujarat.
When I was working as a self-sufficient hero, I got the opportunity to go to a village and I met a chicken pox over the age of 100.
He was listening to me, calling my house to be a park in the Par-Katch area.
He further said that this house has seen 3 landscapes.
I have met 3 landslides.
I have realized them in this house itself.
But there is no effect anywhere.
Several centuries ago, the engineers of that period had built all the buildings in accordance with the regional environment and that was why the public could live safely.
Today, when we observe engineering day, we have to think for the future.
The world is affected by natural calamities.
Let us meet in the voice of mind, let us speak openly, let us take the country forward by our minds, let us be united.
With this spirit, my best wishes to all of you.
Thank you.
Let's meet again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
My dear countrymen, salute.
Although the vastness and diversity of India is on the one hand, sometimes the rain shows its distinction.
But why should we reduce the rain
As a result, nature shows its anger sometimes.
Therefore, it should be our responsibility to be natural lovers, to protect nature, to preserve nature, to ensure that there is a deterioration in nature's beds itself.
A natural disaster incident a few days ago attracted the attention of the whole world and driven humanity.
It usually takes some hours to enter the cave and come out.
But that time the sports of the law were different.
When they went far inside the cave, they suddenly got a lot of water accumulated at the doorsteps of the cave because of a sudden shutdown.
The way they left was blocked.
Because of no way, they stayed in the cave on a small rock, not one day, not two days, for 18 days.
Just imagine how those youngsters would have had to spend every moment while they die in front of the eyes
On the one hand, they were wrecked in large numbers, on the other hand, the entire human society was uniting and expressing the humanity of God.
People from all over the world were engaged in prayers to bring these children safely out.
It is not that the parents don't have any grief or the eyes of the mother are grieved.
While crossing such a difficult situation, he expressed so much joy and lust in a dark cave full of water, it was surprising all over the world that the boys were not able to relax faith.
This happens to us that when the human society stands together, miracles are seen.
But it is necessary that we are quiet and solid, to target the goal, and to work uninterrupted.
Just a few days ago, the favorite poet of our country, Niraj ji, left us all.
He has a specialty - faith, self-confidence and stress.
The months of July-August are the most important months for the farmers and all the youth.
Because these months he has been the highest season of colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Sathya are coming out of school and join colleges.
The months of February-March are funny in the holidays of April-May, and are determined to determine the direction to travel in life and what business should be done.
In the month of July, the qualification of the youth goes away from the questions and goes on cut off values, this is a very important period.
The attention of the students is going away from the house to the school.
Students get away from the kitchen of the parents and join the professor's kitchen.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about starting college life.
For the first time, if you leave the house, leave the village and leave a safe environment and start drive yourself.
For the first time, all these youngsters have left their homes and have come out to make a new direction for their lives.
Many students will be joining their colleges and some will be connected to them.
Whatever I want to say to you, be quiet, experience your innerness in life, it is no doubt that books are essential, it is important to read, while you also make yourself the nature of looking for new things.
There is a unique value for old friends.
The younger companions are very valuable, while selecting new friends, selecting and pursuing friendship is a big intellectual activity.
You can learn some new things, some new skills, new languages...
My best wishes to all the youngsters who have started a new lamb.
While talking about the college season, it was reported that Asharam Chaudhary, a student of the poorest family in Madhya Pradesh, has achieved success over the difficult challenges of life.
He has been selected in the first attempt in the medical examination of Jodhpur AIIMS (AIIMS).
Her father is working as a sanitation worker and enjoys his family.
I convey my best wishes to him for his success.
The students of such a poor family have achieved their unprecedented efforts and efforts to overcome the worst conditions.
Their accomplishments showcases us that Kushi's father is a runner in a school bus, Karthik's father is a guardian of Haryana, Ramesh Shahu's father in Jharkhand works in the bricks.
Likewise, Anushka Panda, a Divyang woman from Kutka, was suffering from a spinal muscular atrophy since her birth...
All of them have achieved the achievements of the world, with the help of motivation, and the obstacles in their minds.
If we look around us, we will know many such examples.
Something that happens in any corner of the country fills my heart with strength and inspires me.
When you talk about such youth, I am taking care of you about Nitish Ji, this is the meaning of life.
I want to listen to the songs of the poems of Niraj ji, the songs of the earth and the songs of the earth. I want to invite everybody to light.
My dear countrymen, my eyes went on a news a few days ago that two youngsters had fulfilled the dream of Modi.
When we learned it further in detail, it was realized that today our youth are trying to transform the lives of the common man by using technology intellectual and constructively.
I was interacting with Indian youth in the city of San Jose, once known as the centre of technology.
I urged them to take time to think about how they can use their capabilities for India.
I urge you to see how knowledge and talent should be used for the country to come out of the country.
Two IT experts from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Shahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji, took this challenge and took a new initiative.
Use of your skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji jointly created the Smart Gaon App and Intellectual Village App.
This App connects the rural people to the world and enables them to get any information and information in their mobile phones.
All the Dudhpur residents of Rae Bareli, the Chairman of Panchayat, the District Judge and the District Registrar were aware of the use of this app.
If you look at this event in a synonymous manner, then we should consider that these youngsters are living in the United States and are living in the middle of lifestyles and ideals, even if they leave India several years ago, they have familiarized their village and understand the challenges and are emotionally associated with their village.
This is the reason why we have been able to understand the needs of the village.
The thirst to make a grip with their village and their roots accomplish something for their motherland is natural within every Indian.
But sometimes, due to the compulsions of time, televisions and conditions, this feeling seems to be slightly relaxed, if there is a bit of evil, then this feeling is quickly dragging them towards the past days.
Bandarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before the audio ekadashya, Varkari i.e. travellers are walking with their teeth for a pilgrimage to Bandarpur.
This journey is called Vari, in which lakhs of devotees participate.
Gyaneshwar swamis and Dukaram swamis are walking towards Bandarpur by singing, singing, singing, singing, singing and music.
Tirthankars reach there to visit Bhagwan when they are called Vitoba or Bandurangan.
Vital Bhagwan protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the victims.
Devotees from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are filled with sadness and devotion.
Going to the Vitopa temple of Bandarpur, its glory, beauty and spiritual joy are all unique experiences.
I urge Mann Ki Baat to be a lover that if you get the opportunity, you will once experience Bandarpur Vari.
The solitaries of Gyaneshwar Swamis, Namadeva, Eknath, Ramdas Swamis and Dukaram Swamis are still being guided by the common people of Maharashtra.
They are providing the power to fight against moodwill and in every corner of India, the tradition of these great people is encouraging.
We have a great message about the significance of Parud songs, abusiveness, harmony, love and brotherhood.
Just as the great tradition of the great ones who dedicated themselves to the feet of God was in our country, there were great men who dedicated themselves to the mothers of Mother India and showed their lives to her.
Such a great man is Lokmanya Tilkar, who has made an unprecedented seal in the hearts of many Indians.
While we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Tilak on 23rd July, we follow his memorial on 1st August.
Lohmanya Tilkar is full of empire and self-confidence.
He was filled with the power and intellect that directly points to the wrongs of the British rulers.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was very attracted by Lokmanya Tilkar.
On August 1, 1920, when Lokmanya Tilkar was missing, he was committed to building a memorial.
When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipality, he immediately chose the Victoria Cardon, named after the British Maharani, to establish a memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
In fact, the British were distinguished by this act, so the head of the government refused to allow it.
The most interesting thing is that Gandhijis addressing the opening ceremony said that after the assumption of Sardar Patel, the Ahmedabad Municipality has not only got a good man, but also the heart, that is why it has been possible to build the Thiruva statue of Tilak.
My dear countrymen, the significance of this miracle is that this miraculous idol is very rare in which he is seen in the shape of sitting on the chair and is engraved as my generosity.
I am shared with you about the age of the British.
Because of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak, there is a tradition of celebrating socially Ganesha festival.
It can be understood from this that our ancient tradition and our brave heroes of history still have a great attraction in our younger society.
Today, we can see the bundles that worship the hero in almost all the streets of many cities.
I would like to make a widespread campaign on the ecosystem of environmentally friendly Ganesha festivals in every city, be it honourable, be it MyGov (MyGov) and Narendra Modi App.
I will definitely take your ideas to the people.
Every Indian must visit the goodwill and the benefits of development.
This will create a New India.
On the same day i.e. on 23rd July, another Sathputra of Mother India was born after the birth of Tilkar.
He dedicated his life to the people of India to breathe a free wind.
I am talking about Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
Any young man of India who is not attracted by these words - "Revolution thirsty remains in our hearts, let us look at the strength of the ladies and these poems have been composed of many youngsters like Ashfakulla Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrasekhar Azad's affliction, freedom, and his motivation inspired many youngsters.
Asad ji possessed his life, but did not head the foreign regime.
I had a great deal of pride going to Alirajpur, a village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again I convey my commemorations to these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilkar and Chandrashekhar Azad.
Just a few days ago, Hima Das, the daughter of the peasant, has won a gold medal in the 400-meter race in the World Championships in Finland.
Ekta Bayan, another woman in the country, has written to my letter through an e-mail from Indonesia, now she is preparing for Asian Games.
I am very proud that if a moment is a very important moment in the lives of the heroes, it is to capture the flag in the hands of the world platform, I have done it.
Ekta, we are all proud of you.
You are proud of the country.
In Tunisia, Grand Prix, a world-class Grand Prix for Persons with Disabilities, won medals like Ektan Gold and Bronze in 2018.
His achievement is that he changed the challenge of Disabilities as a means of his success.
The road accident that took place in 2003, however, the lower part of the body of Ekta Bayan was ruined, he did not lose his heart, strengthened himself and achieved the number of targets.
Yogesh Kadunia, a disabled person, has won a Gold medal in Grand Priyal, Grand Priyal, and along with him, Sunder Singh Kurjar has also won a Gold medal in the Gold Medal for Persons with Disabilities in Berlin.
I convey my best wishes to Ekta Bayan ji, Yogesh Kaduniya ji and Sundar Singh ji for the self-confidence and indecent thirst of all.
You need to move forward, play more, enjoy yourself.
My dear countrymen, in August, many events of history are full of festivals, but sometimes due to the weather, diseases are also putting their feet in the houses.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the festivals that have been guided for centuries in the month of August and the month of August, which raises the spirit of nation-building for the better health and well-being.
Once again we must meet in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, a historic cricket strike took place in Bangalore.
You all know that I am referring to the test competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that this is the first international test system to participate in Afghanistan and the historic test system of Afghanistan has happened with India.
The President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Kani, also made me a tag and said that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I express my gratitude to our Indian friends for building a platform to showcase our sportspersons their talents.
Rashid is a representative of the special features of Afghanistan.
This lamb will be unforgettable for all.
This is the first lamb, it is memorable for memorable, but for another reason, I consider it specially.
The Indian team showed an unprecedented reference to the world.
We can understand the character of sportspersons from this event.
It shows that sports is a unique way to connect the world and bring the capabilities and capabilities of our youth.
My best wishes to both the Indian and Afghanistan teams.
I am confident that we will play and develop together with each other in the same way in this time.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, when we celebrated 4th International Yoga Day, the entire world joined it.
I was told that for the first time in Saudi Arabia, the historic event of Yoga was held, in which women have made massive asanas.
In the highest peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China together learned Yoga.
Some soldiers also learned Yoga in the ship
Like this, some soldiers learned Yoga at the snowy mountain peaks of Siachen.
Our soldiers of the Air Force, at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth, demonstrated and depressed everyone.
It is worth mentioning that they didn't do this as they sat on the plane and did it in the heavens.
Yoga training was conducted at all places like schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports grounds.
A scene of Ahmedabad touched the heart.
There, about 750 Divyang brothers and sisters were present at one place, together they got the world renowned by taking Yoga training.
Without any regulation of caste, religion and geographical framework, we have been living for centuries with the feelings of the Vasudhaiva family and the unity of the world.
Moreover, people will make it a part of their lives.
We are remembering the doctors when there is trouble.
But on this day, I express my gratitude to the doctors for their services, dedication and achievements.
The doctors of our country have made their marks all over the world due to their talents.
While it is efficient and hard workforce in the medical industry, our doctors are well-known in resolving complex medical problems.
India is a rich historical country that does not happen a day or a month.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Makhar on 28th.
You know why Kabirdasar went to Makhar.
Pilgrim Kabirdasar stressed the social unity, peace and brotherhood through his poems of Shakis and Dohas.
This was his goal.
This aim is to be seen in his works, and in today's world it is equally sympathetic.
Behold, listen to one of his dohas - Kabir Soi Beer Hai, Jo Jane Bar Beer, Jo Parbir Na Janahi, So Ka Beer Man Beer.
Kabirdasar stressed on social harmony.
What does he mention in another Doha
Where there is glory and pride, there is sin there.
He added that Jathi Na Bhuchsho Sadhu Ki, Bhuch Lejiya Gyan.
Do not listen to the saints what their caste is, and seek wisdom among them.
His appeal to the people is to cross the caste religion and accept and respect the people with their wisdom.
His views have been affecting even today even after centuries.
It is said that Guru Nanak Dev ji - the service of the poor and the needy is the voice of God.
Wherever he goes, he has done a lot of work for social benefits.
Here, all the castes, all sections and all the religions and systems can come and eat and introduce a cooking system called Guru Nanak Dev Ji Lankar.
The 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to participate in this with enthusiasm and eagerness.
The Indian Freedom War is very long, wide, very deep, full of sacrifices.
There is another history associated with the Punjab state.
The year 2019 is going to be 100 years in the Jallianwalabagh massacre stage, which is an event of humiliating humanity.
My dear countrymen, Raman Kumar ji of Rohini in Delhi and Dr.
Raman ji, first of all I express my gratitude to you.
I am excited to see your interest in the Indian history.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji is the day of his time i.e. 23rd June.
In 1937, Dr.
A few people would also know that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji had addressed the convocation of the University of Kolkata in Bengal.
It is notable that this was the first time that the British had spoken in Bengal at the convocation ceremony at the University of Kolkata during the reign of the British.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji was the first industrial minister of the country and if he was yet to say that he had laid the foundation stone for Indias industrial development and had laid the foundation stone for a strong foundation then it was not very good.
In the first industrial policy of Freedom India released in 1948, his ideas and vision were unprecedented.
Dr.
Mukherjee's dream is to make India self-reliant and self-reliant in every sector.
While India is developing big industries, he wanted to take full care of the medium and small scale industries, handicrafts, weavers and hub industries.
In order to provide financial and institutional platforms for the overall development of small and medium enterprises, he built all Artisans Board, all Artisans Board, Artisans and Rural Industries Board during the period 1948 to 1950.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's contribution is to him.
He was compassionate about the development of West Bengal.
As a result of his understanding, intellectuality and positive activity, a large part of Bengal was saved and part of India.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of the government through video conference.
They had an opportunity to directly know about the changes in life and go beyond the coffees.
While knowing about an ordinary man... his simple words, his experiences, the event about him and the mindset.
Women from remote villages are providing services from Pension to Passport of Senior Citizens in villages through Public Service Centre.
A sister in Chhattisgarh gathers sita peas and sells ice cream.
Like the Anjan Prakash of Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters of the country are also running pharmaceuticals as well as providing affordable medicines to the villages in the nearby areas.
The school children of Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa have been working on important issues such as waste management in the school at their young age.
I have learnt that I have heard more than the success of the government, the success of the ordinary people, the power of the country, the power of the dreams of a New India and the strength of the mind of a New India.
Rather, there are some people in society - unless they talk about disappointment, they are quiet, unless they are able to inspire unbelief, unless they seek a different path of unity.
In a similar environment, when talking about the events in your life with the common man, new hopes and new enthusiasm, I did not consider it as a success to the government.
The story of a small woman from a small village far away has become a motivation for 125 crore people.
I am grateful to the people of the country.
40-50 lakhs of people have been associated with this video bridge programme and you have done the task of providing a new energy to me.
Once again I would like to thank you all.
I have always seen the fact that if we look around us, somewhere, some good thing will definitely be seen in our eyes.
There are people who understand good.
We can also face the aroma of goodness.
In the past, one thing attracted my attention and it was a very serious link.
On the other hand, if there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand there are agricultural brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
Farmers have joined themselves in this thing, have finished schemes and have made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Skills and engineers have been trained by the Trust to learn the new strategy of agriculture, how to do organic farming, how to produce one thousand crops in the fields and how to produce other crops.
Today, they are not only eating vegetables but also selling their vegetables through this trust and selling them for good prices, even the producers of grains are connecting them.
I am glad that this youth associated with the world of entrepreneurs, engineers and technologists have left their circles and have made their own way of working together with farmers and villages and fields and crops.
Friends
Your young man is actually a sympathy for any young man.
Even other youngsters of the country will definitely go to their website and look after their work in their own way, they will also get inspired about how they can work in different fields of society in their respective areas.
One country, one country, one tax, which was a dream for all the people of the country, is conscious.
If anyone wants to appreciate the implementation of the same tax revision system then I would like to appreciate the same to the states as it is.
So far, 27 GST meetings have been held, people with various political ideas are sitting in it, people from different states are participating and states with different priorities are participating
Prior to the implementation, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is being replaced.
The success of the GST currency is a celebration of currencies.
Since the arrival of the tests has come to an end, the movement of goods is going on at a rapid pace, which will save time and there is considerable profit in the Goods Services sector.
Maybe the world's largest tax reform.
Normally, when such a big reform, such a big country, such a big country, it was considered that it could take 5-7 years to complete it.
This is the biggest success and 125 crore people have achieved this success.
My best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Greetings.
Once again I have got the opportunity to meet you all through the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I remember all of you that a team of 6 women commanders of the Indian Navy had travelled for months.
They travelled in various oceans and many oceans and crossed about 22,000 seafarers.
This is the first time in the world.
Last Wednesday, this woman met the jewellery and got the opportunity to listen to her experiences.
Once again I express my appreciation to them for their excellent activity in improving the pride of the navy and the importance of the country, especially the women of India, who are not embarrassed in the world.
Who doesn't know the feeling of compassion.
For centuries, the Everest summit has become a challenge for humanity, and the oppressed have been facing this challenge.
On May 16, a group of 5 tribe students from a Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra - Manisha Truve, Pramesh Ale, Umanand Madvi, Kavitas Kathmode and Vikas Soyam - have climbed the world's highest peak.
The students of the Ashram School started their training in August 2017, where they were trained in Warda, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were selected under the training programme of Shaurya Mission.
In terms of name, they have made the country's pride at the Everest peak.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to these young friends of Chandrapur School.
The 16-year-old woman of India, Shivangi Pathak, is the youngest Indian woman who has reached the Everest peak from Nepal.
Many congratulations to Shivangi.
Ajith Bhajaj ji and his daughter Diya will join the first father and daughter of India to touch the Everest summit.
No youngsters are climbing on the Everest summit.
On May 19, more than 50 years of age, Sangeeta Behel ji climbed the Everest peak.
Some of the climbers on the Everest summit show that they have talent and emotion.
As per the Swachh Ganga Abhiyan and Swachh Ganga movement last days, a team of Border Police personnel climbed the Everest peak, but when they came down, they brought a single slab.
This is a commendable thing, while this shrine shows the humility of the environment for cleaning.
For years, people have climbed the Everest peak and many of them have succeeded.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the soldiers, especially the women.
My dear countrymen, especially my dear young friends, I have not seen that when I talked about Fit India two months ago, there will be no such responses.
Nobody thinks that all sections will support it.
When I talk about Fit India, I acknowledge that the kind of sports we are engaged in, the country will be in sports.
In social media, people are sharing fitness challenges, i.e. communications related to sex challenges, each one tackles and challenges.
Today, everyone is associated with this mission of Fit India.
Whether they are filmmakers, sportspersons, soldiers of the country, school teachers, if we are compassionate, India will be committed.
I think that this kind of challenge is helping us to keep ourselves physically and inspire others to communicate.
Savi Yadav ji, thank you for your phone call.
It is true that the games played in the streets are part of the life of every child, which are surrounding today.
In particular, these sports have been an important part of summer holidays.
At the time of breakfast, after having dinner, children will play for hours without any concern or concern.
In some of these sports, the entire family was able to participate and play.
Several sports such as Kittip Pul, Pambaram, Koli, Aizpai, Thirdon Police, Kannamuchi, Go-Ko were part of the small age sports from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Kamrupam.
Yes, they may have been called by different names in different places.
For example, 7 stons (7 stones) are known as Lahori, Pittu, Sadolia, Tikori, Sadodiya.
In these sports, we see unity and harmony in the aftermath of the diversity of our country.
One sports is known in different places and in different names.
I am from the state of Gujarat, where I know about a sports called Somal-Isto.
It is played in a 8-8 square square square square square square squirrel.
It was played in almost all the states.
In Karnataka, it is called Saukabara and Atu in Madhya Pradesh, which is called by the name of Bagigali in Kerala, Sampal in Maharashtra, Thai in Tamil Nadu and Shangabo in Rajasthan.
I don't know how to speak in every state language but it was only after playing it that we were also playing it.
Is there anyone among us who don't have a kitchen bull and a kitchen
It is known by various names in different parts of the country .
In Andhra, it is called Kotibilla or Karrabilla, and Kulibadi in Odisha, and in Maharashtra it is called Vitidalu.
When everyone comes out of the wind, when everyone plays, we can express the unique qualities of ourselves.
You can see that many children are sweet, but when they play, they will become very active.
They themselves express themselves, appear as deep, the childhood that is hidden in them is emerged.
Determining the goals, how to reach the mindset, how to create the spirit of the committee, how to create mutual help.
I can see that our traditional sports are being used in the training programmes related to trade management, the entire governance and the development of mutual skills.
From children to adults, when all play together, we say a gap of generations, it becomes absurd.
We can also understand our culture and traditions.
Several sports provide awareness about society and environment.
Animation films can be produced, played in streets and silvers, they will also see these games that appear to our new generations, play and grow.
My dear countrymen, on June 5, India is organising the World Environment Day celebrations officially.
This time Beat Plastic Pollution is a concept of BEAT Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to all of you that in this regard, we will all try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on nature, on forests and on our health.
Enter the website of World Environment Day, Wed-Wed-Dunia 2018, there are many suggestions given in a very interesting manner - See, know, try to adopt them in your daily life.
When there is a severe heat, when there is flood, when there is no rain, when there is no rain, when there is unbearable cold, everyone becomes specialists, becomes world warm and environmental change.
Over the past few weeks, we have seen a storm and acute wind fall in many parts of the country and acute hard work is not a natural season.
This has led to a loss of life.
All these are mainly the consequences of the change of climate change
Our culture and traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We must live with nature and be associated with nature.
The Gandhians had brought this thing forward throughout their life and every step in their life.
We will arrange a way to maintain it until it grows and grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
This is the message of Yoga and a harmonious society for unity, which the world has again experienced for the past few years.
Yoga gives us psychological importance, it always protects us like a father.
The feeling arises, it looks like their mother-in-law in children, mental peace becomes our sustainable friend.
Bharatruhari says that due to continuous Yoga, the opportunity is our children, our brothers, our brothers, our brothers, the earth is our bed and wisdom will hungry.
If all these qualities are one's friends, then that Yogi will win over all the fears.
Once again I invite all the nations to take forward the Yoga tradition, build a healthy, joyous and harmonious nation.
Today, on 27th May, the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji's remembrance.
I salute Panditji.
This month, he belonged to another person, he is Veer Savarkar.
In 1857, during the same month of May, our countrymen expressed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers gathered against injustice and expressed their sorrow.
It is a matter of sadness that for a long time, the year 1857 was called as a riot or a civilian riot.
In fact, this is not just an attempt to reduce the event, but to embarrass our self-confidence and self-confidence.
In 1857, Veer Savarkar wrote that it was not just a rebellion, it was the first freedom struggle.
In collaboration with Savarka, many freedom fighters celebrated the 50th anniversary of India House in London.
A specialist in handling both arms and weapons.
We generally thank Veer Savarkar for his bravery and his struggle against British imperialism
But apart from all this, he has been strengthened by a wonderful poet, social reformist, always harmony and unity.
I remind you that our favorite respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had spoken about Savarkar ji.
He was a poet of understanding and a bold revolution.
I convey my best wishes for the bright future of our lady sacrifices, full of hopes and hopes.
If you are determined to achieve something then you can achieve success by crossing all the obstacles.
Considering the dreams of others, the story of some who dedicate themselves to fulfil them is the story of T.
Prakash Rao was his.
You will be surprised to know that today a simple person selling tea is taking education in the lives of more than 70 children.
All the children coming to school are providing all facilities like education, health and food.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Prakash Rao ji for his indomitable hard work, his temptation and illumination in the lives of poor children.
He has removed the darkness in his life.
Who does not know the scripture of Damaso Ma Jotharikamaya
But if there is a person who has done it, then he will have a T.
His life is a concept of all of us, society and all over the country.
There may be such inspirational events around you.
You will also wait for the arrival of Jayachandra in a few days.
I am confident that all of you will celebrate Egypt with great zeal and at this time the children will get the best eagle of the festival.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries of the world including India have participated in this.
You can imagine what kind of environment is there when thousands of sportspersons are participating from all over the world.
Whether there is a feeling of enthusiasm, hope, motivation, aspirations and aspirations - if there is such an environment, there is no impact on it.
..India has achieved an unprecedented achievement.
It is a matter of pride for the medal winners, but it is a moment of pride for the entire country and for the people of the country.
Encouraging and motivation boil.
We are all together with the same feeling.
I have no words to express this feeling.
But I want to share with you what these sportspersons told me.
Why do I say the speciality, many things have been done for the first time.
This time, all the soldiers who participated in India's rank in the Commonwealth Games have won medals.
Manika Bhadra has played medals in all his sports.
He is the first Indian woman to win the Gold Medal in the Table Tennis Single Games.
India got the highest gold shooting competition.
The only Para Power Lifter of India to win the medal in the Chachin Saudri Commonwealth Games.
Moreover, if the competition was special this time, the majority of the winners were women.
Whether it is square, be it square, be it square, the shooting competitor, the female survivors played a very well and showed their talents.
The final competing of Bhubaneswar is that of India's two bowls - Saina Nehwal and P.
V.
It took place between Sindhu.
I was urging Fit India to join and lead.
I am glad that people have joined it with great enthusiasm.
Many have written letters to show their support for this, and share their sex related matters and FIT India information in the social media.
A person named Sashikanth Bhonsley shared his film in the swimming pond and wrote that my body is my weapon, water is my individual, swimming is my world.
Do you know what Ruma Devnath has written
For me, the smoke was mixed with smoke, and when we were happy, he wrote that the smoke should be pierced.
After seeing all these things, it is better that many well-known people have been inspiring our youth in a very interesting way for Fit India.
Film star Akshay Kumar has welcomed a video in Twitter.
His other video is also very popular, in which he can see slaughtering and playing with the people.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences by connecting themselves with Fit India initiatives.
Your city, your village, your area, your school, your college, all the elderly, men and women should make efforts to join Yoga.
You must have deepened the idea of how to experience holidays and where to go.
I invite you to a new work today
I can see many youngsters spend their time to learn something new.
The significance of the training in summer is increasing and the youth are engaged in search of this, in fact, training is a new experience.
Outside the four walls, there is a feeling of living in a new corner of life by crossing the writs and computers.
My young friends, I urge you to take a special training.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, be it the Department of Sports, the Department of Human Resource Development and the Department of Drinking Water Resources, have jointly organised a Swachh Bharat Summer Training 2018.
Go to MyGov portal and register yourself to participate in Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I am confident that our youth will take this campaign for cleanliness further.
Definitely send your information, send photographs, welcome video.
Come on
We will create an opportunity to learn new experiences during this vacation.
A few days ago, the youth of Delhi were showing a thing about some of them in India and they are doing the service of teaching to the poor children.
These youngsters have been making a big campaign to educate the streets of Delhi and children living in the slums.
This innovative work was started because the condition of the children engaged in stealing and stealing in the streets.
The movement, which started with 15 children in the hustle-bustle area near the Gita Colony of Delhi, is connecting 2000 children in 12 places in the capital today.
Young people, teachers and faculty, who have joined themselves with this movement, have been trying to make a change in society for 2 hours in their daily schedule.
Brothers and sisters, Like this, some farmers of the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become a hub for farmers across the country.
Their integrated efforts have not only enriched their position but also the future of their region.
In the Bhageshwar of Uttarakhand, especially the minorities, potatoes, microbes and parli are being cultivated.
Because of being a hilly area, the farmers did not get the right price for this.
They set up a cooperative system in Munnar village, where they set up a factory to prepare biscuits.
The administration has also linked it to the National Rural Livelihood Mission by looking at the mindset of the farmers.
These biscuits are being added not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bhageshwar district but also to Almora and Gausani.
Due to the hard work of the farmers, the income of this organization has not only increased to Rs. 10-15 lakhs per year, but also for more than 900 households, it has also prevented people from evacuating the district.
Everyone speaks about it, but isn't it our duty
Have we not seen that water conservation is the responsibility of the society
It should be the responsibility of every individual.
How can we save every drop of water in the rainy season
Our ancestors have done this for centuries.
They have given priority to the importance of water every drop.
They have found new methods and found out how to save every drop of water.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, you might have noticed the huge inscriptions related to the continuous system, water conservation and dry weather arrangements in some temples there.
Large inscriptions are seen at all places like Mannarkoot, Cheranmadevi, Mandir Pitti and Mannarkoot.
Even today, we should not forget that many lessons are known as well as tourist destinations, which are still a living example of our ancestors regarding water conservation movement.
Atalj in Gujarat and Rani Ki Vau in Patan are being declared as the world heritage site of the education, science and culture of the UN.
In the months of April, May, June and July, they have a great opportunity to save the rainy water, as much as we are prepared before, so much benefits are available.
The budget of Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme is being spent only for water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, all of them are making their own efforts towards water conservation and water management.
An average of Rs. 32,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water management across the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme every year.
As per 2017-18, about 55 of the cost of Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent in operations such as water conservation and water management of about Rs. 35,000 crore.
In the last three years, more than 150 lakh hectares of land have been benefitted by these water reservoirs and water management.
7,000 people who have worked under this scheme have worked hard in seventy days and have resurrected the Kuttamberur river in Kerala.
Ganga and Yamuna are watery rivers but in some parts of Uttar Pradesh, for example, two rivers Sasur and Kaderi in Fatehpur district have dried up.
The District Administration faced a huge challenge on land and water conservation activities under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme.
With the help of the people of about 40-45 villages, this dry sasur was renovated to the river Kaderi.
Whether it is a bird or a farmer or agricultural or villages, how many big aspirations have you seen
May, June and July are coming, we also have some responsibilities for water conservation and water management, and once again I urge you to finish some of the projects and we will also achieve something.
My fascinating countrymen, before the voice of Mann Ki Baat, there are reports from all sides, letters and phone calls.
Ayen Kumar Benerji of Devidola village in north 24 Barganas district of West Bengal has registered his views in MyGov - even though we are celebrating Ravindra Jayanti every year, many have not been aware of Rabindranath Tagore's comfortable, beautiful and honest philosophy.
Please talk about this thing in the Mann Ki Baat programme, so that people will have a chance to know about it.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore has been a complete form of wisdom and discipline and his writings have made an impossible mark in the minds of all readers.
Rabindranath - is wise, diverse, but we can experience that every moment a teacher was alive in him.
He wrote in his poetry that he, who knows how the responsibilities to impart it to the students who have knowledge, they have the responsibility to teach it to the students.
I am not well-known in Bengal but I had a habit of waking up early in my childhood and radio broadcasting in East India will start fast and will start late in West India.
Ananthloke, Akuner, Boroshmoni, when they get the opportunity to hear these poems, there will be a huge inspiration in the mind.
Rabindra Sangeet and his poems must have lived.
My dear countrymen, Ramlan is going to start the holy month in a few days.
The month of Ramalan is being celebrated all over the world with full hardship and respect.
The social side of Nonbin is that when a man gets a switch, he feels the appetite of others, he feels thirsty and feels the thirsty of others.
This is an opportunity to see the message and teachings given by the sovereign Mohammad Nabis.
We learn from his life to travel on a path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a man asked the sovereign sovereignty, what is important to do in Islam is very important.
For this, the sovereign sovereignty said, 'Eating food to the poor and the needy, we knew whether they were unaware, it was equally harmonious to all.'
The sovereign Mohammed Nabis believed in wisdom and compassion.
Mohammad Nabi has said that if something exceeds your needs, you should get it to the person you need, hence it has been given greater importance in the month of Ramlan.
People give donations to the poor in this holy month.
The sovereign Mohammad Nabis claims that no person is a wealthy person because of his clean soul, not a wealth with him.
Lord Buddha inspires equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Baba Saheb gave power to millions of people in the vicinity to the victims, to the victims, to the deprived, to the oppressed.
There is no better example for compassion.
The compassion of the people was one of the greatest virtues of Buddhaprana.
Buddhist traditions in many countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar are mixed with the roots of Buddha.
This is the reason why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which connects the important places of Southeast Asia with India's special Buddhist places.
Today, there are confrontations and people's sorrows in all the places of the world and the teachings of Buddha are pushing the path of elimination by humiliation.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the Buddhists and those who believe in compassionate principles and to all others on the occasion of Buddha Purnami.
I salute the blessings from Buddha to the entire world, through which we can fulfill our responsibility to create a peaceful and compassionate world on the basis of his teachings.
While you have heard about the idols of Laughing Buddha, it is said that this laughing Buddha will have luck, but some people know that Buddha is associated with an important event in the defence history of India.
Well, you can imagine what the relationship between Buddha and the Indian Army is.
The Indian diaspora, which is spread all over the world, has given a new self-confidence.
That day is a Buddha Purnami.
On May 11, 1998, India conducted a nuclear weapons test in Bokaran, Rajasthan on its western border.
India's test has been successful and in a way, it can be said that India has shared its strength in the field of science and technology.
That day, in the history of India, the power of our forces was driven into golden papers.
Lord Buddha showed that the power of Andrathma is essential for peace and peace.
Like this, if we are strong as a nation today, we can remain peaceful with all of us.
We shared the world on the day that India is capable of achieving new goals and summits every day under the strong leadership of the land full of great scientists of Bharatbhumi.
We can see the new joy and new joy that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, once again we can join the voice of Mann Ki Baat and then we will talk about many more things.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the holy day of Ram Navami.
On this auspicious day, my best wishes to all the nations.
In every moment of his life, we were able to see how much the power of Ram was in the life of a devoted brother.
On January 26, when all the leaders of the ASEAN organisation came here, they brought together the Arts Committee.
It is a matter of great pride that most of the countries have provided Ramayana to all of us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries of this region of the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, like every time this time, all your letters, e-mails, telephone information and ideas have been received in large quantities.
You have heard about the starting of cultural lessons in MyGov, Gomal Docker, which I read.
Besides being from the computer sector, it is also a pleasure to see their attraction for culture.
I have told you about the efforts being made in this regard.
I pray to all those who are engaged in the work related to culture, listening to the voice of Mann Ki Baat, that you should consult about how to implement the idea of Gomal.
Kanshyam Kumar ji of Nalanda district (B) Bahar village in Bihar and I read the ideas written by him on the Narendra Modi App.
You are worried about the decline in the level of ground water, it is definitely an important thing.
You are urging the animals and birds to keep water in the summer.
Shakal ji, I bring your feelings to all the lovers.
He is appealing to the youth about the health of the body.
He thinks that our youth are physically weak when compared to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, this time I have thought of speaking in detail about the healthcare - I talk about a healthy India.
Young people can join together and implement a healthy India-related movement.
In the past, the President of France visited Kashi during his visit to our country and said that the scenes of the journey were all touching and affecting.
Now I urge you to lecture them, re-dweet them, bring them to your friends.
Anaka, Jaish and many more children from Chennai have been sent to me on the gratitude cards of thanks from my book Exam Warrior.
I want to tell Anna, Jayesh and all the children that when you see your letters, all my tiredness of that day disappeared like a snow that saw everything.
So many letters, so many phone calls, comments and ideas that I can read from them, if I can hear, many of these things are present in touch with my heart.
I have to say only about them for months.
This time, most of the letters have been written by children and they have written about the examinations.
They are sharing their holiday plans.
They have expressed concern over the water of animals and birds in summer.
There are letters from the farmer brothers and sisters about the functions of the farmers and the activities related to agriculture all over the country.
There are positive suggestions of some citizens on water conservation.
Our festivals, our culture and our traditions are being shared in the festivals.
That is, the things of mind are changing the weather and the fact is that the voice of our mind has changed the climate of life.
Why shouldn't you change
In these things, in your experiences, in your examples, such sympathy, so much power, so much harmony and thirst to do something good for the nation.
These include the ecosystem of the entire nation and the power to change.
When I got the opportunity to read your letters, how a Rickshaw driver from Karimganj district of Assam, Ahmad Ali, along with his deep will, found out that 9 schools have been set up to study the poor children.
13 years ago, due to lack of treatment at the right time, the sister of Sydul Laskar, a taxi driver of Kolkata, died.
He insisted on his own commitment to build a hospital that no poor person should die because of his untreatment.
Siddul sold the buffaloes in his house to achieve this goal and collected money.
Many travellers who traveled on his taxi gave money to him.
An engineer's sister gave her first month's wages as donation.
In this way, after 12 years of collection of money, the Bhagirata pilgrimage of Saidul Laskar finally benefited
Today, due to his hard work, his tendency is preparing a hospital with 30 beds in Punari village near Kolkata.
Such a number of sympathy instruments are introducing and recognising to my country.
Today, when the name of India is highly respected, then the incomplete acts of Mother India's intelligent wealth are swept away.
Today, everybody has this confidence in the minds of the youth, the women, the backward, the poor and the middle class.
We can move forward, we can see progress from our country.
There is a self-confidence and creative environment full of hopes and aspirations.
This self-confidence is this creative feeling that will fulfil our dream of a New India.
My dear countrymen, for the months to come, it will be very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
That is why a lot of letters have been related to agriculture.
This time, when I saw a video of discussions with farmers in the Kisan wave of farmers of Durdarshan, I feel that every farmer should connect himself with the DD Kisan wave of Durdarshan, see it and implement the benefits shown there in their fields.
Be it Gandhians, be it Lal Bahadur Sastri ji, be it Lohia ji, be it Saudri Saran Singh or be it Saudri Devi - all of them are considered to be a very important part of the economy of the country and the lives of the people.
Like this, Lal Bahadur Shastri also often talked about the importance of trees, plants, vegetation and the importance of a better agricultural system.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has said that a large number of people should be aware of the productivity of food and milk to ensure better income and better irrigation facilities for our farmers.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Saran Singh urged farmers to use new technology and create innovations.
I had visited the Agricultural Development Festival in Delhi last days.
Interacting with farmers brothers and scientists there, I had a comfortable experience of understanding, understanding and innovation related to agriculture.
But the thing that has been affected by me is Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers from there.
This area with lesser land has done a big job.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have achieved a record in Mahsul in comparison to the last five years in 2015-16.
If the goal is determined, if the motivation is inspired then the mind is deep, it can be achieved and achieved.
Today, technology is also handling farmers' hard work, which has resulted in substantial strength for agricultural producers.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to provide affordable price for farmers' crops.
Besides, work on agricultural marketing reforms is being done in the country to provide the right price to the farmers' produce.
Efforts are being made to connect the regional markets in the village, the gross markets and the world market.
While the APMC and e-NAM platform will be integrated to develop and improve the infrastructure required for 22,000 rural markets across the country, the farmers are not required to facilitate higher television to sell their produce.
In a way, such an organisation is being created from the farm to any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year the beginning of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Gandhiji.
How should the nation celebrate this festival
Besides, Swachh Bharat is our mindset, how can 125 crore Indians should shoulder to shoulder to shoulder with shoulder
Can we organise new events
Can we create new ways
I urge you all to share your views on this through MyGov.
What could be the symbol of 'Gandhi 150'
What can be the Kosham
Let me write your comments about these.
Today, the entire country has crossed a regular approach in the health sector.
All the health related works in the country were earlier taken up by the Health Ministry, but now all the departments and Ministries - whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Consumer Affairs or Ministry of Women and Child Development or State Governments - all are working together for a healthy India, health prevention and affordable health.
Disease prevention health is a very low cost and is very easier.
Whatever we are aware of the disease prevention health is the beneficial for individuals, family and society.
The first need to be healthy, cleanliness.
We all are committed to a nation, as a result of this, health security has doubled to about 80 percent in the last four years.
Besides, widespread work is being done in the direction of setting up of Health Centres across the country.
Yoga has shown its identity all over the world with a new energy in terms of disease prevention healthcare.
Yoga guarantees both physical and health.
This is the result of all of us, so that Yoga has become a mass movement and every household has got a place.
The next International Day of Yoga is more than 100 days left on 21st June.
In the last three International Yoga Days, people have participated very excitingly in the country and in all the places of the world.
We will also ensure that we will inspire all of us in Yoga, be it Yoga, be it family and friends.
It should be further popularized by all the adults and children, youth and senior citizens by adopting new enthusiastic methods.
Moreover, televisions and electronics from all over the country are providing various programmes related to yoga throughout the year
But can we create awareness about Yoga as a movement from now on Yoga Day
My sweet countrymen, I am not a Yoga worker.
But some people have turned me into a yoga journal through their creation and I have created three pieces of poetry like Yoga.
A widespread effort is being made to ensure that healthcare is accessible to all, to make the goods cheaper and easier.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country, where more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
Further, new centres are being opened.
I would urge the people of Mann Ki Baat to give you information about these Jan Drug Centres to the needy.
This will be the biggest service you have done to them.
Heart Stent prices for heart patients have been reduced by 85 percent.
The cost of joint opposite surgery has also been fixed and reduced by 50 to 70 percent.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Sukshadra Yojana, about 10 crore families, i. e.
The number of medical seats in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
New AIIMS (AIIMS) hospitals are being opened in many states to provide better treatment and healthcare facilities to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts.
Within 2025, the goal of getting rid of the country from TB has been set.
Today, the Make in India-Make in the country has been successfully working.
That day, Dr. Ambedkar ji had dreamt of India as an industrialist and his vision inspires us today.
Today, India is emerging as a shining hub in the world economy, and the largest FDI in the world is coming to India.
The world is looking at India as a hub for investment, innovation and development.
Baba Saheb had a firm faith in self-sufficiency.
He does not want any person to spend his time in poverty.
Moreover, he did not think that if he shared something to the poor, his poverty would be removed.
Today Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India Innovations, innovative innovators and entrepreneurs from our youth have been created.
Today, historical efforts are being made on the waterways and ports of the country.
New ports are being set up at various beaches of India and infrastructure is being strengthened in the old ports.
Most of the 40 debates were surrounding the 2nd World War, the emerging snow war and the country's distinction.
At that time, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation stone for the spirit of Team India.
He spoke of the importance of federalism and strengthened the central and state governments to work together for the progress of the nation.
Today, we have acknowledged the mantra of cooperative federalism - cooperative federalism - competitive federalism - competitive federalism - sir federalism.
The most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is a synonym of millions of people like me of the backward classes.
He showed us that there is no need to be born in a big family or a Siman family to move forward, and that the poor families of India can dream and try to fulfil those dreams and succeed in it.
But the painting of New India is completely different.
I pray before you that you will be enthusiastic to participate in this movement.
My dear countrymen, there will be several festivals in the next few days like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Anuman Jayanti, Easter, Baisakhi.
It is a day to remember the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir, who has spoken of the message of Ahimsai, gives us sympathy.
Mahavir Jayanti greetings to all the nations.
As soon as we talk about Easter, I recall the inspirations of Eshunath and the messages of humanity, peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion.
Baisakhi Festival is being held in Punjab and West India in April
In the same days, Jude Sheethal and Sathuvain are celebrated with joy and joy in the festival of Sathuvai in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and Boila Baisa in West Bengal.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you for the coming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat Feb 2018
In the beginning of this day, I start the voice of Mann Ki Baat with a phone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions about science and some have written letters.
We all know that the colour of the sea is blue, but due to our daily experience, there is no color for water.
Have we ever thought that the river, the sea, and the sea, and why do you look colored
The same question was raised by a young man in the 1920s.
This question has created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about modern science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
The name of Sathyendranath Bose was given to the famous scriptures, which is called Boson.
A few days ago, the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence Wadhwani had participated in the inauguration of Artificial Intelligence Institute in Mumbai.
It is very interesting to know about the marvellous miracles in the science sector.
This artificial intelligence provides for creation of robots, BBs and specific devices.
Today, the machines are making their intellectuals even more intense through machines.
This technology can be used to make the lives of the poor and the poor better.
In this programme related to Artificial Intelligence, I asked scientists to think about how this artificial intelligence can be helpful to make the lives of Divyang sisters easier.
Can we be able to know more about natural calamities through artificial intelligence
Can we help farmers in the field of crops
Can this artificial intelligence facilitate access to healthcare and help in detecting diseases through modern methods
A few days ago, I went with the Prime Minister of Israel to inaugurate the I Create Scheme in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young man and a digital device.
The young man said that if those who cannot speak through this device write what they think about, the device turns it into a voice, it makes it like interacting with each other.
I think we can use artificial intelligence in such a way.
Scientific and technology is a medium value.
There is no self-esteem for these.
Any machine will function as we want.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the Light Bulb, was defeated in many of his tests.
Once asked about this, he said, "I have found ten thousand methods of how I cannot produce the light bulb."
That is, Edison has also changed his failures into his power.
Today, I am in Aroville, the Karmabhumi of Maharishi Aravind, not just an accident but also a great deal of me.
As a revolutionary, he was a challenge to British imperialism, fought against them, raised many questions against their regime.
As a great sage, he questioned every corner of life.
He also discovered the answers and guided the path of humanity.
It is important to understand the truth and raise questions again.
This is also the true ideologue that is behind the search of scientists.
Why, why shouldn't you live until there is no answer to such questions.
I convey my best wishes to all our scientists and scientists on National Science Day.
Rabindra Singh of Pune has written an Occupational Safety on the Narendra Modi App, that is, business security.
He said that the safety standards in our country are not equally important in factories and construction works.
Since the next day is the National Security Day on March 4, the Prime Minister has to speak in his mind about security, so that the awareness of security will be made in the minds of the people.
While we talk about public safety, two things are very important - one is precautionary, one is ready to be ready.
Defence is two-dimensional, one is important in disasters, other is essential in daily life.
If we say that we are not aware of safety in our daily life, it is difficult to achieve this situation in the times of disasters.
Over this, these words do not usually have any benefit in our life.
In view of natural calamities, most of the places are the result of some misunderstanding.
If we wake up, if we follow the necessary rules, we can save our lives and protect our society from larger places.
Sometimes we might have seen a number of words written on security in our workplaces, but we have seen that they do not follow the correctness.
I would like to urge the municipality and the municipality to have a firefighter force to train them once a week in schools or once a month.
There are several natural calamities in this country, and disasters arising out of the chemicals and industry that we have experienced.
Today, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is leading the countrys disaster management.
Self Help Training has been given to Self Help Services (SHGs) in the districts of floods and cyclone hazards.
Till 2-3 years ago, thousands of people died due to the wave of heat.
The National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) then organised a campaign to create awareness among the people by organising training cells on the safety of the heat wave.
The contribution of all was a good effect.
The number of deaths due to the heat wave attacks decreased by approximately 220 in 2017 than expected.
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can be safe.
We must become a society with warning against danger.
We have been traveling several times and are providing defence instruments at the beginning of the airplanes in the airplanes.
Well, was there a system of information
This is how we have experience in every field of life.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, the emphasis has been given to the villages under the Swachh Bharat Yojana on defecation from waste and energy from waste.
The initiatives taken for this have been named as GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources, i. e.
The objective of the Cooper-Dhan Action Plan is to make the villages clean, juice of animals, crops of fields, fertilizers and natural gas through which wealth and energy are being created.
Some European countries and China are using animal juice and bio-waste to produce energy
But India has not been fully functioning in this sector.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen Scheme, we are now moving forward in this direction.
It has been decided to improve natural energy production through livestock, agricultural wastes and kitchen degradations.
Under the Gobar-Dhan Yojana, farmers, brothers and sisters have been encouraged in rural India and they have to look at food and junk wastes not just as a waste but also as a wealthy hub.
New employment opportunities will be possibly possibly enabled in waste storage, transportation and natural gas sales.
Web Site Business Platform will be set up in a smooth manner to implement the Cooper-Dhan Programme, which will connect the farmers with the buyers and provide the right price for farmers' crops.
My dear countrymen, till now we have heard about music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
However, a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, where the first cup of the state was organised.
Inspired by Raipur, Unda and other districts also organized a hut festival for their part.
Everyone shared innovative ideas related to cleanliness in his corner, interacted with discussions, organised poems.
There was an atmosphere like a festival that was focused on cleanliness.
This is a wonderful thing, especially the school children, participated in it with great enthusiasm.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the government administrations of Chhattisgarh for hosting the platform in the most innovative ways of waste management and sanitation.
Every year we are celebrating the 8th of March as International Womens Day.
Several events are being organised in our country as well as in the entire world.
Nari Shakti Puraskar is being conferred on this day to women who have done prestigious work in various fields in the past.
Today, the country is moving towards womens progress and women-led progress.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's golden language.
Today, it is our duty to ensure that the contribution of women in every sector of social and economic conditions is equal.
Today, our women's power is expressing self-confidence and self-confidence.
Where women are powerful and partners in all kinds of development of the country, they themselves dream of a New India.
From 26th January this year, in just 20 days, these women have constructed one lakh and seventy thousand toilets, including about one lakh women groups.
In the lives of ordinary people, the women of Jharkhand have made it an efficiency to convert it into the nature of a large number of people by strengthening the Swachhta movement and cleanliness.
Brothers and sisters, I was aware of the fact that in the 3 villages of Elifanda Islands, when I was watching the news about how much they were happy that we had got electricity after 70 years of independence.
I am surprising that even though it is such a special tourist destination, it has not been able to get electricity from Mumbai for so many years since independence.
For 70 years, three villages of Elipenda Island, Rajbandar, Morbandar and Senthbandar, had left the darkness of the lives of the people drowned in darkness.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and the people there.
Let us say that the life of the people of the country be illuminated, the joy of their lives will grow, the moment of happiness and joy.
Brothers and sisters, Just a few days ago, we have celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
In March is the beauty of green boiling fields, the beauty of swimming crops and the beauty of swimming crops - these are the specialities of this month itself.
At the same time, this month's Holific festival is close to the hearts of all of us.
On March 2, the festival of Holi will be celebrated with great enthusiasm across the country.
The importance of colors in the festival of Holi is so important for Holika, because on this day, we are putting all the evils in the fire.
This is a funny moment for forgetting all the differences, participating in each other's joy, proceeding unity and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, thanks and blessings.
My dear countrymen, Prakash Tribadi ji has written a long letter in the Narendra Modi App, and has been very urging me to talk about all the things therein.
Kalpana Chawla, who visited the space on 1st February, was a liar day.
Though they are not with us today, they have been inspiring the youth from all over the world.
In this way, I express my gratitude to Prakash Ji for his introduction of his letter to Kalpana Chawla ji on the auspicious day.
It is a matter of great sorrow to all of us that we have lost Kalpana Chawla in such a young age, but they have left the message that there is no limit to women's power in the whole world, especially for thousands of women in India.
Today, it is very happy that women in India are progressing very fast in every sector and are stagnating the pride of the nation.
Since ancient times, respect for women in our country, their contribution to society has been surprised by the whole world.
This speaks elaborately about the importance of women in our society.
That is why he has given the status of power to women in our society
It shows that the wisdom of the vedicans like Lopmudra, Karki and Maitrei, the wisdom of Aka Mahadevi and Meerabai, the regime of Ahilyabai Holkar, the valour of Rani Laxmiba, has been inspired by us.
Prakash Tripathy ji has given many more examples.
Our Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman commended him to fly in the sky on Sukoi 30, and said that a group of women from Indian Navy headed by Vartika Joshi was visiting the world.
There are three vulnerable women named Pavana Kand, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi, who are conducting the training of Sukoi 30.
It's all right to say you.
Today, women are not only moving forward in all sectors but also leading them.
Today, for the first time in many sectors, women-power is understanding and establishing a milestone.
The President of India has taken a new initiative in the past.
Our President met a group of extraordinary women who have achieved the first achievement in their respective fields.
These women recorders of the country, the first female captain of the ships, the first female driver of the train, the first female firefighter, the first female bus driver, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to touch the Everest summit, and the first woman to reach Antarctica, have achieved extraordinary achievements.
With the help of hard work, motivation and stressful power, they have proved that they can cross all the barriers and lefts and create a new path.
They are not only in their age but also inspiring generations.
They have filled a new zeal and a new inspiration.
A book has also been written about the women who are the first to come to know about these women and women's powers and inspire them through their lives.
This book is available in the form of e-book today in the Narendra Modi App.
Today, the importance of women's energy is contributing to the positive changes in the country and the society.
Today, while we are talking about the empowerment of women, I would like to mention a railway station.
You can imagine what can be the link between a railway station, women's empowerment and these.
All the workers at Madunga railway station in Mumbai are women.
This time, after seeing the Republic Festival Parade, many of the people on Twitter and other social networks have a special thing about the bag drive section of the Border Police Force.
They knew the adventurous acts, astonished the presence of guests from the country and abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today our women and women are leading.
A self-sufficiency is emerging.
I am surprising that the work done by our tribal women of Chhattisgarh is being done and they have given a new example.
While talking about tribal women, there is a decisive scene in the minds of all, there are forests, roads, where women are burdened on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have created a new scene in front of the country, our women and women.
The Dandewada area of Chhattisgarh is surrounded by Maoist militants.
Maoists, such as violence, repression, bombs, guns and gardens, have created a terrible situation here.
In such a terrible environment, tribal women have become self-sufficient and self-sufficient.
Besides, ecosystem protection is also strengthened.
I also appreciate the government administration here, they have contributed greatly after the success of these women, from providing them funds and training.
Abandoning the disappearance and adopting changes in the requirements.
For centuries, efforts have been made individually and socially against social disorders and disarmaments in the country.
A few days ago, a tasty initiative was taken in Bihar.
A human chain program was organised at a distance of more than 13,000 kilometres in the state of Bihar, by rooting social disorders.
Through this movement, awareness was motivated against evils such as child marriage and illiteracy.
All the people of the state have decided to fight against illiteracy and child marriage.
Children, elders, enthusiastic youngsters, mothers and sisters, all have joined themselves in this movement.
From the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, this human chain has been longer in collaboration with the borders of the state.
If the people of all sections of the society get the benefits of real progress then our society should get rid of such deteriorations.
Together with us, we will not see these defects from the society.
Let us build a New India, a powerful and powerful India.
For the past few years, people have been writing letters to me about this thing.
I have also seen several video and social media related to the beneficiaries of this scheme.
I am relieved that he had got the darshan and got it to others.
The objective of this scheme is to ensure that healthcare is restructured and ease of living.
Prices are less than 50 to 90 percent of the drugs available in the public medicines, compared to trading medicines.
It provides economically beneficial benefits to the elderly citizens, especially the daily use of medicines that can be used by the common man, which will increase the savings.
Generic medicines which are bought here, i.e., the same kind of medicines are in accordance with the standards of World Health Organisation.
Because of this, good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today, the Central Government has set up more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Pharmaceuticals across the country.
Through this, medicines are available at affordable prices and entrepreneurs have created new opportunities for employment for individuals.
Affordable medicines, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Drugs and Amrud shops of hospitals are available.
The only objective behind all these is to provide quality and sustainable healthcare to the poorest of the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, the Mangesh ji of Maharashtra and the Narendra Modi Mobile App are sharing a photo.
That photo attracted me very much.
One of them joined with his grandfather and participated in the Morna River Cleaning.
Citizens of Akola have undertaken the work of cleaning the Morna river on this Swachh Bharat Mission.
Though the Morna river is a river that has grown up for 12 months, it has now become a seasonal river.
Another thing to sadness here is that the river is full of forests and waterfalls.
I was told that the Swachhta Abhiyan was continued on 20th January, 2018 and till the Mornah river was completely cleaned, this movement would continue on every Saturday morning.
It shows that if a man's determination to be tried, he cannot achieve anything.
You can also make huge changes through the mass movement.
I convey my heartfelt appreciations to the people of Agola, its district and municipal administration and all the citizens who have participated in the mass movement for this endeavour and this endeavour will commemorate other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a discussion about the Padma Awards being conferred on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind.
The newspapers and televisions are attracted to this.
But it is a matter of pride for you when you look at a very slight moment and we are very proud of getting awards and recognitions without any recommendation.
It is no longer necessary to be awarded, a person should be popular, but his actions are recognised.
He has been manufacturing sports goods for 40 years, so that he has a scientific interest in children.
Their efforts have been to ensure that children do scientific tests with unbearable things.
For this, he is going to 3000 schools across the country and is encouraging screening of video films made in 18 languages.
See what a wonderful life, a great dedication
It is like this that the life of Sitava Jodatty in Karnataka is also like this.
There is no point in calling him a goddess empowered women.
He has played a major role in changing the lives of innumerable women over the last 30 years of Belgavi.
Since his seventh year, he dedicated himself as a goddess and served his entire life for the benefit of the goddesses.
Not only this, he has worked unprecedentedly for the well-being of the lower women.
You might have heard about Bhajju Shayam from Madhya Pradesh and Bajju Shayam was born in a very poor tribal family.
Even though he had done simple work for his life, he had a unique country on traditional tribal paintings.
That is why he has value not only in India but also in the whole world.
His paintings have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, Britain, Italy.
Bhajju Shayam ji, who has been recognised by the name of India abroad, has been honored with the Padmashree Award.
The life of the tribal women of Kerala, Laxmiguti, can be a wonderful surprise for you.
Laxmiguti ji serves as a teacher in the Kalar area, even today, he lives in the dense forests and in the midst of tribal habitations.
He has been selected in the production of medicines to be used after snake is burnt.
Laxmi Ji is continuously serving the society through herbal medical knowledge.
The Padmasri award for his contribution to the society has been awarded to him who was not aware of him.
Today, I am sorry to say about another one and Subhasini Mistry, 75, has been selected for the award.
Subashini Mistri ji washed utensils at home and sold vegetables.
Today, the hospital built by his hard work is providing free medical treatment to thousands of poor people.
Sometimes, in schools and colleges, such people should also be called and shared their experiences.
After crossing all the awards, the society should make some efforts.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January, we are celebrating the day of the NRIs.
On the same day, the brethren Gandhis returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we are celebrating an unparalleled bond between Indians from all over India and all over the world.
This year we have organized a programme for the NRIs in which immigrants from India were called from all over the world members and mayors.
The event was attended by immigrant Indians in many countries like Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States.
Some of them have been printed in many fields like Internet Safety, Ayurveda, Music, Poetry, Climate Change and Indian literature.
Some people have made gurudwaras from truck drivers, some have made mosques, that is, wherever we are, they have made some kind of improvement in the countries.
I express my gratitude to the European Federation for the recognition of the excellent work of the overseas Indians and the contribution of these information to the worldwide wars.
We are seeing at every stage how genuine the teachings of the mother are even in today's times.
What else can we pay to him more than that if we decide to go through the bread of our mother
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you for the year 2018 and get an answer from you.
We have shared many things throughout the year.
The exchange of letters, ideas and ideas for the voice of Mann Ki Baat has given me a new strength.
After a few hours, the year will change, but our shares will continue to happen as always.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
My best wishes to all of you for the year 2018.
Just a few days ago, people from all over the world celebrated the Christmas festival on December 25.
We can also see the essence of service mindset.
It shows us what the importance of service mindset is.
In our country, we are talking about the "indecisive action" that is, there will be no hope of reflection in such an activity.
'Seva Parmo Dharamshala' is said to be the best source of service.
My dear countrymen, this year Guru Gobind Singh was the 350th year of his birth.
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji is inspired by us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji gave the teachings of the great values of life and values, on the basis of these values, he lived his entire life.
As a Guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great soldier, Guru Gobind Singh ji worked to inspire the people through all these contributions.
He fought against repression and injustice.
In this struggle, he had to lose many things in his personal life.
But he did not reflect in his mind at any time.
Every moment of life has given a message of love, sacrifice and peace
Have you seen the uniqueness of such great characteristics
In the beginning of this year, I got the address to participate in the 350th Birth Anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh Ji in Patna Saheb.
Come, let us all learn from the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and his sympathetic life and try to improve our lives.
Those who were born in the year 2000, or after that, who were born in the 21st century, will start becoming a voter eligible in 2018.
As a democracy of India, I welcome the voters of the 21st century and the voters of New India.
I convey my best wishes to these youngsters and to all of you that you all go and register yourself as voters.
All over India, as a voters of the 21st century, is enjoying for you.
The vote is a tool to make a positive change in the lives of lakhs of people.
You will not be empowered only to vote.
Today, in my voice of mind, I would like to talk about our commemorative youth of 18 to 25 years of age.
I consider them as New India Youth, New India Youth, Youth of New India, Youth, Excitement, Skill.
I am confident that the dream of a New India will be fulfilled by the talent and strength of our powerful youth.
When we talk about a New India, the New India should be freed from casteism, religion, radicalism and corruption.
It should be free from dirt and poverty.
Everyone should get equal opportunities in New India, the aspirations and aspirations of all should be fulfilled.
Peace, unity and harmony should be our guiding forces in New India.
My new Indian youth, come forward and look at how to build a New India.
Young people from 18 to 25 years of age can sit together and exchange ideas about New India, find ways and plans
Can we think how to fulfill our resolutions before 2022
Can we imagine the dream of our freedom fighters to build India
The Gandhians turned the freedom struggle into a mass destruction.
My young friends, it is compulsory for us to create a mass diversity of the 21st century to create a higher India.
How to achieve the success through psychology
Today, there are many new opportunities in front of the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youngsters are moving forward and success.
My dear countrymen, I had spoken of the importance of positive and positive thinking in the last Mann Ki Baat.
There is a case in English - Pessimism Leads to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
In the last Mann Ki Baat, I was urging you to share the positive accounts of 2017 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am very happy to note that a large number of people have given positive answers to the social bases, the MiGov portal and the Narendra Modi App.
The Positive India Hashtag has also made lakhs of towels, which has reached more than 150 crore people.
In a way, this spread of positiveness has spread all over the world from India.
The returns and answers that are coming are really sympathetic.
This was a comfortable experience.
Some of the people of the country have mentioned some incidents of this year that have caused a positive impact on their minds.
Some people share their personal achievements.
My name is Meenu Batia.
I live in Packet One, Face One, from Mayurvihar in Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
She wanted to study.
For this, I needed loans, it has been easier for me and my daughter could continue to study.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I'm living in (B) switching.
My husband had done an accident to pay one rupee a month.
He died unfortunately in the accident.
We know about the worst situation that happened to us at that time.
We have got a lot of benefits due to the help of the government and we have been able to get rid of it.
My name is Santosh Jadav.
Our BHINNAR back village was launched by the National Highway in 2017.
Because of this, our roads have become excellent and our business has started to grow.
My name is Dipansu Ahuja and Saddakanj in Shaharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Sadish.
We have been dependent on the drunken tube of the army for the last 40 years due to the deterioration of drinking water in our area.
Now there is a drinking water pipe for us alone...
This is our biggest achievement of 2017.
There is a positive change in the lives of a large number of people due to many of the acts of their own conditions.
In fact, this is the New India, which we are building together with us.
Come, let us go to New Year with these small joys, start a New Year, move from Positive India to Progressive Greece - from a positive India to a creative India.
When all of us talk about positive ideas, it seems that I should share a thing.
I have heard about the story of Anjum Bashir Khan Kadak, who was the best choice in the state's work exams.
He has emerged from the bail of extremism and defence and has been the leader of the state's regime.
In 1990, you will be ashamed to know that the extremists have burnt his background.
At the time of extremism and violence, his family was forced to throw out their ancestors.
He never gave up hope.
He has set a path for himself - that is the path of service to the people.
He emerged from the opposite environment, and he drew his success.
Today he is not only Jammu and Kashmir but also an inspiration for all Indias.
Even though the environment is so bad, it has proved that through constructive actions, it can dissolve the clouds of disappointment.
Last week, there was a chance to meet some women from Jammu and Kashmir.
This is the strength of the country, these are my young wealth, these are the future of my country.
Millions of devotees come every year to this world-renowned temple.
But the Sabarimala temple is an example of how to convert cleanliness into a culture, how to find a way to resolve the problem and how to make peoples contribution into a power.
B.
Vijayan, a police officer, launched an action plan called Purniyam Garden, which initiated the Swachhta Abhiyan on Swachhta.
This Punya Garden Mission, which has made such progress in Sabarimala, has become a part of the journey of every traveller.
There, even with difficult obstacles, a determined resolution related to cleanliness is also going together.
My dear countrymen, on October 2, 2014, we all made a resolution on the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, that is, Swachh Bharat, that is, Swachh Bharat, which was free from pollution.
He has served the entire life of his brother and tried to do this.
On the 150th birth anniversary of the mother, we had decided that we should contribute towards that direction, to the dream of a Swachh Bharat which we had dreamt of.
Efforts are being made throughout the country towards cleanliness.
There is a widespread change in rural and urban areas with the help of people-building.
To improve the quality of sanitation in urban areas, the worlds largest research is being conducted in the name of Swachhta Survey 2018 from 4th January to 10th March, 2018.
This study will include about 40 crore people in more than 4,000 cities.
The Survey will also envisage elimination of open defecation in cities, collection of pipelines, processing of pipelines, processing of drainage, capacity building, innovations for cleaning and peoples participation in this work.
According to this survey, different groups will go to cities and conduct research.
They will talk to the citizens and get answers from them.
They will also review the use of Swachhta App and development of various services centres.
It will also be considered that all the organisations have been set up by the cities to make the cleanliness of the city the nature of the people.
It is not that the government should only implement cleanliness.
Every citizen and citizen organisation has a huge contribution.
On the basis of this survey, if you have a population of more than one lakh in your city, if you have a country-class quality and less than one lakh population, you will also be given a region-class standard.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share one thing with you through this programme.
I was noticed that if any Islamic woman wants to travel to Haj, she cannot go without 'Mahram' or his male insurer.
When I heard about this for the first time, how can this happen
Why did this distinction emerge
For years, there has been injustice to Islamic women, but no debate has been made about this.
Such regulations are not even in many Islamic countries.
But this right has been denied to the Islamic women of India.
I am happy that our government has focused on it.
Our Minority Affairs Ministry has undertaken the necessary measures and has finished the tradition of 70 years.
Today, I am glad that Islamic women can travel to Haj without a male insurer Mahram and this time 1300 Islamic women have applied for Haj pilgrimage without male insurgents, from Kerala to North India and from various parts of the country have expressed their desire to travel to Haj.
The Ministry of Minority Affairs has been advised to ensure that all women who have applied for a separate journey will be allowed to visit Haj.
I am confident that the development journey of India is progressing and progressing through the strength of our womens power and their knowledge.
Our sustainable efforts should be made to ensure that the powers and opportunities of women are equal to men and they will also see equal progress in the path of development.
My dear countrymen, on the 26th of January, we all are historically important.
However, the next year will be remembered on 26th January, 2018.
In this year's Republic Day celebrations, leaders of 10 ASEAN countries are coming to India as the leading guests.
On Monday, 10 prominent guests will be present on this occasion, not on the other side.
This has not happened so far in the history of India.
In 2017, the ASEAN and India were well-known.
ASEAN concluded its 50-year period and achieved 25 years of Indias combination with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that these great leaders of the 10 countries of the world will participate here on 26th January.
It is very rare that there will be no pundit on a day.
Now all of us have celebrated Christmas festival and the next year is to be celebrated.
May the coming New Year abstain from a lot of happiness, happiness and fulfilments.
Let us all move forward with a new dimension, new enthusiasm, new motivation, new determination and a nation.
Makar Sankranti will be celebrated this month on the occasion of sunrise in January.
This is a time associated with nature.
If we say, every festival is connected to nature in some way, but in our diverse culture, this unique event of nature is a habit of celebrating in different ways.
If Lohri enjoys enjoyment in Punjab and Northern states, it is expected to come to Kichchi and Til Sankranti in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
In Rajasthan, Sankranth is known as Mag-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu - all of them have a special significance for themselves and for this.
All these festivals are celebrated from 13th to 17th January.
Though the namely these are different, the ethics that are the foundations of these are the same - the link between nature and agriculture.
Congratulations to all the people of the country on the occasion of this festival.
Once again, many congratulations to all of you on the New Year 2018.
Thanks to the dear countrymen.
We met again in 2018.
Mann Ki Baat September 2019
There is no doubt that there will be any Indian citizen who doesn't respect him, who doesn't respect him.
He was the most younger than all of us at the age, witnessed in different stages and different times of the country.
Not only of our new generations, but for all of you, this is a great learning experience, you have a great sympathy for us, even after you have done so many achievements in your life, you have always received the primary accomplishments for the promotion and work of your parents.
I have this feeling very pleasant.
Nijama, I don't want to give you any trouble.
Why, I know how much you're running, how much work you have, I'm doing to see everything.
Yeah.
Modhi ji: Because of your love, you're very happy.
Modi ji: I have been thankful to me for the concern that you have continued to show me over me.
Once again I convey my beloved birthday greetings to you.
Modi ji: When I came to Mumbai this time, I thought of talking to you.
We will also celebrate several festivals like Navratri Mahotsavam, Karba, Durga Puja, Dasra, Deepavali, Baiya Dhuj, Satpuja.
In many cities, start-ups of various government organisations and youth are engaged in this work.
They integrate all the dresses, sweets and food items in the houses of the people and find the needy and bring it to them without any advertisement.
This time, in this season of festivals, can we screw the darkness that is in the light of the entire awareness, mind and mind
The smoke burning in the faces of many poor families will double your joy in the festives, your face is more shiny, your light, your light is more bright and more bright.
My dear brothers and sisters, On the day of Deepa, you are welcomed in the house to provide a lot of males and accomplishments.
We warmly welcome the monks.
Would we welcome Mrs in a new way this time
In our culture, we salute women in the form of monks because women are considered to be a fulfilment of goodwill.
Can we organise programmes to honour women in our society, in our villages, in cities
We can organise public programmes, by their hard work and hard work, many women will be amongst us, in our family, in society and in the country.
Can we organise programmes to honour and value these shrines of India during this Diwali
Women who have done many extraordinary jobs may be among us.
One might have been trying to create awareness about cleanliness and health, some might have been engaged in some social service as a doctor, an engineer, an engineer and a poor child.
As a lawyer, it might have been trying to fight for justice.
Our society should recognize such women and be proud of them.
Like all of us, we will join the campaign of a selfie with daughters all over the world, we will end the movement of Bharat ki Laxmi.
Inspiring the people of India is to ensure the fulfilment of life of the country and the country.
My dear countrymen, I had already told you about the voice of Mann Ki Baat that I get the opportunity to interact with many of them who have not known.
In the past, Alina Thayang, a student in remote Arunachal Pradesh, wrote a funny letter to me.
I am from Roying area of Arunachal Pradesh.
Some people asked me whether you have read the book of Exam Boards when my election results came this time.
I said I didn't read that book.
But after returning home, I bought this book and read it again 2-3 times.
After this, the experience of me was very sweet.
My brethren are grateful to me for writing the letter.
Further, I am very grateful to me for the complaints made in it while studying.
I will be followed by your order.
What is your experience in your daily life
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend of Arunachal and student Alina Thayang.
My heartfelt countrymen, through your newspapers, through TV, you are aware of the uninterrupted events of the Prime Minister of the country, you are discussing and deliberating the situation of no rest.
This time, how much was spoken about the success in the US Open competition, Medveda's speech for the second time in the final race was also discussed.
I also heard a more speaking speech on the social networks and then I saw the lamb.
It was 23 years since Medveda's ease and compassionateness in Den.
If there was another man, he would have been distressed and disappointed, but he had no argument on his face, but through his words he made smoke in the smoke of everybody's child and the smoke.
His interaction was welcomed by all the audience there.
In one lamp, the zeal of the producer and the jealousy of the winner were dreaded.
If you say that you haven't heard Medveda's speech yet, especially the youth, please go and see, listen.
There are many things to learn from all sections and all the adults.
These moments are against the failure of the success, and there is no meaning for the failure of the success.
Life is a success, and our chariots show us this thing in a very special way.
The idea of our ancestors is really surprising.
Mani Kanchana Samyoga: Janayatti Lokasya Lokasan joy: i.e. if a person gets the ability and work together, he cannot win anyone's heart
In fact, this young sportsperson has won all the hearts of the world.
My hearts and my countrymen, especially my young friends, this is what I will say now for your direct welfare.
But if we have prevented them from awakening in the beginning, then it can be very safe.
I would like to say a thing to this feeling, especially to the younger community.
You all know that smoking addiction is a very bad effect for health and it becomes very difficult to eradicate that habit.
Tobacco users are more likely to suffer from diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure.
It affects the development of the brain due to its habit in childhood .
But today, I have come here to share a new thing with you.
You know, now there is a ban on e-cigarettes in India.
E cigarette is different from ordinary cigarettes, a kind of electronic device.
A kind of smoke is produced due to the wetness of nicotine liquid substances in the EC cigarette, through which nicot is utilised.
We all are well aware of the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but the misconception of e-cigarette is spread.
That means that there is no danger to this E cigarette.
Like other cigarettes, it should not be smelled because it mixes a smelling substance.
We might have seen that if a father continues to smoke at a house, we would have seen that he would not smoke others in that house, and his children should not have a habit of smoking like him.
He will try to smoke anybody in the family.
Because he knows how bad the body will suffer from smoking and smoking.
They are smoking and they are well aware of it.
But the E cigarette is not the case.
People do not have such awareness about EC cigarettes.
They are not fully aware of the danger of this, because of which sometimes e-cigarette enters the house quietly.
In fact, E cigarettes are composed of many evil products, which will lead to worst impact on health.
Anyone who is in a smoke will show us the nectar.
It is to say that the dreams of every family should not be put in their feet.
Leave the habit of tobacco and do not take any misconception related to E cigarettes in mind.
Come together, let us create a healthy India.
Yes, you don't remember Fit India.
Fit India means that if you go to Jim for two o'clock in the morning, you can't have it.
It is important to avoid these things.
I am sure you don't feel bitter to say that it will definitely be good for you.
They did not live for themselves, but dedicated themselves to others.
He is honoured in Vedican city on October 13.
The works done for the welfare of humanity in the last 50 years of Sister Variya Treasia are an example of the entire world.
He had a special role in the field of social service and education.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride that today, when we are celebrating the 150th Birth Anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians have been determined to get rid of the hustle-bustle.
In the direction of environmental security, India has been leading the entire world in a way and today the vision of all nations is on India.
I am confident that all of you will take part in the movement to get rid of the capabilities that will be used on 2nd October.
In many places, people are making a golden contribution to this movement in their own ways.
But a young man of our country is conducting a very vibrant movement.
When I looked at the milk of his work, I tried to make a phone call to him and know about his new test.
For the first time, when I heard this word of plogging, it was new to me.
Perhaps this word may be very useful in foreign countries.
Hello Riputman ji, salute me, I speak Narendra Modi.
My best wishes to you.
If 130 crore Indians have taken one step in this direction then India will move ahead with 130 crore feet towards achieving the liberation of only one useful materials.
Ribudaman Ji, once again thanks to you for my best wishes.
Moreover, thank you and your team for such a new imagination from my side.
Teng u.
My dear countrymen, the country and the world are working in the preparation for the 2nd October, but we want to travel on the path of 150 Gandhians.
We want to make a transformation and progress in our lives.
I would like to recall you about a thing beforehand.
However, in the next Mann Ki Baat, I will talk about it in detail, why should I talk about it just a short while ago
All of you will remember that on 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji's birthday.
We must drive for unity on that day in thousands of villages of India, in schools and colleges, all children and elders.
My dear countrymen, all of you might remember that on August 15, I had spoken from the Red Fort and asked you to visit some 15 places in India by 2022.
At least 15 places, if possible, one or the other or the other, have to set up programmes to stay there.
When holidays are coming on the occasion of Deepawali, I once again urge you to visit some 15 places in India.
And all these have been done only because of your cooperation, especially because we understand the importance of tourism.
My heartfelt countrymen, once again my best wishes to all of you for a variety of festivals in a diverse India.
A few days ago, there was a chance to have a far-flung contact with the young friends of Karnataka.
The Times team's 'Vijay Karnataka' newspaper published a paper on the children, in which they asked the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
They published some selected letters in that magazine.
When I read those letters, they were good for me.
Kirti Hectay of Northern Karnataka appreciated the Digital India and Smart City programme and said that there is no country for children on classrooms in today's time, and they are keen to know about nature.
If we give information about the nature of children, then they will have the potential to be affordable to natural security in the future.
Reeda Nadaf, a child from Lakshmeshwara, writes that he is the daughter of a soldier and that he is proud of him.
If you are the daughter of a soldier, there is no wonder that you are proud of what Irfana has written from Kalpurgi, his school is 5 kilometres from his village.
My countrymen, I am happy to note that a newspaper has taken such a termination, these letters have come to me and I have got the opportunity to read them.
This was a pleasant experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today 2611.
Our Constitution Day is on 26th November.
In 1949, this day, the Constitution of India was accepted in the Constituent Assembly.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
This day is a memorable day for the members of the Constitution.
They were engaged in a three-year-old attempt to answer the Constitution of India.
Those who read those debates, know what their dedication to the nation was in those discussions.
Do you know how to work hard they will work for a constitution for our country with diversity
They did this with understanding and vision, while the nation is free from the slaves.
It is the responsibility of all of us to establish a New India with the help of the light of this Constitution and to keep the clear thoughts of those who gave the Constitution.
Our Constitution is very vast.
There is no sign of life that is not found in it, but it is not a matter of nature.
It is the responsibility of all of us to pursue the essence of the Constitution.
Be it citizens, rulers, we must move forward by understanding the feelings of the Constitution.
The objective of the Constitution is to ensure that no one has any share.
Today, on the Constitution Day, it is natural to remember Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
17 different groups were set up on the important issues of the Constitution.
The draft committee is one of the most important groups.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the draft Committee of the Constitution.
He was playing an important role.
Today, we are experiencing the pride of giving the Constitution of India, in order to build this, an unprecedented piece of Babasaheb Ambedkar's efficient leadership has been laid.
He ensured that the benefits of all sections of the society are benefitted.
On the day of his disappearance on December 6, we will remember and pay homage to him as always as we are.
Babasaheb's role in making the country self-reliant and powerful.
On December 15, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji was a naked day.
Ayediya Sardar Patel had done an extraordinary work to make the country a single work from the position of a farmer's son as a iron man.
Sardar was also a member of the Constitution.
He was a member of the Consultative Committee of basic rights, minorities and tribals.
Despite 2611 our Constitution Day, how can we forget the 2611 that took place 9 years ago
The nation remembers and pays tributes to all those who are brave citizens, police, security forces.
This country will never forget their sacrifice.
Terrorism is one of the worldwide extensions today, something happens every day and it is happening in a terrible form.
We have been suffering from extremism since last 40 years.
Our innocent people have lost their lives in thousands.
But a few years ago, when India spoke of extremism in the world, many of them did not take it intensely when they talked about terrorism, but today, when the world governments see radicalism as a major challenge.
This is aimed at destroying human powers.
Therefore, not only India, but all human powers in the world must unite and defeat terrorism.
This is the land of Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Gandhijis birth.
Terrorism and terrorism are engaged in a horrific effort to weaken and identify our social system.
Therefore, it is the need of the hour to be with human powers and awareness.
My dear countrymen, on December 4, we all are going to celebrate Naval Day.
The Indian Navy protects our coasts.
I convey my best wishes to all those associated with the Navy.
You all know that our culture has emerged on the banks of the rivers.
Whether it is the Sindhu river, the Ganges, the Yamuna, the Saraswati, our rivers, the sea, the economy and the war are important in both the ways.
This is our entrance to the entire world.
Their navy had a huge contribution in the expansion of the Empire of Empire, to make it economic proud.
Several examples of naval invasions and research visits of the Arabs are present even today in the Sanskrit literature.
Most of the world's navy had long been allowed by women in war operations.
But about 800-900 years ago, a large number of women have played an important role in the navy of the Armed Forces.
Women were also engaged in war.
There was a comprehensive technologies related to shipbuilding in the Egyptian regime.
When we talk about the navy, cannot Satrapati Shivaji Maharaj talk about the opening of his navy
The coasts of Konkan, which were driven by Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts associated with the empire of Shivaji Maharaj, Sindhu Durga, Muruth Janjeera, Swarna Durga were situated on the seashores or surrounded by seas.
The responsibility of the security of these forts was Maratha's army.
Large ships and small ships were included in the Maratha Navy.
His navy was capable of attacking or defending any enemy.
What can't you talk about Kanoji Angre, talking about the Maratian Navy
He brought the Maratha Navy to a new summit and established Maratha naval bases in many places.
Sumitra immediately engaged in rescue operations, saved many fishermen from drowning and delivered them to Bangladesh.
During the floods in Sri Lanka this year in May, three ships of our ships reached there immediately and reached the country's government and the people.
Our navy helped protect the fisherman in their fishing boats when the Poova New Guinea government sent us an emergency assistance in June.
Our navy has been proud to the nation whether it brings medical assistance to the country of Fiji, if it is immediate relief and brings humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring countries.
The Indians on our defence forces have always been valued, respect and pride, be it the navy, be it the air force, the courage, courage, courage, courage, sacrifice and sacrifice of our soldiers.
125 crore Indians live a peaceful life because of the soldiers who sacrifice their youth for the nation.
Every year on 7th December, we are following the Flag Day of the Armed Forces.
All this week will be flagged off on all the small and big people.
The campaign to respect the soldiers in the country will be launched.
On this occasion, we can distribute flags of our armed forces.
This fund is being spent through the welfare of the soldiers for the welfare and rehabilitation of the families of the martyrs of the war and the injured.
You are ksb to know about various ways of economic partnership.
Let us use this opportunity and work to enhance the mindset of our soldiers.
We also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, World Soil Day on 5th December.
I want to tell some things to our farmer brothers and sisters.
All the food we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food is connected to the soil.
Just imagine that if this prosperous soil is not there in this world then imagine what it is.
The trees are not planted, how can human life be possible
How to produce microbes
The farmers of this country are giving immense importance to both the subjects of devotion to the soil as well as scientific nature.
While the farmers of our country are associated with traditions, they are from the country on modern science, they are striving and compassionate.
When I visited the village of Dohu in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, I heard about the farmers there.
The farmers here have been using chemical fertilizers, which has affected the soil.
The production capacity of the soil was gradually decreasing.
In 2016-17, the cultivation of crops increased by 3 to 4 times each acre, from each acre to income from 4 to 6 thousand rupees.
Not only this, the quality of the soil has also been improved.
Due to lack of use of fertilizer, there was economically savings.
It gives me great pleasure that my farmer brothers have come forward to implement the suggestions given to them in the soil resource card and when they see the results, their enthusiasm increases further.
Farmer brothers have started to understand that if we take care of the landscape, if we take care of the landscape, then this landscape will take care of us.
Our farmers have more than 10 crore soil reservoirs across the country, through which they are able to know their land well, so that they can seed.
We bow down to the earth, but have we ever seen how harm she suffers due to her fertilizers like urea
It has been proved in all types of scientific methods that there is a severe impact on the landscape of urea as much as possible.
When the farmer is a landmass, how can he be cooked and wet if he gets sick
It is compulsory to make this mother-son relationship aware once again.
Can our farmers, the sons of our earth, the landlords of our soil ensure that if they are to be 75 years of independence in 2022, they will be able to reduce the urea used by them
We all have started to experience world warming and environmental change.
There was a time to start the cold swing before Deepavali.
But even in such a situation, there are some examples of the fact that the people of Sada and the world are awakening.
A 8-year-old girl from Madhya Pradesh, Dushar has tried to keep her villagers free from open defecation.
The 8-year-old boy couldn't speak, but was a weapon to disperse.
And he arose in the morning at 5 o'clock in the morning, and went to his village's house, and cast them up, and set them through the signals that he should not drive out the open space.
This kid gave 30-40 households every day and was freed from the habit of defecating the village of Kumhari.
This younger child is working to inspire Dushar inspire him to pursue cleanliness.
It shows that there is no age for cleanliness, there is no boundary.
Small, big, women, women, cleanliness is essential for all, it is important for everyone to contribute to cleanliness.
You might also remember that our talented sportspersons have won 4 medals in the Rio Olympics, and won the T-20 World Cricket for the unsuccessful.
Various competitions are going on throughout the country.
In the last few days, 17th National Paralysis Competition was organised in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country have shared their skills and showcased their skills.
One of them is a 19-year-old gigger docker from Gujarat, who has no muscles in 80 of his body, but look at his compassion, mind and labour.
As a result of this capability, he will be trained in the Centre of Excellences in Gandhinagar, Gujarat as one of the 32 Bara Swimmers selected by the Indian Sports Authority of India for 20-20 Paralimbics.
I bow down to the young igar Docker, I bow down my best wishes.
Today, special attention is being paid to the accessibility and opportunity of Divyangjans.
Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi Thiruvananthapuram will be celebrated a few days later.
This is the birth of the sovereign Hasrat Muhammad Saheb ji.
Prime Minister ji, I speak from Kanpur to Nirja Singh.
I pray to you that you will share 10 best of the best things that you have spoken in the voice of mind throughout this year.
Or there are elders in our villages, and they have never forgotten the grief, and do not forget the happiness.
We look at the past year-long, we are engaged in observations of the ideas, and we are undertaking the decisions of the next year's plans.
We are once again trying to recall the interesting events of the past year in the media.
It includes a positive thing and a negative thing.
But in the year 2018, when we take our feet, do not we remember the good things, do you not remember it
I tell you a idea - if you hear, see, share 5-10 positive things that have experienced, then there is no good feeling.
Can you contribute to this
Can we share 5 positive experiences in our life this time
I invite you all to welcome the year 2018 in a pleasant environment and we welcome it with good memories.
We will recall the events that inspire others.
We will recall the good things and create a good environment.
Good things provide the power to do good.
We will unite the strength and impact of this collaborative inspiration.
In my next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely try to bring things that have come to your Positive India to the nation.
My dear countrymen, next month in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I will come back to you again.
There will be an opportunity to exchange many things.
Sad Puja is one of the festivals that will be celebrated with various appointments and regulations on the auspicious day after six days of Diwali.
Traditional appointments are observed in every matter of what should be eaten and what should be eaten.
The significance of cleanliness in our lives is also behind this festival.
The entire house is being cleaned before the Sathpuja, as well as all are involved in the cleanliness of rivers, lakes, waterfalls, sacred places and pilgrimages.
The festival of Surya Puja or Sath-Puja is a feast of environmental protection, disease relief and regulation.
The feeling of destruction of snakes is in the background of this tradition, which enjoys masses, and this evil culture can be a major obstacle in progress.
It is a natural thing that everyone is proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is praised and critical.
We can only take the reflection of carpets and handicrafts.
The joy and joy of the heart increases when you hear that there is so much sale in a shop.
Approximately 680 percent of the Garhwal Sanctuary has been registered on Diwali.
The total sale of wounds and handicrafts has increased by about 90 percent.
Today, it shows that all the adults like youth, elderly and women are wearing garments and handlooms.
I can imagine how much wealthy families, the poor and the families of those who work in handicraft.
Rajan Bhad ji has written the Narendramodi Apple that you should share my experience of Diwali among the security forces and tell you how they are celebrating the festival of Diwali.
You all have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
For me, this time Deepawali brought a special experience.
Once again, we have got the opportunity to celebrate Deepawali with our enjoyed security forces across the border.
This time, it was an unforgettable experience for Deepavali with the security forces in the Kurage area of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our defence forces are protecting the country by facing all the extremely difficult and difficult situations in the borders, I salute all of our defence forces from the side of all nations for that struggle, dedication and sacrifice.
Whenever we have the opportunity, the opportunity, the experiences of our defence forces should be learned, the compassionate acts of our defence forces should be heard.
Many of us cannot know that our defence personnel are engaged in many important tasks not only in our borders but also in the world to maintain peace.
As a peacekeeper, they are proud of India all over the world.
For us, we are guided by the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, one family all over the world.
India has always been pressurizing women's equity, and the ICFI has been enhanced.
This can be seen as a small change in the bracket on top, but it shows a synonymous idea.
If we say that India has a great contribution to various works, then it is an ICFI.
India has always contributed positively to the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served around 50 operations in 71 peacekeeping operations worldwide.
These operations are being carried out in all parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kango, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Kango and South Sudan, the Indian Army has provided treatment to more than 20,000 patients through medical services.
Most of them know that India is the first country to send the first woman's guard through the United Nations Peacekeeping Movement in Liberia.
This activity of India is a sympathy for all the world countries.
Since then, all the countries started sending their women's guard units.
It is a matter of pride for everyone that India's contribution is not only with peace conservation, but is also engaged in training about 85 countries of peace conservation.
Our satisfactory peacekeepers have brought the message of peace and harmony all over the world from this land of Gandhians and Gautama.
Peaceful activity is not a simple task.
Our security forces have to go to difficult places.
It is likely to live among different people.
There is a need to understand a variety of situations and different cultures.
They have to be replaced according to regional and environmental issues.
When he thinks about him, the hearts of all the people of the country are very proud and the only II awarded by Paramveer Chakra.
In 1989, he was appointed as Force Commander for operations in Namibia, who dedicated his services to ensuring the freedom of Namibia.
India is always a message of peace, unity and harmony in the world as a messenger of peace.
Even though he was born as Margaret Elizabeth in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda named him 'Nivedita.'
It means that Nivedita is completely dedicated.
At the following time, he dedicated himself to his name.
Yesterday, the 150th birth anniversary of sister Nivedita.
He was very attracted by Swami Vivekananda, burst his comfortable life and dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor.
Brother Nivedita suffered from the injustices of the British regime.
The British have not only slapped our country, but they are engaged in their efforts to keep us slaves.
Reflecting our culture, the work of deteriorating our minds continues.
Brother Nivedita re-established the pride of Indian culture.
He worked to raise the awareness of the nation and unite the people.
He went to different countries of the world and shouted his voice against the misrepresentation of religious and philosophy.
In a poem of renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati Innovation, he has explained the equilibrium of the New Yugopainter and his architecture.
It is said that the inspiration for this song was received from her sister Nivadita.
Brother Nivedita has helped the great scientist Jagdishchandra Phosu.
He has collaborated and spread through his articles and summits to propagate and propagate Bose's study.
It is one of the most beautiful features of India to complete one of the spiritual and sciences.
Brother Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose are a special example of this.
In 1899, there was a serious blank disease in Kolkata, in which thousands of people died.
Brothers and sisters Nivedita did not think about her health and started the work of cleaning the canals and streets.
He might have lived comfortable, but he was engaged in the service of the poor.
He was inspired by this sacrifice and started contributing to the service of the people.
He taught a lesson about the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is surprising to hear that the children are suffering from diabetes.
In the ancient times, such diseases are called royal diseases, which means that such diseases are only prosperous and comfortable people.
Such diseases were rarely seen by the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today, we know that these diseases are a lifestyle problem.
One of the main reasons for such diseases in young age is that the physical activity of our lifestyle is decreasing and the changes in food habits.
It is very important to focus on society and family.
If you look at these things then you will feel that there is no need to do anything extraordinaryly.
We have to naturally make our old habits absorbed and make small things properly.
Children should be in the habit of playing in the open fields and efforts should be made aware of the family.
If possible, the elders of the family can join the sports with these children.
Instead of using Liftip, children can have a habit of climbing on the stairs.
Everyone in the family after dinner can walk with children.
Yoga is particularly beneficial to create a healthy lifestyle to our youngsters, and to prevent lifestyle.
Before the school starts, you will feel how much benefit will be done for the first 30 minutes of Yoga
If I say that it is easy, it can be learned easily, why is it easier, it can be done anywhere.
There is no need for specific equipment or fields.
Yoga is very beneficial in controlling diabetes and many researches have been carried out.
The study is underway at AIIMS (AIIMS) hospital and it is very inspiring to look at the results that have been achieved so far.
We will not see Ayurveda and Yoga as a mere treatment, but make them a part of our life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been many good news in the sports sector in the last few days.
Since our soldiers have played the best, we have been able to succeed in Asia after decades.
Earlier, India won the Asian Cup in 2003 and 2007.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the weavers and helpers on my side and on the side of the country.
After Hockey, India has got good damage to Betminton's game.
Betminton star Kidambi Srikanth has won the best in Denmark Open and has made India proud.
After Indonesia Open and Australia Open, this is the third Super Series Primeier's success.
I express my gratitude to our young sportspersons and their achievements for making India proud.
Friends, This month FIFA has started World Cup Competitions for 17 years of age.
The teams from all over the world came to India and showcased their talents on the footsteps.
I also got the opportunity to see a lamb.
The sportspersons and audience were encouraging all.
The world is taking care of the great event of World Cup.
When we saw such a big lamb, the strength of all the youngsters, the thirsty of encouraging and achieving it, the humility was over.
The World Cup was successfully launched and all the teams showcased their talents very well.
Even though India could not succeed, the young sportspersons of India won the hearts of all the people.
All the world countries, including India, have enjoyed this great festival, have attracted and enjoyed the audience of the entire sword.
The symptoms of the future of the footprint are very bright.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons and those who helped them and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, when you see the number of people who write about Swachh Bharat, you will have to pay tribute to their feelings, I will have to offer a daily voice of Mann Ki Baat, I will have to dedicate the voice of every mind to cleanliness.
Some people are sending photographs on the efforts of small children and some are sending information about the efforts of the youth.
At some places, some innovations related to cleanliness are being created or somebody gets information about the changes made by an officer's efforts.
In the past, a detailed statement was given to me about a revival story in Chandrapur fort of Maharashtra.
There, an NGO named Ecological Protection Organisation was engaged in cleaning the fort of Chandrapur through its entire team.
In this movement that took place for 200 days, they were engaged in the work of cleaning the fort without any rest.
Continuously 200 days.
As soon as you see this, your disappointment will turn into confidence.
This pilgrimage for cleanliness is an exemplary example of beauty, social activity and intermediate effort.
The fort is a symbol of our tradition.
The responsibility of protecting and keeping historical traditions clean is of all of us.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the ecological protection organisation, their entire team and the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on the next 4th of November, we will celebrate Guru Nanak ji's birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Dev ji was not only the first Guru of the Sikhs but also the Guru of the world.
He thought of the interests of the entire human society, and sinned all the castes equally.
He stressed the empowerment of women and respect for women.
He gave the message of sustaining equality in the society, not only halted his message with words, but also in his functioning.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has provided 3 messages to live a very beneficial life - to supreme the name of God, to work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev ji took his teachings and composed a sacred book Guru Grand.
We will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of our Guru Nanak Dev Ji on the coming year of 2019.
Let us try to move forward on his teachings and messages.
My dear countrymen, after two days, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be celebrated on 31st October.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's specialty is that he was not only a manifestation of change, but also a very difficult problem that erupted, he was able to resolve the process.
He was a specialist in implementing the idea.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took over the great responsibility of connecting India to the same.
In the beginning, he made sure that millions of nations should be brought under the layer of the One Constitution Act.
His ability to make a resolution gave him the power to cross all the barriers.
The word Sardar ji is still a synonym of the dream of a New India.
That is why we follow his birthday as National Integration Day.
His contribution in providing an integrated form to the nation is incomplete.
On the occasion of Sardar jis birth anniversary, on 31st October, a programme for Unity is being organised across the country, in which many people from all over the country will participate in this programme as children, youth, women and all ages.
I also urge you to participate in this run for unity and unity and join together in a mutual harmony celebration.
My dear countrymen, after the holiday of Deepawali, with a new commitment, with a new determination, you all have started to reinforce your daily life.
My best wishes to all of you and to fulfil your dreams.
I have completed three years from talking to you through the voice of Mann Ki Baat in Akaswani.
Today, it is 36th.
In a way, there are accusations of India's creative power, feelings, hopes and expectations in all the corners of the country, but I have given a unique opportunity to connect with the feelings of the people.
You might have noticed that I have never spoken the voice of my mind.
Whether it is an e-mail, telephone, mygov, narendraModiApp, all of these are available to me.
Sometimes individual related problems, sometimes social problems etc. are attracted.
I take about half an hour in a month, but people have been sending me information about the voice of Mann Ki Baat for 30 days in a month.
I am grateful to the people of the country for the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country in such a short span of time.
In the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have always reminded of the words of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
After this, I had received a lot of letters from everywhere in the country and many social organisations and many youngsters were engaged in foodlessness.
While looking at it, it was not only in India but also from all over the world that Selfie has been transformed into a big movement.
This is not a problem of social media.
Every girl has become a new self-confidence and a new pride event.
Every parents had to take a mobile phone with their daughters.
Every woman has a feeling that she has its own importance.
In the past, I participated in a session of the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
Wherever you travel, I asked the travellers to send photographs of Incredible India to me.
Millions of films came from the corner of India, in a way it became a huge property for the workers in the tourism sector.
Every moment is moving towards the right path of the country.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something positively for the welfare of others, for the welfare of the society, for the progress of the nation.
In this three-year movement of Mann Ki Baat, I knew and learned from the people of the country.
This is the biggest capital and great power for any country.
The sale of kitchens has increased, which has led to increasing employment in the houses of the poor.
Since October 2, there is a substantial disposal of liquidation.
I once again urge you to take forward the movement related to letters, we will further strengthen it.
When we buy kadharadas, we should keep in mind the feeling that Diwali can be lighted in the houses of the poor.
We have to do this for this thing that the power of the poor of our country is produced by this process.
Due to the increase in interest in the garlands, there has been a new idea, motivation and motivation for the workers in the field of garlands and the people associated with garlands in the Government of India.
The idea of how new technologies can be enhanced, how to enhance productivity, how to introduce solar equipment.
We have started thinking about how to revive the tradition that had been missing from the trial for 20-30 years.
In Uttar Pradesh, the Sevapuri Kadi Ashram of Varanasi has been closed for 26 years, which has now started functioning with New Delhi.
That is, on the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, on 2nd October, 15 days ago, we decided to participate in the Swachhta Yojana across the country.
Let us unite the minds of the people through cleanliness.
Our Honble President inaugurated this task and the nation was united in it.
Today, all the elders and children, men and women, cities and villages are connecting themselves as part of this cleanliness movement.
I had said that this cleanliness movement is moving towards achieving with the help of our commitment and is spreading in front of our eyes.
Everybody is making it suitable for them, helping them and contributing to achieving it.
All the sportspersons, theatres, academics, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, workers, police personnel and soldiers are connecting themselves with this movement.
I am feeling a good thing that if people are filthy in public places, people are listening to the layers, there is a need to keep the worker there clean.
This time I had to pay attention to another thing - cleaning is one thing, it is another thing that we are not awakened to clean up.
At the same time, cleaning is our natural nature, it is important to implement an ideal movement.
This time there were several competitions related to Swachhta Hi Seva.
More than 12 crore children participated in the articles.
Thousands of children brought their imagination capabilities to paintings.
When we talk about cleanliness, I don't forget to express my gratitude to the media.
They have taken this movement forward with a very clean spirit.
They have contributed a lot to make a positive environment by connecting them with them in a suitable manner.
We have seen how big service is being made to the Swachhta Hi Seva movement by e-Media and newspapers of our country.
A few days ago, one of the 18-year-old youths of Srinagar, Bilal Dar, told me about it.
Asia's largest lake is near Sri Nagar, in which he used to remove plastics, polythenes, bottles and puppets.
He also earned income from this.
Since his father was suffering from cancer and died, he joined his life with cleanliness.
Bilal Dar is a young age, a motivation and factor for all interested in cleanliness.
This month of October is a month of remembrance to many of our dignitaries.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, the birth anniversary of 11 Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh in October, 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay.
This year is the centuries of Nanaji and Deen Dayal.
Nanaji Deshmukh ji swallowed up his political life and joined himself with the movement of Grameodaya, while celebrating his centenary, it is important to pay respect to his work related to Grameodaya.
While speaking to the youth, former President of India, Abdul Kalam, will always present the issue of rural progress of Nanaji Deshmukh.
He also went to the villages to see these works of Nanaji.
Like Gandhiji, Deen Dayal Upadhyay will also talk about the human beings in the market of the society.
Deen Dayal would remember how to change the lives of the poor, the underprivileged, the underprivileged and the underprivileged in the society, education and employment.
If we think about all these gentlemen, it is not a thing that we can do to them, why do we think of these gentlemen
In every city of the country, there is a need for a large scale drive for this unity programme and the weather is also comfortable and it is necessary to get iron efficiency like Sardar.
Sardar ji did not unite the country
We also have to participate in this race for unity and take forward the mantra of unity.
We are very naturally saying unity in diversity and Indias achievement.
While we are proud of diversity, have you been trying to experience this diversity
I want to repeat to the people of the country, especially to the younger generations that we are alive.
Look at the diversity of our India, feel it, face it.
You can see that this diversity of our country will be a school for the development of the individuality within you.
The moment of holidays, the time of Diwali, the moment of our country has become a feeling of going somewhere.
The people of North India are unaware of what is in South India.
It is unaware of what is in the eastern India.
Do you know how many diversity in our country is pouring
If you have seen the speeches of Gandhiji, Lokmanya Tilkar, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam, one thing would be realized that when they looked around India, they had a new inspiration to see and understand India and to dedicate their lives.
All these gentlemen have seen India completely.
Before their operation, they tried to know and understand India.
They tried to see India live in themselves.
Can we try to learn, understand, understand, understand, understand and live in different states, different communities, groups, their habits, their traditions, their customs, their food habits and their beliefs
It is the value of tourism that we are not able to see and stop, but we are a student.
I have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts in India.
The dream of Ekta Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat has been fulfilled in this.
How many types of food habits
If you have every kind of food every day throughout your life, then there will be no chance to eat the same food again and there are such types.
This is the great strength of our tourism.
During these holidays, you should leave the house and not stop, but we are going for change, but go out with the aim of knowing and stopping things.
Your life will be completed by these experiences.
Your vision will be expanded.
Tell me who can be more than your experiences
If you go this time too, you have taken this movement forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share photos.
Definitely send your photographs in Incrediblendia.
If you want to meet the people there, send their photographs.
I have a feeling that in order to encourage the tourism sector in India, what will be the seven most important tourist destinations of your state - every Indian should know about those 7 places of your state, if possible, they should go to those 7 places.
With the help of this, can you give any information about this
Can you express this in the Narendra Modi App
Can you know this in Incredible India
I would like to tell the government that if many people from a state have said this thing then I would like to examine the 7 locations that have been reported in every state and release advertising papers about them.
That is, how can the tourist destinations be taken forward with the views of people in a way
Likewise, you can imagine that the places you have seen all over the country, whichever of the most important 7 places you have, others have to visit and get information about these things, and you must send them to MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
Come on, join me.
During this period from October to March, you can become a synonym to encourage the tourism sector of the country.
I'm calling you.
Our dear countrymen, as a man, many things touch my heart.
I'm a man like you too
The incident that took place in the past may have come to your attention. That is why the people of the country would have seen the magnificent reflection of women's power and patriotism.
The Indian Army has received two seizures - Lieutenant Twadi and Financial, which are extraordinary seizures.
If I say why are extraordinary people, they lost their lives in the service of Mother India, the husbands of both Swadhi and Finance.
You imagine how their mindset would be when the world falls down at this young age
But Martyr Karnal Santosh Mahadik's wife Swadhi Mahadik confronted such difficult situations and strengthened her mind and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and joined the army and inspired himself to realise his husband's dream.
Likewise, Niti Dubey's husband, Mahesh Dubey, was working as a nayak in the army, surviving in the service of Thailand and his wife, Niti, joined the army.
There is no doubt that every citizen will have respect for our mother-in-law.
My dear countrymen, between Navratri Festival and Deepawali, there is a huge opportunity for the youth of our country.
FIFA. The World Cup for 17 years of age is going to be held here.
I am confident that the foot will be reflected on all four sides.
Every generation will enhance the interest of footprints.
Everybody should play this game as if there is no sportsperson in any school-collury field of India.
Come, when all the world plays on Indian soil, we also make sports a part of our lives.
My living countrymen, Navratri is going on.
This is the time to worship Mother Durga.
The environment is enriched by pure comfort.
There is a kind of spiritual environment, festival and devotional environment on all sides.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I would like to convey my best wishes to the people of the country and to meet the aspirations and aspirations of the common citizen of the country and to take the nation to new heights.
The capabilities faced by every challenge should get the opportunity to the nation.
The nation must move forward at a fast pace, when India is 75 years of independence in 2022, when the dreams of the freedom fighters are fulfilled, the mindset of 125 crore people, the uninterrupted labour, the power and the mindset of the people, we must move forward by accomplishing the five-year plans for a New India, Maa Bara Shakti should give us his blessings.
My best wishes to all of you.
Please join the festivals, spread the buzz.
This country is the birthplace of Buddha and Gandhi, the soil of Sardar Patel who is associated with the entire nation for the unity of the nation.
Our ancestors have been honoured for centuries, for the life values that are generally followed, and for Ahims.
Ahimsa Paramodharma: - We have heard this word from our childhood, and have said.
This diversity is not seen only in food habits, habitats and dressing clothes.
This diversity is seen in every activity of life.
You must have seen that all our festivals have been set up in accordance with nature.
All these are directly related to nature.
Many of our festivals are associated with farmers and fishermen.
When I talk about the festivals with you today, I would like to say that Michami is sad to all of you.
The Jains celebrated the convocation yesterday.
Parushan Festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
Samavadsari is the last day of the festivals of Buryushan.
This is a wonderful tradition.
On the day of Samvatsari, it reflects memories, aspiration and friendship.
The festival is considered to be a symbol of unity, equality and cleanliness.
Children Chaturthi greetings to all the countrymen.
Now the festival of Om is being celebrated in Kerala.
The festival of Onam in Kerala is one of the most important festivals of India.
Nowadays our festivals are the factors of tourism attraction.
I would like to tell the country that the Navratri Festival in Gujarat, the Durka Festival in Bengal, this is a kind of tourism attraction.
Our other festivals have also provided an opportunity to attract the foreigners.
In this direction, we have to think more about what we can do.
It is Eid-ul-Suha that the festival will be held in a few more days.
At the same time, festivals should be the factors of cleanliness in New India.
Festivals and cleanliness are connected to the family.
The festival is ready to focus on cleanliness and sanitation.
This is not a new thing for us, but it is important to change it as a social natural.
They are pouring colors, one pours vegetable color, one puts a piece of paper in it.
Every family is doing various kinds of benefits.
In a way, the biggest ecosystem of environmental awareness has been seen for the first time in this Ganesha festival.
We started Swachhta Abhiyan three years ago and will complete 3 years with 2nd October.
Its positive consequences are emerging.
The area of toilets has increased from 39 percent to about 67 percent.
It is an important example of unity in the direction of cleanliness that the people of Jamiat Ulema A Hind organisation do not inspire everyone.
If the efforts made by the dedication and dedication to cleanliness have changed our sustainable nature then no height can be achieved by our country
We will seek opportunities whenever there is a chance and wherever there is a chance.
But we all have to join it.
We consider this as a kind of production that has preceded Deepawali or the production of Navratri or the production of Durga Puja.
Let's serve physically.
We will work together on holidays or Sundays.
We go to nearby habitations and go to nearby villages, but we can do all this as a movement.
I appeal to all non-governmental organisations, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government officials, district regimes and Panchayat leaders - 15 days before the birth anniversary of Gandhiji on 2nd October, we will create an environment related to cleanliness.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
After the construction of toilets, you can register the name of those whom you have helped to set up your name and toilets.
My social workforce friends can drive a few constructive movements and you can commemorate to ensure the work on the platform.
The conceptual competitors will be organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation through the commitment to Swachhta, a competitive competitive competitiveness and painting competition.
You can write in many languages, there is no age.
You can manufactur a tiny film, you can produce it on your mobile phone.
It should be a two-three-minute film, a motivation for cleanliness.
I invite all of you to join this movement related to cleanliness.
After organising the Swachhta Hi Seva Mission for 15 days, when we are celebrating the 2nd October, you can see how clean the joy will be given to the devoted Gandhians.
Millions of people write letters, reports, many people are giving news through phones, this is a big wealthy platform for me.
It is an opportunity to understand the minds of the people of the country.
I wait for the news that I have given you more than what you wait for for the voice of the mind.
I am thirsty because every thing you gives me an opportunity to learn.
Yeah, I too have made such a mistake.
Sometimes we cannot even talk to us about how much things change us naturally.
Prime Minister, I speak from Pune to Aparna.
I want to talk to you about my friend
She has always been trying to help everyone, but her action makes me depressed.
Once I went to the business complex to buy goods with her.
She spent Rs. 2000 without any difficulty in buying a kitchen and then spent Rs. 450 and bought a beetza.
But the auto driver who used to come to the campus was actively engaged in a fee of Rs. 5.
When he bought vegetables on the way back, he talked about every vegetable price and saved Rs 4-5.
I'm very painful.
We are buying things without any question, we are fighting for small money to our brothers and sisters who are working hard.
After hearing this phone call, I am sure that you might have been impatient and you might have made sure that you might have been humiliated and humiliated, and you might have made sure that I will not do so anymore.
Have you ever seen what will run in the minds of that poor
My dear young friends, the entire country is going to celebrate all the sports day on 29th August.
This is the birthday of Major Thyanchand, a hockey sportsperson and a hockey sportsperson of the world.
His contribution to Hacky is incomplete.
I recall this thing that the youth of our country should connect themselves with sports.
Sports must become a part of our life.
As we are the youngest country in the world, our youth should reflect in the fields of sports.
Sports provide sex, awakening mind, governance and development.
Sports are an adventurous sports in a way to connect the minds.
I would like to say that the younger generation of our country should move forward in the sports world and that is also important in the world of sports fields and computer sports.
FIFA's footsteps can be played in the computer, but I see the footsteps in the field.
You can play cricket in the computer, but play in the field, below the heaven, the joy of it is real.
At one time when all the children are out of the house, they ask when the mother is coming back.
As soon as it has changed in todays times, the children are sitting in a corner and start watching cartoons or drowning in mobile cameras.
There is a record in the field of sports, if any child of the country is capable of sports, they can welcome their details or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to selected and developing sportspersons tomorrow.
In India, from 6 to 28 October, FIFA has been organised for the World Call Cup of 17 years of age.
24 teams from all over the world are going to play in India.
Let us welcome the young guests coming from many countries through sports festivals, let us experience sports and create such an environment in the country.
While talking about sports, I would like to share with you about the event that took place in the past weeks.
Six such women are working in the navy.
Their feelings and their motivation are inspiring to all of us.
These six women wealth are traveling in a small boat INS TARINI and trying to cross the seas.
Navika Sagar Parikrama, the Navika Sagar Parikrama i. e.
They will return to India after several months around the world.
Sometimes you will spend about 40 days in water.
Sometimes it may have to be spent in water for about 30 days.
In the midst of the waves of the ocean, our six women wealth travel with compassion and this is the first time in the world.
I am also organising a separate way for their experiences at the Narendra Modi App and you are organising to study.
You must read that because I am happy to share the experiences of this woman's wealth with you.
My heartfelt congratulations and good wishes to these women.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating Teachers Day on 5th September.
Former President of our country, Dr.
This is the birthday of Radhakrishnan ji.
Though he was the President, he gave himself a precedent throughout his life.
He always wanted to live a monk.
He was dedicated to education.
Though he was an attorney, a diplomat, the President of India, he was alive every moment.
I remember him.
When we are celebrating Teacher's Day this time, can we all take a pledge together
Because of his efforts, the events that have succeeded in making a change in the lives of every teacher will certainly be in the lives of every teacher.
If we are trying socially, we can make changes in the country, we can make a big contribution in this.
Let us learn to change, take this mantra forward, come on.
Ananya's fate.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Centre of Howard University.
As an analyst, I have a great interest in financial inclusion, that is, financial inclusion, and social programmes related to it.
I would like to ask you the question that in 2014, you have started Jan Dhan Yojana and today in the last three years, whether India is financially more secure, whether it has increased energy or power, this empowerment and facilities have reached our women, farmers, workers, villages and villages.
My dear countrymen, Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana has been heard and financial inclusion is not only in India but also in the economic world.
On 28th August, 2014, I started this scheme with a dream in my mind.
The Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) commenced with 28th August, which will complete 3 years.
30 crore new families have been connected to it and bank accounts have been opened.
This is more than a number of countries in the world.
Sometimes, if the money falls in hand, if it was in the bag, if it was in the house, it would inspire to spend the house.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the money deposited in the banks is Rs. 65,000 crore through our poor.
In a way, this savings of the poor will be their strength in the future.
Those who have opened bank accounts through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will get insurance benefits.
Prime Minister Jeevan Jyoti Ayurveda, Pradhan Mantri Accident Bima Yojana - a simple amount of Rs.
In many families, if there is a problem for the poor due to this one rupee, if the family head dies then the family gets Rs. 2 lakh.
The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start Up Yojana, Stand Up Yojana - be it the under-privileged, the Scheduled Tribes, the Women, the educated youth, the youngsters who stand on their own feet, such millions of youngsters have been provided without any bondage from the banks under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
They are not only standing on their own feet, but also in a successful effort to provide employment to one and a half people.
In the past, some people from the banking sector came to meet me and told me that they had got a lot of inspirational things when they had done a study on how the benefits of the common man have been made due to Jan Dhan Yojana, Insurance Schemes, RuPay Card and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I will bring them to your sight, and I will make all efforts.
Even from the media, there are events that can be fully utilised.
They can also interact with such individuals and create a new concept for the new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again condolences to all of you.
English rendering of the text of PMs address at Indian Radio in Agra today morning
The rainy season becomes a time to enjoy the minds of people.
Animals, birds, plants and nature are blooming due to rains.
But sometimes when this rain is very heavy, we know how much the water has the power to destroy.
Nature is the mother who lives for us, develops all of us, but sometimes natural calamities such as floods, landslides and their heavily forms are very destructive.
Changing climate and environmental changes have a negative impact.
Over the past few days, natural calamities were faced due to heavy rains in some parts of India, especially in Assam, North East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal.
Complete surveillance measures are being undertaken in flood affected areas.
State governments are also making efforts to help people affected by floods in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and emotional citizens are also making their best efforts to help the people in this environment.
Farming, Animal Husbandry, Infrastructure, Roads, Electricity and Communications are all affected.
We have initiated livelihood projects to the insurance companies, especially the crop insurance companies, to meet the losses of farmers and their crops, especially to the farmers.
Moreover, the process of 24 hours to deal with floods and 1078, which is aiding, is being fully operated.
People are expressing their hardships in this regard.
Prior to the start of the rainy season, the entire government machine was prepared for training in the majority of the areas.
National Disaster Rescue Forces were blocked.
They were trained to create and do what should be done, what should be done, what should not be done, how to determine the volunteers, set up a mass organisation and act in such circumstances.
At present, the weather is pre-deemed, technology has grown more and space science has played a major role in calculating it, which has resulted in almost the right calculation.
Gradually, according to the climate calculation, we must change our engagements and prevent the impact of disasters.
Whenever I am prepared for Mann Ki Baat programme, I can see that the people of our country are engaged in its preparation.
This time, a large number of letters and phone calls have been received on the Goods and Services Tax.
Even now, people have expressed their happiness and hopes about this goods and service tax.
I have heard this phone call: Praise, Prime Minister, I am Kurghavan, i. e.
Have you been expecting a month's expiry
I want to know about this, thank you.
The Goods and Services Tax has been implemented for about a month and the benefits of it have started to be ascertained.
I see how this new reconstruction system has been affected in the transport and services sector.
Items are also going very fast.
Despite this facility, it has also added strength to the economic pace especially.
Due to the first separate tax regime, most of the resources and documents of the transport and services department were spent in handling the documents and in every state there was a need to set up new settlements for themselves.
This tax, which I say good and simplicity tax, is indeed a very positive impact on our economy in a short span of time.
The speed at which there is a reconstruction, the speed at which there is a renewed renewable energy, the new records have been registered, all these have created a new hope throughout the country.
In many of the world universities, this is a model study.
Because in such a large scale, such a big change can be considered as a summit of success in such a large country, with the competing of millions of people.
S. T.
All the states have a role and responsibility in implementing the GST.
All the decisions and states have been taken together as the Central Government.
What was the price of something specified by the App before this regime, how it was after the new regime, everything is available in your mobile phones.
This is a historical success, historical achievement.
This is also a kind of social reform movement.
I salute the crores of crores of people who have succeeded in such a very natural way.
My dear countrymen, the month of Revolution in August.
Naturally, we have already heard about this thing that the Cooperation Movement was launched on 1st August, 1920.
Later, on August 9, 1942, the White India uit Movement was launched, we know that it was the August Revolution.
Next year 1947, the country was liberated on 15th August.
In a way, many events of the month of August have been specially linked to the history of freedom.
This year we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But this white-wheeler has proceeded by Dr.
Some people know that Yusuf Meher Ali is.
Our new generations should know what happened on the 9th day of August, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, we should inspire all the historic aspects of the people of the country to join themselves in the freedom struggle, to bind themselves and tolerate evils.
What else can be a greater sympathy than the sacrifices, penance and dedication of our freedom fighters
The White India uit Movement is the most important struggle for the Indian freedom movement.
This struggle made the entire nation a pledge to get rid of the British regime.
At that time, every corner of Hindustan against the British rule, the villages, the cities, the lessons, the poor, the wealthy, all joined the shoulder to shoulder and participated in the struggle against the British regime.
The anger of the people was at a height.
Millions of people of the country, who have been able to do the sake of Gandhians, have stripped the mantra of 'Setumadi' in my mind and took forward the struggle.
Lakhs of youngsters of the country have given their lessons and books in the freedom struggle.
The Sangathan of freedom was sounded and they went ahead.
The main contribution of the dignitaries like Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan has been contributed.
The Cooperation Movement of 1920 and the White India Exit Movement of 1942 shows two different dimensions of Gandhians.
The diverse diversity of collaboration was that in 1942, when the freedom offer was increased, a mantra like Gandhiji had to be prescribed.
The freedom struggle, which started in 1857, has continued to take place every moment till 1942 in any part of the country.
This long-term period has created a free choice in the minds of the people of the country.
Everyone was determined to do something.
Generations have changed, but there is no depression in mind.
The people used to come and drive themselves, go and go to new people, they joined themselves, they tried to drive the British regime, drive the country every day.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle had created a new position, which took this position to the heights of 1942.
In 1947, the British had to leave the country within five years.
Within 1857 to 1942, all the people of freedom had reached.
This five years, from 1942 to 1947, was a reflection of the mindset of the people. This five years of success were the reason for national liberation.
This five years is a decisive year.
Now I want to connect you with this account.
In 1947, we achieved independence.
Today we are in 2017.
Nearly 70 years have fled.
The governments came.
Organisations have emerged, changed, developed and grown.
Everybody has tried to overcome the country from its problems.
Efforts were made to increase employment in the country, eradicate poverty and grow.
Efforts were made in their ways.
The success was also achieved.
We must celebrate the 15th of August this year as a day of concluding the 15th of August and the 75th year of the country's independence in 2022.
Remembering the 9th August Revolution Day of August, on 15th August, everybody should make a pledge to make this kind of commitment to the nation, as a citizen, as a family, as a society, as a city and as a government department.
Millions of people need to suffer.
Efforts should be made to fulfil the number of such cases.
And that was the time when 5 years from 1942 to 1947 were determined to ensure the independence of the country, as well as this 5 years from 2017 to 2022, we must join it for the years to determine the future of India.
We are celebrating 75 years after the independence of the nation.
Every citizen, every social organisation, local organisations, schools, colleges, different organisations, all of us will take a pledge to create a New India.
May this be a pledge to achieve our percentage in the next five years.
What goal should we reach as a nation
What can be my contribution as an individual
Let us take forward all the technologies, videos, posts, plastics, books and new ideas.
Let us convert this movement into a mass movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi App will compete for young social friends from the White India to the question.
An attempt to compete with this question is to connect the youth with the proud history of the country and to know about the heroes of freedom struggle.
I am confident that you will spread this message well and spread it.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, I have got the opportunity to interact with the nation from the Red Fort as the Prime Minister of the country.
I'm a tool.
I read them myself and I will try to express them on the 15th of August.
Accusation was made before me that the speeches I addressed on August 15 last three were slightly long.
I am trying to regulate my rules and I don't know whether I can do it.
But I have the desire to try this time how to communicate my speech.
I can see whether I have a success or not.
Friends, I want to talk to you about another thing.
There is a social economy in India's economy.
We should never assess it less.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just a chance of joy.
Our festivals and festivals are also a campaign for social revival.
But also, every moment has a direct connection with the economic life of the poor.
After a few days, Rakshabandhan, Krishna Jayanti, then Pillayar Chaturthi, then Saud Chandra, then Ananth Chaturdasi, Durga Puja, Deepavali are coming together.
They connect individuals and society.
The natural journey between these two continues.
Ah Sey is an opportunity to move forward from the point of view of me.
In terms of economic status, even a few months before the Raksha Bandhan festival, many families have started to produce jungles as a small jungle industry.
A variety of rocks are being created with cotton to silver kilns
But today, people have started to enjoy the rocks that are being prepared at home.
It is directly linked to the poor artisans who have produced small-scale lights.
But today, while I talk about the festivals and the economic conditions of the poor associated with them, I would like to make it clear about the environment.
Sometimes I see that the countrymen are more aware and positive than me.
Since last one month, I have been writing letters about the environment of aware citizens.
You have already asked me to talk about a child who is ecosystem favourable before the child's church, and that is why he can plan the wishes of a child made on the earth.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to such aware citizens.
At the same time, it should also be our commitment to create the roots of the child prepared by the soil, which is eco-friendly to protect the environment.
This time I have already told you
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the festivals and festivals coming.
Just a few days ago, our women and women have done a grand performance in the World Cup competition.
This week they all got the opportunity to meet.
I was very happy to talk to them, but I realized that they were suppressing them that they were unable to win the World Cup.
This pressure on their faces was shipped by this crisis.
I gave a different assessment on my side to those women.
Look, today's time is the media world, the expectations have increased, the extent that the success has not been achieved, it becomes angry.
If the sportspersons of India fail, we have seen the anger of the country slaughtering those sportspersons in many games.
Not only this, they appreciated the achievements made by these women, they were proud of them.
In fact, the youth of our country, especially women, are engaged in many things in pride for the nation.
Once again I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the youth, especially to our women.
We all have to take the country to new heights, take it to new heights.
Come on, let's travel together, let's travel by doing something.
Let us take forward the hope that the future of the country will certainly be very important.
My best wishes.
Climate is changing.
After the rain, the cold wind has given some breath to the summer heat in the past.
Whatever the others are facing in life, however individual life, however individual life, however individual life, the arrival of rains and a good change in the mindset of all of us.
The poor people of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the deity of the poor.
In English, there is a word called juggernaut, which means that no one can stop the important chariot.
On seeing in Agaradhi, it was known that the word 'Jagarnaut' has been created at the edge of Jagannath's chariot.
When we see all these things, we can understand how the world is accepting this greatness in their own ways.
On the journey of Lord Jagannath, I convey my best wishes to all the nations and bow down the syram in the tributaries of Lord Jagannath.
Let us all come together and get inspiration from these sacred festivals and share the Khajana of happiness and take the country forward on the path of development.
In this sacred month of Ramalan, we have come to know that an excellent convocation of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
There, about 3500 Islamic brothers and sisters are living in this small village with their families, in a way there are a large number of brothers and sisters of Islamic families.
In this month of Ramlan, the villagers decided to build toilets together.
So, they have said that they should spend this 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for the transformation of this holy occasion of Ramlan for the welfare of the society.
We know that in our country, the states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared free from open defecation habits.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have been declared Open Defecation Free.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration of these five states, to the rulers and the public.
We know that if something is to be done individually or in social life, then it should work hard.
If our signature is bad, we think that it should be corrected, we should try to make it very aware for a long time.
That is why it will become a habit of physical and mentality.
Likewise, some other bad habits are natural.
We must attract everybody's attention.
We must recall the inspirational events.
I am glad that cleanliness has not stood at the level of the government today.
This has been transformed into a movement of peoples society.
This is one of the districts of Vijayanagar in Andhra Pradesh.
What is its goal
Out of 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours, 10,000 households have been constructed.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to note that the people and the government have succeeded in constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
(in) comes through letters and through aeroplanes.
Prakash Tribhadi ji recalled the urgency and said that on June 25, the history of democracy is one of the greatest.
It is a culture that is not just an organisation of democracy, it is a commendable awakening to them on democracy.
At the same time, we have to take forward the good things of the democratic system.
On June 25, 1975, it is a bright night, no one can easily forget it.
No Indian can leave it.
All the great leaders of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were imprisoned.
Today, the students of the world are engaged in a series of attempts to recall that bitter period and to recall that period.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
Atal ji wrote a poem in the country after an emergency was announced for one year, and in that poetry, he described the atmosphere of the country at that time.
We must make this tradition stronger.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian remembers the head and feels great pride.
On June 21, 2017, the entire world was Yoga commemorative.
Everyone from water to mountains welcomed the sun rays in the morning and through yoga.
Yoga has not been earlier but today Yoga has become a bridge that connects the world.
Nearly all the countries of the world have turned the opportunity to provide this Yoga to them.
More than 4,000 people in Abudapi of the United Arab Emirates were engaged in Yoga, at Machhu Pichu, the world heritage symbol of China, 2400 meters above the sea level.
In Herath, Afghanistan, the India-Afghan partner, joined the Salma Dam in Yoga and set up a new edition of friendship.
Even in small places like Singapore, programmes have been organised at 70 locations and they have launched this campaign for a week.
This time again Yoga has achieved the world record.
About 55,000 people in Ahmedabad of Gujarat have achieved a new world record by combining Yoga.
I also got an opportunity to get Yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time in the rainy season, it was also a good opportunity for Yoga.
Our soldiers are also engaged in yoga art even in the syachen of the temperature of 20, 25, 40 degrees of menus.
Our army, Border Security Forces, Indian Tibetan Border Police Forces, Central Reserve Police Forces, Central Industrial Security Forces, all are engaged in Yoga training.
Since this is the 3rd International Day of Yoga, I had requested the family of three generations to take the film and share with me.
Some television channels also carried forward this matter.
Many of them have sent photographs to me and some of them have been selected in the Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister, I am from Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
I'm talking to him, Sonara.
I recall that in recent times you have said that instead of giving brown poultry to different places, you can give good books as a memorable memorial.
We cannot do anything to implement this idea throughout the country.
I liked it very much.
I am reminded of a thing that escaped from my memory again.
Because when I was in Gujarat, we shouldn't provide jewellery anymore, we had to give books or welcome a handkerchief and welcome.
We will also give the kadharadik handkerchief because it can encourage the kadharadas.
This was a habit when I was in Gujarat, but when I came from there, this habit has become abandoned.
But when I went to Kerala, I was again aware of it.
But when we give books, in a way it becomes a part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
We can also welcome the cards and how many of the poor are helpful
Expenditure deficit is also utilised properly.
These things have a greater historic importance.
When I went to the UK last year, the British queen Elizabeth had called me a banquet in the town of London.
He said in a sympathetic voice that when he gave a light in his eyes, when I was married, Gandhiji congratulated me and presented this handkerchief.
For many years, but Elizabeth Rani kept the handkerchief conferred by Gandhians.
One of Gandhijis immense love has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
These habits don't change night with night, and this is the reason why criticisms are overwhelmed.
At the same time, efforts should be made in such conversations.
For this reason, whenever I go anywhere, I don't deny that if someone brings it, I can't do it.
We have to repeat criticisms, gradually a change.
My dear countrymen, there are several aspects as the Prime Minister of the country.
I am making a habit of being drowned in the pockets, that is, I am making an opportunity to connect me with the common people by reading something in my letters.
Various letters are coming and many others write letters to me.
I feel that it is necessary to share a letter I read a few days ago with you.
Therefore, I have started the work of getting money from the bank and buying some goods from the market under the Mudra scheme.
Meanwhile, I focused on the Government of India E-Marketplace, Govt. e-Marketplace, Govt.
Whoever wants to give something to the government - whoever wants to sell anything like electricity bulbs, puppet slums, slums, chairs, tables, they can register themselves on this platform.
What quality of goods he has, however, can he sell for the price and it is mandatory that the government departments should go to this platform and buy goods at affordable prices.
In this way, all the departments of the government are taking care of who are registering in e-GEM.
Due to lack of intermediaries, goods are available at affordable prices.
This is the opportunity to encourage entrepreneurship.
It also has illumination, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
I want all those who want to sell their goods to the government and all of them to register themselves on this portal.
My dear countrymen, while we are proud of Yoga, our achievements in space science are also inspiring.
While our footsteps are on the earth connected with Yoga, we are fulfiling the dream of touching the planet that is far away.
In the past, India has achieved a huge achievement in sports and science.
Today, India is not only on the earth but also on the planet.
Two days ago, ISRO has successfully launched 30 Nano satellites with CartoSat-2 satellites.
Apart from India, there are about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the US.
This Nano Satellite Mission of India will help in achieving information related to agriculture and natural calamities.
Crossing 1000 days is an important milestone in our space journey.
Now, we can see that our youngsters are progressing in the field of sports.
Besides education, they are feeling their future in the field of sports.
The country is proud of our sportspersons, their efforts and their achievements.
Recently, Kitambi Srikanth ji has won the Indonesia Open sportsperson of India and made the nation proud.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him and his teachers for this achievement.
T.
Sports play a big role in the development of overall governance.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If children are engaged in the field of sports in our family, we should give them the opportunity.
They should not be excluded from the plains, put them in the room and asked to study.
Let him study and do it, and progress in it, but if he is more talented and interested in sports, then all of them should encourage him to be in school, college, family and hospital.
Everyone has to dream of participating in the next Olympic Games.
Once again my dear countrymen, during the rainy season and continuous festivals, it has been a time to create new experiences in a way.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you and join you in the next Mann Ki Baat.
This year the heat of summer is an unforgettable experience.
At the same time, we are expecting rains.
When I am talking to you today, Ramlan has started the holy month.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the people of Islamic community on this occasion of Ramlan's auspicious month.
In the month of Ramlan, there is considerable significance for prayers, spirituality and devotion.
It is a matter of pride that 125 crore people of our country are in India that all the religions of the world are in India.
We must assume that our ancestors have established this great tradition.
There are those who believe in God, there are those who deny God in this land, there are idol worshipers and those who oppose the idol worship.
The art of different ideas, different worshipping methods and different traditions have joined us.
Whether it is time, methods, philosophy, traditions, all these things are the only message that they give us - peace, unity, harmony.
We will be helpful to move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony in this holy month of Ramlan.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all.
I am happy that many people have registered their backgrounds.
Everyone wants to share with me individually with enthusiasm about their experiences.
"I speak to Deepsha Gadkari.
I decided to study on holidays when I was almost released from me.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I realised that how many sacrifices and struggles were to be carried out in India, how many struggles were carried out by the martyrs.
I urge you to inspire the life of Bhagat Singh, who has made a big achievement at the youngest age, so I would like to inform you about this thing to the generations of today.
I am glad that the young community is keen to know about our history and our freedom fighters about the sacrifices of body, material and spiritual sacrifices for this country.
Innumerable men have lost their youth in jail.
Several youngsters have kissed their drives in front of them.
We are able to breathe the respiratory wind of free India today because they have experienced all their sorrows.
The people who had spent all the time in the freedom struggle, all of them wrote books, reads, all the big works and their writings have made a lot of contribution to India's freedom.
Several years ago, I had visited the Cellular Jail in Andaman Nicobar.
Today is the birthday of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote the book Maji Janmade in jail.
He wrote poems on the walls of the prison.
He was locked in a small room.
Do you know what kind of oppressions the liberators have suffered
Savarkar ji wrote Maji Janmade - when I had to read the book, I had to see the Cellular Jail.
There they are organising a sound shrine, which is very inspiring.
Those who sacrificed their youth at the Andaman Nicobar Jail, called Kalabani, were from all the states and all the language speakers of India and met with many sorrows.
My dear countrymen, on 5th June, the first Monday of the month.
Well, what if you connect with nature
For me, it is to join us and join us.
Creating a better land of connectivity with nature.
Who can express this better than Gandhians.
Gandhijis once again said, "One Must Care is a world one will not see, it is our duty to look at the world we cannot see that it is our duty to showcase the world we cannot see.
You might have experienced that Nature has my power.
Perhaps you might have been very tired, when you drive the water in your face, then you can see how fresh you have achieved
When our body is created by the fifteenth of the fifteenth of the fifteenth of the fifteenth of the fifteenth of the fifteenth of the fifteenth of the fifteenth of the fifteenth of the country.
Therefore, on June 5, the world-class drive to connect with nature should be a movement that connects us.
Vedas have been shown on the basis of energy on the earth and the environment.
The entire guidance of the environment is given to us in a way, this is a thousand years old book.
: Mata Bhoomi: Bhutro Aham Pradivya: This is the case in our country.
It is said in the Vedas that the cleanliness of ours is due to the earth.
There is a natural lifestyle of natural worship and love for nature, be it festivals in our country, be it festivals, various worshipping methods of worship - naked people, urban residents, tribals and tribal communities.
However, it is necessary to understand this in contemporary terms and with modern ideas.
I still have a lot of news from the states.
As soon as the rain comes in almost all the states, a massive movement of plantation starts.
Millions of trees are being planted.
We also have to contribute to tree plantation in this rainy season this time.
My dear countrymen, the 21st of June is a day of identification all over the world.
The world is celebrating this as World Yoga Day.
In the shortest time of June 21, the world is spread all over the corner of the world as World Yoga Day.
On the one hand, while the separatist powers are showing their worst faces in the world, the world's largest leafying yogic.
Through Yoga, we can connect the world to the roots.
Just as Yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, it can connect the world with Yoga.
Today, because of lifestyle, because of emergency, because of increasing responsibilities, because of pressure, life has become increasing.
We also see that this situation has occurred in the childhood.
During the period of taking unsuccessful medicines and passing days, Yoga will help us live a life of stress.
Yoga is a compassionate guarantee for both welfare and sex.
Yoga is not just a exercise.
It is possible only through yoga if we say that we should experience such an inclusive journey with body, mind, thoughts and habits.
Two days ago, on the occasion of Yoga, letters were written to all the governments and all the leaders of the world.
Last year I had announced some competitions related to yoga and some awards.
Gradually, work is progressing in this direction.
I convey my best wishes to you all for this basic advice.
This is a very interesting thing.
Tomorrow, the third International Yoga Day has asked me to join with the three generations of the family.
Thirty generations like Data Bati, Mother Father and son, can join Yoga and showcase such photographs.
Yesterday, this will be a pleasant combination of tomorrow and a new dimension for Yoga.
Tomorrow, this will be tomorrow's film, which will guarantee a bright future.
I invite all of you.
As the International Yoga Day remains for 3 weeks, start the training from today.
Share things related to Yoga for your share, spread and join the people.
In a way, this is a health care mission to protect the future.
I invite you all to join this.
From that day, I have been touring different parts of India.
I am sure that some people look at what Modi did and what he did.
A funny phone call came to me, and I didn't think of the things mentioned in it.
But thanks to me for creating such a different approach.
I hope that this phone call will happen to you too.
"Modi ji, I speak from Mumbai to Naina.
I often see Modiji wherever you are going, all the people there are focussed on cleanliness in television and social networks.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat or Surat, people are living in the form of a cleanliness movement by listening to your invitation.
If the elderly are on the one hand, there is a awareness of cleanliness among the children.
Many times I have seen that their elders have been deceived to waste the streets.
After starting the Swachhta movement in the gates of Kashi, it has become a very popular motivation from you.
You are right to say, wherever I go, wherever I go, the government machine is doing cleanliness, but now it is being celebrated as a cleanliness programme throughout the society.
Adequate cleaning work is being done 5 days, 7 days and 10 days before I go.
The media also gives a lot of importance and a few days ago I went to the Kutch region of Gujarat.
There was a massive Swachh Bharat Mission.
I didn't see it connected, but only after this phone call came to me, yes, I thought that this thing was right.
It is a pleasure to welcome the Prime Minister that all other producing installations are going on, but it is important to give importance to cleanliness.
It is enjoyable for anyone who wants cleanliness and is commemorative.
I convey my warm greetings to all those who strengthen the cleanliness.
One has given me a suggestion.
It's a joyful suggestion.
The idea is very good, but I must think about it.
It is very important that I will remove so many tons of cupboards, than to give things a prize.
The Government of India has decided to organise a very important movement related to waste management with the help of city representatives with the help of State Governments.
On the 5th of June, on the World Environment Day, there are approximately 4,000 cities in the country that are required to accumulate degradation and liquid degradation.
Two types of puppets are being provided, one green, second blue.
Two types of waste materials are emerged - one liquid waste, other dry waste.
We have to follow the regulations, in 4000 cities, these pipelines are being set up, put the liquid waste in the blue basket, put the liquid waste in the green basket.
In the case of kitchen waste, vegetables are unnecessary, mild food, eggs and leaves of trees etc., all the waste wastes should be put in the green bottle.
If we remember the colorful greenery of the fields, what should be put in green utensils
The second type of puppet is that it includes paper puppets, card boxes, iron commodities, glass pieces, clothes, plastics, polythene, broken puppets, rubber commodities, metals, etc.
A few days ago, a thing came in the ear, and Versova Beach, which is considered to be a filthy beach in Mumbai, has become a clean and beautiful beach today.
For this work, Afroz Shah gave him a great award to the United Nations Environment Programme - UNEP.
He is the first Indian to receive the Champions of the Arth Award.
My dear countrymen, for the past 15 days, there have been discussions and analysis of the present government in newspapers, TV channels and social media.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of the main servant.
A number of polls have been conducted and there have been a large number of polls.
I see all these as very healthy symptoms.
During the last three years, he was addressing every address.
People at all levels of society have also studied this.
This is a special activity in a democratic manner.
It is my obligation that the governments are responsible for replacing in the democracy should submit their accounts for the work done to the people of Magazars.
I express my gratitude to all those who have supported and expressed their grievances and expressed their gratitude with great significance.
I express my gratitude to those who have made significant responsibilities.
Whatever crimes are there, when they are revealed, there is a chance to improve.
Be it good, be it less good, be it bad, be it bad, whatever it is, it is possible to learn from them, through which progress can be made.
The positive criticism strengthens the democratic system.
This analysis and research is very important for a conscious country.
My dear countrymen, I am an ordinary citizen like you, as a common citizen, everybody hurts me as a simple citizen.
Some people see the voice of Mann Ki Baat as a participant, some people criticize it in a political perspective, but after a long experience, I feel that when I have not even seen it as a member of every family of India that the program of Mann Ki Baat will change me.
I feel like sitting in the midst of a family and talking about household things.
I have been responsible for the President, the Vice President and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and all those in such higher positions have given importance to the voice of Mann Ki Baat by extracting their golden time.
In a way, the voice of Mann Ki Baat has made me a new dimension.
Some of our friends had talked to me sometimes when they were engaged in the work on Mann Ki Baat book.
I've been loaned to Akbar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, when we meet next time, the weather will change, the results of the tests will come, the learning will start again and when the rain comes, the new joyous environment, the new reading and the new smell.
Come together, let us go ahead with nature in this environment.
My best wishes to you all.
Every time such efficient instruments are coming in the voice of mind, which are being explored by the government.
What kind of complaints are there and what is the experience of the people
We can usually see that it is the nature of humans to provide advice to others.
When we travel on trains, buses, if anybody coughs then it is natural for us to suggest that someone should do this.
Initially, when consultations came to the voice of Mann Ki Baat, the words of suggestions were found, many of them were told that it could be a habit, but when we tried to see it, I was really happy in the flood.
After I pointed out that in the Narendra Modi App, the MyGov portal has taken innovative methods to prevent everything from the corner of the country from the corner of the country.
I did not even think that the younger generation of our country has been engaged in this work for a long time.
We know that some social organisations have been doing it for many years, but the youth of my country are engaged in it - it was only after me.
Many have sent me video.
Bread banking is being conducted in many places.
People are giving bread from their sides, bringing vegetables, whoever is required, they come and get them.
Nobody is happy to buy them, nobody is required to think them down.
This is an example of how collaboration in society is being done.
Today is the last day of April.
The Foundation Day of Gujarat and Maharashtra is coming in the month of May.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have been continuously trying to achieve new development summits and have contributed to the progress of the nation.
In both the states, Mahapuras have been born and their lives have been inspired by us in every field of society.
Remembering these great men, on the occasion of the Raising Day of the States, on the occasion of the Independence Day of 2022, we should take the pledge of raising our states, our nation, our society, our city and our family.
We have to move forward with the cooperation of all citizens to fulfil this commitment.
I once again convey my best wishes to the people of both the states.
At one time, the change in the environment was a matter of fact that academics had been spoken at the level of seminars, but today, in our daily lives, we have experienced it, we have been addicted to temptation.
Nature has changed the rules of its labour.
We have experienced the heat that we see in the month of May-June this time in the months of March-April.
While I was taking into consideration the advice of the people for the voice of Mann Ki Baat, there was a lot of suggestions about what we should do in the summer.
It is very beneficial for all things to be known and not new, but at the right time it is very beneficial to see them again.
Prasanth Kumar Mishra, T.
They have said that water should be kept on the top of the balcony.
I have seen that even small children in the family have done this thing well.
If they get rid of why water is to be filled then they will leave them to see if they have ten times in a day and if there is water in the utensil.
Not only this, the birds will come and drink water.
It may appear like a sport, but in fact, it is a wonderful experience of compassion in those pinch minds.
In our country, a composite life with birds and animals and nature is naturally mixed with our nervous systems, but at the same time it is important to strengthen the efforts made at the social level.
While I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Dharmaguru Syedna Saheb of Daudi Bohra community was 100 years old.
He lived for 103 years.
To celebrate his 100 years, the Bohra community organized a massive movement to protect the gurus through the Purhani Trust.
Kinnes has also got a place in the world records book.
Sometimes, if we are very busy, we forget to hear if you are a dairy, a vegetable seller, a postalist, if you come to our household door then you are drinking a mouth of water to drink this summer.
My young friends, I want to share some things with you.
Sometimes I am worried that many of our younger generations want to live in a comfortable place and in a small circle.
Maternal fathers are protecting them in a very safe manner.
There is also one such kind, but most of the people are in the fragmental circle.
Now the exams have been completed and you will have made plans to spend holidays.
The summer holiday will be sweet only after the heat is over.
I give you three suggestions to utilize the holidays well, the third of them is special, but I am trying to do something in it.
Get a new experience, try to achieve a new capabilities, let's decide that no one should go to a place where he is unable to see, not ignorant and unknowing.
New places, new experiences and new skills will be available.
The test should be positive, come out of your skull circle.
We are from the middle class families, the comfortable family.
In the evening, take your footballs, candles, or take other sports goods and go to the accommodation of the poor in the neighborhood.
Look at playing with the poor children there, you will feel that when you have not been able to enjoy the joy of playing in your lives.
Have you seen how big changes will be made in their lives when you get the enjoyment of playing with the poor and the children in the society
If you go once, you would like to go back there again.
This experience will teach you many things.
Several autonomous organisations are engaged in service.
Search yourself together with the Kukul Guru and join yourself for 15 days and 20 days with some organisation.
Sometimes there will be a variety of constructive camps that will be organized in the summer camps, which will be organized in the Governance Development Campaign.
When you are elected in such camps, learn to the poor who have not been able to learn this as a service free of cost.
You can teach them how to do.
Though technology is considered to be far-reaching and destruction of borders, the evil consequences caused by them are starving my mind.
In the same house, 6 people are sitting in one room but they can't even imagine the distance between them.
Why
Everyone has become irritable due to technology.
Social nature is a good value, social nature is a power.
Another thing I said is about the skills and don't you want to learn something new
Sometimes it is feared that our younger generation is becoming a robot.
Our younger generation, friends, the dreams that we see in life are good things.
But it should be kept in mind that we cannot intervene the human elements within us and we cannot leave our humanity.
Can we not pay any attention to skill development
A little away from technology, we try to spend time with us.
If you don't know, you can learn swimming, learn paintings, don't come to the best, but it's a mathematical art in the paper.
The feelings inside you will start reflecting it.
You will feel that all these capabilities and these activities will be pleased to you, it will not only remove the tissues that have tied you on one side.
Do something different, friends
This is your opportunity to build your lives.
After all the exams have been completed, you said that if you think that I will learn all this after coming to a new position in your industry then you don't have that opportunity.
That is why I would like to tell you that there is a country to learn Magic and you should learn the booking table.
Please show this to your friends.
If you don't know anything, try to learn it, it will definitely benefit you.
Awaken the creative powers within you, which will create a beautiful platform for development.
Friends, I share my experience with you, we cannot even imagine what things we have to learn and understand in the world.
There are many new places, new cities, new villages and new circles.
Don't think too much to travel.
Go to one and spend 3-4 days there, then go to the next place and spend 3-4 days there .
This will give you a lot of things to learn.
Friends, This time the Government of India has given you a very good opportunity.
The new generations have liberated about cash transactions.
You are engaged in this scheme but you can also earn this scheme and do you know about a scheme of the Government of India
But it can be recommended by someone else.
You can connect others with this, if that new person makes 3 transactions through this, then you will get a income of Rs 10 for this.
10 rupees will be added to the government in your accounts.
If you say that you have gathered 20 people in it a day, then in the evening you will have 200 rupees in return.
Businessmen can also earn this, and students will get income through this.
The project will be upto 14th October.
You can contribute to making Digital India.
You are the protectors of New India.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Honourable Prime Minister, I speak from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh to Shiva Chaube.
I would like to talk about the red light.
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic crisis, I don't have to wait for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for your decision.
The government's decision to eradicate red light is an organizational action.
But the roots of this culture, which is foolish in the mind, should be rooted.
If all of us work together with awareness then it can be removed.
My aim was clear when it was said - Everi Burson Is Important, everybody is important.
If we accept the importance of 125 crore people, if we realize the importance of 125 crore people, then there will be a great power to realize the huge dreams.
We all have to do this together.
This year, we are celebrating the 1000th year of Mahan Ramnujar, the 125 crore people of the country.
Because of some reason, we got stuck in the moments, we were very small, we were more eager to think about the centuries.
Century in other countries of the world is also considered to be very important.
Just imagine.
Even today, it is so difficult to break social conditions.
How could this be a thousand years ago
It would have been known to some people that Ramanujar had created a big struggle against the situation of caste, the feeling of the society's bitterness, the higher and the poorer.
The society considered who was not punished, supposed to be punished and made it through its operation.
Thousands of years ago, he campaigned for his entry into the temple and successfully entered the temple.
The Government of India will release a postal stamp on 1st May to commemorate the memory of Pilgrimage Ramanujacharya.
I respectfully bow down to the sacred Ramanujacharya and showcase my devotional flowers.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow there is another significance on 1st May.
In many parts of the world, it is a day of labourers.
Speaking on the day of labourers, there is talk of labour and workers, naturally I am remembered by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today, we have been grateful to Baba Saheb for the concessions and respect for the workers.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of labourers is unforgettable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb, when we talk about the pious Ramanujacharya, we have got the opportunity to remember the great pious and social reformer of Karnataka in the 12th century.
There was a chance to release a bundle of his golden languages.
In the 12th century, he expressed deep views on labour and labourers in Kannada language.
In the Kannada language, he said that 'Gaya Kave Kailas' means that only you can achieve the handicraft of Lord Shiva through hard work, that is, heaven will be achieved only by understanding the work.
While talking about the workers, it is natural to think about Tatoband Tengti.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we are celebrating Buddha Purnima.
The people associated with Lord Buddha all over the world are happy to celebrate this festival.
The views of Lord Buddha are very suitable when the world is witnessing the violence, war, destruction and conflict of arms.
In India, Ashoka's life war is an excellent example of Buddha's adoption.
This magnificent day of Buddha Purnima is celebrated by the United Nations Visaka Divas.
This festival is going to be held in Sri Lanka this year.
On this auspicious day, I have received a tribute to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka to dedicate my blessings.
We speak especially for our neighbouring countries.
We think that our neighbours should be composed off with our neighbouring countries and they should also move forward.
There are many prospects.
India is scheduled to launch South Asia Satellite on May 5.
The capabilities of this satellite and its convenience will facilitate substantial assistance to the economic and development activities in South Asia.
This is an excellent example of our drive towards South Asia.
In every corner of the country, many families are associated with the preparation for their children's choice.
Today is 26th March.
It is our pride that Rabindranath Tagore and all his memories are the wealth of all of us.
In 1919, the Jallianwalabagh assassination was built, at that time, Ravindranath Tagore was one of the greatest people who gave a voice against the murder.
The murder had a deep impact on a childhood mind full of twelve years of age.
Three days before this day, the British took away Bhagat Singh and his colleagues Sukdev and Rajguru on March 23.
During the sad incident on March 23, there was no fear of death in the faces of sacrifices such as Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
They gave all the dreams of life to the freedom of Mother India.
Even today, these three are sympathetic to all of us.
We cannot devote the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
The entire British empire looked at this kiss.
They were imprisoned and punished, but the British were worried about how to conduct them.
Several years ago, when I had the opportunity to go there for the first time, I could feel a kind of jealousy in that soil.
I urge the youth of the country to visit Punjab whenever you get the opportunity, visit the place where the monuments of the mother of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh and Badkeshwar Dad are located.
It was a time when free choice and its intensity were widespread.
On one hand, soldiers like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were inspiring the youth to make the armed revolution.
Nearly 100 years ago, in April, 1917, Gandhiji had launched Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
The first edition of Gandhian thoughts and the methods of Gandhians in the freedom struggle of India was emerged in Champaran.
This was a turning point in the freedom struggle journey, especially from the perspective of the methods of struggle.
This is the time when there was a profound impact on the thoughts and methods of the Gandhians on all these things like Champaran Satyagraha, Geda Satyagraha and Million workers' strike in Ahmedabad.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new inspiration to the nation.
Today, we cannot assess Champaran Satyagraha by taking care of Gandhiji in our minds.
Just imagine that one who returned to India in 1915 was only two years of experience.
He illuminated a wonderful power through the integration of Gandhijis through Champaran Satyagraha, the power to know the system of the Indian society, the power to inspire the people of the most poor and uneducated people against the British, and to bring them to the battlefield.
We can learn from him what kind of work should be done and how Gandhiji worked.
The great leaders of that period, Rajendra Babu and Acharya Grupalani, were all working to go to the village of Gandhians.
He learned how to connect with the freedom struggle with the people and work done by them.
Today, we are traveling in the 21st century, whoever does not want to change in India, whoever does not want to participate in the transformation of the country
Their efforts to transform this choice of 125 crore people will be a strong foundation for themselves to create a New India.
New India is not a scheme of the government.
New India is the comfort of 125 crore people.
This is the spirit of building a New India with 125 crore nations.
This is a desire, a desire, a feeling, a thirst and a thirst in the hearts of 125 crore people.
They are engaged in such work as those who are compassionately and compassionate.
Many people go to the hospital every day and help patients.
As soon as the news is required, there are many people who donate blood.
There are many people who are aware of the best things they have to eat.
Our country is such a land of valuable values.
People's service is the Magason Service. This is everything in our nervous system.
If we see this entirely, if we look in a comprehensive way, then it is very well known how great power it is.
When we talk about New India, criticism of this idea is a natural thing that can be accepted in a democratic manner.
But if 125 crore people have been resolved, if they decide their path then if they start taking their steps together then the dream of 125 crore people of New India will start emerging when we are watching it.
There is no need to spend all things in the budget or be a government plan or be spent from the government money.
That is, I would like to say that every citizen of the country should do his duties as a citizen and understand the responsibilities.
Why should we not make this journey a good testimony to our autonomy
Let me invite you to participate in this journey.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you today.
Over the last few months, a large number of people have participated in the Digital Money Transfer movement in our country.
After the withdrawal of the currency, there are several improvements in the digital payment system.
We have started the BHIM App for 2-3 months, so far, about one and a half crore people have given it.
My dear countrymen, we must move forward in the war against black money and corruption.
Are 125 crore Indians able to fulfil their commitment to digital transactions this year
In order to implement this, we can provide the school town digitally, we can get the ticket fee for a journey on a train or aeroplane digitally, you can buy medicines in a digital manner, if you buy cheap food items, then you can take the way for digital payment.
In the past, several programmes for Digital Festivals were organised for public awareness.
It was decided to do 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 events have been completed.
70,000 traders won awards for them.
Everyone has a pledge to take this task forward.
There is also a big pool.
I am confident that we will create awareness about the BHIM App, as far as possible, how long Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary remains.
We must contribute to reducing the use of cash.
Friends, I have been giving me various suggestions every time I would like to invite you to give advice to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
But in your suggestions, I can see that you are always putting a lot of pressure on cleanliness.
This river is crossing Risbana Bridge and it flows near my house.
We have tried to create awareness among the people who have travelled to the region against the contamination of the river, but there is no benefit from this.
I urge you to send a team from your side or to create awareness about this matter through newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, See how much pain is there in a student studying in class 11th.
I see this as a good symptom.
Awakening has also been made since the launch of Swachhta Mission.
Everyone has been actively associated with it.
This has grown as a mass movement.
The hatred against dirt is increasing.
Be it aware, positive partnership, movement, it is certainly important for them.
Though the work is difficult, it is necessary to do it.
I am very proud that this feeling that is being created between the new generation of the country, the children, the students and the youth is reflecting a good symptom.
Today, in the voice of my mind, whoever has been asking for the idea of Gayatri, I want to say to all of them - the message given by Gayatri should be given to all of us.
Brothers and sisters, since the beginning of the Mann Ki Baat program, there are many suggestions about wasting meals.
We all know that when we are eating in our homes and public events, we are feeding more than required food in our layers.
Have we ever considered how much damage we cause by the rest of us that are left
If we don't rest, do you think it will help how many poor people to feed
But the morale shown in this matter is a great tragic act against the society.
This is an injustice to the poor.
On the other hand, if the food is not wasted, it will be saved and the family will get economic benefits.
This is a good thing even when socially thinks, whenever it sees familyly, it is a beneficial thing.
I want to be more aware of this matter.
I know some youngsters who have set up a mobile app and are conducting the movement
If there is any food, they will be informed that they will collect the remaining food and share it to the needy.
Our youth are doing the work done for this method of better utilization of food.
You can meet such people somewhere in every state of India.
You can see the ways to change.
They will always say that those who are aware of the health of the body, take less leaves and fill a little less in the stomach.
World Health Day on April 7.
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) has set a target of health care for all by 2030.
A study says that more than 35 crore people around the world are suffering from mental stress.
Talk to friends, to parents, to brothers and sisters, to the teachers and to the teachers as you are inside.
Have you seen everything thinking why they're walking like that
Definitely understand that they are at the first stage of stress.
Psychological stress, mental and physical diseases.
Just as diabetes facilitates all kinds of diseases, like that, stress facilitates all our capabilities, fighting against acute environment, self-sufficiency and determination.
If you are not able to speak openly to your dependents, people should work with service at some place near you.
You will be able to see yourself mixing your sorrows with yourself.
If you try to understand the sorrow of others, you will feel the service, then you will have a self-confidence among you.
You can easily die the burden of your mind by providing selfless service to others by communicating with others.
Similarly, Yoga is a good way to keep your mind healthy.
You start making your efforts from now on.
Make sure millions of people participate in the Yoga Yojana socially.
If there is any suggestion in your mind about the 3rd International Yoga Day, you must send your suggestions to me through the Mobile App.
You can create songs and compositions related to yoga, so that people can understand.
Today I want to talk to the mothers and sisters about one thing and today we have talked about many things about health.
In the past, the government has taken a big decision.
It is a welcome thing that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day and their contribution is increasing.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of April, on the 9th of April, on the 9th of April, on the 14th of April, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
May the life of these great men inspire us forever and ever, let us inspire to cook a New India.
After the spring, the crops started to grow up and the benefits of the farmers' labour will be achieved.
In many corners of our country, this New Year is being celebrated in many ways.
My best wishes to all of you.
Cold weather is now missing.
The spring is registering its arrival in the lives of all of us.
After the autumn, new blooms have started swimming in the trees, flowers are grown, all the forests and gardens are grown greenery.
Not only flowers, but also tears are brightened on his kitchen.
Mangani's pinches in the summer are beginning to appear in the spring season.
The turmeric flowers of mustard curd in the fields provide hope to the farmers.
Flowers of flowers and holiflowers are enjoyed to visit the festival.
Amir Kusru has described these moments of climate change.
The crops of mustard bloom everywhere, the trees bloom, the flowering of the flower, the cattle blossom, the cattle blossom, the environment will be comfortable when it blossoms in the natural dust, the humans also enjoy the sweetness of this environment.
Vasanta Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holip festivals grow joyful flowers in the life of man.
We are going to finish the month of Bhagni in our environment of love, brotherhood and humanity, and we are ready to welcome the new month of New Year.
Spring time connects these two months.
Whenever I hear your suggestions before the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I first express my gratitude to millions of people of the country for sending me a lot of suggestions.
Thanks to all of you, who have contributed in all forms of letters in Twitter, Passbook, in the Narendra Modi App.
Shoba Jalan ji mentioned in the Narendra Modi App that many people did not know about the achievements of the ISRO.
He further urged you to inform about 104 satellites and intermediate satellites.
Shobaji is grateful to you for recalling the pride of India.
Our scientists have cherished India in the world stage.
We all know that ISRO has succeeded in realizing many wonderful achievements over the past few years.
ISRO has now made a new world record in the space sector a few days ago, after the success of sending Mangalyaan to Mangalya on a visit to Marsland.
At the same time, 104 satellites have been successfully launched in many countries.
This is not only for ISRO but also a great historic achievement for the entire India.
ISRO's low-cost space programme is a surprising worldwide, and has appreciated the success of Indian scientists all over the world.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is of great significance - Cartosat 2D - this will help Indias satellites, so that we can identify mineral resources, infrastructure, developmental assessments and urban development plans.
Our new satellite Cartosat 2D will be an audience for my farmer brothers and sisters to know about all the things related to how to use them and how to take care of them.
As soon as we reached, our satellite has sent some films.
It started to do his work.
It is a matter of great happiness that all these activities are under the leadership of our young social scientists and our women scientists.
It is a matter of great pride for ISRO's success that the contribution of young scientists and women scientists is such a great contribution.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the scientists of ISRO on your behalf of the nation.
You have been making several new achievements every day to keep your aim of pursuing space science in mind for the people and for the people.
Whatever appreciation is given to our scientists and their entire team, it is a reduction.
India has successfully tested a marching missile in the defence sector.
This is the biggest achievement in the defence sector.
You will be happy to note that this technological capabilities in the world are only four countries with the world.
Indian scientists have achieved this.
Its strength is that even though a missile has been hitting India from afar, it is capable of destroying it in our missile.
We are happy to see new technologies, see some new scientific achievements.
In the universe, man's mind has been making unprecedented efforts to know the rules of the invasion.
New science and new technologies are born from this.
Every technology has created a new era in every new form of science.
When I talk about the hard work of science and scientists, I have been expressing my heartfelt voice that our younger generation should attract science.
Many scientists need the country.
Today scientists are the factors of a stable change in the lives of generations that will emerge in the era.
None of the scientific scientific emerges from heaven.
All the scientific achievements are educated by experience.
Honble Bapu ji has said that we must praise the thirst, adventure and sacrifice of our new scientists who have worked for the truth.
The need of the public is to make the principles in accordance with the practice and tools of this kind of technology, and that is why it can be an important contribution to the common man.
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Department of Textiles of India had organized a very special competition on the 14th NRI day.
In Mumbai, in 2005, there was a huge storm of rains, floods and seas were showered with anger and there were many obstacles.
Whatever natural habitat happens, it is the first to lay down the doors of the poor house.
Both decided to find a solution, they saved the house during the last few years, saved the households from floods, saved them from floods and saved them from water-free diseases.
I could see a lot of innovations like this.
I would like to say that many people are making this kind of contribution in the country.
Our society is also becoming a society with the help of technology.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our life.
Digitization has been given a lot of importance in the past.
Gradually, people are turning from cash transactions and moving towards digital payments.
Digital inflation is increasing rapidly in India.
In particular, the young people are making digital payments in their mobile phones.
I see this as a good symptom.
Our country has received a lot of welcome in the last few days for Lakhi Grahak Yojana, fortunate Consumer Scheme, Digital Business Scheme and Digital Business Scheme.
About two months ago, every day 15,000 people have received a thousand rupees per day.
Through these two schemes, digital procurement in India is becoming a peoples movement and the entire nation has welcomed it.
So far, it is a matter of privilege that more than 10 lakh people have received pricing, more than 50,000 traders have received pricing, more than one and a half crore of the money has been provided to those who have participated in these schemes.
Under this scheme, more than a hundred traders have received one lakh prizes.
More than 4,000 traders have received Rs. 50,000 per month.
Various people like farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, households and students are connecting themselves with a lot of enthusiasm.
When I saw this invisible, it was not only the youth but also the elderly, who had a 15-year-old boy, who was 65-70 years old.
From Mysore, Santosh ji has expressed his happiness in the Narendra Modi App and said that he has received Rs. 1000 through the Lakhi Grahak Yojana.
But I would like to share with you the important thing he wrote.
Friends, Your name and your work are also happy to all of us.
You are a very inspiring task.
Sabir, a 22-year-old car driver from Delhi, has started using digital transactions in his industry after demonetisation and has received Rs.
Today, he has become a messenger of this scheme, even though he is driving a car.
He shares information about digital payments with all the passengers traveling in his car.
He is excitingly sharing things and inspiring others.
Pooja Namade, a young friend from the state of Maharashtra, is a student who is studying back and shares his experiences with his friends about how his family uses Rupee Card and E-Wald.
Come to lead this movement.
You take this forward, it has an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
All those who join themselves in this task are new warriors against corruption in my view.
In a way you're warriors of honesty.
On the 14th of April, the largest awards are scheduled to be held.
There are about 40-45 days left.
Can you do a job to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Just a few days ago, Baba Saheb had passed the 125th birth anniversary of Ambedkar.
To commemorate his memories, at least 125 people should learn to graduate BHIM App.
This time, Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birthday and Bhim Abhiyan will turn into a special significance
I would like to mention that we should strengthen the foundation of Baba Saheb.
You must ensure that BHIM App is being taken to the hands of 125 crore people by connecting them to the house and connecting them to the house.
Due to the impact of this movement in the last two-three months, there has been an increase in many cities and villages.
Brothers and sisters, agriculture is a man of our country's economy.
The economic strength of the villages is strengthening the economic pace of the country.
Today, I want to share a joyous message with you.
Our farmer brothers and sisters are working hard and filling the field.
This year, there has been an unprecedented cultivation due to the hard work of farmers of our country.
All indicators show that our farmer brothers and sisters have finished the old achievements.
On seeing Mahasul, we are celebrating the festival of gold and fascination today.
This year, more than 2,200 lakh tonnes of massage has been received.
This is 8 percent more than the last achievement of our farmers.
This is a surprising achievement.
I specially want to thank the farmers of the country.
There is also another reason to thank the farmers - they have produced a variety of pulses in addition to cultivation of traditional food, because pulses are rich in proteins.
The voice of the poor has fallen in the ears of the farmers of my country, they have cultivated a variety of pulses in about two hundred hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is a great service to the farmers of my country for the poor.
I express my gratitude to the farmer brothers and sisters of the country who have achieved pulses and pulses in Mahsul for my request.
Dear countrymen, in our country, through the government, through the society, through the organisations, everybody is traveling towards cleanliness through movements.
In a way, everybody is acting in some way as aware of cleanliness.
The government is engaged in uninterrupted efforts.
In the last few days, under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the programme for senior officers of 23 State Governments was held in Telangana.
The conclave was not held within the closed rooms of Varanasi in Telangana, but the importance of cleanliness at the bottom was to be implemented.
Training of toilets was started in Hyderabad on 17-18 February.
Officials made it clear that the toilets in 6 households were waste, they were cleaned, how to bring them back to use by removing the drains of two drained toilets.
They showed how comfortable toilets using this new strategy, there was no problem, no psychological obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles.
Just as we are cleaning usually, we can also clean toilets.
An average of one dual toilet for a family of 6 members will be filled in about five years.
After this, the wastes can be easierly removed and turned to the second trap.
How many things are shown in it, so much will be beneficial.
Even in the government, various sectors are often organising sanitation related meetings for two weeks.
In the first meeting to be held in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will join hands in strengthening the Swachhta Mission.
In the second meeting of March, the Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Renewable Energy for River Ganga is going to take forward the Cleanliness Mission for the last two weeks of March.
If any citizen works well in our country, the entire nation feels a new energy, self-confidence.
We have welcomed the audience of our efficient sportspersons in Rio Paralimbics.
In the final lap of the T-20 World Cup that was organised this month, India defeated Pakistan for the second time and made the world proud of the country.
I once again congratulate all the soldiers who have been present.
We are proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends in the country.
I have always been convinced that our disabled brothers and sisters are very talented, compassionate, accomplished and mindful.
Every moment we have to learn from them.
Whether it is a matter of sports or space science, it is not the women of our country who have died.
They are moving forward simply, they are illuminating the well-being of the country through their achievements.
In the past few days, our women have won silver medals in the Asian Rakpi Sevens singing.
I extend my appreciation to all these swimming people.
World Women's Day is being celebrated on 8th March.
In India, understanding should be enhanced and enhance awareness in the family and society.
Today, it is not just a government scheme.
It is a social understanding and a movement of education for all.
In the last year, this scheme has linked the people's society and has kept thinking about this important thing in every corner of the country and has changed the mindset of the people about the old habits of decades.
There is a lot of joy in the mind when the festivals are going on after listening to the news that the child is born.
In a way, the positive thinking of women children is due to social organisation.
I heard that due to a special movement in Tamil Nadu district, Balaya Vivaham has been stopped.
So far, more than 175 milk marriages have been stopped.
The district administration has started bank accounts in the name of more than 55-60 thousand women children under the Self Help Saves (Suganya Samruti) scheme.
According to the Convergence Model in the Rewa district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the sectors are connected to the scheme of Preservation of Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Gram Sabhas are being organized and all efforts are being made by the district administration to adopt and ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being undertaken for the education of every girl child in the village, as per the scheme to cover every household door.
In the state of Rajasthan, a campaign is being carried out by our child, our school, our school and the campaign to re-induct and re-induct the women who are stopping school education.
I am saying that the movement of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has been working in different forms.
This entire movement has become a mass movement.
It is connected with innovation imaginations.
This is being changed as per regional requirements.
I think this is a good symptom.
On the 8th of March, when we are celebrating women's day, we must be united with the spirit of strength, our Indian women, they are not more in power, they are not less, they are all the people of Sarinikar Same, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, sometimes you all get the opportunity to talk about something.
You are actively associated with this.
I have got a lot of things to learn from you.
All the feelings of world well-being, the condition of the villages and the minds of the poor are coming to me.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
In any situation, our ancestors have made the system of cycle, economic cyclone and social life excellent.
In the last few days, we have celebrated several festivals.
Even after thousands of years, every festival is filling itself with a new spirit and a new spirit.
Sometimes he lifted the mountain, sometimes he worked to remove the leaves of food, that is, we can feel a new innovation in every activity of him.
So today when I talk to you, my child goes to the milk of two Mohans.
Mohan, who has crossed the Sudarshan Chakra, and others are supposed to bear Sarka.
Mohan, who crossed the Sudarshan Chakra, crossed the Yamuna river, went to the seashores of Gujarat, settled in the city of Dwarka, but Mohano, born on the banks of the sea, came to Yamuni and breathed his last breath in Delhi.
Mohan, who crossed the Sudarsan Chakra, used his intellectuality, his duties, his ability and his thoughts to avoid war and to live without conflict even thousands of years ago, according to the circumstances of that period.
At the same time, Sarkka-driven Mohano gave a new shape to the freedom struggle, to secure the country's freedom, to protect human values, to empower the basic principles of governance and to make a new turn to the entire world, it is still unique.
What is the significance of selfless service, what is the significance of wisdom, what is the significance of proceeding with smoke among all the higher deaths of life, we can learn from the life of Lord Sri Krishna.
Today, while we are talking about festivals, India is engaged in a big festival.
Not only India but the whole world is talking about it.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of my brother Gandhiji.
On October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, along the coast of the ocean, today we were born in a small house called Kirti Mandir, not an individual but an era.
This has given a new turn to the entire human history and achieved a new achievement.
One thing was always associated with Annal Gandhiji, in a way it was a permanent part of his life, that is the responsibility of service, service and service.
If we have seen his entire life, he has been involved in the service of the people of the society suffering from different parts of South Africa.
He served the oppressed farmers in Champaran area.
If anybody needs any help, she will be helpful to serve anytime.
He not only strengthened the service but also strengthened the spiritual happiness associated with service.
But along with this, the experience of self-sufficient joy and self-sufficient feeling of self-sufficient joy is also bound in service.
We can clearly understand this through the life of brothers.
For Gandhians, personality, society and humanity are all.
Whether it is Africa's physics farm, whether it is a dolstyle field, or a Sabarmati Ashram, or a Vardha, he has always been strengthening the social unity in a different way in all the places.
I believe that I have got the ability to pay my tributes to many important places related to Annalo.
When it comes to society, it has a strong strength and it has to be a social expression and service in this occasion of Gandhi 150.
It should be a good wish, a good goal, a harmonious, a complete dedicated service, a Swandh: joy: a regular joy experience.
My dear countrymen, I had visited Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
Dandi, the name of salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, was a big turning point.
In Dandi, I have inaugurated a modern museum dedicated to the harvest.
I urge all of you to travel to some place related to your brothers and sisters.
Several events, competitions and exhibitions have been planned during the coming period.
But on this occasion, I would like to share a very interesting thing with you.
This time, in the Venice Biennale India Museum, several interesting sightseeing items of Gandhijis memories have been seen.
The area of Haripura is specially interesting.
You will be aware of the fact that the incident in the history of Subhas Chandra Bose ji was chosen as the leader of Gujarat's Haripura Congress.
In these arts, a very beautiful past has been covered.
Prior to the Congress's Haripura conference in 1937-38, the then Chief Minister Nandlal Bose was invited to Shantiniketan's Kala Bhavan.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India through the art of art and exhibition at the conclave.
The handling of this Nandla Bose is enhancing the beauty of our Constitution.
Nandlal Bose roamed around the villages surrounding Haripura and ultimately showcased rural life.
There were serious discussions in Venice about these priceless works.
Once again, with the best wishes of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Gandhiji, every Indian should take some pledge.
For the country, for the society, something should be done for some good thing.
This is the best, real activity that we can do for the farming.
Brothers and sisters of Mother India, for the last few years, we have been organising the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign for two weeks before October 2.
This time it will start on September 11.
On this movement, there is enthusiasm in all sections of the society.
My business brothers and sisters, all of them have left a banquet in their shops and have written that customers should come out of the house with a boldness.
This will save money and also contribute to protecting the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of breeding, on this occasion, we will dedicate to India, which is free from open defecation, while setting up the foundation for a new mass movement against the materials of the country.
I urge all sections of the society, every village, every small town, every town, every village and every town, to bow down and salute the people of Kakupi and to celebrate this year on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti in a way, we must celebrate this year with the aim of liberating our mother India.
I would urge the private corporations to bring you forward to eliminate these things after collecting so many things.
They can be renewed.
They can manufacture fuel.
But there was a lot before.
Today, I would like to touch a more important thing than a Sanskrit gold language.
Even though it was written several centuries ago, how important is it even today
The monkeys are called foolish jewellery.
Food has always been given great importance in our culture.
We have also scientific knowledge of food.
The balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and children, because they are the foundations of the future of our society.
Nutrition Mission, i.e. nutrition in modern methods across the country, is becoming a mass movement.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once a matter was brought to my attention.
A massive movement called Pitiyata Dhanam was launched in Nazik.
In these days, the Anganwadi brothers and sisters are collecting a handful of grains from the people.
These cereals are useful for hot food prepared for children and women.
This is done in the first time when the child is given nutritious food.
Not liquid food, solid food.
This is a wonderful effort, which can be implemented at all places.
In many states, people are organising the mission of Dhi Bhojan.
Whether it is the birthday of the family, whether it is an inheritance or a commemorative day, the family members, nutritious food and go to Anganwadi by preparing a tasty meal, they go to schools, where the family members share their own children and feed them.
They share their joy, they will not reduce when they share happiness.
The spirit of joy with service is a wonderful confluence.
Friends, Through such small things, we can end the strong war against malnutrition in our country.
Due to lack of awareness today, the poor and self-reliant people are affected by the lack of nutrition.
We will celebrate the month of September as a nutritional movement throughout the country.
Definitely connect you with this, get information, get new ideas in it.
If you bring one or two persons out of malnutrition, then we can bring the country out of malnutrition.
I was confident that this time when I was counting for the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would have heard questions about this matter.
Moreover, in the last few weeks, whenever I visited, whenever I met the people, I was talking about Man Vs Wild.
I did not even imagine that I would get such an opportunity to get a place in the minds of the youth of the world.
I went to Bhutan last week.
As the Prime Minister, whenever I have the opportunity to go, however, the situation has become due to International Yoga Day, if you go to the world, if you go and sit in the world, you start asking me about Yoga for a 5-6 minutes.
Until now, I have no conservative world leader of Yoga, it has been my experience throughout the world.
But now there is a new experience.
Whenever I meet someone, whenever I get the opportunity, they talk about matters related to wildlife, they are engaged in environmental discussions.
This programme of Discovery has been launched by 165 countries in their language.
But one more interesting thing is that some people are asking me something with a little difficulty, Modiji is talking to you in Hindi, when Bear Grills did not know Hindi language, how could you talk so fast
Has it been subsequently stored
Look, there's no secret in it.
The fact is that technology was fully used to interact with Bear Grills.
After this event, a large number of people started talking to me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit places connected with natural and wildlife.
I had already told you that again, I would like to say that you must visit the North-Eastern states in your life.
Your life is vast.
Your thoughts will be vast.
In the past months, I got the opportunity to release the calculation of wild buffaloes.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
The LTTE number in India is 2967.
A few years ago, it was half of them.
The Tiger Summit was held in 2010 in St. Petersburg, Russia.
It was concerned about the decreasing number of LTTEs in the world and finally ensured.
The commitment is to double the number of LTTEs worldwide by 2022.
But because of this New India, we are taking the goals very fast, we have doubled the number of tigers present here in the year 2019.
Not only the number of LTTEs in India, but also the number of protected areas and social security forces has increased.
I recalled the lions in the Gir forests of Gujarat when I released the data related to the LTTE.
I had taken over as the Chief Minister and the residence of lions in the Gir forests was decreasing.
Their numbers were also decreasing.
We have taken one step after another in the Gir forests.
In 2007, we decided to take over the responsibility of women guards.
We have made developments in the framework to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about natural and wildlife, we only talk about maintenance.
Therefore, it is sufficient to protect our forests, vegetations and wildlife that is why it is necessary to create a proper environment to protect them in a better way.
My dear countrymen, who can forget Vivekananda's historic speech on 11th September, 1893.
This young saint of India, who has raised the human society all over the world from sleep, has left a glimpse of India in the world.
The slave that the world has seen, the same world has changed the vision of India by listening to the words of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
Come on, Swami Vivekananda ji has seen the form of India, Swami Vivekananda ji has seen the power of India and we will try to live it.
It is within us, everything is, we will proceed with self-confidence.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating 29th August as National Sports Day.
It is yours that a very interesting movement will be organised for all children, elders, youth and women.
But today I am not going to say anything about their substantial things.
I want to make your mind aware of physical awareness and determine some goals for our nation for a stable India.
I am confident that all of us will be able to get rid of the net goods, get out of the house, get out of the house and get rid of it in the social networks.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, bow to all of you.
On the 26th of January, we celebrated our Republic with joy and joy in the corner of the country.
In a way, it is a cultural festival that is the Constitution of India, the drive for citizens' duties, powers and democratic system, and is now encouraging the future generations to be aware of democratic responsibilities.
But even now, there is no detailed and deeper arguments about the obligations and rights of citizens in our country.
Tomorrow, on 30th January, the day of our devotional tears is absent.
On the 30th of January, at 11 o'clock in the morning, we all pay a two-minute silence and salute our memories for the martyrs of our country.
As a society, as a nation and as a nation, it should be natural for us to pay sacred tributes at 11 o'clock in the morning of January 30.
It's just two minutes, but it has sociality, stress and expression of our concern over the sacrifices.
We have expressed our natural respect for the army and the security forces of our country.
I convey my best wishes to the soldiers and their relatives who have been honored with medals for the brave gallants on the occasion of the Republic of India.
The medals include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I would especially urge the youth to do a job that you are working on the social bases.
This time all the soldiers who have been honoured, write two good words on the web site and share them with your friends.
We will be surprised, pride and inspired when we are deeply aware of the messages of the courage, valour and warmth of those soldiers.
While on the other hand, on the other hand, some of our soldiers who are engaged in the security of our country in Kashmir have died due to snow.
I salute all the soldiers who have lost their lives in this.
My young friends, you all know that I have been continuously singing the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
The four months of January, February, March, April have been challenging for every family.
While there is a choice for a child in the house, the entire family is crying on the burden of examinations.
I always feel that I should come out of this situation, so today I want to talk to my young friends in detail.
I would like to ask you how to make such an environment happy.
I know that Sirushti has asked this question but this question is in your minds.
Exams must be a joyful opportunity.
The exam period for most of the people remains a period of pressure.
You must decide whether you consider it as a joyful time or not as a time of pressure.
Whoever considers it as a stressful time, they feel sorry - please for pressury.
Therefore, it is my belief that the exam is a festival and a festival.
Whenever the festival is celebrated, then the speciality of the festival is visible among us.
The entire family should work as a group and enthusiastically contribute to the success of this event.
There will be changes when you are watching.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrupam, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there is one exam in these 3-4 months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to make this three-four-month festival in accordance with the family environment of everybody in their ways and in their traditions.
If you say that you were happy, if you were with the face of resurrection, you would feel faith, in this situation, even the old things of many years will start smelling in your memories easily.
A year ago, what the teacher said in the classroom will be lightened in your mind.
Sindhna Shakti gets stalled and it starts dreaming of a burden.
I feel that if we feel sorry, we forget things, if we are faithful, we cannot even imagine how many of the most beneficial things will suddenly come into mind.
You don't have any information or you don't work hard.
But when there is pressure then your knowledge, your knowledge and knowledge will all be ruined and pressure will ride on you.
That's why I would say that a happy me is the sector for a good mark-sheet, a happy mind is the opening of more values.
Sometimes I feel that we cannot reach the exams in the right perspective.
This is not a speech for your life.
How you live your life, how you live, how you live and how you think of living your life is not a choice for them.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great example of sympathy for us.
He went to the air force and failed.
Estimates are very important.
This has led to the increase in the fatness of the students and there has been a greater pressure on the minds of the students.
In this situation, I would like to know your views on the modern tendency and future of education.
If you believe in these things, the values will be buried behind you like the wind thread.
It is necessary to know where I have reached today, the situation of my knowledge till yesterday.
If you talk about the world of sports then it will be reflected in the mind, I have noted this explanation.
Most of the sportspersons are leading to their lives due to their competitors.
You will take the life of Sachin Tendulkar
He has been plundering several achievements for 20 years and has achieved a new achievement every time he has achieved the previous achievement.
His journey of life is very wonderful because he has been pursuing a way of competing with others and pursuing his own challenges.
Friends, You will have to write your exams in every field of life when you have to study for 2 hours, can you study for 3 hours
You might have decided how long should you get up in the morning, how long will it be delayed, but can you get up at the time of determination
Therefore, I urge you to compete with others and create challenges to you.
It should be kept in mind how my action was earlier, how I should move forward and how to do well.
With this perspective, you will be able to understand the changes in you.
S.
Sundar ji, it's all right to say you.
Even today, you might have noticed that those who ask me questions, those who give me advice, the number of women in it is more.
Because whenever the mothers are aware of the future of children in the houses, they are making many things easier.
Be guided by your capabilities, guide yourselves, all your jobs, allocate time.
Once you are ready to accept, most of your problems will come to an end.
The aspirations of parents and teachers are in the face of their problems.
The acceptance of the same is a reflection of the way to resolve the problems.
The expectations make the path even more difficult.
You'll get comfort of loading.
In a way, we see the patient and fear the disease.
I would like to tell my parents that we too are making such a fear to our children at some points.
Have you ever seen a pleasant environment in the election days
So, you can see that the environment is completely changing.
I got a surprising phone call.
He doesn't want to mention his name.
You will understand why he doesn't want to mention his name.
Honourable Prime Minister ji, I do not want to mention my name because of a work done in my childhood.
If there is a habit of preserving once, the thirst to learn in life will end.
A telephone call was received: "My name is Monica. I would like to ask you two questions about my exams when I read in class 12.
It is a common idea that if students focus on sports, there will be a lack of attention to education.
This is the basic idea that is wrong, it is the guy of the problem.
If you say that there should be a complete development, there is a life that can cross the scriptures, it is very vast.
This is the right time to live and learn that life.
Whether it's five minutes, it's definitely a little bit off.
You can feel that your work is not difficult.
I don't know whether it is for everyone or not, but this is my experience.
During the election, when I addressed the platforms, my voice would sometimes refuse to cooperate.
Once a native singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long you are sleeping.
Till now, I have not seen that there will be a connection between my sleep, my speech and my voice and he has given me the basic treatment.
If we understand the importance of such basic things then we will get many benefits.
Do not do all this, or your family goes to anger with me.
On the day your honor is coming, if you don't see, I'll look at them.
Please don't do that.
It is a very important thing to keep mind, intellect and body active.
Okay, young friends, when you are engaged in organisations for your exams, I am talking about something, I believe that perhaps I would like to give you relief to what I said today.
But I urge you not to be burdened with what I said.
If possible, don't do it.
Remember your resolution, believe in you, go to the election, my best wishes to all of you.
Alternate the challenge before facing every challenge.
Then the challenge will not be the challenge.
Take this mantra in mind, move forward.
My dear countrymen, on February 1, 2017, the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard is over.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to the officers of the Coast Guard and the soldiers for their contribution to the nation.
It is a matter of pride for us that our coastal guard with 126 ships and 62 aircraft is 4 of the world's 4 largest coastal guards.
The mantra of the Coast Guard is Vyama Raksham.
The Coast Guards are awake at night in tragic conditions to protect the coastal regions and sea shores of the country through their objectives.
Many people may not know that they are not only men but also women are successfully performing their duties as they stand shoulder to shoulder.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard are airplanes or observers and are operating hovergraphy.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the Indian Coast Guard on the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard, which is engaged in the security of the coastal region of India today as the world's largest issue of Coast Guard.
In our country, Basant Panchami is a great festival of Saraswati Puja.
It is considered an opportunity to praise education.
Not only this, it is a time to encourage the soldiers.
Merra Rang de Basanti Sola, make me deserving a spring - this is an inspirational idea.
I extend my warm greetings to my countrymen on this holy spring Panchami festival.
Friends, My dear countrymen, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, Akaswani has always given new colors to the new words, according to his architecture.
As soon as my Mann Ki Baat has been completed for the last two months, he has illuminated the voice of mind in the state languages.
This is a very welcome.
I have got a great opportunity to travel with you through the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Greetings.
My dear countrymen, blessings and best wishes to all of you on Christmas Day.
Today's service, sacrifice and compassion must be given importance in our lives.
Several wealthy people came and gave a single wealth.
In the end, a poor widow came to her and put two snakes on her.
Today, on his birth anniversary, we will pay tributes to him.
Two days ago, I got the opportunity to start several development works in Malviya's penanced Varanasi.
I laid the foundation stone of the Honble Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Centre, which will be set up, will not only be of the eastern Uttar Pradesh but also of the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today, Bharat Ratna, former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, is also the birth anniversary.
This country will not forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we are also proud of the country in the nuclear sector.
As a party leader and as a parliamentarian, Atal ji's unique contribution to the post of minister or prime minister has made him an example.
Today, on the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I convey my heartfelt greetings to him and to give him good health.
As an employee, I had a great deal of work with Atal ji.
The memories about him shake in front of my hearts greenly.
Today, on the occasion of Christmas, the benefits of two projects are available to the people of the country.
In a way, both of them can be the beginning of new projects.
Whether it is a village or a city or a reader or a worker or a cashless transaction, we can see the interest of knowing the things related to how to buy cashless business and how to buy goods without cash.
Everyone wants to learn the methods related to this from each other.
Likewise, the Digidhan Business Programme has been set up to encourage traders and on December 25, as Christmas Awards will be given to 15,000 persons in a qualified manner.
This project is going to be held from today to 100 days.
Every day 15,000 persons will get a prize of Rs.
Digi Dhan Business Programme is mainly for traders.
Business of traders will also have a pleasant opportunity to lay down money.
This scheme is designed by concentrating all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class.
Those who buy goods worth Rs. 50 to Rs. 3000 will get the benefit of this.
This is not available to buyers of more than Rs 3000.
The poorest of the market can buy and sell the goods using USSDs, feature phones and simple phones and all of them will be benefitted by this scheme.
People in rural areas can buy or sell goods through AEPS and gain prizes.
Today, there are about 30 crore RuPay cards in India, out of which 20 crore cards are of the poor families and the people who have their accounts.
These 30 crore people will soon be able to participate in this award.
I am sure that the people of the country will take the country in this process and will be eager to get the required information from the youth around them.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to see the spread of awareness about how technology is being used in the country, how to provide electronic money and how to provide online money.
Over the past few days, cashless business has grown up to 200-300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to take this forward.
The traders are very well aware of how big this resolution is.
A businessman who is buying digital payments, instead of using cash in his business, has been providing income tax concessions to such traders.
I congratulate all the states and Union Territories of the country.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu, led by a team, has been set up and they are reviewing several schemes.
At the same time, the governments have also started several schemes in their own way and are implementing.
I am told that the State Government of Assam has announced that wealth tax and business licensing fees will be given to the digital payers by 10 percent.
If the branches of rural banks do at least two digital transactions from January to March with their 75 percent account holders, the government will pay a sum of Rs 50,000.
The Committee has announced that 100 of the digital mobilization in March 31, 2017 will be provided to the villages from the Government to the best Panchayat for Digi Mobilization of Rs. 5 lakh.
Several organisations are making successful operations to advance digital payments to rural poor farmers.
The interesting thing is that in comparison to GNFC's fertilizer sales last year, there has been an increase of 27 percent this year.
In case of availability of Rs. 100, Rs. 80 and Rs. 80 are available at a cost of Rs. 50 and are deprived of the facilities of insurance and health.
But now money is being paid in a cashless manner.
Our country is a majority of the youth.
Technical is a art that we have abandoned.
A country like India should be at the forefront of all the countries in this area.
Our youth have seen significant progress through start-ups.
This is a golden opportunity for digital operations.
Our youth should incorporate the strength of this sector with new ideas, intellectual technologies and modern methods.
At the same time, it should be linked to the entire power with the movement to get rid of black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I would like to ask you every month before the voice of Mann Ki Baat that you should consult and show your views.
Thousands of letters have come into consultations with MyGov and narendramodiapp, out of which 80-90 percent of the suggestions are related to corruption and black money elimination and currency evasion.
After seeing all this, I feel that they can be generally educated in three ways.
Some have written extensively about the difficulties and difficulties faced by the citizens due to this monetary withdrawal.
Otherwise, they also mentioned how the sweets are taking new ways to lay down the impeachments and unregulated activities in many places, in such a way that the work done for the welfare of the nation is being done so sacred.
I am grateful to the people of my country, you have written such letters to me.
This is a commendable way to bring the money under control.
It is true that the problems faced by our citizens are being faced by all of us, but we are all on the platform for the struggle against corruption, and we are happy to have our cooperation in this war.
We are fighting against corruption and black money as the military forces are fighting for war," said Guru Mani Kewal ji in MyGov.
The writing of Guru Mani Kewal ji is the voice of every corner of the country.
They are the factors, agents of change that they are genuinely transforming.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to those who have given a simple replies to some people who have been trying to bring people to the wrong direction.
A massive effort was made to counter the war against corruption and black money.
Not only this, many people snatched on the field, used their work and intellectuality, snatched the swords of the swords and showed the truth.
If 125 crore people of my country are connected to me then can there be something possible
If the blessings of the fascinating people, are it not the blessings of Isn't it
I express my gratitude to the people of the country, I bow down to them, people are participating in this epic against corruption and black money.
I was expecting that this war against corruption and black money in Parliament would be widely discussed for political parties about the funds given to political parties.
If the sessions were held in the House, it would certainly have been discussed.
Whoever insists that political parties have been exempted in all ways, it is absolutely wrong to say.
Whoever cannot openly support corruption and black money, they are spending their full attention and time in search of the government's grievances.
There is also a question of why the rules are often changing.
This government is working for the people of Magazars.
The government is engaged in making efforts to pursue the earliest epidemics from the public.
When they handle new policies, we also have to adopt new methods to break their evil thoughts.
In the war of Vitak Kandan and Kodacondan, it should be a decision for corruption, prosperity and black money.
On the other hand, there are letters from many about what kind of worst practices are being dealt with and what new ways are being used.
On this occasion, I express my heartfelt gratitude to my dear countrymen.
In order to share such information, the government has set up an e-mail address separately.
Apart from this, you can also send MYGov website.
The government has binded the arms and arms of war against all kinds of evils, such as the evils you indicate.
When your collaboration doesn't end, it's easier to fight.
The third categories written by the letter are also in large numbers.
"Modi ji, you don't get irritated, don't wait, do whatever serious efforts you want to do, but if you decide to travel, you have to walk on the path, you have no choice to resolve the decision and retreat."
My dear countrymen, I had said that even after the voice of Mann Ki Baat last time, our farmer friends have made a lot of efforts in the midst of such places and have achieved the achievements of the records that have been created in the field of seeds.
This is a good symptom when it looks from the perspective of agriculture.
Be it the worker of this country, be it the farmer, be it the youth, the efforts of all of them are renewing the country.
A few days ago, on the World Economic Forum, India has proudly recorded its name in many fields.
It is the result of the continuous efforts of our skilled nations that India has improved in the world class list through different indices.
The World Bank's report on non-soldier trade has enhanced the quality of India.
India has risen to 32 places in the World Economic Organisation report on global competitiveness.
We have moved 16 places in the World Comprehensive Operating Index of 2016 and we have moved 19 places in the World Banks Infrastructure Services Operating Index for 2016.
Several other reports point to the same assessment and India is growing rapidly.
My dear countrymen, this time the anger of the people was read on the Parliament session.
There is anger about the functioning of Parliament at all places.
The President and the Vice President openly expressed their dissatisfaction.
But even in such a situation, I am happy that some good things are happening.
Even between the implementation of the Parliament, the country's attention has not returned to a noble task.
Brothers and sisters, I am happy and proud to say that the government's efforts have been made to keep in mind the goal of development of Divyangjans.
I express my gratitude to the members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for fulfilling this and express my gratitude to the country's Kodanu crore Divyangjans.
This government has been working towards the welfare of Divyangjans.
Individually, I have also been trying to increase the speed of this goal.
My aim was to provide their rights and pride to the persons with disabilities.
Our disabled brothers and sisters have strengthened our efforts and beliefs by winning four medals in Paralympics.
They have not only fulfilled the pride of the country through their successes, but have also made the people surprising in the ocean through their talent.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, like other citizens of the country, our valuable assets and valuable powers.
The provision of jobs to Persons with Disabilities has increased since the Act has been introduced for the welfare of Persons with Disabilities.
Reservation in government works has been increased to 4 percent.
Under this Act, special arrangements have been made for education, facilities and complaints of Persons with Disabilities.
In the last two years, 4350 camps have been conducted for Persons with Disabilities and 5,80,000 Divyang brothers and sisters have been provided at a cost of Rs. 352 crore.
A new law has been enacted with the feelings of the United Nations.
Earlier, the Persons with Disabilities were educated at 7 stages, but now we have made it in 21 ways and 14 new conditions have been added to it.
They have got justice for the first time and have got the opportunity to incorporate certain varieties of Divyangjans.
For instance, we have linked Talassemia, Parkinsons, the affected people, and those who have a slap in birth.
The Indian Cricket team has won a 4-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-for-four-four-for-four-for-four-four-for-four-four-for-for-four-for-four-four-for-for-four-four-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-the-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f--f-f-f-
Some young men are commendable.
Our country's young Karuna Nayar slaughtered 3 percent.
KL Rahul took 199 runs.
Test Captain Virat Kohli has not only spoken well but also had a good leadership.
Spinner of Indian Cricket, Point Visitor R.
Ashwin's name was declared as the ICC 2016 Cricketer of the Year, and the Best Test Cricketer.
My congratulations to all of them and my best wishes.
In the Hockey sector, after 15 years, a very beautiful and special message has been received.
The Junior Hacky team has won the World Cup.
This achievement is a pleasant symptom for the future of Bharat Haki Ani.
Our lady survivors have also done well last month.
If the Indian women's hockey team won the Asian Champion Cup, a few days ago the Indian women's hockey team won the Black Medal in the Asian Cup of 18 years.
Like every year, during Diwali, I once again went to the borders of China to celebrate Diwali with soldiers.
I have celebrated Deepawali at the peaks of the Himalayas with the ITBP, Indian Tibetan Border Forces and Military Forces.
I'm going every time, but the experience of this Deepavali is unique.
People are not just sending information, they are associated with their minds.
One composed poems, others made films, others produced cartoons, others produced video.
That is, every house looks like the dwelling of soldiers.
When I saw letters, I was told how many imaginations are there in people's minds, how many feelings are there
A soldier of the Armed Forces wrote to me: Prime Minister, all of us, all of us, all the occasions like Deepavali, Holi, will be on the borders.
We will spend every moment in the thoughts of security of the country.
Yes, however, there is a feeling of houses in the festivals.
But if you want to say the truth, this time there is no such idea.
There is no idea that we are not at home on this occasion.
Somehow, with 125 crore Indians, we also felt that we are celebrating Diwali.
My dear countrymen, during this festival of Deepawali, the feeling of foolishness in the hearts of the soldiers between our security forces and the security forces of our country should be lost with a few moments.
As a society, as a nation, I urge all of you to feel that it should be natural for us to create this feeling and communicate with our feelings, whether it is a festival or a festival or a festival or a joyous occasion, we should remember the soldiers of our country in some way.
When the whole country stands shoulder with the armed forces, it is sure that the strength and strength of the forces will increase by 125 crore.
Some time ago all the leaders from the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had come to meet me.
They are from the Panchayat Convention in Jammu and Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 leaders from different villages in the Kashmir Valley.
I had an opportunity to interact with them for a long time.
Some of them had spoken about the development of their villages, some had come to the demands, but it was natural that when the conversation began to grow, the atmosphere of the valley, the law and order situation, the future of the children were found in it.
With very love and open hearts, these leaders of the village touched the heart.
During the talks, when I was talking about the burnt schools in Kashmir, I was able to realise that how much sorrow the people of our country were suffering from it, similarly the villagers were also aware of it.
They thought that schools were not burned, the future of the children was tortured.
I asked you to pay attention to the future of these children after you returned to your shrines.
I am very happy that all these leaders who came from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise given me very well.
They also made awareness among those who went to villages.
A few days ago, 95 percent of the children of Kashmir participated in this board exam.
In such a large number of students participating in the Board exams, it shows us that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are encouraging to reach new heights of development through education for a prosperous future.
While conveying my best wishes to those students for their inspiration, I convey my heartfelt greetings to their parents, relatives, their teachers and all the rural leaders.
Brothers and sisters, This time when I asked for advice from the people for the voice of Mann Ki Baat, the advice of all of them came about one thing.
All of them have called upon me to talk about Rs. 500,000 in a broad manner.
In my address to the people of the country on 8th November, I spoke of the launch of a change in the country.
Whenever I had made this resolution, I had put it in front of you, then this decision was not simple, it was complicated.
But the resolution is so important that it is equally important to implement it.
I am sure that a variety of innovations in our average life will face difficulties.
Even then, I had said that this decision was very big, and we would be able to take 50 days from the impact of it and then we will be able to take action in the nature.
Whatever diseases we have been burdening for 70 years, the effort to get rid of those diseases cannot be so easy.
I can understand all the problems you face.
500 and 1000 rupees notes, such a big country, so many numbers of nuts, millions of crores of nuts, such a resolution - the entire world is taking care of it and every economist is evaluating it.
India has immense faith in 125 crore people of India, and 125 crore people are committed to achieving the goal of their stress.
All sections of Central Government, State Governments and Regional Local Organisations, one lakh 30,000 bank branches, lakhs of bank workers, more than one and a half lakh post offices, more than one and a half lakh bank agents from all over the country participated in this work with dedication and dedication.
In the midst of a variety of tensions, all of them are very quiet and are engaged in it as an attempt to make a massive transformation of this country's work.
As a result, it is evident that India will succeed in this work.
I see that all of them are working in banks and post offices in such a situation.
When the matter of humanity comes, they are traveling a little more.
One told me that there was an accident to an old man in the place of Kandwa.
Suddenly the money was needed.
I am glad to know that when the bank workers were taken care of this thing, they went to the house of the elderly and brought the money to the house and looked at no problem with treatment.
Several such uncounted events take place every day in TV, media, newspapers and interactions.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all my colleagues who are working in this great velvet.
But if the evil is spread to the extent, even today the evil practices of some have become a habit and absorbed.
Even now, they are thinking that this corruption money, this black money, the money that is not shown in account, the money that can be found and saved.
They are trying to save their money by cheating the poor, speaking optimistic words or charming their accounts, buying something from them.
I would like to say to such people today that the law will see what to do, what to do, what to do, what to do, what to do, what to do, what to do, whether to be foolish or foolish.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
When the name of the poor comes to the registration, then during the investigation, my beloved poor should not do anything to the problem because of your sin.
There is a very harsh law on pinamic properties, which is coming into force, there will be a lot of difficulties.
The government wants that the people of our country should not face any kind of problem.
I live in Trili Thaluka in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
You have taught a good lesson to black money holders and corrupt people through notes of Rs. 500 and 1000.
If this action has not been taken then every citizen of India will never have a good time.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this.
Some of the things through the media are increasingly encouraging when people get it from the government sides.
It is very joyful and pride that when the common man of my country knows what is a wonderful talent.
Even if you want to eat food, don't worry about money, don't go back from here with hungry, don't go back with food, you have to go away from this road, you must pay money if you want to travel on this road.
People go there, eat food and when they travel again after 2-4-6 days, they pay back the money.
This is the power of my country, the spirit of service, the spirit of sacrifice.
During the election, I was interacting with tea and this idea spread all over the world.
Many people of the world have started talking about tea at the time.
But I did not know that marriages would take place during the interaction of this tea.
On November 17, a marriage in Surat took place with the interaction during tea.
In Surat in Gujarat, a woman gave only tea to those who came to her household for marriage, no festive festive festivities, no money, because there was a monetary liquidation.
The marchers also considered this as a pride.
Surat's Bharatmaru and Daksha Parmar - are enjoying their malpractices in the war against black money and against corruption through their marriage.
While giving a lot of blessings to Navpurnith Bharat and Daksha, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to you for making it a new opportunity.
When such difficulties come, people are making solutions to it very well.
Some people have received immediate benefits through this movement.
The country will benefit in the days to come, but the benefits of some are immediately available.
When I heard about the happenings, I got some information from small towns.
But this time, due to the decision of the 8th day, all of them came to pay their old notes.
During this period last year, about Rs. 3000-3500 crore was collected in 47 City Units.
3000-3500 crore, where is 13,000 crore
Isn't it natural that if these municipalities have got 4 times the money, if the waste water systems are being set up for the poor, water supply systems are set up or the Anganwadi Centres are set up
There are many such examples that have seen direct benefits.
Brothers and sisters, our villages, our farmers, these are the strong pillars of our country's economy.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, every citizen of the middle of the Left itself is improving himself.
But I would like to salute the farmers of my country well today.
Now I was looking at the details of the seeds of this season.
Whether it is wheat or pulses or oil crops, I have an account till November 20, the seeds have increased in comparison to the same period last year.
The farmers have discovered a way in the midst of difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions, in which emphasis has been given to farmers and villages.
Under the Mudra Yojana, efforts were made to provide loans to them.
Millions of crores of rupees were given to the common man under the Mudra Yojana because millions of people are engaged in such small industries and millions of crores of rupees are providing the pace of business.
Today, I want to tell my little business brothers and sisters that you should enter the digital world by using it as an opportunity.
You also get your mobile phones to replace the banks' app.
Your contribution to create a society without cash payments can be very big, you can enhance your business and use the entire banking processes through mobile phones, we can run the business in many ways without handling the notes today.
There are technological ways, which are safe and quick.
Not only this, I am confident that you will be able to lead the transformation, you will be able to give such leadership.
I am confident that you can help the business of the entire village with this technology.
I would like to say to the labour brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot of injustice.
One of the wages laid down in the paper is that the amount given in your hands is otherwise.
You need to get your wages full, no one has to share.
You should not be oppressed.
If you get money in your bank accounts, you can also buy goods in a small mobile phone, through which you can pay money, you don't need any smart phone, even if your mobile phone is going to be e-wallet.
Therefore, my labour brothers and sisters, I would like to contribute to this scheme because I have made such a big decision for the poor, for the poor, for the farmers, for the labourers, for the deprived, for the deprived and the deprived.
Today, I specially want to interact with the youth.
In India, 65 percent are below 35 years of age.
I also know that you have contributed a lot to take this forward in a positive way.
Friends, you are my real soldiers, you are my true friends.
We all have a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India, this is a golden opportunity to take the country to the economic heights.
My young friends, can you help me
App, i.e. you will know what is the app, online banking, i.e., you know what is the banking of the money, and the registration of the travel tickets through the money.
These things are very simple for you and you are using them.
But today, the massive task of doing the country is a society without our huge cash money.
It is true that the society without 100 percent of cash transactions is not possible.
But why shouldn't we make India a less cash user society
Once you start using this low cash society, the goal of a society without cash transactions will not be far away.
I am confident that you will never disappoint me because all of us are interested in the desire to change the lives of the poor of Hindustan.
You know how many opportunities have been made today to create a society without cash transactions, introduce digital banking services or introduce a mobile bank service.
Every bank provides online facility.
Wallad's direct substance e-purse.
A variety of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, millions of poor families of India have Rupee Cards, the lowest Rupee Card, which has been used after the 8th of the year, has started to be more useful and has grown by 300 percent.
Like the prepaid card on mobile phones, banks also have a prepaid card to spend money.
The UPI is an excellent platform for business, through which you can buy goods, send money and get money.
This work is so easier as you send information on the Wattsup.
He has also learned how to send information to the Wattsup today and how to form it.
Not only this, technology is very simple in the unnecessarily unnecessary of a big smart phone for this work.
Money transactions can also be done through a common facility phone.
It can be utilised without any difficulty, whether it is a cooking worker, a vegetable seller, a milk seller, a newspaper seller, a tea seller and a buffalo seller.
I have stressed the efforts to make this process more easier.
All banks are engaged in it and are doing it.
Now we have also canceled the additional fees for online business and you might have seen this in the newspapers in the last two-four days that all such taxes related to the card have come to an end to strengthen the idea of a non-payment society.
My young friends, even after all this happens, it is unsuccessful for all generations.
I know that you all are constructively associated with this great task.
I look forward to giving you the creative news of WhatsApple, poems, poems, swords, cartoons, new imaginations and laughter.
I see what happens to me when I see the creativity of our youth among the challenges and the creativity of our younger communities, even in the battlefields, that is the speciality of this land of India, today when we meet the time of such a big change, a basic creation emerges within you.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I once again say that I need your help, I hope that you and millions of youngsters of this country will do this work.
You will be a part of a non-payment society today.
Graduate all the technologies for online expenditure on your mobile phones.
You must lead the society without cash transactions, the disorder from the network of nets, the movement to liberate the country from corruption, the movement to liberate the black money and the movement to liberate the people from the problems of the people.
Once you learned how the benefits of the Rupay cards are, the poor will give you blessings.
Within a month, we can stand up as a new India, you can do this work through your mobile phones.
Go to 10 houses everyday and join 10 houses everyday.
I invite you, come on, your support is not enough, but we will become a stakeholders that make this change, we will change.
We will move forward in this war that liberates the nation from black money and corruption.
This country has created a great revolution.
My dear youngsters, I once again urge you to take this movement forward.
I invite all of you to join this work in a social and individual manner in every school, college, university, national student force and national welfare programme.
We will take this task forward.
All of us have a chance to serve the country for the greatest service, and this opportunity should not be filled with golden opportunity.
My dear brothers and sisters, Today is the birth anniversary of a great poet of the country, Harivanshrai Bachan ji and today on the birth anniversary of Harivanshrai ji, Amitabh Bachchan ji has given a goal of Swachh Bharat Mission.
You might have noticed that Amitabh ji, the most favourable artist of this century, has been taking forward the Swachh Bharat Mission in a very pace.
Harivansh Rai ji identified himself through this tax.
I convey my respect to Harivansh Rai ji.
I express my gratitude to Amitabh ji for joining the voice of Mann Ki Baat and for taking forward the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your feelings, your letters, myGov and narendramodiopp continue to connect me with you.
Now at 11 o'clock, Mann Ki Baat (Mann Ki Baat) is a shout, but in the state languages, it will start soon after it is completed.
Thank you very much.
Deepawali is being celebrated everywhere in India with fervor and humor.
The country that is taking place on some part of the country for 365 days is the country of India.
But one thing that can be seen clearly in all these things is that this entire journey of the festivals of India, their expansion, their depths and the accomplishment of the people is connected to a basic mantra - it is to move towards the individual society.
Festivals showcase the responsibility of trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains and birds.
Now, we are celebrating holidays on Sunday, but you must have noticed that those of the previous generations, the working class, the fishermen, who have followed the holidays in the days of Purnami and Amavas.
Scientists have proved to have a similar impact on the nature of the changes in sea water for the days of Purnami and Amavasa.
It also affects human minds.
That is, the tradition of celebrating holidays in our country is also connected with fate and science.
Today, we are celebrating the Deepawali festival, as I had earlier said, it is a teaching and knowledge that every pundit of ours is enlightened.
It gives us the message of Dhamsoma Jyotirkamaya to go from dark to light.
It does not mean the darkness caused by lack of light.
The darkness of hypocrisy, the darkness of intellectuality, the darkness of poverty and the darkness of social evil.
And if we are able to get rid of the darkness of the individual, the darkness of the individual who has been dragged into the society, the aim of spreading the light on the Deepavali Dip.
You will see a thing that we all know that if you want to visit any corner of India, whether it is the largest wealthy house, or the poorest of the poor, when the festival of Deepawali is celebrated, you will see that cleanliness movement is being mixed in every family.
There is cleanliness in every corner of the house.
He would have kept his soil distress even clean.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepavali has shared his film with a tweet.
The UK Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on the occasion of Deepawali in London, organised a welcome programme to connect all communities, and participated in it.
It can also be said that there is no UK city that does not celebrate Diwali with great festivals.
Singapore's Prime Minister shared a film in Instagram with great pride all over the world.
Well, do you know what that film is
The film is the 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament wearing the Indian patriotism and standing at the door of the Parliament.
All these were on the occasion of Deepavali.
I would like to say that Deepawali is a bright day and it is a big day to inspire all the people of the world from dark to light.
During the days of Deepawali, news about accidents, firecrackers and temporary deaths are concerned.
There is another problem - when doctors are going to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers, there is another problem with one more problem.
In particular, I appeal to parents and insurgents that when children are slaughtered, there should be adults with them and not be careful that there should be no misunderstanding.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated in our country for a long time.
It's not a day's thing
Govardham Puja, Bai Dhuj and Lap Panchami can be said so that it is a long time for Karthika Purnami to longer than the bright festival.
Besides, we are also happy to celebrate the Deepawali festival and are also engaged in the preparation of Sat Pooja.
The festival of Sath-Puja is a big festival in the eastern parts of India.
In a way, it is a great festival, it is celebrated for 4 days, but it has a special significance that provides a very deep message to the society.
It is difficult to calculate all the things that the Sun God gives us, from whom we reach.
This sacrifice, compassion and labour of the soldiers and the defence personnel is emotional in my heart.
I want to share one thing from the world of these feelings - we will dedicate this island to the security forces.
I have called upon the people of the country to participate in a movement called Sandesh2 Soldiers, a message to the soldiers.
I would like to bow down to the soldiers of the country that there is no citizen who is not proud of the wards, the pride of the forces and the security forces.
The media has also changed this festival as a day of gratitude to the soldiers.
When we are in the mindset of celebrating, if we think about them then a new energy is also born to those memories.
A news also gives multiple power and the country has done it.
Some have painted paintings, golmets, cartoons were made.
I can imagine how proud the moment it is to give to the soldiers of my country.
Such things have been identified in the Hashtag of Sandesh2 Soldiers.
I would like to read the poem sent by Shri Ashwini Kumar Chauhan ji.
Ashwini ji writes: "I am happy to celebrate the festival, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke and smoke.
I convey my best wishes to the people of the country and to you.
My dear countrymen, a sister Shivani has sent me a telephone telephone call when soldiers are full of their homes and soldiers are full of their homes.
Come, let's hear what the soldiers want to say.
Honorable Prime Minister, I speak Shivani Mohan.
Their families and their wives have done a lot of sacrifices with military officers and soldiers.
In a way, the entire military community has also received a very good news.
My dear countrymen, the military bravery is not only on the border but also at every stage of life.
You might have heard that Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of defecating in the open.
Vikas Tagore is a small village of Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Our soldiers of the Indian Tibetan Border Force visited their village for holidays.
At the time of Panchayat in the village, he went there and there were discussions about the construction of toilets in the village panchayat.
It was known that some families have not been able to build toilets due to bankruptcy.
He immediately took his Kasol book and gave a cash of Rs 57,000 to the Chief of Panchayat, if there is no toilet in 57 households, give it a thousand rupees to every family from my side, build 57 toilets, keep the village of Badana free from the habit of defecating.
Vikas Tagore has done this thing and has given 1000 rupees to 57 families and has provided a new energy to the Swachh Bharat Mission.
This is why the Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of open defecation.
Similarly, I would like to express my gratitude to the youth for this thing has happened in Kerala.
At the same time, they came to the conclusion of the construction of toilets in collaboration with all the guys of the National Students Force, national welfare programmes and engineering students.
All the items that were required to build toilets like brick, cement, were carried on their shoulders throughout the day and went to the forest.
They have constructed toilets in the village through their hard work, and these youngsters have been freed from the habit of open defecation outside the small village in the far-flung forest.
That is why Kerala is becoming an untouched state of open defecation.
The state of Gujarat has declared that more than 150 of all municipalities and municipalities have been freed from the habit of open defecation.
10 districts have been declared free from this habit.
But generally these things are not focused.
A new project is being implemented and the next project will also be expected and it will take place.
The houses in which there is a gas layer in our country, the houses in which electricity is there, they do not need kerosene.
But those who are worried about the government are also being given kerosene, gas is being provided, electricity is also being provided and the middle class has got the opportunity to pay.
Look, there will be a big change, the market will be stopped, the environment will benefit, our foreign exchange will be saved and the convenience of the people will increase.
Yes, there is no doubt that the middle class and the currencies will suffer.
My dear countrymen, Gandhiji has always been a guide for us.
In every matter, his claim is to determine the quality of the country where to travel and how to travel.
The need of the hour is to focus on the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take action one after another to get rid of them.
Whatever our ancient ideals, the society should be freed from the distinction of male and female.
Now there are toilets for women children and children in schools.
This is a good moment to achieve the status of a country that is a country that has no differences between our women and children.
Though vaccination is being done on the government side, even millions of children are getting rid of vaccination and are aimed at diseases.
The Mission Indradhanush vaccination is being organised for children who are free from vaccination, which gives children the power to get rid of serious diseases.
We are in the 21st century, but the darkness of the village cannot continue, and a massive movement is successfully progressing in bringing electricity to the village.
After so many years of independence, how will she be healthy when the poor mother cooked food in the bed, 400 cigarettes smoke smoke in her body
5 crore families have been trying to get rid of smoke and we are traveling on a successful path.
Small traders, small enterprises, vegetable sellers, dairy sellers and financing shopkeepers are buying interest loans from the businessmen.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Yojana are successful movements that are being started to get rid of interest loans.
Direct payment of money to the banks through Aadhaar, directly to the beneficiaries and beneficiaries.
It is a good opportunity to get rid of the stakeholders in the lives of the common man.
We fulfil our hearts with the memories of the dignitaries.
But a telephone call from Punjab has touched my heart - Prime Minister, sir, I speak from Punjab to Jastip.
Sir, on October 31, Sardar Patel's birthday.
Sardar Patel had worked to unite the country throughout his life, he has succeeded in this goal and has united everyone.
It is not known that the country's misfortune or what else is to say, that day, Smt. Indira Gandhi was murdered.
After that, we all know what happened in the country.
I would like to know your views about how we prevent such unfortunate events.
My countrymen, above my creature, this pain is not just a human being.
After Chanakyan, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done the work of Bhagirata to integrate the country.
Sardar Patel ji tried to unite, because of his primarily objective of unity, he was ruled by many of his anger, but his path of unity is no less than the goal.
But on the same birthday of Sardar, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardars were killed after the assassination of Smt. Indira Gandhi.
On the birth anniversary of that great man who spent his life for unity, the evil that was built on Sardars is painful to all of us on one side of history.
But even among these difficulties, we must move forward by pushing the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the biggest strength of the country.
The unity in diversity is the strength of India, the speciality of India, despite the variety of languages, various castes, various garments and food habits.
Every generation has a responsibility and every government is responsible for finding an opportunity for unity in every corner of our country and advancing unity theory.
We have also been away from the separatist thoughts and distinguished natures, and save the country.
Sardar ji has given us a united India, it is responsible for all of us to make it a great India.
The original mantra of unity creates a strong foundation of a great India.
The journey of Sardar ji started in the struggle of farmers.
He is the son of a farmer.
Today we are listening to the name of Amul.
Everything in the implementation is really introducing in India and abroad.
But some people know that because of Sardar's vision, the formation of the Milk Producers Cooperation Trade Union was created.
In those days, when he was called Kera, in 1942, he strengthened this idea, the Amul, who was present today, is an example of how Sardar Ji worked for the welfare of the farmers.
I convey my respect to Sardar Ji.
On 31st October, on the day of integrity, we will remember Sardar Ji, we will fulfill our commitment to unity.
My countrymen, Kartika Purnami is being celebrated as a light festival in this Deepavali festival.
Guru Nanak Dev ji's foundations are for the entire human society, not only for India but also for the entire human society, it is still a guide.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev ji is service, pride and good for all.
Peace, unity and harmony are the main mantras.
Guru Nanak Dev ji was aimed at liberating the society from diversity, mood and evil habits.
May your dreams and your commitments succeed in all ways.
Over the past, we have lost 18 soldiers of our country in the Uri area of Jammu and Kashmir.
I convey my tributes to all the martyrs and brave soldiers.
This impoverished event is enjoying the entire nation.
Sorry increases in the nerves of the people of the country, anger boils
This loss is not only for the families of those soldiers who lost their children, lost their brothers and lost their husbands.
This loss is being experienced throughout the country.
Therefore, the people of the country, even today I have said before you that day, the culprits will be punished and they cannot escape from the punishment.
My dear countrymen, we have immense faith in our military.
They will foil every environment by their militarism, and 125 crore people of the country will express their valour in a peaceful and peaceful way to live.
We are very proud of our military.
Today, I would like to talk with the citizens of Kashmir.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the enemies of the country well.
When they are starting to understand the truth, they are trying to remove such devastating forces from them and travel in peace.
Every parents wish that schools and colleges should start functioning at a rapid pace.
Over the past few days, business has started well.
We know that peace, unity and harmony can be the solution to our problems, our progress can be the path of development.
For our future generations, we have to take new heights of development.
I am confident that if we pave the way for a peaceful consultation and solution to every problem, then we will be able to create a better way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The responsibility of the security administration of the Kashmiri citizens.
The administration has to take some measures to enforce law and order.
I also urge the security forces of the country to pursue the efficiency, power, law and regulations that we have with them for law and order and ensure peaceful life of the common man of Kashmir.
Sometimes those who are different from our ideas present new ideas.
The youth of the eleventh class Sharshvardhan has given me a different idea.
After the LTTE attack, there was a lot of concern in my mind, and I didn't know the way to do something.
This is my heart's pleasure that Harsh Vardhan, in this emotional environment, you are thinking positively in such a young age.
But Harsh Vardhan is one of the greatest values of anger in the minds of the people of the country.
This is a reflection of the feelings of the people of the country.
Yes, you have introduced a positive approach.
But you know that during the 1965 war, Lal Bahadur Shastri was leading the country and this kind of feeling was enhanced throughout the country and the dream of patriotism was a dream.
There was a commitment to do something in every citizen's mind.
At that time, Lal Bahadur Shastri was trying to give a very good year to these feelings of the country.
He gave a mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and inspired the people of the country to work towards the nation.
One more attempt to express patriotism in the midst of bomb blasts should be understood by every citizen, which he presented to Lal Bahadur Shastri.
While Gandhiji was leading the freedom struggle, he successfully worked to inspire the creative tasks of the society when there was a need for another platform when the freedom movement was intensely dreamt of.
We and our army can make our duties, those who are responsible for the administration, their duties, our people and every citizen, with this feeling of patriotism, we will contribute to some positive contribution, when the country will certainly take new heights.
My dear countrymen, the history of our sportspersons who participated in the Para Olympics Games is the success of human inspiration.
Varun Vishwanathan ji has registered that our sportspersons have worked compassionately in the Narendra Modi App and has asked you to tell this in your heart.
Not only to both of you, but also to every citizen of the country, the sportspersons who have participated in Para Olympics have got a sense of connectivity.
These Para Olympic competitions, the achievements of our sportspersons, the perspective of humanity and the perspective of the persons with disabilities have been completely changed.
I do not forget the words made by our successor sister Dipa Malik ji after winning the medal.
This time, 19 sportspersons, including three women of our country, participated in Para Olympics.
In comparison to other sports, the psychological determination and determination of persons with disabilities, their talent and their talent in sports.
Maryappan Thangavelu has won a gold medal in the tall-up competition.
Maryappan had lost his right leg at just five years of age.
Even poverty could not stop his tension.
He is not a resident of a big city but a middle class family or a wealthy family.
At the age of 21, he did not pay attention to physical obstacles, but also gave medals to help him with stress.
While they have raised our feelings, we have changed the view that we see the Divyangjans.
Can anyone imagine that the disabled persons can dissolve the response of a customary Olympic competition
This time it happened.
Abdul Ladip Paskar, Algeria, who was a Gold Medal in the Olympics Competition for 1500 meters of drive, was 1.
I once again express my heartfelt congratulations to our sportspersons that in the coming days, I would like to say that India will move towards a positive programme for Para Olympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a very different experience in Gujarat's Navsari.
It got me a very emotional moment.
The Government of India had organised a Mega Camp for Persons with Disabilities, in which many world records were created.
I met a young girl who had no eyesight, and her name was Gauri Shardul, a little child from the long wilderness of Nang district.
And she told me some parts thereof, and when I told it before the congregation, the people were astonished.
I believe that the Government of India has achieved a world record in Navsari.
The process of listening to 600 unsuccessful persons with disabilities has been carried out within eight hours.
It took place in the world record book of Kinnes.
It is a matter of great pride to our nation that the creation of three world achievements by the Divyangjans in one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we have launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
On that day, I might have said that cleanliness should be natural, it should be the responsibility of every citizen, it should be seen as a filthy association.
I am sure that in the coming two years of October, I am sure that there has been awareness of cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore people of the country.
Similarly, everybody has been trying to take one step in the direction of cleanliness.
That is, 125 crore feet of the country have moved towards cleanliness.
It is sure that if the direction of going is correct then the benefits will be very good.
Be it a common citizen or a government office, be it a road, be it a bus or railway station, be it a school or college, be it a place of worship, be it a hospital or be it a child to adults, the poor, the farmers and the women of the village have contributed to cleanliness.
Media friends have also done a positive job.
This progress is not enough, we have to see further progress.
It's very important
So far, about 2 crore 48 lakh toilets have been constructed in rural India, and in the coming years, more than 2 crore 12 crore toilets have been constructed.
In the states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, the habit of defecation will soon be eliminated.
When I had recently visited Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji in Gujarat, officials had told me that on October 2, the day of an open defecation was completed.
Come on, people, we will see a lot of progress.
In particular, my young brothers are fully utilising technology and I want to introduce a scheme before them.
The Government of India has organised a telephone number of 1969 to know how the level of Swachh Bharat Mission is in your city.
You can fully use it, especially the younger generations, use it well.
The Government of India urges the Corporate World to take forward your contribution.
Young professionals who want to work for cleanliness should support the industry.
We can use them as Swachh Bharat Partners, Swachh Bharat Fellows.
If this Swachh Bharat Mission stands with the government then it cannot progress and cleanliness is natural and will not be fulfilled.
It is also important to get out of the waste.
Therefore, along with the Swachh Bharat Mission, we have to travel towards the direction of waste to fertilizer.
Fertilizers have been requested to buy compost fertilizers from the waste.
They should see the way to get this fertilizer for the farmers who want to be involved in natural agriculture.
These fertilizers should be provided to those who think of improving the resources of their land, who are concerned about the welfare of the land, who have suffered substantial damage from the chemical fertilizers, even if they need this fertilizer.
Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing to this work as a business ambassador.
The Ministers from all over the country, the Chief Ministers, the city mayors and the commissioners are all together to conduct deeper consultations about cleanliness.
What can be achieved by technology
What can be the funding model
Discussions are going on for all these things.
I am looking at the innovations of cleanliness continuously.
I read that one day in a press conference that students of Gujarat Technical University went to 107 villages to create awareness about the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has also prepared a year-long list in its Ministries.
Every sector should focus on cleanliness for 15 days.
The three sectors of the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Panchayati Raj and Rural Development are going to jointly develop and implement the schemes related to cleanliness in their respective regimes from 1st to 15th October.
In the last two weeks of October, 3 more Ministries such as Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs will implement the Swachhta Abhiyan in their respective regimes from 16th to 31st October.
If you have any work related to these sectors then I would like to urge the citizens to join it.
Now you might have noticed that the Cleanliness Relations Mission is going on.
The first survey was conducted in 73 cities, which was placed before the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh, now we have resided in every city and every city and have a hope to see progress next time.
There is a competitive environment related to cleanliness.
We all have to give so much contribution to this movement.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Gandhians and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It has been two years since the Swachh Bharat Mission.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepavali, I have been asking you to buy something.
Once again I ask every family to buy something, so that the lamp will burn on the day of Diwali in the houses of the poor.
This October 2 Sunday, as a citizen, can we not be involved in any work related to cleanliness
I urge you to join yourself in the cleanliness work for 2 hours and 4 hours, and share your photo with me in the Narendra Modi App.
If there is a video, share that video.
With our efforts, once again this movement will be strengthened and new speed will be created across the country.
Recalling Gandhijis and Lal Bahadur Sastri, we will reaffirm our commitment to do something for the country.
The responses given by the people of the country to my request to eliminate gas subsidy in the past are very inspiring to the lives of the country.
This is a mission to gather food items and clothing to the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers landed in the streets and took away the old sports materials in the families and brought them to Anganwadi in the poorest of the poor.
The pundit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya ji, who explained the political ideas that millions of workers like me are working by which political ideals are driven by.
Today, the centenary of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya ji, the political ideals associated with the roots of India, the tradition of Indian culture, the tradition of the tradition of the tradition, the tradition of the tradition of the political philosophy and humanity.
Sarvajan Hithai, Sarvajan Sukkai, the well-being of all, the happiness of all is his contribution.
Gandhiji also spoke of the interests of the people in the market.
How to bring the benefits of development to the poor in the market
Deendayal presented the entire economic project in a single word that the work for every hand and water in every land.
The country should celebrate his birth centenary as the year of the poor.
The attention of the society and the government must be to bring the benefits of development to the poor.
I recall Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji, who was an incomplete compassionate compassion of our thoughts, who was a compassionate compassion of us.
The common man of this country gives me such inspirations.
What are the aspirations of the common man of this country
The record of the materials that have been recorded in my mind and mind is emerging in the voice of the mind.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to extend my thoughts and express my heartfelt gratitude for taking full efforts to bring it to all languages.
They published letters after the voice of Mann Ki Baat and gave suggestions and betrayed the doors of the government, highlighted the government's grievances, prepared special programs with such letters, brought representatives from the government and set up a platform for solutions to the problems.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat has not stopped with a 15-20-minute interaction, it is a new opportunity for social transformation.
What else can be a joyful thing
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all those who have contributed to this success and salute them.
My dear countrymen, next week Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijaya Dhasamy are coming and arrangements for Deepawali will start and in a way a different environment will be held throughout the country.
The unity of society is the power of the country.
Whether it is Navratria or Durga Puja, we think of making this Shakti a path of worship and social unity.
Let us follow the sacred days of Navratri and Durga Puja in the heart of peace, unity and harmony to take the country to new heights.
We will celebrate Vijaya Dasamy.
This day is being celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
During the Olympic Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936, he has done a very important job to achieve the Gold Medal for India.
At that time it was only 10 minutes to get the end of the labour.
Thyan Chand ji put 3 crores in those ten minutes, and I have put the bucks in response to the wound.
My dear countrymen, whenever I come to the voice of Mann Ki Baat, MyGov or narendramodiap, there are many suggestions.
They are varieties.
But this time I must comment on Rio Olympics.
This is very positive when I see such an interest in the minds of the people about the Rio Olympics, such awareness and the pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to talk about it.
Besides the cricket, there is so much interest in other sports for the people of India, so much awareness and so much information is known.
Sachin has written that you must talk about Sindhu, Sakshi and Diba Karman in the voice of Mann Ki Baat this time.
One of these women belongs to North India, one South India, one from East India, other from the other side of India.
It seems as if the daughters of India have accepted the responsibility of pride for the nation.
Shikar Dakur ji on the MyGov portal has written that we can work even more well in the Olympics.
He further said, My best wishes to you for the two medals we have received in the Honourable Moti Sir Rio.
There is a need to travel longer in the sports games.
Our parents are paying attention to education today.
In the society, they still see sports with the perspective of time.
We have to change this idea.
There is a need to encourage society.
Who else can give this job better than you
Like this, Shri Sathyaprakash Mehra has also written on narendramodiapp. He urged the need for extra-curricular activitises in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
In a way, this feeling reflected in thousands of people.
It is true that there is no alternative opinion that we cannot act according to our opponents.
We have received only two medals in meditation.
But if the medals are not available, you can see that for the first time in many cases, the sportspersons of India have shown considerable talent.
Our Abhinav Bindra ji got the fourth place in the shooting category, and lost medals in a very small distinction.
Likewise, Sania Mirza-Rohan Popanna took place in the Dennis competition.
We have worked well in the athletics sector.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar ji was eligible for the final competing of the trackfield.
For the first time in the last 36 years, men have succeeded in achieving a knock out position in the hockey.
In Baxing, Vikas Krishan Yadav came to the final stage, but he could not get the bronze medal.
Many of the soldiers, such as Atiti Ashok, Datu Pognal, Dhanu Das, were well-known.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do more.
But if we continue to work as we have worked till now, we may have to come back to disappointment.
I announce the setting up of a committee.
The Government of India will deeply wash it and consider what kind of activities are there in the world.
The action plan will be finished on what sector we can do well.
Our plans should be set up with a vision of 2020, 2025, 2028.
I urge all Indian citizens who are interested to send their suggestions to me on narendramodiap.
The State Governments will send their suggestions after discussions.
My dear countrymen, Teachers Day on 5th September.
I was able to learn a lot with these smaller milkmen.
For me, on September 5, it is not just a day of teachers but also a day of education.
But this time I had to go to the G-20 Summit, it appeared that today I had to express my feelings in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
The more important place for the mother in life is the place of teachers.
We have seen teachers who are more interested in us.
They have dedicated their lives for their disciples, for their students.
Today I see Gobichand Ji as a best teacher by crossing him as a sportsperson.
On Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand Ji, his penance and his entire compassion towards sports and his joy in the success of Payalvar.
The contribution of teachers in the lives of all of us is always felt.
Former President of India, Dr.
Surveypalli Radhakrishnan's birthday
He always tried to live himself as a teacher, even though he had achieved any position in his life.
Not only this, he never dies that the student is among the good teachers.
In that month, the books read and the curriculum would have been shown in it.
It would have been noted that I did all the month in his sight is wrong.
Even today, he is teaching me in the classroom.
Even today, he is giving me a way of far-reaching education.
I am surprising that when he looks at his signature at the age of 90, how can he write such pearls in this old age
Because my signature is so bad that if someone writes beautifully, then my heart is very respectful.
Your experience may also be like my experience.
Whatever good you have got in your life by your teachers, if you tell it worldwide then there will be a change in the perspective of the teachers we see.
It is our responsibility to increase the pride of teachers in society.
If you were taking some photographs with your teachers, if there was any incident with your teacher, then you must share it on narendramodiap.
It is a matter of value to see the contribution of the teachers of the country with the vision of students.
But when we talk about Gaya Chaturthi, it is natural to recall our memories about Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilkar.
The legacy of Lokmanya Tilkar is the tradition of socially observing Gaya Chaturthi.
He transformed the religious activity through the Democratic rally as a day of national awareness and has become a social cultural day.
Democratic Chaturthi was discussing all the issues that touched the social life, which led to a new uprising and a new development in the society.
Not only that, there is a mantra he has given - Swarajya should be the centre of our reproductive and the power of the freedom struggle.
Not only in Maharashtra but also in the entire country today, the Gayana Chaturthi is being celebrated socially.
They are discussing public matters, conducting articles and competing to goalam.
The scenes found in this will have artistic illumination of the things that touch the society.
In a way, the movement to create awareness for all is being carried out through socially democratic.
Lokhamanya Tilkar Swarajya has given the title of our generosity.
But now we are in a free India.
Come on, I'm calling you.
It is true that festivals are the powers of the society.
They provide a new life to the individual and the society.
Life without festivals is not possible but it has to be changed according to the need of the hour.
This time, I can see that many people have written about Gaya Chaturthi and Durga Puja.
They are concerned about the environment.
Shri Shankar Narayana Prasad and Modi ji have insisted that you should not use the idols made by the Plaster of Paris through the voice programme of Mann Ki Baat.
The statues made by the Plaster of Paris are not suitable to the environment, but others have expressed their concerns.
I urge all of you to use the idols of the dust, the idols of the dust, the idols of Durka, to redeem our ancient tradition.
Ganesha is the one who removes the problems.
In such a situation, we should not create a idol of Ganesha that creates trouble.
I don't know how you're taking me to say, but I don't just say it, many say it.
One of the artisans of Pune, Shri Abhijit Dodpale, Nisark Mitra, Vigyan Prabodini, Nisark Kata of Vidarpa, Gyan Prabodini of Pune, Kirgavasa RAA of Mumbai.
Such a variety of organisations and individuals face more difficulty in building statues of Ganesh.
It is also a social service that is a democracies that are not polluted in the environment.
Durga Puja is still a short time.
Employment will be generated through such mud statues for traditional idols.
We will determine that the environment will be protected because our ponds and the soil of the rivers will be done.
It is natural that all the people of the country are proud that the mother Teresa, who has served for the poor of India, is now being given a pious grade.
All the saints, the sages, the sages, the great men, we have got the favour of learning something every moment.
We have received something from them, we are further learning and understanding the good things.
My dear countrymen, when it is a movement of progress, it will make such a big change.
People are seen in the form of Shakti Makshan Shakti.
In the last few days, the Government of India has been working together with the people to create a clean Ganga, clean Ganga, in collaboration with five State Governments.
We called the leaders of the villages living on the banks of the river Ganga to a meeting in Allahabad on 20th this month.
There were men and women among them.
I convey my best wishes to all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India, who have fulfilled this great task.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Ministers of 5 State Governments who have helped in connecting Jan Shakti and taking the pollution of Ganga.
My dear countrymen, some things, sometimes touch my heart, and sometimes there is a great respect in my heart on those who have created an opportunity.
On July 15, about 1.
More than 25 lakh students have written letters to their parents socially.
Some people in English, some in Hindi and some in the language of Chattisgarh had told their parents that they should have toilets in their homes.
They were asking for toilets to be constructed and some children were writing that even if you don't celebrate my birthday this year, you would not be able to do it, but definitely build toilets.
Children from seven to 17 years of age did this work.
There is a 16-year-old Mallamma in Kobal district of Karnataka, who has made Satyagraha against her family.
He didn't want to achieve anything for himself or dress good clothes or eat sweets.
Girl child Mallamma's oppression is to call for a toilet in our house.
Look at the importance of the village leader Mohammad Shafi, he arranged for Rs 18,000 and constructed toilets within a week.
But everybody is associated with it in some way, everybody is making a golden contribution.
I also invite television channels to organize competitors by producing such short films.
There is no need for a big studio to produce a film and a big camera.
During this period, you can make a film using your mobile phone camera.
Our Honble President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new event called Akashwani Maitri Channel in Kolkata.
Many people can hear the question of launching a radio army as the President of the country.
Bangladesh is our neighbour.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are integrated to the same cultural heritage.
Here, Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Pedar Radio will be beyond the borders and people from both sides speaking Bengal will be happy to hear the aspirations.
The contribution of Akashwani to connect people with the people is the biggest contribution.
This was inaugurated by the President.
I express my gratitude to the country of Bangladesh associated with us for fulfilling this work.
I extend my appreciation to the friends of the Akashwani for their contribution to the policy of hygiene.
My dear countrymen, you must have made me the Prime Minister of the country, but I am a man like you.
Sometimes, therefore, some of my minds and some of the emotional events are soaked.
Such emotional events provide renewable energy and new sympathy and inspire the people of the country to achieve something.
A letter that came to me in the past few days had touched my heart.
This is written by a mother of about 84 years
If a retired teacher had not asked him not to mention his name, I would certainly have mentioned his name.
I also broke the subsidy and forgot about it as you asked me to drive the subsidy for gas.
For me, the letter written by the Prime Minister of India is similar to the Padmashree Award.
My countrymen, you must have been aware of the efforts made by all those who have swallowed the gas subsidy and wrote a letter from my side and my representative will go and give it to those who have swallowed the subsidy.
It is my endeavour to write letters to more than one crore people.
My dear countrymen, we have suffered due to drought last year but this August has caused the sorrow of continuous floods.
In some parts of the country, there was a flood again.
State governments, central governments, local organisations, social welfare organisations and citizens have made efforts to make them self-reliant.
But some of the things that happened between the floods of this tragedy are worth remembering.
This year, we will remind us of how the power to live together and how the impact will be on the shoulder to shoulder.
In August 2016, the political parties, who were opposed to the Goods Services Tax, together with 90 parties from all over the country and all the political parties in the Parliament.
Appreciation for fulfilling this is to all the political parties.
This is an excellent example of what will be the benefits of travelling in one direction, together with all political parties.
Likewise, all the political parties of the country together discussed the issue of Kashmir in a single voice regarding the situation in Kashmir.
The message was sent to the world and to the separatist forces and their understanding was expressed to the people of Kashmir.
Interacting with all the political parties regarding Kashmir, one thing was well known and if I had to say that it should be suppressed in two words, they were united and loved.
These two words were mixed as their original mantra.
Whatever the loss of lives in Kashmir, whether it is the life of a young man or the life of the security forces, the loss of ours is ours, the confidence of our nation, the confidence of the people of 125 crore nations, the confidence of the villagers and the Prime Minister of the country.
Those who pursue smaller sinners to create unrest in Kashmir should be answered one day to this foolish boys.
I am confident of 125 crore people of the country.
Yesterday morning, I got the opportunity to spend a few moments with the youth of Delhi and I hope that in the coming days, the enthusiasm of sports related to sports will increase the enthusiasm of every young man.
We all know that the biggest Kumbh of the world sports is going to be held in a few days.
The word Rio continues to be reflected in our ears.
Yesterday, the Government of India had organised a unique organization of Run for Rio Run, play, live, play and development in Delhi.
In the days to come, in any part of the region, we will be able to encourage our sportspersons.
I am ready to do this work from your side.
The country's Prime Minister is ready to make your best wishes to our sportspersons.
Come, let us all make every sportsperson honourable in the days to come and encourage their efforts.
Today, when I was talking about Rio Olympics, I read a poem written by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a poet of Punjab Central University.
Like him, many more poets may have written more poems in this regard, some may have made them songs of songs, it may have happened in every language, but today I want to share with you the poem that Suraj ji wrote to me.
Golden silver shall be a brass of medal for India.
Suraj ji, I dedicate your feelings to all these sportspersons, and I convey my best wishes to you all from my side and from my side to 125 crore nations and to fly our flag with pride in Rio.
Mr.
But whenever the name of Abdul Kalam is taken, there is a future picture of a skilled India in the form of science, technology and missile.
In that way, you have asked what efforts are being made by your government to realize the dreams of Abdul Kalam
And if we want to compose our pattern, then research and innovation must be done, this is the life of technology.
If researches and innovations have not been created, however the stored water starts drizzling, the technology will become a burden for us.
If we do not do research and innovation, we are dependent on old technologies, we will become a compassionate in the changing era
Therefore, the government is making several efforts to sow the dairy country of science, technology and the milk attraction of research in the minds of our youth.
That is why I say that we aim to innovate and create innovations.
This means Atal Innovation Mission when I call it AIM.
If we want to create innovators next generation then we should connect our youngsters with this scheme
That is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
Wherever such smooth centres are being set up in schools, Rs. 10 lakh will be provided and Rs. 10 lakh will be provided for maintenance in five years.
Similarly, innovations are directly connected to the Centre of Innovation.
If we have a powerful, fulfilment centre, we have a system that is required to create innovations, check ups for start-ups and consolidate them.
While it is necessary to set up a new Centre, it is important to strengthen the old centres.
Our eyes face problems in our daily life.
Now we need to find technology solutions.
As an Atal Grand Challenges, we have called upon the younger generation of the country to take research, innovate and come to address the problems of your eyes wherever you see.
The Government of India wants to give special awards to the learned technologies and encourage them to address our problems.
I am happy that when we talk about Tinkering Lab, more than 13,000 schools have applied, and when we talk about the Centre of Construction, more than 4,000 non-educational organisations have come forward to set up such centres.
I am convinced that the real tribute to Abdul Kalam is to research, to create innovations, to find solutions through technology and to get rid of our obstacles through the problems faced by us in our daily life.
Whatever our younger generations pay attention to them, their role in cooking the modern India of the 21st century will be greater, this will also be a real tribute to the memories of Abdul Kalam.
My dear countrymen, sometimes ago we had anxiety of famine in our minds, now the rains are enjoying and the news about the floods are also coming.
The State Governments and the Central Government are working together with the shoulders to help the flood affected persons.
Even though there are some obstacles due to rains, there is a progress in every human mind because there is rain and agriculture as the centre of all our economic activities.
Sometimes, the diseases that are suffering from us throughout our life are also afflicted with us.
But if we are awake, if we are awake, then the ways of prevention are easier.
Take the fever of dengue.
We can protect us from dengue fever.
Even if the government, the hospitals and the doctors are doing their jobs, we should not allow dengue to be allowed in our homes, in our homes, in our homes, in our homes and in our households and in our households.
My dear countrymen, I want to turn your attention towards another problem.
If life becomes compulsory and faster then sometimes we can even think about us.
If you want a few moments, you can get relief, but doctors should stop the habit of taking antibiotics without any recommendation.
There has been another problem - if the doctor recommends taking 15 antibiotic pills in 5 days, please complete the amount of physicians in the days of the doctor's recommendation.
If we quit that there is no need for health, then it is beneficial for microorganisms and becomes stronger.
It is called antibiotic resistance in medical terms, therefore, it is important to follow the methods of adopting antibiotic and how to use it.
The government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance
You might have noticed that the antibiotic vegetarians that are now sold have been covered upon a red poult, it is to make you aware that you should take care of it.
When we talk about health, I want to add another thing to it.
Sometimes the health of the pregnant mothers in our country is of great concern.
Every year, about 3 crore women are pregnant in our country, but some mothers die during childbirth and some infants die during childbirth.
Sometimes both mother and daughter died.
Though it is true that in the last decade, the level of maternal mortality has fallen, even today we cannot save the lives of pregnant mothers.
The situation is unaware of the fact that in the pregnancy or after the pregnancy, blood deficiency, infections related to childbirth and high blood pressure will be their lives.
Considering this, the Government of India has been implementing a new movement for the past few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, i. e.
My medical brothers and sisters cannot dedicate themselves to the poor for 12 days a year
In the past, many have written a letter to me.
I am sure you will definitely join it.
My dear countrymen, today the concern of climate change, world warming and environment is improving all over the world.
Discussions are going on among the people across the country and around the world.
India has strengthened this idea for centuries.
In the song, Lord Krishna, Achvatha: Sarvavrukshanam, I am a king's tree in that tree.
Sukrajudhi or Nasti means that there is no vegetation without any medicinal quality.
The example of Sonal, a woman from Pune, attracted my attention, it was my heart for years.
It is said that on the occasion of Mahabharata, trees perform the duties of Makkad Selava in heaven as well, Sonal is accepting the challenge of fulfilling the aspirations of his mother's father, not only the aspirations of the entire society.
The farmer of Narayanpur village in Junnnar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra, Kandu Marudi Mahadre
Several people are making such efforts.
During my tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, during the month of Bhadra, I have seen a large number of pilgrims coming to the Amba Devi temple there.
Once a social service organisation has provided a tree to those who come to the temple, and if they go to the village then the mother-in-law will continue to give you his blessings.
This year lakhs of plants were provided to millions of pilgrims who came here.
Even temples can start the tradition of planting trees in the rainy season instead of Prasad.
This can lead to a mass movement related to plantation.
I would like to ask my farmer brothers again why should we not plant trees of tea on the borders of our crops instead of destroying our lands
Today, we have to import a single tree from all over the country to build houses and slaughter products in India.
The government has created a mass movement and Rajasthan is a desert area.
There too, a large number of forest festivals have been celebrated and 25 lakh trees have been decided.
It is not a small task to drive 25 lakh trees in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the land of Rajasthan know what a big challenge it is.
In Andhra Pradesh, it has been decided to increase the Greenness by 50 percent by 2029.
Van Mahotsav is also a very popular tradition in Gujarat.
In Gujarat this year, several schemes like Mamar forest, Ekada forest and Sheet forest have been initiated and several crore trees have been planted.
As a foreign visit, international agreements are undertaken in various fields such as a combined part of the state and diplomacy, discussions on trade and defence talks.
But for me, the visit to South Africa is like a pilgrimage in a way.
It is natural that the memories of Gandhians and Nelson Mandela are emerging in mind while thinking about South Africa.
When the words of Ahimsa, Nasma, Magnitude etc come in the ears, the faces of Gandhians and Mandela will appear before us.
As part of my visit to South Africa, I had to go to the Phoenix settlement and the place where Gandhians lived is known as Sarvadaya.
I got the opportunity to travel to the Peter Maritzburg railway station when Gandhiji had sown the seeds that made Mohanthas a Gandhian train.
This time I had the opportunity to meet many important people who sacrificed their youth for equality and equality.
Nelson fought with Mandela, shoulder to shoulder to shoulder and lived with him in jails for 20-25 years.
In a way, they had sacrificed their entire young man, and I got a great deal of visiting the people of Nellson Mandela near Ahmad Kadada ji, Lalu (EEBA) Shiba ji, Jews Bezos ji, Roney Castries.
While I was interacting with them, when I was asking for their prison experiences, there was no compassion in their minds, no compassion.
Everyone is equal, all of us are the ways to lead us to a bright future.
Let us be proud of these Indians who have lived the original mantras of our life in South Africa too.
Recently, I read in a news article that a woman who was involved in fraud and email web loses 11 lakh rupees and committed suicide.
I am also sorry about the condition of his family as a woman.
I want to know what your opinion about such a fraudulent e-mails.
A new strategy that is using technology is spreading across the world.
The way technology plays a big role in the economic system, its misuse is also increasing.
It was noted that at the time of commencement of work, at the time of the completion of the daughter's marriage, one day, you have received a great honor from the country, to get that if you want to put 2 lakh rupees in the bank account for the customs solution, then this person has taken 2 lakh rupees in his life and sent it to a person who has not known the face.
Your borrowing card number, debit card number, etc. can be created and dispatched by anybody else, through technology, you are cleaning your bank accounts.
This is a new kind of fraud, it's a digital fraud.
I think that we should protect us from this conflict, I want to be awakened, if such letters come, we should immediately share them with those who know them, friends and help them to create awareness.
My dear countrymen, when the Parliament Conclave is going on, I have the opportunity to meet many people of the country.
I had a pleasant experience during such a meeting.
Some students from Alikar met me.
The student was enthusiastic and they were bringing a huge album, swimming on their faces.
They had brought the films that they have made the Aligarh railway station.
They built a layer plantation built by plastic bottles at the railway station and created a new shape for the station.
If you also have the opportunity to go to Aligarh then you must visit the railway station.
This kind of information about several railway stations in India has come to me now and the people of those circles are making their regional artistic beauty on the walls of the railway stations.
One feels a new feeling.
This is an example of how people can change through their contribution.
My congratulations to all those who are engaged in this kind of work in the country, my best wishes to all my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, with the rainy season, the season of many festivals starts in our country.
You will also participate in festivals in your homes and publications.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is very important.
Like last year, during the Rakshabandhan period, cannot you give the country's mothers and sisters the Pradhan Mantri Ayurveda Yojana or the Jeevan Jyoti Ayurveda Yojana
Brothers and Sindhis and brothers, in life, give a gift to your brothers and sisters to really feel secure.
Why should we sit upon a woman to cook or do household work in our homes or be the daughter of a poor mother.
Can they also present the Pradhan Mantri Ayurveda Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Ayurveda Yojana during this Raksha Bandhan festival
My dear countrymen, many of us would have been born after independence.
We can create such an environment.
Freedom Day is not a program of governments but it should be of the people of the country.
Like Deepavali, we have to celebrate this shrine as our festival.
Together with the ideologies of patriotism, I want to do something positive.
I would like to inform the people of the country that I would like to invite you to make it clear from the brink of the Red Fort.
I don't want to be the prime minister's views from the brink of the Red Fort.
The emotions of the Red Fort should be reflected from the bottom of 125 crore people.
Several people are planning on holidays.
Awareness is spread in many villages
A few days ago, somebody told me that Hivre Bajar village panchayat of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and the villagers of the village have approached the problem of water in a sensitive manner.
There may be many villages that want to save water, but after talking to the farmers, they have changed the entire cropping pattern and cultivation system.
They decided that the crop which uses excessive water, it may be black pepper, it may not be harvesting such crops.
Something is easy to hear, but it is not so easy.
But look at my farmer brothers, Immediately they left alone that you should not do black pepper because you need more water for black pepper.
They cultivate fruits and vegetables all over the world, that is, they only cultivated the minimum amount of water that is required.
They have succeeded in their own endeavours to deal with the problem of water today through various measures such as irrigation, rain water conservation, water recharge or rain water recharge.
Well, I have spoken about Hivere Bazar, a small village, but there may be many such villages.
I convey my best wishes to the people of this kind of village for the good work you have achieved.
Someone told me about Gorwa GORVA village panchayat in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
When the Indian government brings water to Ladur through trains, I think it is a news for the world.
If there is a good news from some place, it is human nature to feel that the entire problem is lost.
Since I heard that this time there is a possibility of 106 percent to 110 percent of the rainy season, I feel like a big news has come.
Even though the rainy season is still time, the news of good rainfall has also been refreshing.
But my dear countrymen, however enjoys that there will be a good rain, it also provides an opportunity and challenge.
Can't we even start the campaign to save the village's salt water
The farmers need soil and it helps them in the fields of crops.
Why should we not put the soil in the lakes of the villages in the fields
The soil reservoir of the fields will increase while the water conservation of the water conditions will also increase.
What if you fill stones and soil in empty cement shawls and empty fertilizers and shut up the way water comes out
I always say one thing that whenever we go to Porbandar, the birthplace of our brother Gandhi, we can see various places there, one place is worth seeing.
That is, it is necessary to know how clean the water was constructed at the bottom of the house 200 years ago.
His concern is very natural because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments have come and several schemes have been made, the amount of money has been spent due to which it is natural to raise such a question in the minds of millions of people in the country as a brother Kumar Krishna.
Religious people consider the Ganga as a household delivery.
Ganga is working for us and Ganga is giving us the power to live.
The way the flow of Ganga is going on, there is a pace in the economic activity of the country.
A devotee brought us to Ganga, but millions of devotees are required to protect it.
People cannot succeed in work without their contribution, so we all must become a chang agent for cleanliness and a transformation app.
Repeat this thing, remember it again.
Several efforts are being made on the government side.
Efforts are being made to seek the full cooperation of all the states on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to integrate social and hygiene systems.
Several measures have been taken to prevent surface cleaning, surface cleaning and industrial pollution.
Each day, solid wastes are mixed in large quantities through canals.
In the days to come, projects will be implemented in many other places, which will benefit the people living on the banks of the Ganges.
I feel that there will be good results by this.
I am glad that some officials have told me that the expulsions from the buses in the states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have been successful in the past few days in ero Liquid Discharge i. e.
The expulsion of black liquid from paper plants is almost complete.
This shows us that we are traveling in the right direction and an awareness has increased.
Not only on the banks of the Ganges, but if anyone from the remote southern coast meets, it is necessary to ask whether Siya and Ganga will not be cleaned.
This is the belief of the masses that will definitely succeed in cleaning the Ganges.
People are giving donations to clean the Ganges.
This system is being implemented in a very romantic manner.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
On April 14, we celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, and today on April 24, we are celebrating Panchayat Raj Day.
This is a good thing that is happening accidentally, since the birth anniversary of the admirers who gave us the Constitution of India, and the biggest integrated villages of the Constitution, and the collaboration with the State Governments of India, in collaboration with the Government of India, from 14th April to 24th April, to 10 days from Village to Bharat Uday.
Today, on April 24, I am going to celebrate Panchayat Raj Day in Jharkhand, living in our majority of tribal brothers and sisters, this movement has created a big awareness.
How to strengthen democratic organisations at the village level in all corners of India
How to make villages self-reliant
How can the villages do their own development plans
In many villages of India, various events may have been held in ten days, it may be less than that.
I convey my best wishes to all the state governments and rural leaders who have been using it as an opportunity for the benefit of the villages and for the development of villages in the most basic ways.
There is also awareness among the villages, that is the guarantee of the rise of India.
The foundation of Bharat Uday is in the village rise
Therefore, we all are paying attention to the rising of the village and we will get the benefits of the desired results.
In the education sector, there has been a need for development in the last several years.
Today, if there is one dream of parents in every family then it is necessary to provide quality education to children.
The idea of houses, vehicles etc. is only after all.
This is the great strength of the people of the country like India.
That is why I will apply to all the parents and take a broader and short time to discuss the practices of schools.
If something gets up in mind, go to school and sell it to the teachers.
This awareness must be the path of reducing the problems of our education system and the contribution of the people.
All the governments in our country are focusing on education and every government is making their own efforts.
It is true that a significant time has come from our people's attention to setting up of educational institutions, extension of educational institutions, setting up of schools, colleges, teachers, maximum children to go to school.
In a way, the effort to spread education was primarily achieved and it was also necessary.
But the importance of expansion is more important than that of our education system.
We have done the biggest task of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Our primarily aim is to provide good education to all through the academic movement.
It is true that we have to make a long journey to Kadiya.
But if 125 crore people have decided, then a long journey will be possible.
It is very important that we have to make basic changes according to Sharmila Ji.
Indias Universities can become world-class competing universities.
The importance of education is the same as the importance of skills and the role of technology in education is going to be very important.
I am confident that far-flung education and technology will make them easier to our education, and the results will start to appear to the eyes in a short span of time.
I am talking to Mona Karnawal from Bijnor.
In todays era, sports is also very important for the youth along with education.
It requires a team spirit, a team spirit, a good leader, a natural nature, so that they can grow overall.
I say this through my experience because I am in the form of an Indian ancestor, it has a good impact on my life.
It required a lot of integration.
This kind of dissemination of them has given me satisfaction and they should have a lot of enthusiasm and something to do.
I have never heard of the National Students Force at a time, I know that there is a national perspective that creates a new perspective through these institutions.
In my childhood, I have experienced the benefits, should fill up a new energy in these organisations and give a new inspiration.
This time I have put some things in front of them.
During this season, why should not our youth and all the organisations take a great job for water conservation
We can prevent how many circles, how many districts from open defecation.
My dear countrymen, today I have to talk about the thing that we all have to think about.
I also see this astonishing thing.
You will be aware of the fact that how much gas cylinders were given to the party in the last several elections, the political situation of our country was there.
On the other hand, economists were pressurizing the reduction of subsidies, which led to a number of groups set up, suggestions and decisions on subsidized reduction.
These groups have spent several crores of rupees in operation.
But today, my heart is shocked by the pride of the people of my country.
But if we look at the account, more than 80 percent of these million people went to the distributors themselves, stood in sequence, gave them their subsidies in writing.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government gives some tax evasion, then the government will get rains throughout the week in television and news halls.
Because they are compelled to think of political leaders in a new perspective.
Even this event is forced to think of the economists of the country in a new perspective.
It is also an extraordinary event of the world's economists to present a variety of potential.
It should be thought of at some stage.
It is an extraordinary thing that if one crore families are abandoned subsidy and availability of gas cylinders to one crore poor families instead of them, if one crore families have abandoned subsidy, then it seems to be a simple thing when they look upon them, however, they can be achieved when they believe in the people.
I insist on all the political leaders that wherever we go, we must believe in the people there and say something.
You will have the benefits you cannot even think.
We have to travel in this direction.
For instance, I thought that why should we not believe in the examination values of the 3rd and 4th standard of workers, why should we conduct a direct examination
I also feel that there will be no ticket examiners on some railway stations.
Let us believe in the people of the country, let us do many such tests.
Once we believe in the people of the country, there will be immense benefits.
There are no political leaders and one crore families of the country.
A Ravi has written a letter to me - Good News Everyday, good destruction everyday and tell your officers about a good thing every day.
There is a worst news in every newspaper and the media that is breaking news.
Is there no good thing happening in our country with 125 crore people
A few days ago, a newspaper sent me a letter and told me that we would not even release a bad news on Monday and release a positive message.
It is true that there is an environment of positive news.
Everyone feels that good news and real news should be available to all.
Whatever a well-known person gives special information, however beautiful it is, however, arbitrarily explained it, is more beneficial than that through a good news.
Good news is sympathetic to good works.
The truth is that as much as we are strengthening the good, the amount of evil is reduced.
If we take the fire, the darkness will be removed by itself, and it will certainly be removed.
You can also contribute to it.
Ravi Ji, you have given good advice but don't worry about me, please.
Let us join together in a constructive effort, we can talk about positive things and participate in the efforts to bring positive things.
Kumbh Mela is the specialty of our country.
Kumbh Mela can be a center of tourism attraction.
Several people of the world were unaware of the fact that millions of people have come to the river bank for several days.
The festival ends in a peaceful and peaceful environment.
These events are organisedly achieving greater standards as a participant of the people in the field of programme management.
I have been noting that for the last two days many people have been welcomed films related to the Simhasta Kumbh Mela.
I want the tourism department of the Government of India and the tourism departments of the State Governments to hold a photo competition in this regard.
You can ask the people to welcome the most important photographs.
Definitely do this.
When the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh met me, he told me that special attention was paid to cleanliness.
Cleanliness is not only during this festival but also aims to put the idea of cleanliness in their minds.
While I acknowledge that the Kumbh Mela is a festival related to spirituality, I think that it can also become a social opportunity.
We can utilize Kumbh Mela on how we can enhance our love on water, how we can commemorate water and the news related to water storage.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
I feel that you will speak to me but I want to dedicate your thoughts and expressions to the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have remembered that last time I had spoken about a book on the stories of Bremchand and whoever has to read it, share your ideas through the Narendra Modi App.
A large number of people have presented their views on the books written about science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and lifestyle.
Some others are asking me to talk about many other books.
I will definitely talk about some other books.
But now I have to acknowledge that I do not have enough time to read more books.
But I feel that we have to take forward the experience we have received in the last one month.
Friends, I feel like the fact that I have touched the voice of mind about water conservation. But even before this, I feel like a matter of water conservation that touches your hearts is the most favorite thing for the common man.
For a few days, it is a matter of water that the entire country has been benefitted.
Several strivings are being made to affect water conservation across the country.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
The media have been suppressing several innovative movements related to water security.
I am happy to note that Meghalaya, the most beautiful state of the Northeast, has created a water policy for itself and has created a water policy.
I convey my best wishes to the state government.
In Haryana, low water consumption and farmers are being encouraged to facilitate crops.
Why should we not use these festivals for water conservation
Friends, Some things in life fill us with enthusiasm
And especially the achievements of the children, their successes, give us enthusiasm and new energy.
The things that I say now can gather you pride and enthusiasm.
We all know how complications can be made in the world, a word of cancer.
While standing in the gates of death, these ten children have not only rushed to cancer in their struggle of Live Sawa but have also praised the name of the country due to their wonderful activity.
This month, World Children's Winners Games World Children's Victory Competitions took place in Moscow.
In this case, competitions such as shooting, swimming, drive, telephone and table tennis were organised.
These ten winners of our country have won medals in this medal and some of them have won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that the success of India's success in space crossing the Chandrayaan 2 heaven will give you compassion and pride.
Sanjeev Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, B.
Many such as Arvind Rao, from different parts of the country, the Narendra Modi App and MyGov have asked them to talk about this Chandrayaan 2 in the voice of mind.
In terms of space, India has to say the year 2019 as the most beautiful year.
Our scientists have applied A-Sat in March, after which Chandrayaan 2.
We could not talk much about the important issue of A-Sat in the electoral process.
But the A-Sat missile is about 300 km above the earth in just 3 minutes.
On the 22nd of July, the whole country was gloriously happy to see that Bong Chandrayaan 2 was scrutiny.
This goal of Chandrayaan 2 is important in various correspondences.
Chandrayaan 2 will further illustrate our understanding of the moon.
Even in our life, we have to face temporary recessions
Today, through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I will invite the youngsters to participate in this quiz.
The knowledge of space, Indias space programme and scientific technologies will be the audience of the competition.
For example, what has to be done in the rocket launch, how the satellites are roaming around, what is the information we get from the satellite, what is the A-Sat.
This competition will be reported on the MyGov website on the first day of August.
I invite my young friends and student wealth...
I appeal to all the schools, parents and enthusiastic teachers to work hard to achieve your school.
I inspire all the students to join them.
The most interesting thing is that the Government of India will take the maximum number of students in each state to Sriharikota at its own cost.
In the month of September, they will also get the opportunity to see the sight of the Chandrayaan landscape.
Our Mann Ki Baat has accelerated the cleanliness movement at times
Similarly, efforts being made for cleanliness are also inspiring to the voice of mind.
Today, the journey that started five years ago has been set up with the help of everyones contribution and has set up new scales for cleanliness.
I have not said that we have achieved the ideals of cleanliness, but from the habit of defecating in the open, the success of cleaning up to public leaves is the strength of the commitment of 130 crore people.
But we're not going to stop with this.
This movement is now moving from the filthless to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I had to know about Yogesh Cheney and his team.
Yogesh Chinany is an engineer who has been working in the US and has returned to serve the mother of India.
A few days ago, he made a challenge to not only clean Delhi but also to make Delhi beautiful.
He started his work in collaboration with his team from the cupboard in Lodhi Cordon.
You might remember how the roads of Prayag Raj have been painted on the Kumbh Mela.
I also knew that Yogesh Cheney and his team had shown his hand there.
We are also experienced in the beauty of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
It is important that the principle of wealth from waste should be strengthened in our society and it should be our culture.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I had read an interesting idea in MyGov.
Mohammad Aslam, who lives in the Shopian region of Jammu and Kashmir, has registered this.
I like Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to note that I have contributed positively to the village Return programme in Jammu and Kashmir in my state.
The programme was organised in June.
I think this will be the first action plan to direct the people with the government.
Many more things have been added to make this project more interesting.
As per the Khelo India scheme, sports competitions were conducted for children.
They were awarded sports equipment, workshops for Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment, Scheduled Tribes Certificates.
In a way, this organisation is the festival of development, the festival of public participation and the festival of public awareness.
A large number of people have participated in this development festival of Kashmir.
While it is a matter of joy that the programme for the return of the village was done in the interior villages, the government officials climbed to such far-flung villages and took a two-day journey.
The officers also visited the border areas of Shobian, Pulvama, Kulgaon and Anantnag districts without any fear.
The welcome given to them was so impressed by many officers that they had spent more than two days in these villages.
It is comfortable to organize rural council meetings in these areas, ensuring a large number of peoples participation and setting up of their own schemes.
New commitment, new enthusiasm, wonderful results.
It also makes it clear that whoever seeks to sow barriers and humility in the journey of development has never succeeded in their atrocities.
My heartfelt countrymen, how do you know how Ramachandra Bendre, who has been awarded the Gyanpeeth Award, has written in a poem about the pride of poetry
People from different cultures and languages all over India are happy to celebrate the month of their own.
If we look around us in this season, the earth will be seen as if some cow slaughtered on him.
There is a new energy emerging from all sides.
During this sacred month, many devotees take care of Amarnath Puni, many are eating and waiting for festivals like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami with great enthusiasm.
This time Raksha Bandhan is also coming out of the love of brothers and sisters.
When we talk about the monthly period, you will be happy to know that this time more than four years devotees have participated in the Amarnath Yatra.
Since 1st July, more than 3 lakh devotees have visited the sacred Amarnath cave.
More than the number of people participated in this 60-day pilgrimage in 2015, this time the number has been deducted in just 28 days.
I would like to convey my special felicitations to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests after the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
All those who have returned after the journey are attracted by the hospitality and admiration of the people of the state.
All these will be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
It is said that even in Uttarakhand this year Sardham pilgrimage has started and more than 8 lakh devotees have come to Kedarnath temple in just one and a half months.
For the first time since the terrible natural calamity in 2013, people have taken a pilgrimage to achieve such achievements.
I urge you to visit some places of beauty in the monsoon season, wherever they are in the country.
Seeing such a beauty of our country, the feelings of the people of our country cannot be anybody else than tourism and pilgrimage.
May this magnificent month of Maritime bring new energy, new hopes and new aspirations to all of you.
Like this, in August, the memories of the uit India Movement are taking place.
On the other hand, there is heavy floods in different parts of the country and in many areas the people of the country are suffering from floods.
When we see the rain on television, we see only a glance - wherever there is flood, water and transportation.
I will come back after a month's wait.
Today, the people of the Christian community all over the world will be celebrating the eastern day.
Today, when India is singing with Australia, I convey my best wishes to both the soldiers.
India won the gold medal in 1951 and 1962 Asian Games and India won the fourth position in the 1956 Olympics.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been lagging down the rankings.
It is also difficult to say that if our position has fallen in the FIFA rankings today.
Whether it is EPL or Spanish League or Indian Super League, I see that today the interest of Indian youth is increasing on footprints.
The youngsters of India are watching televisions to know more about footpath.
At the same time, we can utilize this opportunity and try to take the football to every village and every street.
The FIFA Under-17 World Cup of 2017 is such an opportunity that in this year, we should try to fill up a new zeal between the youth and the youth.
I think this is an opportunity to brand India globally.
My dear student wealth, you will be planning to go to tourism on holidays.
Very few people travel abroad, most of them travel to every state for 5 days and 7 days.
Some people leave their states and go to other states.
It is a doubt that I am not a district in India.
Tourists have a great power in building our lives and now Indian youth are showing more interest in tourism and their enthusiasm is increasing.
They don't travel on the way, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
I think it's a good sign.
There is also a case in our area that if you bite hands with coal, others will leave themselves.
But it is a pleasure to create a tourism tourism environment with the same coal.
This is just a beginning, so far more than ten thousand people have experienced a composite coal mine tourism in the environment near Sawaneer village near Nagpuri.
It provides an opportunity to see an innovation.
Can you contribute to cleanliness when you go to other places during this holiday
It may not be done very scientificly, but it is true.
Can you also work as a tourist destination in a strong collaboration with the idea of Swachhta
In India, tourism is very backward in comparison to the world.
But if 125 crore people are determined to strengthen our tourism sector then we can attract the world.
Let us try to travel in this direction.
My young friends, I don't like some of the holidays.
Please imagine this point of view.
Would your holidays, the important years of life and their significance go to the destruction of the suitable moments
I prefer a idea to your child.
Can you develop a capabilities during your holidays, can you add a new thing to your governance
If you don't know the swimming, I will learn swimming during the holidays, if you don't know the swimming of the bike, you can decide that I will learn the cycling.
Even today, if I'm typing the computer with two fingers, can I do a leaflet
How many capabilities are there to develop our governance
Why can't we learn them
Why shouldn't we remove our defects
Why shouldn't we develop our energy
Now think about this, there is no need for big training, no trainer is required, no too much fee is required, no big expenditure.
Like this, the interaction will be with other friends.
I am sure you will do this and tell me what you are learning newly.
My name is Abi Chaturvedi.
Honourable Prime Minister, during the summer holidays, you used to say that the heat of summer for the birds and the birds should be kept in a utensil of water in the balcony or the bed of the house so that they can get water.
I was very happy when I did this work, through which I had friends with many birds.
I urge you to express this again in your voice.
He reminds me of a good thing by communicating with the phone.
I was asking you to fill water in soil vessels outside your house in summer.
He told me that he has been doing this work throughout the year, so that many birds have loved him.
Mahadevi Varma, one of the world's greatest poets of Hindi literature, was very fond of birds.
In his poems, I will not allow you to go away, I will fill the cereals, I will fulfil the cold incense anywhere.
Shelpa Kooke of Mysore has a very technological idea.
Have we ever given them water
My heartfelt gratitude to you, Shilpa, you have made a very emotional idea in a very natural way.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard more about Digital India.
Some people can see this digital India as a matter related to the youth of some city.
If you are providing App for the facilities of these farmers then you will get all the information related to agriculture and climate related to your handloom.
The market conditions can be obtained from it by many reports that the conditions in the markets, the trend of good surgeries and the kind of germs will be suitable.
If you hear any questions about them, they answer it or understand you.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to make App available to these farmers on their mobile phones.
We have tried to create assets for water conservation through Manreka.
There may be many villages that have created such awareness in the country, there may be a number of leading farmers, there may be many aware citizens.
I welcome this.
In 2014, there were about 612 crore diabetes patients in India.
Statistics show that 3 percent of the deaths occur due to diabetes.
Two types of diabetes, one type 1, other type 2.
Type-1 is a traditional tradition, because of hereditary and mother-father.
Type 2, because of habits, because of age, because of obesity.
Since the world is concerned with diabetes, it has been established as the centre of World Health Day on 7th.
Our lifestyle is a big reason for this.
Physical work is decreasing.
Can we undertake symptoms from 7th April to diabetes in our lives
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we don't get a medical check up done by putting a problem.
Only after the situation worsens, you know that there has been diabetes for a long time.
Our country is less than the number of tuberculosis patients in other countries.
This disease can be decided by proper treatment.
India should be freed from the grip of these diseases.
But without your cooperation, it cannot be eliminated only by governments, doctors and medicines.
Therefore, I urge the people of the country to overcome diabetes and eradicate tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, several important events are being held in April, especially on the 14th of April, the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country throughout the year.
This year, on 14th April, I have got the opportunity to visit Baba Saheb Ambedkar, his birthplace, Mhow.
Baba Saheb has given us everything that is required to be a good citizen.
We can pay a special tribute to him on his way to travel and live as a good citizen.
We will start Vikram Year in just a few days.
New Year is being celebrated in different forms in different states.
My New Year greetings to all.
I had already said that you can hear the voice of my mind whenever you want, you know that you can hear it in about 20 languages.
You can ask it at the time of pride.
You can hear it on your mobile phone.
I am happy to be associated with you.
My dear countrymen, my heartiest greetings to you.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the eastern festival.
My young friends, you all will be on one side in the election.
An excellent motivation is visible.
You might have seen that India is going to host the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in our country next year in 2017.
What do I say is to insist that the eagerness of the footprints increases, but if such a great opportunity is given to India's gates, can we only make our obligations from intellectuals
I had a request to you last time that wherever you are going, welcome the photograph of that place.
The work that the tourism sector cannot do, the work that our cultural sector cannot do, the work that the State Governments and the Government of India cannot do is done by millions of people from across the country.
The joy of watching all the photographs that they have done is really enjoyed.
We have to take this task forward and do this kind of thing, but this time you can add another one.
Not just sending photographs, but also show your creativity, even when you go to new places, you can know many things.
India is a diverse country.
If you start traveling once, you would have been traveling throughout your life and you would have enjoyed watching it.
Normally we want to be away from coal mines.
When we see the films about the participants, we think what happens to go there.
I am confident that my young friends will definitely help me in this work.
Whether it is government, organisation, society, citizens, we all are working together.
Your governance will be recognised by it and your self-confidence will increase a lot.
They are coming to sell milk near our homes, newspaper sellers are coming, postalists are coming and sometimes the utensil sellers and the sellers are crossing.
Have we ever heard that you should stop their thirsty when the heat of summer is over
Only then can one drop of rainwater be used without waste.
The beginning of agriculture for the farmers is very important.
But we should also think of what is the country's people if there is no water.
You might have noticed that 5 lakh lakes and irrigation ponds have been undertaken this time.
I still remember that people are scared as soon as they ask the name of TB at my young age.
If you want to get rid of tuberculosis then the right treatment is necessary, complete treatment is important.
If half of the treatment is left in the middle then the disease will come back.
Whenever you get time, you can ask the voices of the old Mann Ki Baat and ask in your language.
My dear countrymen, I salute all of you.
In a way, this is my fulfilment of Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
The next Mann Ki Baat programme will be held in 2016.
If you see in a way, you can say that every festival leaves the expectation when the next festival will come.
Sometimes, India can also be said to be the economies that will be driven by festivals.
These are the reasons for the economic activity of the underlying people of the society.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country for the Christmas festival and my best wishes for the coming year 2016.
Let us bring a lot of happiness and joy to all of you in 2016, let us take a new zeal, a new spirit and a new commitment to new heights.
Whether it is extremism, the world is hot, be it natural calamities, be it the problem created by man.
What else can be the greater joy than this, the human society should live a peaceful well-being by getting rid of all these things
Chawley Sawarkar ji is a tourist season, a large number of domestic and foreign tourists come and people go to many places for Christmas festivals.
I welcome Ganesh ji's views that the way our tourist destinations are clean, the spirit of India and the emergence of others will be comfortable.
I am going to bring the ideas of Ganesh among the people.
When we come to the tradition of Atitideo Deva Bhava, that is, if guests come to our homes then we are engaged in cleaning and cleaning the house immediately or not
Similarly, we should keep our country's tourist destinations, centres and tourist destinations clean and clean, it is important to add special strength.
I am glad that there are colors from all over the country about cleanliness.
Since the beginning day, I have been complimented with the media friends for this thing.
Because they are digging small and good things and bringing people to the sight.
I want to share this thing with you that this work is very sacred and this thing is that he has built only 100 toilets with his work in Bhojpura village.
The country is making rapid progress due to the uninterrupted efforts of many.
125 crore people of the country are walking on the path of progress with shoulders and the country is also progressing.
Excellent education, improved skills, increasing employment opportunities
Life insurance schemes for citizens, banking facilities, global trade without locality, setting up of new entrepreneurs.
All of the simple families who cannot reach the banks are now able to get loans easily through the Mudra Yojana.
Nowadays, Indians have started understanding that the world has begun to fulfil the milk of Yoga.
When the world was celebrating International Day of Yoga, how proud is our country, how much is it
This feeling will happen only when our thoughts and thoughts are huge.
And when his mother opened the mouth of Jesus, and opened the girdle of the girdle of the girdle, and said, Who can forget that she saw her eggs there
Similarly, the Yoga Day has made us feel the significance of India.
Nowadays talk of cleanliness is emerging in every household.
Be it a farmer, be it a farmer, be it a farmer, be it a young man, be it mother-in-law, it is also a big thing that the government officials engaged in the work of bringing electricity to those villages have a sense of renewable change in their lives.
I can't only do everything individually
But when I tell you about this, don't I want to contribute to me
Even a simple citizen can join me with an app called Narendra Modi on his mobile phone.
I am sharing simple things in this.
I am happy that even people share a lot of things with me.
Let us join us in matters of the interests of the common man, bring us together to understand the common man, and give them sympathy to get their rightful things.
My dear young friends, on 15th August, I had presented a basic concept of Start-up India, Stand-up India from the Red Fort.
After that, in all the sectors of the government, the ideas related to this were put in place.
Can India become a start-up capital
Start-up Nadia, Stand-up Nadia has brought a great opportunity to the younger community.
My dear young friends, on January 16, the Government of India will start the operation of Start Up Unia and Stand Up Unia.
We have a stable idea of start-ups that the digital world is only those who are in the IT sector.
Keeping in mind the needs of India, we have to make changes.
The knowledge skills of our younger generation are spreading across the country.
This start-up should not be left only in some cities, but it should spread that it should not be left anywhere in the corner of India.
Therefore, I appeal to all the State Governments to take this scheme forward.
On January 16, I will definitely share with you in detail in this regard.
I look forward to your best ideas.
My dear young friends, on the 12th of January, the birthday of Swami Vivekananda.
Like me, there are millions of people in this country.
From 1995 to 12 January, we are celebrating Swami Vivekananda Jayanti as National Youth Day.
The events are scheduled to be held in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th January to 16th January this year.
I urge my young friends to send your views directly to me through my Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand what is in your mind.
Dilip Chauhan from Ahmedabad in Gujarat was a person with disabilities of vision and followed the Accessible India Day in his school.
Thank you, Dilip ji.
Sometimes when we meet humans like him in our lives, there will be a feeling of confusion in our minds.
The perspective of humans like this will be emerged on the basis of our thoughts.
There is no doubt that I have a significance for words.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Swachh Bharat Yojana, I was organised to participate in it.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai, I had to go there because of the severe floods, I could not participate in this event.
Despite not being able to participate in this event, the thoughts related to it were swimming in my mind.
Need for innovations, technologies, requirements, organisations and understanding to simplify schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, accessible vehicles, lifts and braille languages.
They should not be kissed and kissed in the cups.
Whether the schemes are not made for the common man and the poor
A few days ago, efforts were made to bring the benefits of the beneficiary to the beneficiary in a simple manner.
We are providing subsidy for gas cylinders in our country.
Crores of rupees are spent for this, but no account has been filed for this.
The government has made a small change in subsidies to know whether the subsidy is accessing to the real beneficiaries or not at the right time.
By the end of November, about 15 crore people are beneficiaries of Pahal Gas Yojana.
These 15 crore beneficiaries have directly access to bank accounts.
This is happening without intermediaries, ibariso and the possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the work for the Aadhaar Identification Card, the opening of Jan Dhan Bank Account on the other hand, on the other hand, the Central Government has been working on preparing the list of beneficiaries and linking it to Aadhaar Identity Card and Bank Account.
There was a colour of allegations related to the scheme.
The bank accounts of the workers who have worked for money in many places are being placed directly.
So far, about Rs. 40,000 crore has been directly placed in the bank accounts of beneficiaries regarding about 35, 40 projects.
My dear countrymen, on January 26, a golden moment for the Republic of India.
This day is a very charming link to Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary.
We have to take this forward.
Only during the elections, there is a lot of advertising that it is a sacred obligation, it will be written on the walls and layers.
We will talk more about the duties in the elections, but why shouldn't we talk about the same duties in a daily life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, can we organise a competitive competitiveness, poetry competition and talk competition in schools, colleges, villages and cities, in different societies and associations
When 125 crore people take one after another in a sense of duties, then look at what kind of big history will be created.
On January 26, when we are celebrating the Republic Day, cannot we clean and decorate the royal statues of the country's leaders and the surrounding places by the citizens through school and college students
As a citizen, I predict that it can be done.
The leaders whom we are very emotional in preserving the mirror statues, we are then reflecting the gestures in maintaining those statues.
Can we continue to clean up as a society and as a nation
On 26th January, we will join us in this effort.
My dear countrymen, once again greetings for the New Year of 2016.
Thank you very much.
On the other hand, the Christmas festival is being started.
There is a separate place for festivals in social life.
Sometimes festivals are beneficial for wounds and sometimes they give new inspiration.
But sometimes when there are difficulties in the festivals, they are very sad.
From every corner of the world, there are continually reports of natural disasters.
Till now, there are reports of disaster events in an unanswered manner.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is spreading.
State Governments are engaged in rescue and rescue operations in full swelling.
The central government is always working shoulder to shoulder with shoulders.
I am sure that even after crossing all these difficulties, Tamil Nadu will be in a fast pace and will contribute to the progress of the country.
But there is a feeling of a transformation when we face such a terrible environment on all sides.
Until about 15 years ago, natural disasters had been associated with the agriculture sector because there was a natural calamity only with dry and famine.
Governments, peoples society, citizens and small and big institutions are scientific to work in the field of skill development.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I interacted with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawas Sharif.
I suggested that in collaboration with the South Asian countries, we should take a joint operation to be prepared to face the disaster.
I am happy to note that a conclave related to this and a conclave on the best ways to deal with the disaster has also been walking in New Delhi.
This is a good beginning.
I am talking to Lakwinder Singh of the Jalandhar of Punjab.
We are engaged in natural farming and are guiding many people in agriculture.
One of the reasons for this is that you are doing natural farming
I am happy that you are not only doing this but also understanding the problems of the farmers.
Your concern is justified, but this is not happening only in Punjab and Haryana.
It is our routine throughout India and traditionally we are burning the agricultural waste after the crops.
Earlier, we did not know about the evil caused by this kind of burning, so I was also doing it.
Because of this, it continued to grow and today it has been associated with climate change.
After the impact of this distress started to reach the cities, the protests of the people began to shout.
That's the real concern you're expressing.
Our farmer friends should be trained for the first stage and explain the truth to them.
This can save time by burning agricultural wastes after crops, reduce difficulty and achieve the preparedness of the next stage.
But it's not the right regulation.
Agricultural wastes are also very precious after harvesting.
They are natural fertilizers.
We're destroying them.
Not only this, if we make them a small piece of pieces then they can be the guest of animals.
Secondly, if we burn them, the layer of the earth gets burnt.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, think about a moment, our bones are firm, our heart works well, our kidney works simple, everything is correct, but if the skin on the body burns then can we live
As the skin of our body gets burnt, we cannot survive, as we burn the skin of our mother Earth burns, the layer of our land burns.
Therefore, we have to take positive steps in this direction.
I got an opportunity to interact with the farmers who are engaged in the fruits.
They shared their charming experiences to me.
They had to spend a hectare of Rs. 5,000, 10,000, 15,000 per hectare to remove their lives.
There was no work on them until they came to the tractors.
Last time I talked about body donations in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I had mentioned the NOTO Free Phone No.
Film actress Ravina Dundan has joined her.
Organ donation can save many lives.
What else can be the bigger donation than this
The National Registration Centre for Organ Transformation of Organs with details of patients waiting for organs and body donors was launched on 27th November.
I am sure that awareness will spread in this sector and it will definitely help those who need it in time.
Because if there is no one to donate, this help is not available in any way.
I had earlier said that on December 3, we are following the day of Divyangjans.
Physically, physically and indispensable persons with disabilities are immense courage and incomplete.
Sometimes when they are portrayed as caliphs, the mind feels sorry.
Sometimes they are expressed with grace and self.
But if we change our perspective, if we fulfil the vision of seeing them, they will be a sympathy for us, they will be a motivation for us to understand the achievements.
Their commitment, their ability to change their lives, their complications as well as their complications as complications, thirst and immense appreciation.
Today, I want to talk about Javed Ahmed, who was 40-42 years old.
In 1996, militants shot Jawad Ahmed in Kashmir.
But Javed did not accept Ahmed's defeat.
The wounds caused by extremism did not make him crazy.
There was no part of his motivation, and a person who had not committed any crime had received such a punishment, his young man was destroyed, yet there was no anger or anger in his mind.
He dedicated himself to the education of children for the last 20 years.
As a social servant, as a aware citizen, he is making a peaceful revolution today as the sovereign sovereignty of the disabled.
Is not Javed's life enough for all Indians to be sympathetic
I would like to commemorate Javed ji's life and his dedication to him on the 3rd December.
Even though I have been able to talk about Javed today due to lack of time, even though there are illusions of such sensitivity that are illuminating the corner of India.
Thus, on December 3, we are the day to get inspiration from them.
In many cases, we are required to function with governments.
The middle class, below the central class, the under-privileged, the under-privileged, the under-privileged, the affected, the underprivileged, the oppressed, all are constantly associated with the government and government-related organisations.
As a simple citizen, they have a chance to have a worst experience with government employees in some way.
These couples are spending their wealth in the development of the poor in their comfortable life.
The total population of Dendhaga, the smallest village of Balasore district of Odisha, belongs to tribals.
The village that is poorly swallowed is a state of malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, a resident of this village, decided that I will ensure that no one from this village will die due to malaria.
He finished the struggle against Malaria and prepared the entire village to face it.
Any such moments may be in the country.
You should not only read but also recommend others.
The creative power is the greatest power.
Sharing good events and share these e-books and analysis of this.
My dear countrymen, the world is deeply concerned about climate change.
National Energy Savings Day on 14th December.
Several schemes are being implemented by the Government.
The LED bulb movement is progressing at a rapid pace.
On the day of Purnami, I had once told you that the streets should be tied and wet for an hour in the full moonlight.
A friend sent a link to my vision and I got the opportunity to see it.
I felt that it should be shared with you.
He is trying to give light to the poor by using the solar power, fighting with darkness, working with his name and setting up a group of women.
Lander, a solar-driven launder, has been inaugurated by an electrical hub for lighting.
He is providing these lunder lights at a cost of Rs 100 per month.
People take these lights in the evening and get them e-mailed in the morning.
Until I heard, I know that about 500 households are giving such electrified lunders.
Nurjahan is working in the work of electrification of these lunders throughout the day.
But a good start has come up.
In a short span of time, 66 lakh people have received Rs 42,000 crore through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am happy that out of these 66 lakh beneficiaries, 24 lakh women are women.
I had earlier said that Swachh Bharat will create such entrepreneurs.
Silesh Bonsley has made it true.
He is buying a tanker and I know that he has paid a loan of Rs 2 lakh to the bank in a short span of time.
This is our goal of Mudra Yojana.
This was similarly stated about Mamda Sharma ji of Bhopal city.
He also received Rs 40,000 from the bank under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He is working to make a handmade.
Around 1000 rupees per month remains due to lack of interest.
His family also had a good job.
But I want this scheme to be more popular and expanded.
All our banks must reach this with greater understanding and help smaller traders in large numbers.
In fact, they are acting as economic drivers of the country.
They are the economic powers of the country.
We want to inspire them.
The good thing has happened, but it should be done more and more well.
This means that it is the price for freedom to give us freedom, that is, the persistent awakening of freedom is the eternal violence.
The country's unity must continue to be sounded.
But I look forward to more suggestions.
I am confident that your suggestions will definitely benefit.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is going to start.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen, Jai Hind
Then I have got an opportunity to interact with you all through the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the 5th day cricket competition between India and South Africa is being played in Mumbai.
This 5-day cricket is known as Gandhi Mandela series.
Therefore, the interest in the final competition has increased.
My best wishes to all sportspersons.
Today, I congratulate all India Radio's Kannur station friends.
Therefore, I convey my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to all my colleagues at the Annur Radio Station.
I once again want to mention Kerala today.
Dhoya Mary Upper Primary School students from the Siddhi region of Kerala have sent a letter to me.
This letter has a variety of characteristics.
One, these students had registered their thumb map and dressed the mirror of Mother India in a very big cloth.
I have sent the magnificence of Mother India to me.
First, I was surprised why they had made this film with their thumb maps.
But after reading the letter they wrote, I knew how big index they sent to me.
They are engaged in the movement of awareness about body donations.
Around 80-year-old Vasant Rao Suduke of Maharashtra has been organising a movement for a long time.
He said the body part donation should be celebrated as a festival.
Now, there are many news and news coming to me through phone.
Devesh Ji of Delhi has also sent such a message to me.
I speak from Delhi to Devesh - I am happy to note that the government's efforts to donate body parts and the policy plans related to it.
I am sure that countries like China are very advanced in the matter of body donation, and I am sure that the goal of donating one lakh organs of the government is commendable.
More than 12 lakh kidneys, heart and liver donations are required every year in the country.
But in a country of 125 crore people, we are able to implement only 5000 body parts.
Every year it is necessary to give light to one lakh eyes.
But we can give only 25,000 eyesight.
If there is a need of eyes for 4 people, we can give it to only one person.
Efforts are being made to provide guidance to the State Governments.
Some states have seen a good improvement in the efforts to ease and tackle the administrative processes related to this.
I am telling you that Tamil Nadu is the first place in body donations.
A 24-hour Helpline is being served through the number 1800 11-4770.
Even our ancestors are bent on honey temporary Bhujeetha
That is, they have spoken of the joy of sacrifice through the words of Honey Tyakdena Bhujeetha.
In the last few days, Delhi's G.
This surgery was successfully carried out and a life was saved.
A few days later, we are also celebrating the Deepavali festival.
We also celebrated the festivals of Eid and Democracy.
The India-Africa Summit is scheduled to be held in New Delhi from 26th to 29th October, 2019.
This is the first time that such a massive conference is being held on Indian soil.
The leaders of 54 African countries and Unions are called to participate in the conference.
The population of both our countries is one-third of the world.
A million years ago, India and Africa were the same globe, and then it is said that they were two parts of the Indian Ocean.
There are a lot of unity between us.
Indias wildlife and African wildlife can see many similarities.
There is a lot of harmony in natural resources.
About 27 lakh Indians have been living in Africa for many years.
The relationship between India and African countries is in the field of economic, culture and politics.
But India has played a major role in providing training to the younger generations of African countries.
More than 25,000 African students have been educated in the field of human resource development and skill development.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has organised a very important event.
Competitions are being organised in the field of writing poetry and increasing their contribution amongst all the students connected to the CBSE.
Thousands of school students wrote about the information about Indian African relations.
Millions of school students have seen this exhibition, the villagers have seen this exhibition, what was the contribution of Annal Gandhiji in the interaction between Africa and India, all the people knew how his impact was on the minds of the people of these two regions.
There were many important contributions in this competition.
I love a poem with my heart, so I want to teach you this.
I compliment all the students who have participated in this programme, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
On 15th August, 2014, I had mentioned about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana and MP Model Gram Yojana.
After that many member friends have completed this task.
They are fully involved in this.
Last month, an edition was organised in Bhopal.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today held a detailed consultation on the Model Gram Yojana in collaboration with the leaders of the villages, district regimes, some Parliamentarians and officers of the Union Governments.
This has led to a variety of new ideas and incentives.
I would definitely like to bring some things to you.
Jharkhand is one of the most tribal areas.
Unfortunately, it is a reminder when we talk about Jharkhand about Mao militants, bombings and murders.
Many areas have been destroyed due to the impact of the Left Wing Extremists.
But our senior parliamentarian Karya Munda, who is working as the Vice Chairman of the Parliament of that region, has dedicated his life to the tribal people.
He started going there, he took the confidence of the people, tried to give life to the government agencies and encouraged the officers to come and work there.
He established a nation to bring development in that area of long-term neglect.
Besides infrastructure in the Model Gram Yojana, a successful effort to create awareness among the people was made in this Barsi village of Jharkhand.
I convey my best wishes to the Honble Member of Parliament, Kariya Munda.
Other arrangements are being made and they have made a special innovation in this regard.
He handed over a job to the students studying in the schools there.
He urged school students studying in upper classes to study their parents in this class.
In that way, the school was providing education to the students in the morning and their parents in the evening.
The same children were taught about 550 uneducated senior citizens.
See, without any budget in the society, without circulation, without any special facility, how big change has been created only through a psychological determination.
This is the song of the village panchayat of Dwarpuri.
This village is known for production of black pepper and black pepper festival.
Ruwala ji inaugurated the Kalambat Festival on 11th March in this village.
He has attracted our attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I would like to recall you one thing and after the festival of Deepawali last year, the media has organized a campaign in our country, especially in our country.
Your idea is that even after the festivals, however, however we are trying to clean up before the festivals.
Our action should be done during every public event.
Today, I congratulate all the media of India.
On October 2 last year, when Gandhiji's birth anniversary and Swachh Bharat Mission was launched, it was a good opportunity to participate in the Safai Giri programme organized by the India Today Group.
He has been encouraging the work related to cleanliness for the last one year through ETV, and the news about it has come up in his newspapers and he is focusing on creative works only.
He has added 51 lakh children from about 55 to 56,000 schools in Andhra and Telangana to Swachh Bharat Mission.
Whether it is public places, railway stations, worship places, hospitals, parks, cleanliness campaigns are being organized in many places.
These news also strengthens the creation of a clean India.
ABP News Channel has launched a programme titled 'India My Country'.
The people of the country have sown the idea of cleanliness in the minds to highlight the awareness of cleanliness among the people.
NDTV organised a campaign to create a Swachh Bharat.
There are several channels and newspapers in our country and because of the lack of time, I cannot tell the names of all but everyone has taken this movement.
Over the past several years, this village has been taking a pilgrimage of cleanliness and every generation has been taking the issue of cleanliness intensified.
A few years ago, the Governor wrote in the letter that this village has been awarded as Asia's most clean village.
I am happy to note that a village in Meghalaya, a remote north-eastern region of our country, has been engaged in cleanliness for many years.
This has become the culture of the village.
These events give us confidence that our country is surely clean.
My dear countrymen, I had said that when I spoke from the brink of the Red Fort on 15th August, corruption had become in the country.
My best wishes to all my young social friends.
We made an important announcement in the last budget.
Accordingly, you can pay your gold to the bank, as you get interest for your investments, as well as you can get a golden interest stored in the bank.
Now the gold will be in the bank, but the money will be given to you by the bank interest.
Now tell me, people of the country, don't wear gold
Wouldn't the gold that has been poured in an unprofitable manner turn into a worldwide energy
Don't keep gold in the house.
Do not miss the benefits of its safety and circulation.
We will not have to buy gold, we will not have to protect gold, and no one shall shut the paper.
I will definitely dedicate this scheme to the people of the country that will provide security in the next week.
However, we have so far used the golden currency of the country or have been using the golden tables of foreign countries.
Why shouldn't the indigenous index of our country be
Therefore, in the coming week, the Indian Gold Cinema will be released by 5 grams and 10 grams of Ashoka Chakra before the Dhanderas holy day.
Besides, 20 villages of gold will also be provided to the people.
I am sure that this new scheme will create a new transformation in the path of economic development and I will have your full cooperation.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji.
The entire India will be reflected in mind when he thinks about one India, one of the best Indians.
This great man has made a great contribution to Indias unity.
Not only these varieties, but the beauty that has given us pride, it will not be able to get rid of us.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last few years, the unity drive has taken place on 31st October.
I have already got the opportunity to participate in it.
I am told that this process is being organised in different parts and people are engaged in preparation for unity with enthusiasm.
Unity Run is actually a drive towards development.
On the other hand, if you want to say this, the guarantee for development is unity.
Come, let us pay tributes to Sardar Ji.
We will take forward the mantra of unity.
My dear brothers and sisters, you all are engaged in preparation for the festival of Deepawali.
I specially urge the parents to enjoy the festival of Deepawali, but also to look at the color of no harm to our children.
My dear countrymen, the next day I will go to Britain on Diwali.
This time my visit to Britain is very interesting.
There is a special reason for this.
I am sure that this memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will be a tourist destination and a commemorative place when our children are going to study in Britain.
As far as possible, he will learn and live for the country afterwards - this is the message of Baba Saheb Ambedkar himself and he has shown lifelessness.
It is a matter of understanding that many years ago the work done by Lord Basaveshwar for democracy and for empowerment of women.
The idol of Lord Bhasaveshwar in London is the best example of how many centuries ago the ideal of the great people of India was, how far the vision was.
When such an event comes together, the minds of all the people of the country are filled with humility.
Your suggestions have come to me through the instrument.
Later, with your letters, events are being prepared in All India Radio, government officials are being invited and discussions, while some people write about their problems, efforts are being made to solve them.
We need to learn many languages in a country like India.
Though I have learned some languages, it is true that I cannot learn so many languages.
I will definitely try to enter your minds in your language at 8 o'clock in the night.
See how much our relationship has grown.
Over the last one year was completed.
Today we are raising our feet in the new year.
Once again my heartfelt greetings to the people of my dear country.
My dear countrymen, I salute all of you, this is the 12th event of Mann Ki Baat.
There is a great significance for people's power in democracy.
There is a feeling that is based on my life, because of which I have great faith in this peoples power.
But the voice of Mann Ki Baat has learned many things, they have been experienced and all of us are aware of how great people's power is.
Our ancestors have made it clear that Jan Shakti Magasan Shakti.
I can say that with the experiences I have received in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, the idea of our ancestors is a great power and a great truth.
I convey my appreciations to All India Radio on this matter, and they have not seen these suggestions just as papers, and they have seen the expectations of the masses.
In terms of administration, the basic principle is that information should be from the bottom to the bottom, the guidance should be from the top to the bottom.
Who would have seen that Mann Ki Baat would be a synonym of information
But this has become the same.
I said that on October 2, we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
There was a time when there were letters for the country, but shouldn't it be a pattern for fashion today
I'm not too much, buy a little.
I am happy to note that in the last one year, the sale of garlands has played a two-way role.
It is difficult to swallow the subsidy to the middle class and the middle class.
Nevertheless, they're tragic.
Isn't it a peace revolution
Isn't it the expression of people's power
The governments should also learn that the power of the government sectors is more than a massive manpower, which is efficient, efficient and determined.
Whatever I had faith in, after the voice of Mann Ki Baat, all these things have become a pledge to me.
Therefore, today, I would like to convey my best wishes to the people's power once again through the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
People considered the small things that I have spoken as a thing and made them their own for the welfare of the nation and added them to it.
What else can be enjoyable than this
This time, I thought of a new approach to Mann Ki Baat.
I urged the people of the country to contact you through phone and register your questions and advice.
There are suggestions from all parts of India that the invitations are not a part of the country.
This is a pleasant experience.
All the adults have given advice.
It was comfortable to hear some suggestions, and my team is paying attention to others.
You might have spoken for one and a half minutes, but your suggestions and news are very important for me.
The government will definitely focus on your suggestions.
Normally it seems that negativeity is full of negative thoughts.
But my experience is different.
Moreover, in particular, the invitations from the Divyangjans and the visually impaired have received a lot of invitations.
They can't see televisions, they can't see radio.
Bhawan Acharya ji of Alwar region of Rajasthan is sharing a message with me.
I want all the people of the country to listen to the advice of Bhawan Acharya ji and follow it.
My name is Bhavan Acharya, and I am from the Alwar region of Rajasthan.
On the occasion of Deepawali, I urge the people of the country to utilize the soil of soil, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to invite the people of the country in his heart.
Moreover, while using soil absorptions, the environment does not get polluted, it will provide employment to the poor who do so for thousands of soil.
I pray before the people of the country that if we ever listen to the advice of Lord Acharya Ji, the soil lights will be used in our homes, but the light will fall in the family of the poor.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the three soldiers during the time of the democracies.
An exhibition of bravery is being organised near India Gate in Delhi when the war of 1965 was over.
We have been questioning the glorious moments of the war, the unprecedented compassion and sacrifice of our soldiers, not the photographs of that period or the shooting of the films.
If you want to create history, you must understand the elements of history.
History connects us with our roots.
Cleanliness should be our natural and we should also provide the means for it.
I didn't think it was wrong.
I see this well that the Parliament of the country is also engaged in discussions about cleanliness.
On the other hand, on the other hand, what is the matter of pride to the nation than that both the children of the country are talking about cleanliness on the other hand
The movement of ideas is being organised, an environment against pollution has created a awareness about cleanliness.
Do you know what Gandhians said
Once he said that if I want to choose one among the others of freedom and cleanliness, I would like cleanliness first, then it was the freedom of the country.
Cleanliness was more important than freedom for Gandhijis.
Kulshan Arora, Delhi has registered a report on MyGov portal.
Deen Dayal Udayai wants to know about his century.
Even last year, I had told him that the clothes of a variety of fashions may be a variety of dresses, but they should be for dresses.
I urge you to leave something else.
Last time you have almost doubled the sales.
How many poor people have benefited from this
You have been able to do the work which the government has not been able to spend several crores of rupees with a small help.
This is the power of the people, so I once again ask you about this thing.
My dear countrymen, my heart is also happy for another thing.
I want to share this with you.
I went to Kolkata in May and Subhas Bose's family had come to meet me.
His brother son Chandra Bose was organizing the meeting.
Chandra Bose and his family were engaged in this work and it was decided that last week more than fifty families of Subhash Bose were coming to the Prime Minister's house.
Can you imagine how much it gives me joy
Many of Subhas Babu's family live in other countries.
Do you know how much enjoyable it is to me that everybody is coming for this thing
I am eager to welcome them.
We have to make it a habit.
I want the youth of the country to make efforts to join the voter list and participate in the voter list.
In the elections, I am sure that I am talking about one thing, first voter, then everything else.
Everyone should do this sacred work.
Among them, I met a child studying the seventh grade of Kshitij Pandey.
He is studying the seventh grade in Kendriya Vidyalaya, Banaras Hindu University.
Likewise, there was a chance to meet a girl named Sonam Patel.
The daughter of Sadavaruj Patel, who is 9 years old in Sundarpur, Varanasi.
She is a very poor family girl.
But the biggest thing is that when she heard of any sympathy of the song, she abandoned it and gave her English explanation and Hindi explanation.
When I asked her father about this, she told her that she was telling it from her fifth year of age.
He added that this is also surprising to all of us in the family.
This has made me a big impact on you.
Some children have an impression on the popularity, but children have nothing to do like that.
I just felt that God has given her some special power.
It is a special thing that I met these two children during my visit to Kashi.
I wanted to share this with you.
Once a month, you should make the voice of your mind a week, because we get more sympathy from these.
Chandib Ji, you know what you think of working from me
It's just a monthly time.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat has been completed for one year.
Do you know how Subhash Babu used the heavens
In Germany, he launched a blossom, spreading his ideas through radio for the people living in India.
Asad started the Indian Radio through an annual report.
He also spoke of radio in many languages like English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Uru and Pashtu.
My radio broadcast has also completed one year through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Your contribution is unforgettable for me.
My best wishes to all of you again.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
Once again I have got an opportunity to make you know the voice of my mind.
People are celebrating Omam festival in the southern part of the country and yesterday the Raksha Bandhan festival was celebrated throughout the country.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes for social security, keeping in mind the welfare of the people.
I am glad that in a very short time and in a wide range of time, all of them have joined themselves in these projects.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan tomorrow, I had requested our sisters to bring the benefits of these defence projects.
I have been informed that about 11 crore families have been connecting themselves with this scheme in a short span of time.
I am happy that half of the beneficiaries are as mothers and sisters.
I think this is a good symptom.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
About a year ago, we started implementing Jan Dhan Yojana in a big way.
Several questions and doubts were raised whether a scheme that could not be completed in 60 years could be implemented in such a short time.
But it is a matter of joy that all the departments and branches of the banks associated with the implementation of this scheme have been engaged in it with full power and mind.
Even though it was said that even if it was said to start the survival account, they saved Rs 22,000 crore.
The banking sector is one of the major incentives of the economy and has reached the houses of the poor.
Today, 1.
25 lakh bank colleagues are working on the field.
This has provided employment opportunities to the youth.
Now thousands of people have been empowered to take overdraft due to this Jan Dhan Yojana.
There is hope that the poor will get bank loans.
Once again I convey my greetings and best wishes to all those associated with this and I pray to all the poor people that you should never bury your relationship with the banks.
Banks are yours, don't leave you in any way.
We have brought banks to the doorsteps of your homes, do not leave it, take it thick.
Our bank accounts should also be financing.
I am unbelievable that you will definitely do this.
A few days ago, the incidents and violence in Gujarat have lost the entire country in peace, this is a natural feeling.
This kind of tragedy occurred in the land of Gandhi and Sardar, which causes deep sorrow and pain to all the people of the country.
This is the path of peace, unity and brotherhood.
On the path of progress, all of us should stand shoulder to shoulder and we should travel.
Only progress can be resolved to all our problems.
The first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, has visited Buddha Gaya.
I am proud that Buddhist Chairpersons from all over the world will participate in this event.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I want to share the voice of my heart with you.
I have been ready to accept any advice regarding the welfare of the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters, My dear farmer should not forget, must not be afraid.
I assure you that if anybody attempts to guide you in the wrong way, we will not take any action to remove it.
For us, there is a value for every citizen of the country, but there is a unique significance for farmers' thoughts and voices.
We brought an emergency law.
The deadline of the Ordinance will be concluded with the date of 31st August, 2019.
This will ensure that farmers do not get economically damaged.
I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan are not mere words, but this is a mantra.
They are in our minds the interests of the poor farmers living in villages.
Therefore, I had mentioned in my Independence Day speech that the Ministry should function as a field of agriculture and farmers welfare.
We are taking this resolution forward faster.
I want to talk about another thing.
Two days ago, the war ended in 1965 and completed 50 years.
It is a natural thing that whenever we talk about the 1965 war, Lal Bahadur Shastri remembers him.
Similarly, the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan will also be remembered.
Our scientists are actually making significant progress.
Many new information has been given to me.
This is meant for sensitivity and education.
Many young scientists shared a lot of things with me and I dreamt of many dreams in their eyes.
Even in the last Mann Ki Baat, I had said that I should guide our student wealth to science.
I had also spoken of my Independence Day speech about what is the need for direct selection in the following tasks.
When the direct election is called, every poor family and widow mothers have to face issues related to getting the letters of the recommendations, seeking the help of anyone to get the job.
This is also a reason for corruption in the bottom.
I had said that there should be no direct choice under a specific position.
I am delighted to note that the government is progressing rapidly in this direction, suggestions are being made, this resolution will be fulfilled almost almost and the way it will be fatigued as an efficient exam for lower levels.
In today's days, India has the color of international dignitaries.
In order to reduce the maternal mortality rate, 24 countries of the world have organized a conference in India in coordination with the implementation of Call to Action Plans.
For the first time outside the US, this Thinking Meeting was held in India.
Every year, about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die after delivery.
Just as we get rid of polio, we have also been freed from tetanus for maternal and maternal mortality.
The world has also accepted this.
But even today, we must save our mothers and save our babies.
Brothers and sisters, Today, the fever of dengue is spreading.
It is true that dengue fever is dangerous, but it is very simple to avoid it.
My request for Swachh Bharat is related to it.
Even if we see advertisings on televisions, our attention does not go on them.
Even if advertising is made in the newspapers, our children are not paid in it.
Awareness is being made to the people in small matters of households and methods of cleaning, clean water conservation.
Yet we don't care about it, we live in good houses, there are many facilities, but sometimes we don't know that water is stored around us.
I urge you not to spread such a simple sword for death.
Life is very valuable.
This is not true that the calls for the death are lack of attention to water conservation and cleanliness neglect.
Approximately 514 dengue fever detection centres have been set up across the country, where free tests are being conducted.
Timely testing and treatment is one of the beneficials of life.
Your cooperation is very important in this matter.
From Raksha Bandhan to Deepavali, the festivals and festivals will be filled in our country.
Why shouldn't we connect all our festivals with cleanliness
Good registrations will be habitual, right
My dear countrymen, I want to share a joyous message to you.
Headendra Mahajan, Dr.
The interests of our tribal people have improved in the minds of Mahendra Mahajan.
Both of these brothers have made India proud.
This year, these two brothers have succeeded in this thing and have made India proud.
I convey my best wishes and best wishes to these two brothers.
But they are taking into consideration the interests of the tribes of Team Nadia, Vision for Tribals in all these efforts.
Everyone is contributing to the progress of the country.
When heard about such events, the heart is very proud.
Sometimes due to our perspective, we have committed evil injustice to our younger communities.
I believe that this trend has been for centuries.
But my experience was different from the younger community.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth, we can also learn many things.
I have met many youngsters who have decided to make a cycle ride on Sunday.
Some people are following the cycle day that I will travel one day in a week.
They say that this gives me the pleasure of my health, well-being, environmental well-being and youth.
Cycle clubs are operating in many cities of our country and there are many people to encourage the cycle journey.
This is a good effort for health and environmental well-being.
The vision of the youth of the country is also remarkable as the achievement of two youngsters of India has made the country proud.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's memorial in the Hindu Mills land of Mumbai has been in the forefront for a long time.
The memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, who is set up by the Maharashtra government, will be conferred on the visit of Indians around the world to London.
I convey my heartfelt prayers and appreciations to the State Government of Maharashtra, which is trying to create these two memorials to be set up to make Baba Saheb Ambedkar proud.
My best wishes to you, thank you very much.
There is a huge shortage of pulses and oil seeds in our country.
The poor need pulses and need some idea to include porridge.
I am glad that the present production of pulses has increased by 50 percent and I am glad that there is an increase of about 33 percent in oil crops.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to my farmer brothers on this matter.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of July has been described as a successful day in the Kargil war in the history of our country.
The Kargil war is not just on the borders, but every village and town of India has contributed to it.
On July 26, I consider it more important and more important.
After the formation of our government in 2014, we started mygov portal on July 26 in a few months.
I am happy that about 2 crore people have gone to MyGov portal after the government has completed nearly one year and about 5 lakh 12 lakh people have been aware of their views.
More than 50,000 people have provided their suggestions in the PMO application and have spent their golden time for this, and have provided their child to it, it is even more rejoicing that they consider it to be important.
They have given very good suggestions.
But the people of the government have not been able to pay attention to this, but brothers, Akhilesh Vajpayee, the government has undertaken the advice of him and today we are implementing it.
Today, for any scheme of the government, logo-tag lines are being set up, projects are being finished, policies are being formulated and very positive suggestions are being received on the MyGov website.
Now, on 15th August, my suggestions have started coming to MyGov on what I should talk about.
Susidra Azhakari of Chennai has given me several suggestions.
He said that women should protect children, teach children, talk about Swachh Ganga and Swachh Bharat.
This is an idea in my mind that this time on 15th August, you can register your comments on what I should talk about.
Let's send MyGov to the face, write to the radio and send it to the Prime Minister's Office.
It is a pleasant idea that I should get the place in my speech on August 15 from the public.
Definitely I think you will give me the best ideas.
Two days ago, my child went to an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the life of the person who traveled in the scooter was slaughtered for ten minutes.
He did not get any help.
People are asking me on several occasions that you should talk about road safety, create awareness.
Your concern is right.
If we observe the statistics, the heart will stop.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
I urge my parents to make an environment related to the safety related aspects that the administration should do its own obligations, but the child-driven vehicle should be constructed in a family regarding 2 square vehicles, 4 wheelers or anyway.
The government has also made several initiatives regarding this matter, be it road safety awareness, be it engineering related to road construction, be it law enforcement, be it emergency treatment for the injured after the accident, we are bringing the Road Transport and Safety Bill.
We are planning to make several important efforts to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan in the coming days.
We are focusing on cashless treatment on national highways like Kutgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, Mumbai and Ranchi.
According to this, we are thinking about how to get the best life-saving and maintenance at the first 50 hours, keeping in mind the matters related to money or money.
In fact, the cost of every life is basically valued, with the point of view of how accidents are not happening.
Sometimes I say that the workers should be Karma Yogis.
I share with you some of the events that touched my mind in the past few days.
It is a good feeling to see how he can bring life in the works that he knows.
Vijay Biswal has expressed how he can connect his country, his artistic compassion and his strength with his work.
I hope Vijay Biswal ji's painting can be a thing that will be spoken in the days to come.
I would like to express my heart that a big group of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has been working.
Sometimes, some small things are also enjoyable and that is why I share them with you.
There is a village called Kashla in Rajnandka of Chhattisgarh
For the past few months, they have been trying to create a mission to set up toilets.
Now no one from that village needs to spend natural resources in the open.
Even though this was done, when it was completed, it was celebrated all over the village like a big festival.
The best examples of how the values of social life are changing, how the people's perspective is changing, how the citizens of the country are moving forward.
Bhavesh Dey of Guwahati has written to me about the problems faced by the North-Eastern states.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country, a Ministry called DONER means that the Ministry of Development of the North Eastern States was established.
Well, we can't decide the interests of the North-Eastern states by sitting in Delhi or not
Hence, a team of officers of the Government of India visited the North-Eastern region including Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim
This endeavour is a good effect in the days to come.
This is an excellent effort to move from Delhi to remote areas and this is what I call the ACT EAST policy.
My dear countrymen, I am delighted to be the success of the Sevai satellite journey.
A few days ago, India has launched 5 satellites in the UK through its PSLV C28.
Though this news is not one of the most attractive attractions, it is a great achievement.
Sometimes when we raise the question of the younger generation of the country and what you want after the development of the country, he replied that one of them is the most scientific one.
It is a matter of concern that the country is less visible in science.
Under this, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has launched a National Innovation Mission.
I also urge the officers of the Government of India to share your experiences with the students of school and colleges that are near you for one and a half hours a week.
Our villages should get electricity 24 hours or not
Though this task is difficult, it should be fulfilled.
Today, even if you want to charge the mobile, you have to go to another village.
The benefits that are available to the cities should be expanded to the villages and these facilities should be provided to the poor of the market.
That is why we have launched the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti.
Our country is the largest country, where there are thousands of villages and the most remote areas should ensure electricity supply.
Your views will be me favourable.
Thank you very much
When I said this, I don't expect to get such a huge amount of answers from you.
Millions of people, Twitter, Festival and Instagram have sent photographs.
I also retweat some of them that attracted my views.
If some people say that the photographs of Andhra Pradesh (B) Bellam Caves have not been registered, then it would have been known that many people of the country have such caves.
This is the picture of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh.
We always know Rajasthan as a low state of water, but it is very surprising when one sends photographs about Manal waterfalls from there.
That is, in fact, a wonderful thing has happened.
I can assure that Yoga practices are not concealing the sun in the world.
What kind of red blankets the world is enlarging Yoga, when it sees that no Indian is proud and pride in his heart
I was also in the flood of joy and the heart was foolish.
While the Chen river and the Eiffel Tower are very proud symbols for the people of France, they have also chosen these symbols to be followed by Yoga.
The New York people learned the Times Square for Yoga.
When Australia's Sydney is talking about, the Apera House scenes are brilliant.
The Australian nations have conducted Yoga practices before the Apra House symbol.
Rajpath became Yogapath.
In all the crores of the world, a new uprising, a new spirit, a new spirit, a new spirit, a new zeal.
A few days ago, a child from Vietnam had tweeted the photo of Yoga, which was very fascinating, and it was famous all over the world.
Women, men, adults, children, villages, cities, developing countries are all involved in taking Yoga training.
Yoga is actually a factor that connects the world.
I don't know how the world of knowledge organisms will wash and criticize this event.
But I feel a matter of pride for every Indian that the world is keen to know about India.
The world is keen to know about Indias values, traditions and culture.
But if we have the pride and pride of our tradition, then we can make it better for the world.
Sometimes we think what is innovation in this, for example, we can tell our family values and we do not know the biggest thing that Indias family values are in the world.
I appeal to the youth of the country, especially to the youth in the field of Information Technology, that is: Young people, you all should work together on online yoga.
Do you know that there is a field of Ayush in the government
Nobody's attention will return to it.
In five years, there will be news about it 2, 4 times and a small sector in one corner.
But it was the leadership of the people during the Yoga Day.
The smallest sector has worked worldwide.
This is an example of how many smaller organisations can be achieved when the goal is ahead of us.
The world was surprising about how our people rescued the victims of the Eman country.
In a few hours, the world had seen that Indians had rushed to help Nepal quickly.
If we start working in the mind, then the government will work faster and the government workers will work faster and the common man will be finished on the head.
This is my own experience.
This is the real power of the country's progress.
Last month, we had announced three livelihood insurance schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been engaged in these schemes in some way but we have to take this forward.
A thought arises in my mind, I want to put it in front of you.
The Raksha Bandhan Festival is coming in August, all of us can start a strong mass movement before Raksha Bandhan Festival.
Let us all join me and try to fulfil this pledge.
When I hear the voice of Mann Ki Baat, many people advise me.
This time, many people have advised me to tell me something about the rainy season.
Thiruvananthapuram, Yogesh Dhandekar of Nagpuri, Harsh Vardhan of Mysore, Praveen Nathkarni and Divyaanshu Gupta are surely asking you to talk about the weather.
They have also given good ideas to their share.
You might also have enjoyed the joy of absorption in this rainy season with hot bakoda, bajji and soaking tea.
Just as the sun rays give us life, the rain also gives us energy.
Every drop of rain is valued.
As a citizen, as a society, we must develop a feeling of protecting every drop of water.
Water in the village should be used in the village as well as for the use of water in the city.
Whether it is vaccinations, whether it is hydroelectric management, whether it is small ponds or lakes, we should protect every drop of water.
If you want to visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji, then if you can see his house, then you can see that there is a trap of water stored inside his house in which rain water is directly available.
You must see this.
At that time, this amount has been taken into account.
We can do this too
This should be transformed into a mass movement.
The village should be followed by this method.
Similarly, the greenery takes our eyes.
Green life is so pleasant
Trees, plants, gardens, gardens, all these change lives into greenery, isn't it
We all have to implement trees during this rainy season and the movement related to it through social organisations in a big way through the youth.
I give a suggestion from my own experience that this rural technology is very successful.
When you kiss the plant, put an old soil pool near the plant, fill it with water.
Health is very important because microbes are increasing due to moisture in the environment.
Cleanliness is very important.
It is necessary to drink clean water .
Most of the people smoke water in this season.
There is also good deeds.
Whatever we pay attention, we get protection from diseases.
There is a need for water and rain, but it is important to be safe from the disease momentum.
Friends, We are now introducing three new schemes, especially for urban people.
As per the Amrid Yojana, we have set up a mission to make our cities livelihoods.
In 2022, when India celebrates the 75th anniversary of its independence, the houses should be constructed to all Indians.
Considering these three things, we have started a big plan.
This inspired all the fathers to take selfie photographs with their daughters and register on social networks.
In Haryana, the rate of female children is very low as compared to male children.
There are 100 districts of this kind of concern in the country.
This is very high in Haryana.
In some way, we will make the scheme 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' as a mass movement.
You will be happy to see how the upliftment of daughters, dignity and the Safety of Beti Bachao Mission will provide
Have a lot of rainy season
Make our country a greenery
I am experiencing this.
Take this forward.
Next time I meet you for the next Mann Ki Baat programme.
Sometimes, some people think that I should declare the welfare schemes of the government on the occasion of my Mann Ki Baat
This is my pleasure.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine how this intermediate period has passed.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month, at 11 o'clock in the morning, the feeling that something was left out of me, and that is why you are
But I thought that it should be a program on Sunday, if it had emerged.
But I was eagerly waiting when this Sunday will come.
Several people have asked me why I traveled to Kedarnath in the midst of elections.
But if I started traveling in that direction then the voice of Mann Ki Baat can change.
That is why I was stirred at the time of the election stir, the concepts of success failure and the voting continued.
Many consider it a political instrument.
For me, I think it is an opportunity to meet me.
In a way I went to meet myself.
I can't say when to do it, but I will definitely do it because it's your right to know, it's my duty to tell.
Just as the people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I am constantly aware of your efforts to strengthen the positive things.
The inputs in the letters of Mann Ki Baat are totally different from the customer government's concessions.
Sometimes your words are also opening the dust between my countings.
While one writes about cleanliness, he expresses his anger against cleanliness, he also collaborates with the efforts of cleaning.
If a person discusses the environment, his grief reflects
But he also shows his efforts and describes his thoughts in his mind.
That is, in a way, a philosophy of how the solution to problems can be incorporated to the entire society will be explained in his words.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat is like a glass for the country and the society.
It shows that there is no shortage of commitment, energy and skills in the depths of the people of the country.
It is necessary to integrate those strengths and capabilities, create opportunities for them and initiate constructive efforts.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat tells us that 130 crore people want to join the country in a strong and constructive manner.
One writes a letter to the Prime Minister of the country, but I imagine that he has not made any application for himself.
... how excellent the feelings of millions of people in the country
When I examine all these things, I leave your imagination that how much joy I am, how much encouraging I am.
You can't imagine that you are driving me, you're running me quickly, every moment you are imagining yourself to live in me...
I was waiting without this relationship.
Today, my heart is filled with joy.
Inside this feeling, we will take forward the voice chain of the mind with a swimming and mode.
While there was an emergency in the country, the struggles against it have not stopped with political frameworks or political leaders.
It has not been imprisoned between the prison camps.
Every citizen was angry with the mind.
There was a vision for the devastated democracy.
I don't know what if you are hungry, if you don't eat food every day.
Like this, whenever it comes to know about the rights of democracy in a normal life and the joy that it gives it, it is only when a person breaks our democratic rights.
During the period of emergency, every citizen from all over the country felt that something was broken.
I am very proud that India is a surviving society because of this tradition.
That is why the people of the country have realized the lack of democracy and we have experienced this lack of emergency.
Therefore, the country dedicated not for itself, but for the protection of democracy, but for the entire election.
Anything that is far away from our handloom, we ignore the significance of it, we ignore its miracles.
In India, more than 61 crore people have voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
This number may appear to be simple but if we have seen China free from the world's perspective, more than a population of any country in the world have voted in this election.
How many voters voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, their number was more than doubled by the whole of the United States, more than the whole of Europe.
This reflects the vastness and broadness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election has so far been the world's largest democratic election in history.
You can imagine how great things and human resource will be required to handle such a massive election.
This is the result of the hard work of millions of teachers, officers and workers at night.
This is because of the hard work of all of them that this time, more than the last time, the polling has been held.
Around 10 lakh polling booths across the country, more than 40 lakh polling machines, more than 17 lakh videobat equipment...
I leave your imagination of the magnificence of the arrangements.
All these were implemented to ensure that the right to vote for any voter should not be denied.
In a far-flung area of Arunachal Pradesh, only one voter was set up for a single female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the election officers took two days to visit there.
This is the true respect for democracy.
The ballot is located in the world's highest place in India itself.
The poll is at a height of 15,000 feet at Lahaul Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is another thing that makes pride in this election.
This may be the first time in history that women and women have participated in the vote with enthusiasm for men.
The vote rate of women and men was almost equal in this election.
Another exciting thing about this is that today the number of women members in the House is 78.
My dear countrymen, I must have heard of you saying that it is not a bungalow, but a Buddha.
I was asking you to give books instead of flowers during the moments of welcome and pride.
Since then, people have started giving books in many places.
Now one has given me a book called Bremchand ji's famous stories and I love it.
It has not been time for many days but due to his foreign visit, he has got the opportunity to read some of his stories again.
In his stories, Bremchand describes the reality of the society and when he reads, the scenes start dwelling in your mind as a painting.
Everything he wrote is alive.
My young days were shaken in my mind...
Secondly, I touched the depths of my mind, whose name is Idghah.
The understanding of a young man's grace, the clean love that he is with him, and his heart is full of compassion in such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid Festival buys a bread and comes to his bottom, the human feeling is actually touching the summit.
Like this, the name of a film touching the chest is Bhus Ki Rath.
In this story, a contradiction found in the lives of a poor farmer has been depicted with life.
Even after his crops have been destroyed, why is he happy that he does not need to sleep in his field in the winter of bones.
But these stories were written about a century ago, but we can feel that these stories are still suitable.
After reading these things, I felt a different experience.
While talking about the subject of learning, I was reading in some media about Akshara Library in Kerala.
Sometimes, the books have been tied up to the lips and they have been tied to the back.
Today this library is showing a new direction not only to tribal children but also to all.
Gujarat's Wanje Gujarat movement is a successful effort.
In this movement of reading books, all the elderly have participated in lakhs.
In today's digital world, I would like to ask you to put some time in the midst of your daily curriculum.
In fact, you will enjoy it very much and write about the book you read and the Narendra Modi App, so that the voice lovers of Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am delighted to know that our countrymen are also thinking about the challenges faced by the future.
When I was studying these ideas in the Narendra Modi App and MyGov, I was able to take care of how many people wrote about water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belgavi and Siddamsu Mohan Parita of Bhubaneswar, many others have written about many water related challenges like Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf.
Water has great significance in our culture.
This is said about the water in the absurdity of Riqveda - Apohista Mayobuva: Sthal Kaje Dadadhan, Maheranaya Sakshase, Yova: Sivadamoras: Dasya Bajaydehna: Ushdhiriva Madra: i. e.
Your mother is equal to the mother, that is, mother will fulfil her blessings and betray her blessings on us.
Water consumption affects many parts of the country every year.
You can be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water available due to rain throughout the year can be saved in our country.
It's just 8 percent.
That is why the time to find a solution to this problem has come to an end.
I am sure that with the help of peoples participation, with the help of other problems, with the opening of 130 crore people through Jan Shakti, this problem can be resolved by our mindset.
Considering the importance of water, a new Ministry of Water Resources has been set up in the country.
This will facilitate decisions on all the issues related to water.
A few days ago, I had to do something different.
I gave a letter to Panchayat leaders and rural leaders of the country.
I had written a letter to them to save water, to collect water, to maintain every drop of rainwater, to join the village council, to join the villagers and to take care of them.
I am glad that they were engaged in this work and on the 22nd of this month, millions of people participated in thousands of panchayats.
The people of the village have made a pledge to save every drop of water and have contributed to their physical work.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about a member of the country.
The people there have once again agreed to fulfill their positive contribution to water conservation.
My best wishes to all the Panchayat leaders and all the rural leaders who have worked positively from my side.
There are several leaders who have made such a challenge for water conservation throughout the country.
In a way, it is an opportunity for the entire village.
I feel a feeling that the villagers are now in their villages to join the temples in their villages.
As I said, positive results are available through social efforts.
There is no single way to deal with water crisis throughout the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different ways in different parts of the country.
But the goal of all is to save water and maintain water.
The waste water canals of Punjab are being improved.
This endeavour will get rid of the problem of blockages.
There is a transformation in the lives of the villagers due to the setting up of water in Thimaiyapalli of Telangana.
There has been a major change due to small ponds in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
While I was studying about a social effort in Vellore in Tamil Nadu, I knew that there were 20,000 women mobilizing the revival of the river Naga.
At the same time, I also read about the women of the Garhwal region, who have worked commendablely with each other about rainwater collection.
When people get together, water will be saved.
Today, through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have made three appeals to the people of the country.
My first appeal - just like the people of the country have converted cleanliness into a mass movement, let us take the beginning of converting water conservation into a mass movement.
I am confident that all of us will join together and save every drop of water and you are God's gift, it is a wonderful jealous rasamani.
It was said that Rasamani was iron gold.
But you are the same as Rasamani, the sperm of water produces new lives.
We have to set up a mission of awareness about every drop of water.
My second request to the people of the country is that many traditional methods of water conservation have been used for centuries in our country.
I urge all of you to share these traditional methods.
If someone of you got the opportunity to go to the birthplace of a devoted bread in Porbandar, then there is a 200-year-old water conservation in a house beyond the house.
Come, let us create a lot of lists related to water conservation and inspire people to store water.
You all share your views by using JanShakti4JalShakti.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you and the people of the world for another thing.
The Presidents of the world, the Prime Ministers, the well-known and the common citizens of the world have told me through Twitter how Yoga is being practiced in every country.
On that day, the world showed it as a joyful family.
We know that there is a need for healthy and understanding persons to establish a healthy society, Yoga ensures this.
Therefore, the spread of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Shouldn't it be honoured to recognize such service
In 2019, announcing the Prime Minister's Awards gave me an insignificant opportunity to contribute to the progress and development of Yoga.
The award is given to organisations contributing significantly to the spread of Yoga throughout the world.
Japan is organising several institutions and training courses there
Likewise, Ms.
He is not an example of sympathy.
When it is a matter related to yoga, tell us whether India is behind
Years of Yoga are special for Yoga Day to be celebrated with widespread commemoration and honour to all those who bring the message of Yoga to all the houses.
My heartfelt countrymen, this journey has started today, new feelings, new experiences, new determinations, new openings.
Yes, always wait for your suggestions and suggestions.
We are often met and we are happy to interact.
I ear your feelings, I gather, I understand.
Sometimes I am trying to live according to those feelings.
Let your blessings continue.
You are my concepts, you give me strength.
Come together, let us feel the voice of mind, let us fulfil our duties in life on Tuesday itself.
Once again we meet again in the voice of Mann Ki Baat next month.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, my heart is dreaming at the start of Mann Ki Baat.
Ten days ago, the mother of India lost her brave friends.
These warriors have lost themselves to protect ourselves from 125 crore nations.
Our brave maidens had dedicated themselves to sleep peacefully for the people of the country.
The hearts of the people of the country are wounded and shouted in anger after the sacrifice of our brave soldiers in Pulwama's radical attack.
Condolences from all sides about the sacrifices and their families.
I salute all the soldiers of the country, who have dedicated their lives to protect the Mother of India.
The task of facing this challenge in front of the nation should forget all the differences of views such as casteism, religiousism and regionalism, so that our endeavours and decisions against extremism are determined and harsh.
Our Armed Forces have ever expressed the pride and valour of no one to ever.
On the one hand, they showcased their excellent ability to maintain peace, while they worked in the same language to understand the attackers.
You can see how actions were carried out within 100 hours of the attack.
Military forces have committed their commitment to extremists and their sub-competitors.
After the martyrdom of the bravery of the soldiers, the words and ideas that have been inspired by the media have been disseminated and strengthened all over the country.
Mina, wife of sacrificed Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, is also commending his unlimited admiration throughout the country.
He supplied that he will join his only son in the Central Border Security Force.
When Vijay Shorena, who was killed by a three-floor flag, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, he told him that I will work together in the army.
The glory of this pinch is that today every child of India has emerged as a mixed feeling inside the body of the infant.
Whether it is the family of Deoria's sacrifice Vijay Maurya's family, the daughter of Tilakraj of Kankda or the daughter of Hemraj, the six-year-old daughter of Koda, the story of every family of the martyrs, the inspiration of the stories and inspirations is immersed.
I urge the younger community to know, understand and understand what these families have expressed their feelings and targets.
There is no need to look at the past stages of history to know what is patriotism, what is sacrifice or what is penance.
My countrymen, more than my creatures...
Since independence, all of us have been waiting for the war memorial for such a long time.
It is a natural thing to have the affection and enthusiasm of the people of the country in this regard.
He was happy to note that Shri Ongar Shetty, a Udupi of Karnataka state, has achieved a National War Memorial at Narendra Modi App.
I am surprised that no national war memorial has been established so far in our country.
I wanted it to be a memorial decorated by the abominations of the soldiers who have dedicated their lives to the security of the nation.
I am sure that such a memorial must be established in the country.
The second wheel reflects the admiration and admiration of the soldiers.
The valour of the soldiers will be carved on the walls of this venue.
Subsequently, the sacrifice chakra
This cycle reflects the sacrifice of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the soldiers who have made the nation universal for the nation will be recorded in golden leaflets.
Thereafter, the Raksha Chakra symbolizes the security.
There is a sequence of dense trees on this wheel.
It is impossible to contribute to our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in words to the progress of the country.
In October last year, I got a great deal of fame to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
This memorial was also a reflection of the feeling that we should be grateful to our police-sponsored men and daughters who are engaged in security all the time.
I am sure you will definitely visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go to those places, share your photographs on the social web site, so that others get inspired to visit these sacred places.
My dear countrymen, your thousands of letters and comments are coming to me in different ways for the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
This time, when I was studying your ideas, it attracted my attention to Adish Mugopadya ji's interesting idea.
His age is only 25 when the British arrested Birza Munda on March 3, 1900.
Similarly, on the 3rd of March, Jamshedji Dada ji's birthday is also an accident.
And he added that both of these men are completely from the family backgrounds, but both of them are fulfilling the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
In the voice of Mann Ki Baat, Birza Munda and Jamshedji Dada are likely to commemorate the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great men are not only the name of Jharkhand but also the name of the whole country.
The entire country is grateful to them for their contribution.
If a person who is inspired to guide our youth is needed today, then he is Lord Birza Munda.
The British captured him when he was sleeping in a humorous and humorous manner.
Do you know why they accepted such a pride
Because the British who had established such a great empire were also apprehensive to him.
Bhagwan Birza Munda, with the help of amboos in his tradition, drives the British regime that used guns.
In fact, if there is a leadership that imagines the people, the mindset of society becomes bigger than the power of arms.
The oppressed and the oppressed took them to the sun that illuminated from a dark life.
Lord Birza Munda sacrificed his 25-year life.
Like Birza Munda, the sons of Mother India have been born in all parts of the country.
In all the places, such great men were filled with imagination that they could not see anywhere in India as a part of the freedom struggle that took place for centuries.
But unfortunately, the stories of their sacrifice, heroism and sacrifice are not going to new generations.
If people like Lord Birza Munda have made us feel that people like Jamshedji Tata have provided great institutions to the country.
In fact, Jamshedji Tata ji had a visionist and he had not only seen the future of India but also had a strong foundation for it.
He was very well aware of the need for a future to make India a synonym of science, technology and industry.
Because of his vision, the Tata Institute of Science has been established, which is now known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Not only this, he established a number of reliable institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
As a result of this interaction, Indian Institute of Sciences was born.
My dear countrymen, the birthday of former Prime Minister Morarji Bhai Desai Ji on 29th February.
You all know that this day will come only once in four years.
In fact, the peaceful person, Morarji Bhai, is one of the most regulatory leaders of the country.
Morarji Bhai Desai, who presented the most budgetary statement in the Parliament of Independence.
Morarjibai patriotism was at a very difficult time when he was able to lead India, during that period, the country's democratic system was in great threat.
Morarji Bhai Desai dedicated himself against the urgency to protect democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price at his pay.
The then government arrested him and imprisoned him.
But when the Janatha Party succeeded in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his regime, the 44th Constitution Amendment was passed.
Why is it important, the 42nd Constitution Amendment was brought when it was brought, apart from reducing the powers of the Supreme Court, some other slaughters found in it have broken our democratic values, so they were withdrawn.
That is, through the 44th Constitution Amendment, the provision of empowerment of Parliament and Legislatures to print in newspapers was made.
It was for the first time that the President could declare the emergency in the form of a written recommendation of the Cabinet and the time of emergency cannot be increased in a manner more than six months.
Morarji Bhai ji promised to declar the emergency and to prevent the democracies being killed and torn in 1975.
His contribution to the preservation of Indian democracy is great, and the generations will remember it.
Once again I see my tributes to such a great leader.
They are creating a positive change in the lives of others in different ways with the help of their labour.
They are genuinely compassionate, who do the service of the people, social service, and the service of the country without self-reliance.
When the Padma Awards are announced, you might have seen the people who are the awardees.
In a way, I think this is a great success because they are not seen in the cards of television and television, which are away from a day-long world.
But those who don't worry about their name, who believe in working on the ground.
They live in the singing of Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam.
I would like to share with you about such a few.
You must have been aware of the Daidari Nayak of Odisha, and it is not because of the calling of Kanal Man of Odisha, Daidari Nayak ji had cut the hill in his village and built a canal path up to 3 kms.
I gave him a commemorative gift to former US President Barack Obama on the Tree of Life painting built by Abdul Kafur.
Among the Padma awardees, Shapir Said ji of Maratwada was known as the servant of Gasuta.
It is very rare, wonderful that how he dedicated his entire life to the service of the cow.
In Madurai, Chinna Billa was the first time initiated by the Federation Mission of Tamil Nadu for the first time to make efforts to contribute to the oppressed and oppressed and started socially micro-financing.
Despite hundreds of years, he teaches Yoga to the people all over the world, so far 1500 people have become Yoga practitioners.
The famous woman named Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, Jamuna Tudu (Tudu) has done a luxury job to oppose trees and dragons, preventing the destruction of 50 hectares and inspired ten thousand women to protect trees and wildlife.
Because of his unforgettable hard work, the villagers are taking 18 trees and 10 trees at the time of every child's birth.
The story of Rajkumari Devi, a farmer from Bihar's Musafarpur, is very commendable.
I am trying to meet some beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana that is, Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, Over the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have benefited from this scheme.
I can see how many changes have been made in the lives of the poor.
This scheme belongs to all the poor.
My countrymen who are sitting in my mind are going to start examinations in schools.
Various academic boards across the country will start board selections for 10 or 12th class in the next few weeks.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the students and their parents and all the educators who are coming to the examination.
A few days ago, a major programme on Pariksha Bay Church in Delhi was held at the Down Hall.
One of the special features of the interaction related to the examinations is that there is no interference on various issues related to the examinations.
Because thousands of years old culture and traditions are with us.
A few days later, the sacred day of Mahashivaratri is coming and this time Shivratri comes on Monday, a special significance spreads a slight sand in our minds.
I had gone to Kashi a few days ago and I got the opportunity to spend some time with the disabled brothers and sisters.
Their self-confidence was really impressive and inspiring.
When the interaction was being held, he said that a visually impaired young man is a platformkeeper and when he introduced himself as a mixery in the swimming programmes, I asked him who would speak like you.
He said that I will migrate like the Prime Minister.
At the same time, when I had done something, I was surprisingly waiting for me, and he spoke like that, and showed the voice of Mann Ki Baat through Michri.
I am happy to know that people are not only listening to the voice of Mann Ki Baat but also remember it in many occasions.
In fact, I was very disappointed by the power of this disabled youth and they had a great impact on me.
My dear countrymen, I have given a unique experience to join you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
In a way, I have joined millions of families every month through the radio.
When you talk to you several times, when you read your letters, when you hear your phone calls, I think you consider me as a member of your family.
This feeling reflects a pleasant experience in my mind, smells .
Friends, Elections are the biggest festivals of democracy.
For the next two months, we all have drowned in the electoral frenzy.
I am also standing in a candidate for this election.
To honour the healthy democratic tradition, the next Mann Ki Baat will be held on the last Sunday of May.
That is, on March-April, all my feelings of these three months, with a new hope after the elections, with the strength of your blessings, once again I will start the series of conversations through the voice of Mann Ki Baat and I will travel together for several years.
Once again I express my gratitude.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shiv Kumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Sivakumar Swami is acting in this philosophy.
He served for the social, education and economic development of thousands of people in his 111-year life.
Whatever his panditism was widespread, he had an excellent wisdom in English, Sanskrit and Kannada.
He's a social reformist.
He spent his entire life in dieting, absorption, education and spiritual knowledge of the people.
Swamiji was the main objective of his life to provide all kinds of benefits to the farmers.
The Chidiganga monastery is organised in a proper manner for cow and agricultural festivals.
Many times I have got the blessings of Swamiji.
During the Centenary Celebrations of Shri Sri Sri Sri Shiv Kumar Swamiji in 2007, our former President Dr. A.
During this occasion, Kalam Aiya read a poem written for a commemorative Swamiji.
This poetry of Dr Kalam Ayya explains in a beautiful way about the life of Sri Sri Sri Sri Shiv Kumar Swamiji and the goal of Chittaganga Math.
There is a very important organization in our country
This is the combination of our democracy and our democracy - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
This is the foundation day of the Election Commission on January 25, which we celebrate as National Voters Day.
Looking at the level of elections in India, the world is surprised by the nose.
Voting centres are being set up in the elevated areas of Himachal Pradesh at a height of 15,000 feet and also in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
You might have heard about Gujarat
In a far-flung area of Kir forest, only one voter has been set up.
Imagine you, friends...
It is the beauty of our democracy that the entire group of ECI workers goes to far-flung areas to get the opportunity to use the voter's ballot.
I express my heartfelt appreciation for the Election Commission which has been continuously making efforts to strengthen the democratic system.
I compliment the Election Commissions of all the states, all the security forces and other workers who have not been independent and disadvantaged in the elections.
This year, Lok Sabha elections are going to be held in our country
The youngsters born in the 21st century are going to vote for the first time in the Lok Sabha elections this time.
They have the opportunity to burden the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are going to be participants in the process of resolutions for the country.
The dreams and dreams of the country have been comfortable.
If you are eligible to vote, I would urge the younger community friends to register your name to the voter list.
If you are not able to vote for some reason in life, we must feel that it is sad to us.
If we say that there was a mistake in the country then we should feel sorry.
This activity should be changed naturally.
I urge all of us to join the voter and vote on the day of polling, that time we should conduct a campaign and create awareness among the nations.
I am sure that younger generation voters will register their names in large numbers, make their contribution to our democracy and strengthen it further.
My dear countrymen, many times Mahanas have been born on this great land of India, such great men have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
On January 23, he celebrated his birthday in a new way.
On the birth anniversary of Netaji, I had a great deal to inaugurate a museum dedicated to those who participated in the freedom struggle of the country.
Inside the Red Fort, many such rooms and memorials have been closed since independence.
The Red Fort rooms have been converted into a museum with a museum called Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Yaad-e-Jalian dedicated to the Indian National Army.
The Museum, which was set up in 1857 in the memory of Indias First Freedom War, has been dedicated to this entire complex as the Kranti Mandir i.e. the Revolutionary Temple.
Every brick in these museums smells our glorious history.
At this place, the British government prosecuted the brave friends of Bharat Maa, Col. Prem Cycle, Col. Gurbaksh Singh Tillon and Major General Shahnawas Khan.
When I took care of the memories associated with Netaji in the Revolutionary Temple of the Red Fort, one of the family members of Netaji gave me a very special hat.
In fact, the courage and patriotism of our heroes needs to be re-integrated to our new generations in different dimensions.
About a month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman Nicobar Islands.
At the same place where Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose had flagged off the flag 75 years ago, I had the opportunity to fly the flag at the same place.
On this occasion, the announcement related to the Assam-Hind Government was set up 75 years ago.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier, a talented administrator.
Such a brave soldier has contributed significantly in the freedom struggle.
Dilli Chalo, you give me inspiration, and I give you freedom, Netaji is finished in the minds of every Indian by encouraging and inspiring desires.
For many years, there was a demand for the bringing of secret claims about him to the public.
I am very happy to note that we are doing this work.
I don't think that all of Netaji's family came to my house for a day.
Together, we talked about several things related to Netaji and demonstrated our characteristics to Netaji Bose.
Efforts are being made to improve several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
It will be 26, Alipur Road, Sardar Patel Museum and Grandma Mantra associated with Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
If you come to Delhi then definitely go to these places.
My countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, I would like to share with you an event related to Netaji's life in the voice of mind.
I have always considered the radio as an important media that connects people.
I have been told that this radio station has been published once a week and it has been broadcast in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Pashto and Urudu.
In this radio station administration, M.
R.
Vyas ji's contribution is very important.
The programmes of ASADHIND Radio were very favorite among the common people, which gave great strength to our freedom fighters.
A museum has been built in this revolutionary temple.
Efforts are being made to explain the Indian art and culture more attractively.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum, where more than 450 centuries old paintings and art works are there.
The museum showcases excellent works of great artists such as Amruda Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avainindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai and Sailos Mukherjee.
I urge you all to visit there and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, especially all of you.
Well, what are you talking about art, but you can try to think about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore's excellent works.
You all know Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a composer and a musician.
But I want to tell you that Gurudev is also a painting.
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to his majority of works.
He thought that the painting seeker himself should understand it and look at the information given by the painting.
His paintings have been displayed in Europe, Russia and in the US.
I am confident that you will visit the Grand Mantra and see his paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is a land full of pilgrimages.
Our pilgrimages have given the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and actions.
Chand Ravidas is such a sacred person.
Ravidas ji's birthday on February 19.
In fact, if God dwells in all humans, it is not worth seeing that he is separated from caste, religion and segment.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Pilgrim Ravidas tried to understand the importance of labour and labourers in his entire life through his messages.
It is not supreme if he said that he had raised the truth of the importance of labour to the world.
Once again I recall the sacred Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, in MyGov, Kiren Sidhar ji has asked him to talk about the aspects related to the Indian space sector and its future.
Vikram Sarabhai has contributed significantly to the space programme of India.
Our space programme consists of the contribution of innumerable young scientists of the country.
It is a matter of heartening that the satellites and soundingrockets developed by our students are carrying out space.
The same month, on 24th January, the Kalamsad, designed by our students, was launched.
Even sounding rockets built by university students in Odisha have been praised.
In the last four and a half years, such space missions have been conducted from the country's independence to 2014.
We have achieved 104 satellites in space in one space space.
We will soon register Indias stake in Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is making space technological uses in a very special way for the protection of livelihoods.
Satellite technology is providing significant assistance in the field of humidity, rail and road safety.
NAVIC equipment has been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which protects them and helps in economic development.
We have been utilising space technology in a special way to ensure that the government is serving and responsible.
Under the Housing for All, about 40 lakh households have been provided in 23 states.
Moreover, Geo-Dack has also made about three and a half crore assets under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme.
Our satellites today are symbols of the growing power of the country.
It is because of its contribution that we have established a special relationship with many countries of the world.
There is a unique attempt to call South Asia satellites, which gives the pride of development to our neighbouring friendly countries.
India is not only of the developing countries but also of the developing countries through its specially competitive Application Services.
The heavens and the heavens have always been attractive to the children.
Our space programme provides opportunities and opportunities to move forward across the borders, seeing what is impossible so far.
Our children are attracted by artificials and are inspiring to find new stars and provide a vision.
My dear countrymen, I always say that whoever plays, they grow, blossom, this time, the sportspersons in Kellow India have illuminated.
In January, about 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 sports games in the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
If the sportsperson works well at the local level, he can understand the most important activity in the world.
This time, the sportspersons from all the states in Kellow India showcased their talent.
He lives in a bush with his family.
Like him, Captain Sonali Helvey of the Kabdik Committee of Maharashtra, lives in Sadra for a 21-year-old women.
He has lost his father at the youngest age, and his brother and his mother have inspired and encouraged Sonali.
We have seen in many times that women are not very inspired in sports like Kabadi.
But all these were chosen by Sonali Kabdi and he worked well.
Abinav Shah, a 10-year-old ASNSOL, has been proud of winning a gold medal at the youngest age in the games of Kellow India Youth.
The daughter of a farmer of Karnataka, Akshta Vaswani Kamti, has won a gold medal in the sweets.
His father is a farmer from Belgaum.
But didn't you hear about the competing to shine toilets
More than 50 lakh toilets have been participating in this unique competition that took place for nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is a clean beautiful toilet.
While people have kept their toilets clean, beauty and smoothly, some paintings have been used, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, a lot of pictures related to clean beautiful toilets are seen on social networks.
I urge all Panchayat leaders and rural leaders to take the leadership of such a movement in your Panchayat.
Definitely share the picture of your clean beautiful toilets with MyizatGhar on the social network.
Friends, Together with the aim of cleaning the nation and getting rid of the habit of defecation in the open, we have made a memorable journey on October 2, 2014.
Today, due to the collaboration of the people of India, we are moving forward in the direction of getting rid of the habit of open defecation before 2nd October, 2019, that is why we can dedicate to him on the 150th birth anniversary of the bread.
The contribution of Mann Ki Baat lovers in this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat is also very important for this thing that when I share this thing with happiness, more than 5 lakh villages and 600 districts have been announced that they have been freed from the habit of open defecation.
My little friends, the days of examination are coming closer.
I have been asking Ansul Sharma MyGov, who lives in Himachal Pradesh, to talk about examinations and exam workers.
My gratitude to you, Anshul ji, for introducing this thing.
Yes, the first phase of the year is selected for many families.
The students, their parents and teachers are all in the field of examination related activities.
Moreover, this time, students from all over the country are also participating in the event.
I am talking about all aspects related to the examinations in this Pariksha Bay Church, particularly with our young friends about the unconscious examination.
For this, I have been asking many people to send inputs and comments.
I am happy that a large number of people are shared their views in MyGov.
I will definitely present some of these ideas and suggestions during the Down Hall programme.
You must participate in this program...
You can also see its direct broadcast through social media and Namo App.
May this 2019 visit proceed successfully.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018

Jayachandran joined God.
People say that he was trying to treat patients at any time.
Like this, Sulakiti Nasamma from Karnataka also joined God on December 25.
Sulakiti Nasramma was helpful in delivery to pregnant mothers.
He has served thousands of mothers in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
At the beginning of this year, he was honored with Padmashree Award.
While talking about healthcare, I would like to talk about the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some of our party members told me that some young doctors were camping in the city and providing free treatment to the poor.
Every month many poor patients are benefiting from this camp.
The enthusiasm of these medical friends who are engaged in service with selfless feelings is really commendable.
Today, I am very proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful movement because of social efforts.
A few days ago, some people have told me that at Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people have joined the Swachhta movement at the same time.
All the people of Jabalpur were very excited to participate in this palace of cleanliness including municipality, NGOs, students of schools and colleges.

There is a special significance for sports in all communities.
While playing, the minds of those who see it are full of energy.

But sometimes there are bigger things than the sports world in the background.
I want to tell you about a girl from Kashmir, Hanya Nisar, who has won a gold medal in the Karatte competition in Korea.
Hanaya, a 12-year-old girl, belongs to Anantnag in Kashmir.
Karate was trained due to the hard work and hard work of Hanaya, and he made it smooth and accomplished.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for his future to be bright.
Many congratulations and good wishes to Hanaya.
Like him, there have been a lot of news in the media about another 16-year-old girl Rajni and you must have read.
Rajni has won a Gold medal in the Youth category for women.
When Rajani won the medal, he immediately went to a nearby milk shop and drank a cup of milk.
After that, Rajani roamed his medal in a cloth and put it in his bag.
Yeah, why did Rajni drink a cup of milk, all of you think, right
He did this to pay homage to his father, Jasmer Singh, who is selling luxury in a shop in Paniba.
Rajani later told that his father had sacrificed this situation and suffered many difficulties.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
This year, a young 20-year-old girl from Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni, was the first Asian woman who was fastest in the cycling world.
He travelled about 300 km per day to 159 days.
His indiscriminate interest in cycling is really appreciable.
Doesn't we imagine when these achievements are heard about such successes
The names of all these festivals may be different, but it is a feeling of celebrating everything that these festivals are in some way connected with harvesting and swimming, which are associated with the farmers, which are connected with the villages and crops.
During this time, the time for sunrise and sunrise is going to enter the rope.
After that gradually starts to grow in the day and starts to harvesting cold crops.
My best wishes to our farmer brothers and sisters.

Sharing your photographs during these festivals, so that everyone can enjoy the diversity of India and the beauty of its culture.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela is a great dimension, and it is all sorrowful that is full of God.
People from all over the country and from all over the world come and join Kumbh Mela.
In Kumbh, people come to the sea with faith and faith.
At the same time, millions of people from all over the country join together.
The tradition of Kumbh Mela is enjoyed in our great cultural wood.

This gives the opportunity to the youth especially to be a great learning experience.
I had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I was able to see that arrangements for Kumbh Mela were being made very critical.
The people of Prayagraj are very excited about the Kumbh Mela.
There, I dedicated the Integrated Command and Control Centre to the people.
There will be difficulty in organisations and it will reach remote areas.
This time, after the sacred bath at the Bhakta Sangam, a holy sight of Akshayavad can also be done.
This Akshayavat, a symbol of the faith of the people, has been blocked in the fort for thousands of years so that even if the devotees wanted it, it could not be seen.
Now the doors of Akshayavat have been opened for all.
This spiritual Kumbh should be the fame of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith be the palace of the nation.
Whether it is the fame of nation unity and this Kumbh of devotees is the fame of the world tourists.
There was a connection to the devotional Bapu with South Africa.

This is where he used to pursue the way for his Satyagraha philosophy and struggle.

Their aims will inspire us to create a lovely, compassionate society.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, there was a meeting of the Director General of Police in Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where there were economic discussions with the senior officers of the country's police.

Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the nation.
He was always involved in building the unity of India.
Sardar Patel thought that he had the power of India to see unity in diversity.
We can pay tributes to Sardar Patel ji through this award.
My dear countrymen, on the 13th of January, the holy birthday of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Govind Singh ji was born in Patna.
Until a large part of his life, his actions were in North India, and he joined the Nanded of Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna and the actions are in North India and the last moments of life in Nanded.
In a way, the whole of India has received his blessings.
The courage to fight for justice was received from Guru Gobind Singh and Sikh Gurus.
But whenever efforts were made to crush the voices of the poor and the weak, injustice were made against them, Guru Gobind Singh gave a voice to the poor and the weak, he said, 'Sawa Lak se Ak Ladaum, sidion Son Baj Dhudaum, Dabe Gobind Singh Nama Kahum.
He will say, "Modi cannot express his power to the weak.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji thought that it is a great service to satisfy the sorrows of humanity.
He was a gentleman of valour, heroism, sacrifice and sermons.
Besides, Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Samskritm, Persian, Hindi and Urdu were specialists in many languages.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My heartfelt countrymen, many events are going on in the country without much discussion.
The FSSAI is such a different attempt.
Programmes are being organised across the country on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
Healthy India Yatra is being carried out through the mission of Eat Right India and a Regular Food India.
Whenever India becomes clean and healthy then it is self-reliant.
The most important need for good health is nutritious food .
Knowledge of the importance of food is essential from childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the concluding event of 2018 that we will join again in the year 2019, we will interact with our hearts again.
Be it personal life, the life of the country, the life of the society, the inspiration is the source of development.
Come on, new inspiration, new enthusiasm, new mindset, new successes, new summits and successes, we also see changes and changes in the country.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On the 3rd October, 2014, on the 3rd day of Vijaya Dasamit, we all made a journey together through the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
This time, the letters and telephones that have come from you are mostly connected to this 50th part.
In MyGov, Ansu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Patna, Vikas Yadav from Patna, Mohanika Jain from Narendra Modi App, Prasenjit Church from Barthwan in West Bengal, Sangeeta Sastri from Nagpur have raised the same kind of questions.
Your interest is natural.
In today's times, why does Modi interact with the radio in a radio forgotten
I want to tell you about an incident.
This happened in 1998.
I was working for the Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
I was going to a place in the month of May.
He said that he had a lotus kept in a bowl of tea and first ate a lotus.
I was surprised, why did I hear what happened to someone in the house like marriage
No, brother, don't you know
I'm sure I'm supposed to understand.
Behold, you're listening to the radio first.
He was talking about it in the radio.
In this forest area, in such an unprovoked area, a common man is selling tea as his own and asking for radio throughout the day.
That is why I am not surprised at the time of my prime minister, the most powerful media, Radio's milk, turned my attention back.
Mann Ki Baat inspired the people of the country from remote villages to towns, from farmers to young entrepreneurs.
Every month lakhs of letters were read, phone calls were heard, criticisms were made in the App and MyGov
The journey of these 50 areas, which have been connected to the same lake, is interesting and connected to us with this journey.
At present, the Indian radio and Mann Ki Baat have also been reviewed.
Some of the backgrounds are very interesting.
Whoever has been researched, 70 percent of them are constantly asking for the voice of mind.
They consider the creative feelings of the society as a very important contribution to the voice of the mind.
The mass movements have been encouraged by the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
There has been widespread discussions about indipositive.
They underscore the positive sense of the minds of the people of our country.
People share their feelings that the spirit of self-confidence has increased in the voice of the mind.
It is a big change in the minds of the people that the spirit of social service is being made.
But people are not connected with this programme only through Holi.
The people of Mann Ki Baat are making their contributions through TV, F. Emwanoli, Mobile, Internet, Basebook Direct Broadcasting, Pariscope besides Narendra Modi App.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the families of Mann Ki Baat for the change in the form of Mann Ki Baat by relying on the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Your doubt is right.
At the end of their study, this event was also an unpolitical decision.
When the voice of Mann Ki Baat started, I had decided that there should be no politics or the back of the government and that Modi should not be seen anywhere.
The opponents of the beloved were clearly aware of the letters, websites and phone calls that came before every Mann Ki Baat.
Modi will come and go but this country will continue to sustain and will not be destroyed by our culture.
There will be no concealing of the small stories of 130 crore people.
I read the letter, if the same sensitivity appears in another letter, then I also suggest it.
Besides, I also share my experience and share with you.
The movement of Mangaleselphy has spread from a small village in Haryana to all over the country and even abroad, there is no power to spread so much and create awareness.
When every section of the society and the well-known section of the society is spoken in a new dimension of consciousness change, this generation understands and is unaware of the eyes.
India's Andranama is about social justice and social power.
There are thousands of correspondences of social life, one of them is political.
If it becomes all in politics, it is not a good system for the healthy society.
Sometimes, however political events and politicians dominate, the other capabilities and other efforts of the society are drowned.
Thank you for your phone call.
In a way, you have been heard because of compassion.
If I want to answer the question you asked, then it is only that I don't have any preparation in the Muslims.
In fact, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is a very simple job for me.
People's letters are also coming in front of every voice of mind.
That letter is not just a paper for me.
In fact, for nearly 40-45 years, I have lived the life of a saint, I have visited most of the rounds of the country and have spent considerable time in remote districts of the country.
If you want to say the truth, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, it is my voice, but examples, emotions and feelings are all of my countrymen.
Till now I cannot tell the immigration of lakhs of such people in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, but that is why they are taking their letters and their views without disappointment.
I am confident that all of you will come to me more than before, that you will contribute to your views to make the mindset more fun, more fun and more comfortable.
Efforts are being made to make all the letters that have not been made in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to thank All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other televisions and my friends on social bases.
In this way, they have become Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I express my heartfelt gratitude and gratitude to all of them.
I urge you all to say that you must listen to this event in your state languages.
Any politicalist will never be happy with the media, it will be considered that there is a very little coverage and it is also negative.
But the media has made many things raised in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
The media has done several things like cleanliness, road safety, narcotics and daughters innovative ways and innovative ways to transform it into a movement.
If you have no partnership, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Financials, thank you for your phone call.
If you want to tell the truth, I have no secrets.
It makes it easier to understand anyone until the consciences in our life are not embarrassed.
Sometimes, we are talking about the difference between the elderly and the adult age.
In fact, most of the prosperous speaking to the adolescents is short.
I have always been trying to regularly interact with the youth through social networks with special events.
I am always trying to get rid of what they do or what they think.
Through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I am trying to give greater importance to the efforts of the youth.
But I think that there is no time to ruin the youth, this thing helps the younger generation to create a lot of innovations because they think they will speed up their work.
Today, we see that the youngsters are thinking about the greatest talented and big things.
Well, let them fulfil big dreams and great successes.
Some say that younger generations are going to do many things at the same time.
I'm sorry, can you make this mistake
They are doing a lot of work at the same time.
If we look around us, be it social entrepreneurs, start-ups, sports, other sectors - the youth who make a big change in society.
These youngsters are starting questions and are capable of dreaming.
If we keep the ideas of the youngsters on the earth, if we make a free environment to shape them, we can create a positive change in the country and they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram Vinita Ji MyGov, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk about the Constitution Day coming on November 26.
Why is it important for this day, he has also registered that in the 70th year we have accepted our Constitution.
Vinita ji, thank you for your advice.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
This is a day when we think of human beings who have given us the Constitution.
Our Constitution was acknowledged on November 26, 1949.
It took two years, 11 months and 17 days to fulfil this historic work made by the Constitution.
Just imagine, within three years, these gentlemen have made us such a broader and profound state building law.
The rapid pace that they have created the Regional Infrastructure Act is still an example of time management and productivity.
We are also supposed to finish our responsibilities in a time bound manner.
The significance of our Constitution is that it is detailed in detail about the obligations without rights.
It is a memorable event to recognise the awareness of the Constitution Act among the youth and connect them with various aspects of the Constitution.
In the year 2020, as a Republic, we are going to complete our 70th year and in the year 2022, we will complete 75 years of independence.
Let us all take ahead the values of our Constitution, we ensure peace, progress, prosperity - peace, development and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, if you talk about the Constitutional Council, you should never forget the contribution of that man who is the center of the Constitutional Council.
That great man is a devotee.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His Mahabhari Nirvana Diwas i.e. immortality day on December 6.
I pay my tributes to Baba Saheb for all the people of the country and he obtained the right to live with respect to millions of Indians.
Democracy is composed of Baba Saheb's nature and the democratic value of India is not imported from outside.
Democracy is not a new thing for the country.
My servants pay tributes to Baba Saheb, another year.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji was celebrated on 23rd November two days ago and next year in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Dev ji always thought of the welfare of humanity.
He has always pushed the path of opportunity, work, service, compassion and brotherhood in society.
All the States and Union Territories have been asked to celebrate this festival very well.
Similarly, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
Besides, there will be a train on the path of Guru Nanak Dev along with his holy places.
At present, when I was participating in a meeting related to this, I thought about Lakhpad Saheb Gurudwara.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, the Gurudwara had a great impact.
But even today, it is an example that the state government has revived it in collaboration with those circles.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th part of Mann Ki Baat, we met again in the voice of the next Mann Ki Baat, I have got the opportunity to showcase the feelings of Mann Ki Baat for the first time before you.
As much as I am associated with you, our journey will be deeper and happy to all.
The question of what I got from the voice of Mann Ki Baat can be awakened in some people.
Today, I would like to say that one thing is touching my heart through the voice of Mann Ki Baat and when all of them are sitting together and listening to the voice of Mann Ki Baat, the leader of our family sits among us and shares with us about our things.
Your comfort, my comfort.
Your expectations, my expectations.
Your desires, and my desires.
Come on, we will take this journey forward.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On October 31, the birth anniversary of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This year, the youth of the country are ready to participate in the programme of Unity Run.
Climate is comfortable now.
Therefore, I urge a large number of people to participate in unity drive.
About six months before the country's independence, on January 27, 1947, the world-renowned international newspaper 'Time' was shot with Sardar Patel's photograph on the first side.
The newspaper also published a map of India.
But that map is not like that now.
The map showcased India as a piece.
It consisted of more than 550 embassies.
When they left the country, they thought that India should be different pieces.
The Time commented that India is facing various threats such as separation, violence, food deficit, price rise and power politics.
The newspaper noted that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel could be able to integrate the country and heal the wounds in the minds of the people.
The article also highlighted the reconstruction of the history of life of India's iron man.
When the floods in Ahmedabad by 1920, the article took place in the form of a handholding of relief measures and a pilgrimage of Bardoli Satyagraha.
His honesty and commitment was as much as the farmers, workers and industrialists had full faith in him.
Sardar Patel has taken every issue in his hand to integrate the country, as he deteriorates the war through a single-written fear.
He asserted that all the embassies of the country are connected to a united India.
Whether it is Junagarh, Hyderabad, Tungur monarchy, Rajasthan, the integrated India that is now seen is the main reason for Sardar Patel's vision.
This statue, built on the banks of the Narmada river of Gujarat, is two times high like the statue of America's independent goddess.
This is the world's tallest statue.
Every Indian will be proud to see the world's tallest statue in India.
Sardar Patel, the real landlord of our soil, will decorate our airspace.
I am confident that this statue, which has been embodied by the mother of India, will make every Indian proud.
Because it is natural for every Indian to see the statue of unity.
I am confident that this statue will be a place where people from all over the country want to see.
My dear brothers and sisters, We all celebrated the Kalatpada Day yesterday.
I salute everyone who is a part of India's security forces.
I also salute the families of our soldiers.
You must know why we are celebrating this day as the Kalapadhi Day.
The Indian forces took a skull in Kashmir this day and saved the valley from being captured by the occupation.
This incident is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I read an old interview with our respected army officer Sham Maneksha.
In this, Fild Marshal Sham Maneksha recalled the time he was Karna.
At that time the military operations started in Kashmir.
In a meeting held at that time, Feeld Marshal Maneksha pointed out how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was slaughtered for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir and noting that there should be no delay in sending troops and quick resolution of the issue and giving clear instructions to Sardar Patel.
This is why if our forces flew to Kashmir, we can know how our army worked successfully.
The commemoration day of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is on 31st October.
Let us pay homage to Indira Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, who does not want to sports.
If the youth of our country have these capabilities then our country will not only grow in the field of economic and scientific technology but also in the field of sports.
I am very happy to have two recent meetings.
I congratulated them and encouraged all the people of our country to showcase their commitment to ruin the barriers and achieve success.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the Yuva Yuva Yuva Yuva Olympics 2018 in Argentina.
You are aware that the functioning of our youth in the summer Olympics 2018 was unprecedented.
We got 13 medals in this competition and got three medals in the Collection Doubles.
You must see that the activity of the Indian soldiers in the recent Asian Games was excellent.
You must have noticed that I have reflected the word "Every best or indispensable achievement".
This is a reality reflecting the progress of Indias sports sector every day.
Not only the sports sector, but also innumerable sectors, India is making new achievements.
For example, I would like to indicate you to the disabled sportspersons who have won the Gold in the Asian Games 2018 for Divyangjan.
He is a disabled person in the first place.
He lost his father when he was eight years old.
After that, he lived in the house for eight years.
He then left the house and cleaned the Delhi Transport Corporation buses and worked on the roadside restaurants.
It is Narayan who has won medals for India in the International Games.
Not only this, it should also be noted that the sports sector of India is at a rapid pace.
Moreover, India has not won a medal in the Junior or Chinese category in the Judo competition.
However, the Tapapi Devi of India has won the silver medal in the Youth Olympics and has achieved a historic achievement.
The 16-year-old Tapabi Devi belongs to a Kuggram in Manipur.
His father is an ordinary worker, mother fishing.
It's a period of no money to buy food.
In such a situation, his zeal and dedication have not been reduced.
He has won a medal for the nation and has a history.
The entire world appreciated that this competition was very successful.
The World Cup competition for FIFA 17 years of age is a record of the number of people who have seen in the field.
More than 12 lakh sports enthusiasts have seen football competitions in different sports sports halls in the country and have given great impetus to the youngsters.
This year, we have got the opportunity to host male hockey competitions in Bhubaneswar in the World Cup 2018.
The World Cup Hockey competition will be completed from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian, whether he plays any game or is interested in any game, is surely interested in the hockey.
In the hockey sports, India has achieved the achievements of golden silver.
India has won gold medals and won the World Championship once again.
India has also created a number of best hockey soldiers.
Whenever citing the hockey sports, it cannot be fulfilled without reference to our recorders.
Major Dhyan Chand, who is considered the father of Hockey, is famous all over the world.
Further, the Indian Hockey has a long-standing tradition from Balbir Singh Chineseer, Lesli Cladian Mohammad Shahid, Uthamsingh and Thanjabilla.
Even now, the soldiers of the Indian team are inspiring to the younger generations by looking at their hard work and goals.
This is a good opportunity for sports enthusiastics who want to see the most beautiful competitions.
Go to Bhubaneswar and encourage every brave Indian team there.
The state of Odisha is not only of the best historical backdrop but also of cultural heritage.
The people of that state are very bad.
This is a unique opportunity for sportspersons to see Odisha.
The world famous pilgrimage places like Konark Surya Mandir, Puri Jagannathar Mandir and Silka Lake are also enjoying sports competitions.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian male team who participated in this competition and assure them that they are supported by 125 crore Indians.
I convey my best wishes to all the teams who participated in this competition from different countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, the mood of those who worked for social work is really inspiring and encouraged to all the people of the country.
However, in the present new era, the new generations are innovative and enthusiastic with innovative methods that can fulfil their dreams.
I have also participated in the inaugural function of a new portal named 'In for Community' which has been launched to provide opportunities for them to work in this sector to encourage the country's IT and Electronics industry and the country's IT industry.
Their dedication and valour will make every Indian proud.
The transformation that we are not, has created a new eco-system in the field of Information Technology, keeping in mind the society from individuals and working towards society.
Some people give singings to adults
Some people have dedicated themselves to cleanliness and some are helping the farmers.
But they have no intent behind anybody's action and their commitment is a motivational force.
But a person who is sitting on a wheel chair and learns to play a batch can help the Divyang sportspersons who are participating in a wheel chair.
This feeling and dedication is a system of work.
This will make every Indian proud.
I am not - we are definitely attracting all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, when you had suggested the suggestions of Mann Ki Baat today, the idea of Puducherry's Manish Mahpatra was very encouraging.
My Government has called upon the Mann Ki Baat programme to take a philosophy of tribals, their traditions and traditions as an example of natural environment.
He said how tribal traditions can be followed in our lives and achieve sustainable development and learn from such traditions.
I congratulate you for presenting this issue among the lovers of Manish and Mann Ki Baat programme.
It will encourage us to understand our glorious past and ancient traditions, when the whole world is discussing environmental protection and examining new ways to adopt a balanced lifestyle.
Our country is also facing this problem.
But if we want to resolve it then we remember our past golden age and know our traditional riches, especially the lifestyle of our tribals.
To collaborate with nature is an integral part of the lives of our tribal people.
Our tribal brothers, trees, vegetation and flowers are worshipped as God.
In India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the people of Bil are singing trees, Beepal and Arjun.
The Pishnoy classes living in the desert area of Rajasthan are guiding us how to protect the environment.
In particular, they are ready to give their lives rather than affecting a tree.
The Mishmi tribals of Arunachal Pradesh are friendly with the LTTE.
They consider the LTTE as their brothers and sisters.
Even in Nagaland, the LTTE has become forest protection.
The Varli people of Maharashtra consider the LTTE as their guests and they think that the LTTE is with them and reflects their prosperity.
The Goal race of Central India, the LTTE is directly associated with their lives and feels that if the LTTE does not get food, the entire village will become powerful.
The people of Central India also stop fishing in the Kaithan river during the period of fishing.
Those who consider this region as a sanctuary of fish think that nutritious fishes will be found in large quantities due to this confidence amongst them.
Besides, the tribals are also setting up their habitations with strong and environment-friendly natural products.
The companions living in some separate areas of the Nilgiri mountain range of south are building their habitations only with the materials available in the region.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is the testimony that the tribal people believe in living very quietly and compassionately and that if anybody attempts to harm or harm their natural resources then they will not be willing to fight for their rights.
There is no wonder that many of our freedom fighters were the leading soldiers of the tribal community.
No one can forget Lord Birzamunda, who fought hard against British imperialism to protect his forest area.
Besides this, I can still mention a large number of tribal communities who have been aware of how to collaborate with nature and we are very committed to the tribal people to continue living in the forest areas of the country.
Everyone should come forward to express our gratitude to them.
My dear countrymen, we have mentioned about the individuals and organisations that have played a valuable role in society in the programme of Mann Ki Baat.
But all these works are not enough, but they have inspired the deepest feelings of our thinking to show a new way to work for the society.
A few days ago, I read about the farmer brothers of the Panchayat Kurbachan Singh.
The marriage of the son of Kurbachan Singh, a farmer brother who works hard, is going to be done.
Kurbachan Singh has given a definition to her parents that she should take this marriage in a very simple manner.
He said that there is no need to spend a lot of money for marriage reception or any other thing.
He said that it should be considered a very ordinary personality, and suddenly imposed a condition.
It is his condition that the woman should ensure that her produce is placed on the ground and we will not burn agricultural wastes.
You must consider the social strength of this idea well.
However, it shows how high his well-being is, how many families in our society are solving their personal problems to the entire society.
Thiruvananthapuram Kurbachan Singh's family has shown us such an example.
I also read about the village Kalarmajra near Naba in Punjab.
Instead of burning potatoes, Kalarmajra village has come to light by the farmers who have followed the new technologies of swallowing them with soil.
My congratulations to Kurbachan Singh
Congratulations to the people of Kalarmajra village and to all those who do not have pollution in their environment.
You all have been a real way to take forward the Indian tradition of a healthy lifestyle.
It is necessary that every constructive activity and a good environment should be created as the sea is formed due to the consolidation of small drops of water.
My dear countrymen, our archaeologicals also mention this: 'Cowl, we should enjoy peace in all the works like water, air, land, fire, breathing, medicine, plantations, gardens and depths in all three people.
Every soul within me and within you, every heart and this confluence should be peaceful anywhere.
Om Shanti: Peace:
Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be replicated by golden texts.
For India, the first world war was concluded on November 11 this year, a hundred years ago.
We feel that the catastrophe and human lives are over a hundred years since the end of the war.
For India, the first world war is very important.
In fact, we don't have any direct contact with that war.
However, our soldiers have fought with courage and sacrifices in that war.
Indian soldiers have also quoted that if there is a war, Indians are not slaughtered.
Our soldiers have shown their courage and valour in difficult areas and bad weather.
The only aim was to create peace.
The world knows that there was a huge loss of lives and commodities during the First World War.
About one crore soldiers and innocent people are reported to have died in the same way.
This is what the whole world realised the importance of peace.
The meaning of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
Today peace is not just a war but also a global collaboration and integration need to resolve terrorism, climate change, social change and economic development.
The development of the poor is a real example of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-Eastern states have a special characteristic.
There is no link to the natural beauty of the North-Eastern states - the people of the region are very talented.
Now the Northeast has been well-known by their best practices.
The North-Eastern Region has witnessed great progress in organic farming.
To encourage sustainable food processing, the State of Sikkim has received the Gold Award for the Future Policy of 2018 a few days ago.
Not only this, Sikkim has won the award, which has been postponed by the recommendations received from 25 countries.
I express my heartfelt appreciation to the people of Sikkim for this.
I am confident that such festivals will be an opportunity to accept new pledges.
Your progress is very important for the progress of the country.
If you develop then this country will also grow.
My best wishes to all of you.
