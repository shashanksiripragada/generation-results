It is said that light brings happiness, health and prosperity in the life of this volcano, which destroys the opposite and sees the best.
There is a special attraction of Festival tourism in the world .
There are immense opportunities for festival festivals in our country.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is important in encouraging festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something new to this Diwali in Mann Ki Baat last time.

Due to the magnificence of these archaeologists our society is the future of our society .
My dear countrymen , on 12 November 2019 all over the world celebrates the 550th Birth Anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji .
The effect of Guru Nanak is not only in India , but the whole world .
In many countries of the world our Sikh brothers reside in many countries . They are completely unparalleled to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev Devji .
I have never forgotten my journey to Vancouver, Tehran Gurudwara.
I would like to tell you how much about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, but it has to have many episods of Mann Ki Baat.
They were standing at the place of service .
It is believed that the service done by the name of Guru Nanak Goddess Goddess is priceless .
They were opposite to social ill effects like unconsciousness .
The goddess of Shri Guru Nanak Dev had discovered his message from far off the world .
There is no other among those who travel more during their time .
Going to many places , at places they spent all the hearts with their unconsciousness , hearing , simpleness .
Taking good , equal messages they went to all the directions of the north eastern direction , everywhere with people , saints , sages .
It is believed that the well-known saint of Assam Shankar Dev also had a pleasure with them.
They traveled to the sacred Haridwar .
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi .
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev had stayed there .
He also visited religious places like Rajgir, Gaya of Buddhist religion.
The southern Guru Nanak Dev had traveled to Sri Lanka .

There all these guests have not only visited Golden Temple , but also got the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions , culture .
It is my desire to give more support to bring their thoughts , ideals , ideals in our life .
Once again I am praying to the goddess of Guru Nanak Dev .
My beloved brothers , October 31 will definitely remember all of you .
If you read about the work style of Sardar Saheb , then it is known that how strong their planning is .
Thousands of representatives from all over the country have to come to participate in the Congress Summit in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the responsibilities of the contemporary arrangements were on the Sardar Patel .
They also used to illuminate the network of water supply in the city.
Who has been organised without deficiency of water .
Not only this, you will be astonished if you know that the shoes, shoes and shoes of any delegates are not stealing.
They were prepared by contacting the rails , Khadi bags .
At the same time Khadi Victoria also glittered .
Our country has always been accomplished by Sardar Patel to play an excellent role in the Constitution.
On the basis of Kullu , tradition there is no chance of feelings made on the basis of tradition they have done the main task of determining primary hakims .
We all know that the first hostel of India , Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of India is an important Bhagirathi , historical work .
You know that Lakshadweep is a group of some islands .
After the division of India in 1947 the eyes of our neighbouring country are on Lakshadweep .
He also sent a ship with his flag.
Immediately after knowing the news of Sardar Patel, they took a tough discussion without finishing the time.
Thiruvananthapuram has been told by the brothers of Arkat Ramswamy and Arkat Lakshmanswamy etc. - Travel Course will be flagged off with the people and first in Lakshadweep.
Immediately with his country the Trivandrum was flying there , all the neighbours of the neighbouring neighbour of Lakshadweep .
After that they do not want to make all efforts for the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep has played its main role in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I believe that you will visit these beautiful islands , sea shores .
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the Statue of Unity has been dedicated to the world in the memory of Sardar Patel.
This is the highest statue of the world .
This is twice higher than the Statue of Liberty in America .
The highest statue of the world is the pride of every Hindustani .
On an average, about eight and a half thousand people have seen the glory of the Statue of Unity every day.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has declared his belief , devotion to his mind , and now there many attractive centres like Cuttas Garden , Batter Fly Garden , Jungle Safari , Childron New Treatment Park , Ekta Narsari are increasing regularly in the local economy .
People get new alternatives daily . tourists are available for the convenience of tourists there many villages are provided the convenience of homes in their houses .
We have witnessed how a region grows as a world-renowned tourist destination in a year.
People come there from the country and abroad .
The government has played its role .
In the midst of this time Magazine in the midst of this centres of the world 's 100 major tourist destinations the status of the University can not be pride of any Hindustani .

My favorite country , Sardar Patel is sitting in the Ikta Sutra of the country .
The magnificence of Ikta Mantra is like a culture of our life . In every country like India we should strengthen the magnificence of the magnificence of the magnificence of the magnificence of the magnificence of the magnificence of the magnificence of the magnificence .
My dear countrymen, our society is always compassionate to fulfil the unity of the country's mutual harmony.
Seeing our surroundings many such examples are found . In those examples people are seen continuously working to increase mutual harmony .
Any kind of self-confidence attempts to forget those conditions in their own ways .
How many types of words used to talk to increase excitement in the environment .
Try to increase burning sensation in different voices .
Some residents , glorious people do not know what they are talking to themselves only to be famous .
The responsibility of any responsibility is reminded of us .
But this is happening for five days , seven days , ten days , but on coming to judgment , a joyous , surprising change has been seen in the country .
On one side it has been done to increase the excitement of two weeks , but on coming to Ramjanmabhoomi the government , royal birds , social institutions , civilizations , civilizations , civilizations , civilizations , civilizations have been published .
Try to reduce stress in the environment .
But I remember those days very well .
The dignity of the judgement has been recognised with pride, and there is no chance to increase fertility and heat anywhere.
These things should always be kept in mind . They give us strength .
These days those moments , do us carefully .
It is an example of how much power gives strength to the country .
On the day of a big injury to the country .
I also dedicate my respect to them today.
My dear countrymen, today the story of the house is heard from a distance of shores that every village hears the story of the story from the north to the south, from the east to the west, the story of the roots of Hindustan is that it is a clean story.
Every person , every family , every village wants to say his joyful experiences related to cleanliness because the efforts of cleanliness are hundred and thirty crores of Hindustan .
Their fruits are also hundred crores of Hindustan .
There is a joyful thrilling experience .
It is not only separated the garbage in it but also making that arrangement is very important task .

And we shall be of different kinds of torches to Deepavali.
But sometimes salt is called by carelessness .

Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
There is no Indian who is not proud to see our soldiers , our armed teams .
Every Indian of any species , any place , any religion or any language is always ready to tell our soldiers , their happiness , Madhuni .
All the 125 crore Indians have celebrated the Parakram Parv and recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016.
In the Terrizon Mussoorie on our country , on the occasion of their unsuccessful way our soldiers were given the form of surgical streak .
How much capacity is hidden in us , how many soldiers keep cutting their lives and protecting all the countries .
Main days like Parakram Parv reminds of traditional traditions like our soldiers in our country .
These days encourage us to keep our countrys equality and ethics equitable.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
In the two world wars done in the 20th century our country soldiers gave clean sacrifices for peace more than one lakh .
The adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous soldiers of our country .
India is also one of the countries of sending soldiers in maximum numbers to various peaceful Bhadrata teams of the Ikya State .
Our soldiers are playing role in establishing peace in the world wearing blue helmet in decades .
My beloved country is spectacular , sky covers .
On the 8th honey of October we celebrate the day of air conditioned team .
In 1932 the very small airplanes like six feet , 19 soldiers etc . have increased . This is why our team stands one of the adventurous , powerful airplanes of the twentyth century .
In 1965 the enemies of the enemies were also the team of our flights .
The cost of the cost of Bangladesh happening in 1971 is known about the freedom fight of Bangladesh .
In 1999, the Air Force also played an important role in eliminating Kargil from the jurisdiction of cross-borders.
The Tiger Hills ballooned them at night and ballooned them at the level of enemies.
If the help of archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically .
It is marvellous to show them in helping the people of the country by meeting all the natural varieties of carpets in the forest from storm , air , floods .
In order to prove the gender equity of the country i.e. women and male equality they are an example.
Now, our Air Force is giving an alternative to the Permanent Commission for women and I have made this announcement from the Red Fort platform on August 15.
Now India can proudly say that India is equal to women's energy cooperation with male power in the armed forces of India.
The woman in the form of power has also become a martyr .
My favorite country , some days Christian Abhilash Tommi of our boating team had fought with death for his life .
How to save him from the country of Yavat
You know that Abhilash Tomi is a very adventurous ruler .
Without using any modern technology , only with the help of a small boat the first Indian who surrounded the world with the help of a small boat .
In order to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the southern Indian ocean, he has been moving ahead with his speed in the sea for the last eighty days but the terrible sea storm has brought him problems .
But these people of the boating team of India spent many days in the sea .
He was the biggest example of adventurous , consolidation and traditions. A few days ago I talked to him in the phone after saving him from the sea.
My beloved Deshprajala , the second day of October , how important is our country , everybody knows .
This year October is a speciality of two .
From now on both of us are celebrated by many programs worldwide on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi .
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have given the inspiration of the world .
In 1941 Gandhiji started writing some thoughts in the form of a constructive program i . . positive program .
Then in 1945 when he was swimming free fighting in 1945 he made his thoughts every year .
To protect the rulers of the priests , villages , labors , cleanliness , education have kept their thoughts in front of the people of the country .
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
This is the speciality of his personality .
How important is this for the country , how important is the important opportunity of the country .
Then as thy doubt is being relieved, thou feelest as thy ahh is melting.'
This mantra of my beloved country , Gandhiji said that this mantra is still important .
Today the middle class of the country is increasing , their economic power is increasing , the power of shopping is increasing .
When we go to buy something then remember this mantra which he told him once .
Because of shopping this thing I am giving benefit to any citizen in the country .
Who has the cost of happiness in the mouth .
This is his message . I believe that in the life of the poor , weaker person you can change important changes in the life of the person .
It is said that Gandhiji will get freedom from my favorite country , clean song .
As he did not know , but India had come to independence .
For example , due to the production of Khadi , negative products many people give help to the workers .
All these Khadi clothes are also so difficult that they are not ready , they should use each other .
Looking very immensely from outside , from inside the mountains like mountains were determined by Lal Bahadur Shastri .
'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan' is an extraordinary display for the great personality of the scientific scientific science.
At the same time he gave the mantra of victory over the soldiers of his country , rails , rails .
It is common to talk about cleanliness when we remember the priests of my favorite country , this is the common thing .
On September fifteen, a garden called 'Cleanliness Service' started.
Millions of people participated in this park and I also got the opportunity to donate sanitation with children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar himself had laid the foundation of that school .
People of all the classes of the country participate in the labor done on this September fifteenth honey .
Come on, let's call a phone call.
I tell you special thanks for your phone call .
The Swachhta Mantras from all over the world, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Celebrations) will come together and share their experiences and experiments in this sanitation event.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be concluded with the commencement of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu on October 2, 2018.
If you want to give freedom , peace , judgment to people , then it is specially important .
In the state built by Baba Saheb Ambedkar many churches have been done for the primary hiccups of lice .
Inspired by them, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on October 12, 1993.
In some days NHRC has been fulfilled .
NHRC has not only saved human rights . This commission has also been done to increase our pride .
The Prime Minister of our Majijid, our dear leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has clearly stated that human rights are not for us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal source of Vedic times is 'Sarveh Bhawan' comfortable.
NHRC has provided an expansive opportunity for human habits , with which the role of hypnotise has also been done to stop the use of hypnotise .
In this journey of pathways NHRC has made a hope , one faithful environment .
I am sure this is a very optimistic event for a healthy society, for the best democratic values.
In the national level the commission of human habits has also been established with the work of human habits .
This is the basis of the idea of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas' - 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' - 'Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas.
In the month of my favorite country Prajalara , October the Jayanti of Jaiprayag Narayan is the Jayanti of Narayan dynasty . In this month in the same month the festival of the Jayanti of Rajmata Vijayraj Sindhiya dynasty starts .
I would like to detail this proposal in the next Mann Ki Baat but I would definitely like to make this proposal. In the last few years, on the occasion of October 31, the 'Run For Unity' is being organised in every small towns, villages and villages.
This time also we will organise this ' Ran Far University' in every small and big cities , in villages , in villages .
The programme "Run for Unity" is the best way to remind Sardar Sahib.
On October 31, we will strengthen all our efforts to combat all the sections of the society and all the regions of the country with equality.
This is the right place that we give him .
My dear countrymen, Navratri , Durga Puja or Vijay Dashmi , I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of these sacred festivals.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018

On the occasion of this sacred festival many acquaintances of all the people of the country .

Friends, We are also celebrating the day of Sanskrit language along with the conservation of the Shravana Purnami day.
I also express my best wishes to all the people associated with preserving this important heritage , decoration , ordinary people .
Every language has its own grandeur .

It is science , science , agricultural science , health science , scientific science , science , science , science , management , economic science , environment .

With this science , education , students have expressed your dedication to the students .
My dear countrymen, this rainy season brings many hopes to our farmers working hard.
The trees dried with strong sunshine , plants , dry rivers .
But sometimes this rainy season also brings the floods to destroy .
At some places less rains , at some places more rains all the rains are rainy .
The destruction of leaving behind them is unfortunate .
But on occurrence of dangers humanity meaning what we understand .
We all know the officers of the soldiers of the soldiers of the security programs happening in Kerala .
They did not leave any opportunity to save those who were stuck in the floods .
Air Force but not negative but rather army, but BSF, CISF, RAF, everybody has played a big role in helping and protecting efforts.
I want to say specially about the hard industry of NDRF. In such a difficulty they have helped very best.
The efforts made to keep the ability of NDRF , their committee , active decisions have been kept in mind every Indian .
Nine is the festival of Omnam .
To come out very quickly from this danger we pray to the nation , especially the state of Kerala , to give the strength of this festival of Kerala , to give the opportunity of the state of Kerala .
It is believed that the people of Kerala , other places of the country , the whole country were with them once again .
My favorite country , this time I see the information coming for Manki Baat that I have come to me more than one thing .
They are about Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee .
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Soni Pat, brother Pravin from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Berji from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar etc.
On the eleventh honey of August the news of the death of Atal dynasty has been drowned in the world , country .
He is a great country that left the prime minister of the fourteen years Christ .
It is said that in the last teeth he went away from the royal palaces .
People considered him the best parlor of the parlor , simple architect , great architect , favorite leader .
Due to the reason of bringing supplication in the reproductive organs the country of Atal dynasty has been discovered .
We are always grateful to Atal ji due to the 91st Constitution Amendment Act, 2003.
This improvement has brought two major changes in the royal palaces of India .
First change is that in the states the number of mantras in the states is fifteen percent in the number of seats .
Atal Garden changed it .
That is why money has become adventurous .
That is why the work has increased .
These conditions have started increasing healthy traditions in our royal culture .
Atal ji is a true patriot .
It has been changed while entering the budget in their administration .
Initially, according to the tradition of the British, the Parliament was held in London, so that it was in the evening that it entered the market.
In 2001 Atal dynasty changed the evening five times , in the morning for eleven .
In the same way you are seeing the churches of the states , central centres once in the country .
This is a good result of democracy .
Healthy democracy , best democracy , best traditions , reproductive system , reproductive efforts , unsuccessful churches , etc . are also the best tribute to Atal dynasty .
The work of the working in the Lok Sabha is about eighteen percent , the work of the state is seventy four percent .
These rainy seasons in the Parliament are always reminded of social justice and development of youngsters.
In these conferences many important children used to use youth , backward classes have been emotional .
It is also a desire to make the commission of Organisation like SCST commission for decades .
To ensure the powers of the backward classes, this time the country has fulfilled the resolve to appoint an ODC.
It has also given the authority of a state . social judgment that it takes forward .
That is why parlor has entered the difficult training by entering the parlor of parlor .
According to this the iniquity of the infected infected infected infected infected infected infected in at least teeth , twelve girls are discovered .
A few days ago, you would have been studying in the books and a court in Mandshoor, Madhya Pradesh, after just two months of inquiries, the girl has been executed for two infiltrators in the case of atrocities.
Further, in a court in Kathani, Madhya Pradesh, only five days after inquiries, the culprits were executed.
Even in Rajasthan, the judges there have taken some such rapid decisions.
This chatti plays an important role in stopping the unrighteousness happening on women , girls .
When we moved ahead for the country, we can bring changes in the lives of the poor, the backward, the suffering and the vulnerable.
In the occasion of rainy season this time everyone has made a ideal ideal .
I am telling thanks to all the parlors of the country .
My dear countrymen, the eyes of millions of people are on the Asian crickets being held in Jakarta today.
Asia Crides are still happening .
I am expressing my best wishes to all the players for the country .
The bright future of India will be built only if India is fit.
I am telling the guests of Asia once again . Along with this other sports also want to see the best exhibition .
Everybody 's national festival is a contemporary contemporary .
Besides this the whole country also remembers him with great pride , spirituality .
In his memory September is celebrated as the fifteenth day of engineers .
The engineers of our country running in their footsteps have encouraged their existence in the world .
It is called 'Bhunga' in Kutch.
These houses were seen three earthquakes .
But you can see any harm somewhere .
Our ancestors of this house are made suitable to the environment here , naturally .
It has been said pride . It has been told me that before centuries the engineers of that period were constructed according to the local conditions , ordinary people living safely .
Now we should also think about our future while celebrating the engineers destination .
Keep a work shop at every place .
During changing we learn some new things .
What should be taught to the students
Then meet .
In the middle of this many places rains are coming properly .
At some places more rains are also coming to the architects .
In some places today people are waiting for rains because there is no rains .
The opposite of nature has been brought to humans .
Because of that reason sometimes nature feels tired on us .
Therefore we have the responsibility of protecting nature .
Twelve Junior football sportspersons in Thailand went to a cave for their coach tour.
Normally it takes some hours to go to that cave , come out .
But the decision of that day is another way .
For coming out no way they had stayed near a small dip situated inside the cave .
Not only in one to two days , but in the same way eighteen days were left like this .
On the one hand they are fighting with danger, on the other hand the values of the humanity of the world have been exhibited by God.
These children throughout the world were prayed to fall out safely .
Those children who are stuck where they are in any condition , to know all these attempts were made .
How to bring out the water if it is not possible to save them in time then it is impossible to bring them out during the rainy season .
Unfortunately they were safe , all the world had enjoyed peace .
But how this protection program was done in the whole of the conservation program .
The responsibilities found in every level are marvellous .
Government , parents of children , their family members , media , people of the country , everyone has also been seen marvellously .
In this entire behavior a Jawan of Dhayland boat had also lost his life .
It is enough to work on our goal with cosmetic , stable mind .
The favorite poet of our country Neeraj had left us for a few days .
Our Indians can also give how much strength , how much strength can be given to the Indians .
This is the time of the beginning of art galleries .
On coming to July the youth take a step in the most important part of their life where their eyes turn towards Kat-Af from questions .
The meditation of students changes from home to hospital .
Students come in the shadow of professors from the shadow of parents .
I believe that my young friends are very enjoying their college life , enthusiasm .
This is the time when you have to get out of the house for the first time, get out of the village, get separated from a frequent environment.
Many youths come out to give a new direction to their life for the first time .
I say to all of you that stay calm , spend life joyfully , enjoy your mind completely in life .
Small friends are priceless .
But to choose new friends , to mix friends , to keep those friends standing , this is very important task .
Learn new experts , new languages .
The student of Ashram Chaudari of a poor family of Madhya Pradesh had achieved victory over all the difficult competitions of his life.
Jodhpur AIMS Taluku was successful in the first attempt of MBS test .
And his father did the work of comparison to his father , and nurtured his family .
My beloved country people , a few days ago my sight was attracted by two youths associated with the dreams of Modi .
If we read inside then how our youth technology is trying to bring changes in the life of ordinary person .
In America once I am discussing with Indian youths in Sanjoj city called technology hub .
I want them to do something for the country by thinking about how they can use their everybody for India.
Use of their professional experts both of them together , making a memorial ypnotise .
Apart from the people of this village not only connected with the world but they have to give any advice to Gani , information , if they have to get it available in their own mobile .
In a way attempts to bring digital revolution in this Yap village . It has become easy to record , tracking , monitoring the development works done in the village .
The App consists of phone directory, news department, Jabita, Health Centre and Information Centre in the village.
In order to know the FACT rate between the rural feature rails in this app, it is in such a way that their product will be used as Market Place.
It will be a matter of fact that the youngsters are spending their lives in America, the lifestyle of America, the thoughts of the people of America, even after leaving India many years ago, even though they have left India in the past, they have also kept in mind the small things of their village and understanding the challenges of their villages.
That is why they can do anything properly in the village .
This relationship with their villages and their roots is natural for every Indian to do something for the country.
But sometimes due to time , due to the situations , situations , there is a thin dust on it but if someone touches it then all the things inside come up again .
Pandar Pu is a sacred village in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
A fifteen-twenty days before Ashadha Ekadshi, the pilgrims, pilgrimages and pilgrimages will go out on foot for the pilgrimage of Pandarpur.
This journey is called Wali . In which lakhs of devotees participate .
Gyaneshwar , Tukaram etc . are put in the palanquin , singing Vithal , Vithal , dancing , dancing dancing , dancing dancing dancing dancing on foot .
The pilgrimages or Vithoba or Pandurang reach there for the visit of Lord Vithal .
Vithal Bhagwan protects the lice , jewellery , paintings .
In Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana there are unparalleled devotees .
Going to Vithoba temple in Pandarpur, the glory, beauty and spiritual joy there is a special experience.
If possible then I want to feel the experience of Pandarpur once .
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Nam Dev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram etc. are still imprisoning the common man in Maharashtra.
We get the message of harmony , love , beauty , beauty by their main folk musical rituals Bharud or Abhang .
Due to this the society of the society gets the mantra of fighting against the mood beliefs .
The power of the British rulers to see their evils is in him .
The English i . . Tilk i . . on the same day , in twenty years he tried to call the royal leader thrice .
This is not a small thing .
I share an interesting incident with the people of the country about a Tilaq statue located in Lokmanya Tilak, Ahmedabad.
He said that on August 1920, when Lokmanya Tilak died, he would devote his memorial idol in Ahmedabad.
The name of this Garden is Victoria Garden for the idol of the idol of the idol of the idol of the idol of the idol of the idol of the idol of the idol of the idol of the city of Ahmedabad .
Finally the idol was built . Sardar Garden besides anybody , 1929 February 28 Mahatma Gandhiji .
The most important thing is that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, the construction of the idol of Tilak dynasty was also possible because of his valuation.
Due to the attempts of Lokmanya Tilak dynasty the tradition of collective Ganesh Festival has started .
These collective Ganesha festivals have become an effective medium of traditional faith , festivals , social awakening , community , equality among the people .
Our old heritage , history standing in history , how much interested in our youth is also known by such arrangements .

It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th honey .
When I worked in the Kabirwood in Gujarat, I organized a national conference with some people who participated in the tradition of Satpurush Kabir.
Why do you go to the cost of Kabir Dass Maghar
It was a belief that heaven could not reach when he died in Maghar.
It is believed that if the body is done in Kashi then heaven goes .
Seeing the Maghar is unsuccessful . Satpurus Kabir Das does not believe it .
He tried to destroy the foolish beliefs , mischiefs situated in his lifetime .
That is why he went to Maghar and died there .
Kabi Das has dedicated social equality , peace , beauty through his creations , jewellery .
These are his ideals .
This is the ideal of his creation .
In this time also they are inspired with us .
One of his writings is Kabir Soi Peer Hai , Jo John Peerzo Peer Na Janahi , So Ka Peer May Peer , that is , the true saint who understands the pain of the saints is the best saint .
Special attention has been shown to the social identity of Kabir Dascus .
He used to think more about future than his time .

For this some sports participating in every street , every child 's life are gradually becoming alright .
For this game there was a special place in summer holidays .
Once in the swimming , once at night after eating at night all the children used to ask all these games for hours without worry .
Some games were playing all the family together .
The unity hidden in the diversity of our country is also seen in this game .
One sports is known by various names in different areas .
I am a person from Gujarat, there is a sport, which is called Chomal Isti (Ashta-Chamma).
It was playing with jewels, pigs or dies, with 88 square bords.
This game is approximately every state .
In Karnataka, it is called Chaukabara in Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakali in Kerala, Champul in Maharashtra, Dayam in Tamil Nadu and Thayam Ani in Rajasthan.
In Andhra Pradesh this sports is called guides or wood - seeds .
In Orissa Gulibadi is called Ani , Maharashtra .

All these are also the changes happening in the environmental specimens , their results .
Our culture , our tradition has not taught us to discover nature .
We should be unsuccessful for nature .
Mahatma Gandhiji has been dedicated to this thing in every step of life .
It is a thought that all the world stands at one moment through the International Solar Alliance (ISA) through the International Solar Alliance (ISA) to make the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi at the back of all these things.
If we want to make our land clean , hygiene then what can we do that on the day of this environment we all think .

In the year 1857 in this month our Indians showed their beauty to the British .
In many places of the country our soldiers , rails have been standing opposite to unjustly .
It is a matter of sadness that we have to say that for a long time only 1857 incidents of 1857 incidents , syphilis were rebellious .
But in reality not only does this incident less estimation , it is also an attempt to take our self-confidence .
In 1857 Veer Savarkar wrote that it was not only a rebellion but it was our first freedom struggle .
Savarkar is a personality with many specialities .
He worshipped both the weapons , weapons .
We remind him of the battle against the rule of the British , and of the rule of the British .
But apart from all these, he was also a poet, a social culture and always strengthened the feelings of harmony and unity.
Our beloved glorious glorious description about Savarkar dynasty was done by Atal Bihari Vajpayee .

This is not just the subject of the Sikar region, but also every corner of India, you can see such things.

Because of the hilly area the rails did not get the right price of these fruits .
The rails of Kapkot area have discovered the way to increase the price of girls in the market directly .
Because of the excess of iron minerals in all these fruits these iron elements are very beneficial for pregnant women .
In Munnar village all these rails have organised a government institute , where these biscuits have been opened .
On seeing the courage of the farmers, the government also conveyed this institution to the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).

We are listening to the people of my favorite country , in future wars take place for water in the world .
Everybody says this thing but nobody is responsible .
We do not feel that the conservation of water is a social responsibility .
How to take the cost of one drop of rains

Manki Bath February 2018 .
This question has given us an important scientist of modern India .
Before talking about science we are talking about India Sir C . .
His research was famous by the name of Raman effect .
On one side the main study scientist Bodhgaya , Bhaskar , Brahma Gupta , Aryabhat etc . are traditional .
On the other hand in the treatment of Sushrutra , Charakari is our pride .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose, Har Govind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose are the pride of India.
On the name of Satyendranath Bose the name of the main parlor BOSON has also been named .
In this meanwhile, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai. It is a grand invitation to the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It is very interesting to know about the marvellous wonders happening in science .
Through Artificial Intelligence, it will help to create robots, boats and other instruments that do special work.
In the midst of this instruments also themselves increase their intelligence even more .
This technology is beneficial for glittering the lives of some poor , bahadhis , needy people .
Is it possible to get any help through Artificial Intelligence to make the lives of Divyang brothers well-being in this program
I have got the opportunity to visit the I Create Festival in Ahmedabad, Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel for a few days.
There I saw a digital design made of a young man .
I would like to use Artificial Intelligence in many such ways.
The price of science and technology is permanent .
They do not have any price .
Every instrument does the work of how we want .
But through the instrument we do any work which depends on us .
Here the goal of human goal is important .
Science should not only be used for human welfare but also for climbing the best peaks of human life .
Thomas Alva Adison, who looked at the Light Bulb, has failed many times in his research .
It is fortunate that I am in the Karmabhoomi Auroville of Maharshi Aravind.
Similarly he questioned everything in life in the form of a Maharshi .
They also saw the path of humanity by extracting the pocket .
To know the truth it is very important to keep questioning every time .
In the contribution of national science I am telling all the people associated with science , science .
Friends , people keep coming to me many times on the subjects of safety , desert etc . during accidents .
In a message sent from Pune to Ravindra Singh ji to Narendra Modi yape, it was proposed about competitive safety.
They said that safety standards are not very important in place of factories and construction works in our country.
He said that the fourth day of March is the National Safety Day, so that the Prime Minister should take some precautions about Bhadrata in his Mann Ki Baat programme and to increase the awareness of Bhadrata in people.
In a daily life we are not able to take precautions about Bhadrata , not taking precautions , it becomes difficult to get precautions during accidents .
If concentration is decreased then it is harmful, it causes happiness, laughter and joy. Do not enhance bondage with security, do not play with security, do not forget life.
By crossing that path one can not use all the times in our life .
But if you leave natural alternatives , maximum dangers happen due to our layers .
If we are very comfortable, if necessary precautions are taken then we can not only save our lives but also protect the society from big dangers.
There are many information about Bhadrata at the place of working once but nobody can participate them properly .
I wish that the archaeologists situated in the cities of Mahanagar , the archaeologists of the cities have to make a macro-drill in front of the children once in a week .
This country has faced many natural, human-built risks and many chemical and industrial accidents.
This is the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) that is, they are conducting major seeds in the country.
When there is a variety of threats like earthquakes, floods, storms etc, NDMA reaches there only when there is a rescue operation.

In the districts coming to floods , temporary districts a program has been done by the name of Apada friend for training .
How important role is training , best role .
Two-three-three years ago, Lu, that is, every area was killed due to hot winds.
In 2017 the number of deaths occurring due to hot gases in 2017 is estimated near 220 .
Therefore, it is known that if we give importance to Bhadrata then we can be safe.
If there is such a danger in the society then innumerable people , social incidents , social incidents , immense civilizations coming there .
Under the leadership of India, all the countries including BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal etc. have done a joint disaster management exercise.
This is the first , important human use .
They should be part of our life .
Normally we keep on traveling on airways many times . In the beginning of airways information about air host Bhadrata .
All these information also keep listening to us many times .
But if someone takes us to the airways standing , where is the life jacket , asks how to use it , nobody in us can tell us proper peace .
There is a chance of seeing them clearly .
That is .
But we pay attention .
Therefore, no one of us thinks that if we are sitting in the air, the precautions of our ears are heard but they are saying our wishes.
We feel like every hole of life .
We do not think that this Bhadrata is not for us .
If we are very best for our Bhadrata then the society Bhadrata is also in it .

Every morning the view of cleaning the whole of the tourists here is so unique .
How important , how big authority , how much wealth , everybody goes ahead after participating in the program of this pilgrimage .
Many such examples are for the people of our country .
This Swachhta Abhiyan of so many developments in Sabarimala, in which the Punya Pungavanam programme will be part of the journey of every traveller.
There the complications of singing , clean , clean , clean complications also run with them .
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Bapu Ji, the dream of worshiping Bapu, the dream of 'Swachh Bharat' and 'Swachh Bharat' and 'Swachh Bharat' will change our country.
On the 150th birth anniversary of Babuji we made something in an attempt to give him a clean India .
Several attempts are being made to participate in the country .
Changes occurring in rural areas , urban areas are seen with a large participants .
To estimate the level of sanitation in urban areas, the worlds largest survey is being conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018.
These symptoms take place in about 40 crores of population on four thousand cities .
The Survey also envisages the estimation of new efforts to make cities free of defecation, collection, collection of defecation, cleaning of scientific hygiene, changes in habits, efficiency and cleanliness, participation of people for this work etc.
This survey goes to various waters and makes the cities their faces .
They talk to the citizens and take their opinions.
The Cleanlin Entertainment App is estimated to be used and changes in different services.
Through this survey the cleanliness system organised in cities is estimated to be part of the cleanliness of the city or people 's life style .
Cleanliness is not just the government .
This is also a big responsibility of every Pauri , every project .
In this survey of Jagboe in the days of coming every Pauri has participated with enthusiasm .
In this survey, you should try hard without your city, your place, your streets behind.
It is my belief that using blue color , green colored dustbins to remove the wet , dry dust of your house is still a habit of all of you .
It is very beneficial to reduce it , use it again , use it .
In the Swachhta Survey held between 4th January and 10th March, 2018, it should be a matter of public discussion in every city without being behind you in this healthy competition related to cleanliness.
Our city - our efforts, our development - the path of progress for the country should be made by all of you.
Come , let us try to fulfil the dream of Swachh Bharat by reminding the worship of Bapu once again .
Lovely my country residents , some things are very small to see but the society shows many effects on our identity .
I want to share this thing with you through Mansu in Mansu.
Who has made such a rule .
Why is there any question
It is said that when I went into this matter deep then the independence came to independence and became such a discovery that we were observed .
The decades of Muslim women have become unrighteous but no church has happened .
There is no rules in many countries .
But Muslim women in India do not have this power.
Our government has given me a lot of happiness to pay attention to this matter .
Normally Haj travellers are given permission by latri method but it is my opinion that alone women have to keep away from this lottery method .
Our women should also get power equal to men . In the progressive way they also have to give them equal opportunity to walk with men .
My dear country Vasulara , January 26th honey is a historical festival for us .
But this time in 2018 January 26th honey is specially remembered .

Seeing in history eight , three hundred years Christ , whereas in all the teams of boating teams the most powerful boating team has been recognized .
In the expansion of the Chola Empire , in the states of contemporary states Kella has played a big role in keeping the economic power of Kella .
The examples of the adventurous journeys of the boating teams are available in the Sangam literature .
Many people know that after many years of boating teams of the world , after many years there is a permission of women on the war boats .
But in the boating team eight , nine hundred years old women played the main role of women in large numbers .
Women also participate in war .
The scientific science related to the construction of boating was rich .
The Konkan coastal area situated in the main role of the sea was part of the state of Maharaja Shivaji .
Several forts like Sindhu Durg , Murud Janjira , Golden Durg etc . of Maharaja Shivajijijijiji were surrounded by sea shores or sea shores .
The responsibility of all these forts was done by the boating of Marathas .
Large boats and small boats were included in the boating team of Marathas.
Their navy team was very efficient in fighting any enemy and escaping them.
When the Marathas are talking about the naval teeth, they cannot remember Kanhoji Angre.
They went to the highest level of the Marathas to a high level . In many places he built the establishment of Marathas .
In 1971, after the independence of India-Pakistan war in 1971, our naval forces have seen their traditions in many cases.
Some fishermen were saved from water and handed them to Bangladesh.
This year, in the months of May and May 19, when there was a terrible flood in Sri Lanka, three boats in our Navy team reached there and provided their help to the government and the people.

In this conclusion we also work to increase the mind of our armed teams .
We also do good works for them .
My dear countrymen, December 5th day world soil day.
This conclusion I want to say some things with my brother , brothers , friends .
The most important part of the earth is soil .
The symbol of our eating substance is engraved with this soil .
One way the entire food chain is covered with all the soil.
There is no soil , trees do not increase .
Where is the cost of human life .
How is the cost of living animals
Earlier this thing has been discussed in our culture . This is the reason why we have been excellent from the ancient times of soil .
In our culture on one side the natural attempts of devotion , emotional emotional emotional emotional emotions have also been made in the people of soil , on the other hand some scientific methods have become part of our life .
Both of us are important in the lives of the rails of this country to protect and protect our soil with devotion, scientific soil.
It is a matter of pride that the rails of our country are drowned with tradition , showing interest in modern science , attempting , attempting , concluding all of us .
I have heard about the farmers of Bhoraj Black in Tohu village of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
It is said that some rails of the village were able to test their soil in time , some kind of red nutrition , micro nutrition , sandra red , that advice was done .
After that you will be surprised by listening to the results .
Along with this the soil has also been glittered in the climate .
If you want to think about the fruit then precaution the earth beforehand . If we preserve the earth then the earth saves us all .
All our roses all of the country understood their soil even more very well , according to which the soil health cards have been taken up to ten crores .
We worship the mother of the earth but how much the health of the mother of the earth gets spoiled with the red .
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific tests that due to the reason of excessive desert of redness of more than necessary it is proved by the scientists .
Global Warming , changes in the environment , we feel all .
Sometimes the winters came before Diwali . Now December is coming to December gradually feet .
But as soon as winters we do not want to come out of all the corners . It is an experience for all of us .
Due to this child going to 30,40 houses every day, Kumhari village was freed from excretion of excretion of excretion.
In the direction of increasing cleanliness the small child has done how inspiring work .
There is no need to participate cleanliness , there is no limit .
Cleanliness of children , elders , women , men is important for everyone .
It is necessary to do something for cleanliness .
Our Divya brother , friends are strong .
The capabilities , adventures can make any contribution .
You can learn something from them every moment.
These are queens in every hole .
In some social problems , in some social problems our Divya brothers do not take anyone .
You must be remembered that our Divyang sportspersons and sportspersons have won four medals in Rio Olympics.
Blind T-20 is a champion in the world cup.
Different types of competitions are happening in the country .
A few days ago, 17th National Para Swimming competitions were held in Udaipur.

I express my heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen .
I hope that in order to increase peace , goodwill in this society we give new enthusiasm to all of us , give new energy , give new energy , give new ability to make new alternatives .
The completion of 2017 is the door of 2018 .
But you got the information straight .
I thought to change your words even more .
Don't forget the grief, forget the grief that the elders and elders living in our villages forget the grief.
In our country also attempts to remind the zealous incidents of Taluku in the last year of media .
Distribute the things that give inspiration to others .
If you share good things , then it gives the mind to do good work .
It gives strength to make good things good .
We see all the effects of this contemporary place Shaktini , its effects .
In the coming mind, I will definitely try to provide things to all the people of the country that have come in this positive situation.
My dear countrymen, I will come among you with a word in the coming month.
Once there is a chance of telling a lot of pockets .
Manki Bath : Speak in mind .
This Chhat Puja of special festival is completely celebrated with nature , natural worship .
During this puja of sunrise , water is worshipped . utensils , soil utensils , bamboo etc . various objects drowned with this puja .
In this festival full of beliefs the message of sunrise , ascending sunrise is full of a special culture .
If the world is worshipped then it is important to worship those who know that it is not possible to worship in this Chat Puja .
In our life this festival is also said to be so important in the swimming of swimming .
Before this festival people also clean the shores of the rivers , rivers , ponds , ponds , worshipping rivers with great enthusiasm .
It is natural to consider everybody 's pride to this important tradition of India .
But when I looked at the impact of words in mind, I am confident that the words in mind with the people of the country have become a hundred percent strong bond.
Take the example of Khadi , dollars .
During Gandhi Jayanti I have done the result of the consequences of Khadi , the consequences that you will also enjoy how much .
On the fifteenth of October i. e.
Khadi , chicken , two girls are such a big height that you are also a joyful thing .
During Diwali approximately 680 percent of the girls of Khadi Gift Cooperation were emotional .
In all the girls of Khadi , handicrafts also the last year about ninety percent of this year is emotional .
In this meditation youth , elders , children , old age , women , all age groups also like Khadi , donors .
That is why I can imagine how much benefit for families , families , many poor families .
I said Khadi for fashion. Now, Khadi for fashion, Khadi for fashion, all the places for Khadi for fashion have been brought for fashion for Khadi.
Besides bringing changes in the lives of poor labourers, both Khadi and Karneta are changing into a powerful means of bringing them up with power.
How to give our household sweets to the Bhadrata teams in the Nrender Modi Yap in Tejas Gaikwad
It is said that during the festival we also remember our virgins .
I also felt that the sweets of our house were provided to the teams of Bhadrata .
On the other hand we got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali festival with our Veer Bhadrata teams .
This time I am unforgettable to celebrate Deepavali with the Bhadrata teams of Gurez sector in Jammu and Kashmir.
In the borders of the country how difficult , toxic situations they keep protecting our Bhadrata teams , that conservation , dedication , devotion , devotion , devotion , devotion , devotion of all the people of the country .
If we get the opportunity then we should know the experiences of our soldiers . listen to their prideful stories .
The soldiers of our Bhadrata teams are not only in the borders but also in the whole world the main role of establishing peace all over the world .
As a peace inspector in the United Nations Peacekeeper Equality, they are changing the name of India all over the world.
A few days ago on 24 October the UN Day i . . the day of Ikyaraj Sammti was celebrated throughout the world .
The attempts to establish peace in the world , their successful role is remembered everybody .
We believe that the principle of the family of Vasudaik family i . . the whole world is our family .
With this belief, India is playing an active participant in various important efforts of Taluku .
You will be aware that the establishment of Indias engagement, the establishment of the ICG Charter, both of them will also start with the words of 'We the People'.
The UN Declaration of Human Rights (UN Declaration of Human Rights) is an example of this.
It seems very small changes but a strong thought is seen in it .
Under the UN Umbrella, India has played an important role in peacekeeping activities of the United Nations.
India has always been playing a very active role in the UK peacekeeping Mission.
More than 18 thousand Indian Bhadrata teams have provided their services in UN peacekeeping operations for the first time.
By August 2017, our soldiers served in nearly 50 operations in the 71 peacekeeping operations conducted by the Indian Army in the United Nations.
These operations have been conducted in many countries of the world like Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyrus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan etc.
In the hospital organized by the Indian Army in Congo, South Sudan, more than twenty thousand patients have been treated and many others have been saved.
The Indian Bhadrata teams have not only saved the people there in many countries but also have spent many hearts by making people friendly operations there.
Indian women have played an important role in the establishment of peace program .
After that all the rest of the countries also started sending their women police units .
You will be proud to hear that Indias role is not merely constituent to peacekeepers but also to the people of about eighty five countries.
Mahatma Gandhi , Gautam Buddha had given the message of peace , harmony and harmony of the world .
Peace conservation works are not so easy .
Our soldiers also have to work in dangerous areas of our Bhadrata .
Different kinds of humans have to be between humans .
Different situations , different kinds of traditions have to be detected .
They have to forget themselves according to the local needs , situations of those areas .
The second Indian Peacekeeper, Lieutenant General Prem Chand, who received special recognition in the Cyprus.

Journal Thimaya, the Chief of the Indian Army, was also leading the UK Peacekeeping Force in the Cyprus and offered all of them for peace establishment.
In the form of peacefulness India has always been giving the message of world peace , unity , civilization .
It is my belief that everybody lives with peaceful experiences , walks forward in the direction of a shining peaceful future .

Brothers have established the pride of Indian culture .
It has been working to make people aware of the national memory .
Going to various countries of the world opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite of the opposite to the opposite opposite to the opposite opposite .

Your movement is correct and the diseases occurring in old age have come to the end of life - they are now seen in children as well.
Children are also surprised by listening to diabetes .
These are such diseases that in the past such diseases have come only to those who live only rich , fascinating life .
Such diseases were rare in youth .
But this has changed our life style .
Such diseases are known by the name of life style .
Change in our dietary methods , there is no sufficient physical labor in life , people are the main causes of such diseases in the age of pinnacle .
It is necessary to pay attention to this matter of society , family .
If we think about it then there is no more precaution to participate .
Small tasks have to be done regularly in the right way , changing their habits , changing them naturally .
The members of the family members try to make their children a habit of playing in the plains .
If possible then elders also try to play with children in the field of singing .
Do the habit of roaming down on the way to the stairs without using lift .
After dinner try to walk everybody , children in the family .
It is easy because someone can learn easily because yoga can be done anywhere .
There is no need of any special administration , plains .
Several researches are being done for taking diabetes control as much as yoga is useful .
All Ayurveda , yogani we should not only see the meditation of disease .

All the hairs of the world came to India . Everybody showed their everybody in the field of football .
I also got the opportunity to see a game.
Once again I tell the sports , their colleagues , sports , sports , sports .
My beloved country , how many people are coming to me in the matter of clean India , if I want to judge all the opinions then everyday I have to make a program in mind only everyday .
If you send photographs of small children then there is a stories of youth hair at another place .
If there is some creative object related to cleanness at one place , on the other hand there is a news about changes occurring with some authority .
Some days Christian report is that in which the story of Chandrapur fort in Maharashtra is the story of Taluku .
There a NGO Vrindra Chandrapur Fort was organised by an ecological projection organisation.
In this program running for two hundred days people have run a clean program without stopping , without tiredness , standing a hair .
Two hundred days .
Before the program , after that they sent me photographs .
This Bhagirathi attempt done for cleanliness is a unique example of beauty , community , continually .
Forts are symbols of our heritage .
The responsibility of keeping historical buildings safe , clean is all the people of the country .
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the people of Chandrapur, all of them.
People of my favorite country , on the fourth day of November we celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti .
Besides the first Guru of Guru Nanak Nanak Sikhs , Jagat Guru are also .
His entire human welfare has been seen one of the species .
Women have given importance to empowerment , women pride .
The journey of twenty eight thousand kilometres on foot of Guru Nanak dynasty has given a message about the real humanity .
They were talking to the people . they saw the way of truth , sacrifice , karma .
In the society the message has been given about equality . Not only through words but also by their works .
Guru Nanak had also discovered Gurubani to tell his words .
In the year 2019 we are celebrating the 550th light year of Guru Nanak .
Come , we try to walk ahead on the path of their messages .
After two days of my beloved country , after two days we are celebrated the Jayanti of Patel dynasty on October 31 .
We all know that the foundation of modern Akhand is of India .
With the extraordinary journey of the important child of India we can learn how much .
October 31 AD Indira Gandhi had left this proposal .
He is a witness in making thoughts .
The cracks standing on one side of India were stopped by Sardar Valbhai Patel .
Crores of Indians are determined to bring India under one country, under one kingdom.
Their decision has given them the power to face all the obstacles .
Where there is need of psychologists work there .
Where it is necessary to use strength there it is possible .
They decided a purpose that they went ahead with the entire artificial artificial direction .
This program of uniting the country can be done every week .
Everybody has imagined the country like equality .
I want them to be inspiring for all of us - the difference between the Kulamatas should not stop us.
This story of Sardar dynasty is also an inspiration , related to our dream of New India .
Because of this their Jayanti is celebrated as the fifth day of the country .
Their support is unsuccessful in giving the form of an unparalleled form of the country .
My dear countrymen , after the lamps of Diwali , with a new conception , with a new determination , you will have started again in your daily life .
My generation wants to make all their dreams of the country , luxury .
Through the sky the words of all of you have spent three times while talking to the mind .
The word in the mind of this is 36th .
I have never told these words in my mind .
In this mind the words of the people sent me from all the corners of the country .
Many of these are inspired me .
Many people are like bringing changes in the government .
Some person 's complaints are like that of keeping an eye on some social problems .
Once in a month, I am taking your time for half an hour but people keep on reaching their words for the words in mind for thirty days in a month.
That is why the journey of this three-three mind is the journey of all the countrymen , feelings , feelings .
In such a short time I am telling thanks to all the people of the country for giving me the opportunity to understand the feelings of common people of India .
Now three-three years have been completed therefore social scientists , university , researchers , media specialists definitely discover it .
But in the future of such a poisonous churches how much useful is in the mind . a new enthusiasm , new enthusiasm .
After that many social institutions of the country , many social institutions , many youths have done such tasks beforehand .
How many people were thinking to use it at one place , how many people were able to use it , I came to my sight , how much joy .
Once again I had seen a serpent in Haryana with the photo of 'Selfie with Datter' and told everyone about it.
Not only in one India but also in the entire world, a big garden called 'Selfie with Dater' has started.
This is not only a matter of social meditation .
This is the incident of producing new self-confidence , new pride in every girls .
Everybody feels that parents should take self with their daughters .
It is believed that every girl has some importance in itself , it has its importance .
A few days ago I am sitting in the Department of their tourism department of India .
I said that wherever you go to Incredible India, I would like to send photographs there.
Then lakhs of pictures coming from different parts of India , in a way the work of tourism has been very big .
I am experienced by words in the mind that how big a small incident can not be done .
On coming to the thought of the three-three years many incidents were slowed in my mind .
The country is always before walking in the right direction .
Everybody in the country wants to do something for the progress of the country , for the welfare of the society , for the progress of the country .
I have learned and learned from the people of the country in my three-three Mansu.
This is the biggest power of any country , the biggest power of any country .
I salute all the people of the country with heart .
Once I talked about Khadi in the mind . Khadi is not a cloth , a thought .
Discounts are given in Khadi girls about two October . very less is available .
I want to increase this Khadi preaching in such a way , I want to increase again .
Increasing interest towards Khadi, the enthusiasm to think about Khadi in the Khadi sector has also increased in a new corner of the Government of India.
How to bring new technologies , how to increase productivity , how to bring the handicrafts working with solar power , how to revive the ancient tradition of 20-20 , 25-25 , 30-30 years of age .
Many people were produced .
He reiterated the Centre for Training of Khadi and Village Industries closed in Pampore, Kashmir and there is a lot of work in Kashmir to provide this sector.
Nowadays in the beginning of the education centres the help of new generations , in the construction of new generations , in the midst of this big corporate institutions are very happy to choose the things of Deepavali .
People also started selecting Khadi things while giving each other .
Some things naturally go ahead and all of us have come into experience .
In the mind of the people of my favorite country , in the mind of Christian month we decided to celebrate cleanliness throughout the country fifteen days before Gandhi Jayanti .
Our glorious President President started this program .
Children , elders , men , women , cities , villages , everybody has been participated in the publicity .
It is said that I can contribute with imagination , how we are moving ahead in the way we are seeing before the eyes .
Everybody has adopted this proposal , to support it , to make it successful .
That is why I am telling thanksgiving thanks to the president of the Archaeologists .
Along with them every category of the country is also considered to be its own work . Everybody has been celebrated with this proposal .
In the sports they, students, schools, art galleries, universities, rails, coolies, officers, police, children, jawans and everybody joined it.
If these places are scattered then people are not able to swim there , this pressure is also seen in the workers there .
It is very good that more than fifty five lakh people and more than forty thousand people participated in this programme in the four days of the Swachhta Seva campaign.
Some results are definitely working continuously with the goal of paying attention .
This time, we also looked forward to a new thing - while doing a bedroom programme, the other bed should be cautious.
If you want to change cleanness in a natural way , then emotional park is also important .
This time many competitions have been done by clean service .
More than two and a half thousand children participate in the competition of this cleanliness .
Thousands of children have made pictures .
The pictures about their voluntary voluntary voluntary have been put .
On coming to the words of the media I always forgot the blessings of the media .
We are seeing how much the electronic media, print media of our country are doing the service of the country in the sanitation sector.
In the meanwhile somebody told me about the youth of Bilal Dar of Srinagar .
You will be happy to know that this Bill Dar has been appointed as his Brand Ambassador for the functioning of the Portuguese Programme of Sri Nagar.
Not only .
Bilal Dar had paid attention to the cleanliness of his twelve - twelve years of age , last five years .
In the age he is an inspiration for all those who are interested in cleanliness .
I am giving many congratulations to Billa Dar .
We should confess that my favorite country , future history , last history is born .
This time Nanaji is also the year of the century of the year of Nanajiji dynasty , Pandit Deen Dayal dynasty .
What is the centres of all these Mahapuras
It is a common thing in everyone that to live for the country , to do something for the country .
Nanaji 's country has left the life of the royal family of the country , leaving the royal life of the royal family . It is natural to have the pride of their village program .
The President of India, Shri Abdul Kalanji, spoke to the youngsters of Nanaji, who had spoken about the development of the rural development of the country.
The education of Deen Dayal Meditation also used to talk about the person sitting in the last corner of the society .
We also run forward for unity , one element mantra .
The unity in diversity is usually said to be the speciality of our India .
We pride diversity but sometimes you try to feel this diversity .
Deepawali falls near Deepawali is so much in the thought of traveling somewhere in the country .
It is a common thing to go to every tourist .
But it is a matter of trouble that people do not see our country, they do not know the diversity of the country.
Our country is filled with many diversity .
All these Mahabhavas have also been toured in the country .
Before starting this work , attempts were made to understand the country of India .
Try to fill India in itself .
My experience is that I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India .
In more than four hundred districts I got the opportunity to spend at night .
Besides not only recognising the unity in diversity, I wish you all to feel this vast India and our immense power treasure.
One India - best India is hidden in it .
This is the biggest strength of our country tourism .
My suggestion is that if you want to go out in your holidays , then go out with the goal of learning something other than Kosamo Baaldev .
Look at India inside you.
Your life will be rich with these experiences .
Your thought is large .
There is cost of experiences .
Normally from October to March there is a lot of tourism .
Definitely send your photo to the incredible composition.
Please also send pictures of humans connected to the place where you go .
Not only the identification of construction , not only the beauty of nature but also the lifestyle there .
Could you keep incredible
You see, I would like to tell the government that after examining all the beauty from one state, about the seven more places coming out of them, I would like to make literature about the seven places coming out of them.
The government of India definitely works on them .
By making pictures , making video , making publicity on such best places , by encouraging them the government will accept the information of many places beautiful from you .
Come on, walk with me.
In order to encourage the time of the month of October to use the time of the month of March , to encourage the country tourism you can also become a big excitement .
I am inviting you.
My beloved country , one person meets me many things .
My mind becomes a victim of obstruction .
They leave deep effect on my mind .
How much I am also like you .
Why is Assamese say that while serving the mother of India , their husbands were not heaven .
We can imagine how their condition remains in small age .
With the eleven months she trained her hard industry , to make her husband dreams of her husband .
Although the husband of Nidhi Dubey had forgotten death by working in the army of Mukhesh Dubey .
His wife also reached the army only .
It is natural for every Indian to have the pride of our maternal power , our pride towards these wildlife .
I am telling many good wishes of these two brothers with heart .
They have given new inspiration and new excitement to millions of people of the country.
These two brothers are many impressions .
My favorite country , Navratri festivals , Deepavali festivals have a big opportunity for our country .
FIFA Under-17 World Cup is happening in our country.
It is my belief that the sounds of football are reflecting all around .
Every generation is increasing the interest of football .
In any school in India, there is no ground without youth playing football in art gallery.
My favorite country is celebrated , Navratri festival .
Durgadevi is worshipped .
The whole of the environment is clean , aromatic .
The atmosphere of spiritual atmosphere , festival environment , devotion is filled with devotion .
This is considered to be the festival of energy .
These are also called Sarad Navratri . Till now the winters start .
My beloved countrymen , Sadar Namaskar
On the one hand, the country is drowned in festivals and on the other hand it is natural to worry about the country when there is a positive news from some corner of India.
This is the country of Sardar Patel the birthplace of Lord Buddha , Gandhi 's birthplace of the country .
"Ahimsa Parmo Dharamshala: " We came to hear it from time to time .
I have also said from the Red Fort - I have not tolerated Hinduism by the name of beliefs. It is a traditional belief, royal thoughts, Taluku beliefs, although the beliefs of a person are true, traditional beliefs.
According to the kingdom given to us Baba Saheb Ambedkar , every person has all kinds of arrangements for getting the judgment .
I believe that those who take the chatti in their hands , who are a person , who is a person , who is a crowd , this country is not able to bear any government .
Our festivals are also filled with many diversity .
Because of the archaeological culture of some thousand years we have got the tradition of cultural traditions , social traditions , historical incidents , everything , therefore in the year some day in any festival .
All our festivals also come according to nature .
Everything is also directly related to nature .
The festival of Jain society is celebrated throughout the year .
The Jain society celebrates the festival of men in the month of Bhadrapa .
The festival of Purushu festival is celebrated on the day of Akhri .
Actually it is a unique tradition .
The festival of the year is symbol of forgiveness , non-violence , friends .
My favorite country , today everybody of the country is celebrated the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi .
It is natural to come to the matter of Bahraang - Ganesh Festival on coming to Ganesh Chaturthi .
Balgangadhar Tilak had given birth to this tradition of 125 years . Last 125 years before independence they were symbol of freedom .
After independence they stand symbol of social education , social consciousness .
Ganesh Chaturthi festival is done for ten days .
This festival is said to be the symbol of unity , equality , cleanliness .
Several acquaintances of the Ganesh Festivals of all the country .
Now Omam festival is celebrated in Kerala .
In the colorful festivals of India Onam of Kerala is a major festival .
This festival shows social , cultural importance .
Onam festival exhibits the important cultural heritage of Kerala .
This festival will create new enthusiasm, new hopes and new faith in the minds of the people with the message of love and harmony in the society.
Now our festivals are also changing their attractions .
The festivals of Navratri in Gujarat and Durga Puja in Bengal have become their attractions in a way.
Our other festivals are also useful to attract foreigners .
Think what we can do in that direction .
In a few days on the tradition of these festivals the festival of Eid-ul-Juha is celebrated.
Congratulations and best wishes to all the people of the country on the occasion of Id-ul-Juha.
Festival is a symbol of faith , belief .
In Navbharata the festivals of Navbharata should be made symbols of cleanliness .
This is not new for us but it is important to change it as a social habit .
Cleanliness is not only in the house but also in the entire village , city , city , state , cleanliness , cleanliness in our country .
My favorite country is changing the meaning of modernity .
These days, how many cultures, how many moderns are your thoughts, how fresh you are, all of them have become a new element, a new measure, a balance.
Therefore in the days of this festival all the places of environment friendly soil has begun .
If you look at the Europeans then in every house children are making mud dynasty and colouring it .
Some vegetables are playing colors , some colorful papers are playing .
The media house is also giving inspiration , pathways to the people giving education to the education of making the statues of Ganesh Ganesha according to the big environment .
See how big change has come .
Funny change.
As I said , our country is full of marvellous thoughts of crores of crores .
Somebody gets very enjoyed by doing new alternatives .
Some engineer himself told me that he has got some special kinds of soil , mixed it , mixing it , giving education to the people of soil .
After the puja, the idol melts in the water immediately after a small ball.
I started the cleanliness of the three-three Christians . Its coming to October is completed three-three times .
The consequences of this park are seen .
Construction of construction of toilets has reached about 67 from 39.
It is said that more than two lakh thirty thousand villages , Bahraang had freed themselves from excretion of excretion .
In the meanwhile, there were severe floods in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives .
But after the water of flood water very bad smell spread .
At such a time, the workers of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera in Banaskata district of Gujarat cleaned the flood-affected twenty-two pieces and three mosques with a decade.
Everybody saved their sweat .
If the attempts done by dedicating the dedication of dedication are changed to permanent nature then our country can climb to the height of another country .
In a way it is considered to be Sannah before Diwali , Navratri , Durga Puja .
Go to the buses nearby , go to the nearby village but consider it a garden .
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
My social media friends can also make your creative garden and work on the Virtual World Forum, which can inspire us.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is organising business competitions, stories competitions, short painting competitions and painting competitions.
In this you can make exercise in various languages .
You can take a small picture with your mobile.
Film can be prepared for two-three minutes like inspiration for the film .
Three , state levels are also there in the district level of those participating in these competitions .
Therefore, from the fifteenth of September, get the mantra of Swachhta Seva from home.
Give something or the other for cleanliness .
After fifteen days of publication, you can imagine how sacred joy will be among you when you are celebrating Gandhi Jayanti on October 2.
My dear countrymen , I want to accept all your friends specially .
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for not being associated with the words in my mind, but also for my heartfelt gratitude and thanks to millions of people from across the country.
The number of listeners is in crores but lakhs of people are coming to the north , sending messages , giving me messages by phones . This is like a big monkey .
To know the words of the mind of all the people of the country I have become a big opportunity .
As much as you wait for talk in your mind , as much as I wait for your messages .
They come to work for the work of doing it .
Once some things get so much connected in our habits , we also consider that we are pursuing .
"Prime Minister Garu, I am speaking immortally from Pune.
I want to say about my friend.
She is trying to help people at any time but a habit of her own .
I went to the shopping mall once with me.
On one pus he spent two thousand rupees easily .
Piza has been paid Rs 450 but shopping mall has been done for five rupees with auto driver .
The vegetables were bought on the way . Bermadi 4,5 rubbles were left on one vegetable .
I did not like it .
Not only this , if you go to buy pus in Shorum then berala but if someone comes to work with the poor then there will be no unconsciousness .
Do ye think that the poor does not want to do anything
In your life there is no importance of two rupees , five rupees but your small habits can hurt their minds so deeply .
I am grateful to you, Madam, to tell me through your phone call.
It is believed that my people of my country also , they have a habit of procedure with the poor , they definitely change .
My beloved youths , August 29th honey festival is celebrated throughout the country .
This is the birth day of the birthplace of the great Haki sports , Haki Matri Matri Major Dhyan Chand .
The service of Haki sports is unsuccessful .
The reason for reminding this thing is that my desire to finish with the emotional sports of our country .
Sports should be a part of our life .
In the world when our country is young then this youth should also be seen in the game of youth .
A big medicine is useful for mixing the minds of games .
Come forward in the youth of our country . I warned that the playing field of playing field is very important in the age of these computer .
Play FIFA in computer but sometimes in the field outside also show fats with football .
Cricket keeps playing in computer but in the open field cricket playing cricket is different .
At one time the children of the house went out , when they asked .
Now the situation is such that even children in the house are drowned in seeing phones , cartoon films or mobile games .
Young friends, Sports Ministers have created a sports talent portal for exploring and shining the sports talent.
Wherever there are talented children in the sports fields across the country, their successes in the sports can be uploaded with biodeta or video in this portal.
Encouraging encouragement provides training to the sports .
This portal started tomorrow .
The joyful news of our sports is that in India on October 6 to 28 , Fafa Ardar 17 world camps have started .
These six girls are taking a small boat to cross the sea by taking a small boat .
The name of this propaganda is Navika Sagar Parikrama.
They return to India after a few months, or after a few months after surrounding the world.
The journey of our six girls between the waves of the sea has become the first incident of the world .
Seeing the cost of these girls Indians are not proud .
I want to share their experiences with the people of the country .
I will also organise a department for their experiences to read yourself in the Narendra Modi Yap.
Because I am happy to receive the words of these girls , adventurous experiences .
I am giving many blessings to these girls , many blessings .
My beloved country is celebrated on the fifth day of September .
A student , a physician , a politicalist , even though the President of India was considered as a study every moment .
In its students the joy of creative feeling , knowledge Taluku has to be the most important quality of one study .
Make everybody kissed with something or the other .
Watch the way to make it successful . Give the joy of getting successful in life .
Such environment can make our schools , our art galleries , our education institutions .
If we talk about change in our country , talking about family , then the teacher remembers about the society .
The teacher has a very big role in change.
In every study life because of its natural artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial incidents , sometimes incidents occurring .
If we try to compare together , then we can play a big role in changing the country .
We moved ahead with the mantra of Teach to Transform.
Prime Minister Garu, my name is Dr.
Annaya Awasthi .
I am in Mumbai and Hovard University will work in their Indian Research Centre.
As a researcher , I have special interest in the economic functions of the financial inclusion , related to it .
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Financial Inclusion, not only in India but also in the entire world.
I started this proposal with one eye of my mind on 28th August .
Tomorrow, on 28th August, the Prime Minister will complete the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
With this the new families of 30 crores of new families have opened the banks .
This number is more than the population of many countries in the world .
He changed his habit and he was going to the bank.
But now due to the environment formed gradually he also understood that he also works for the needs of children .
It is understood that in the days of coming if you want to do something good work then money will work .
The poor now sees the rape card of his pocket , as if he sees himself with riches , if there is a crade card in his pocket , then it is satisfied that there is a card in my pocket .
It is considered its pride .
In the prime minister Jan Dhan Yojana about 65 thousand crores of rupees were included in the banks of our poor .
In one way this is their strength in the days of the poor people coming .
Those who are made by the prime minister Jan Dhan Yojana , they also got the benefit of Bima .
On occurrence of danger of poor , if the main person dies in the family , in some days he gets two lakh rupees .
Jan Dhan Yojana , Insurance Valla , Rupee card , prime minister Mudra , ordinary people have done any benefit , they have done survey .
I will make a complete attempt to reach them .
Due to such inspiring incidents media can also get complete benefit .
By publishing the face of such people new generations can give new inspiration to new generations .
My dear countrymen, once again forgive all of you if you are suffering from swimming .
In rainy season the mind of man is very important .
Animals , birds , goats , nature , everybody becomes excited due to rainy season .
Changes have come in the environment due to changing weather cycle , its effect is also very fast .
In the last few days, there has been a need to face natural obstacles in Assam, north-eastern regions of India, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal.
My friendly members of the Ministry are also reaching the place wherever possible.
State governments also provide the best help to the victims of floods in their own methods .
In such a situation the help of people is helping them with social institutions , cultural institutions , services .
The Government of India Government often gives happiness to help their lives in such a time when the air force , air force , air force , air force , air force , air force .
Because of floods the life of people becomes very impossible .
Fruits , animals , moulds , roads , electricity , information meditation etc . are affected .
Especially when our rail brothers , fruits were destroyed then they were not destroyed , especially in the companies of Isurance companies , specially the clinical centres of the fruits , they made an excellent plan .
To face the situations of flood 24 hours control room Helpline is working continuously 1078 .
People are also telling their problems .
Gradually, if we are doing our work according to the information of this environment then we can save us from losses.
When I am prepared for the programme Mansu in Mansu, I want more and more people of the country to be made more.
I heard the occasion of your Chartered Accountants Day , very impressed.
On the same date of last month, GST has come into force in our country.
That is why you can say whether the results of the government have been coming for the past months .
I want to know your thoughts in this matter .
I am very happy , joyful when I come to the answers from any poor person because of GST , how they are getting cheaper in the things they are shopping .
Especially the belief is increasing on the businessmen .
I am thinking how much GST has been affected in the transport and logistics sector.
How fast changes occurring rapidly , migration registered registered a new belief in the country .
Scientists and technological experts of the economy are studying about the use of GST in India and sometimes standing before the world as a specimen.
This is a case study for all the university of the world .
Because with such a big height , so important change , so many crores of people in this large country it is very big task to move ahead .
Definitely researches on this matter .
All the decisions have been taken concentration by mixing the state , central governments .
The results of the concentration of those concentrations do not fall any kind of weight in the lice .
What was the price of anything that was before the GST, in the new conditions, how much the price is that, all the things are available in the GST app can be easily known by your mobile phones.
How good , friendly environment has been created between the government , businessmen . It has played an important role in increasing faith between the government , government .
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries, all the departments, central governments and state governments participating in this program.
GST is an important example of the entire country of India .
If you want to say a way , this is a social museum .
For making such a big attempt easy victory once again I am making the fort of all the countrymen of crores of crores .
The beloved country is Vasulara , August i . . the month of revolution .
Naturally we started listening to the help of 1 August 1920 .
On 9th August, 1942, the uit India Movement was launched, which is also called August Revolution.
The independence of 15 August 1947 came to the country .
Seeing a way , all the incidents happening in the month of August are also specially drowned with the history of freedom fighters .
Our new generation should know what happened in August 9th honey in 1942 .
For the independence of 1857 to 1942 the people of the country were drowned with the independence of the country , which is the inspiration for the construction of India .
On the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians led their lives to the flow of the garden with the mantra of 'Doo RD'.
Lakhs of youths stopped their studies , left books .
The great men like Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan have played a major role in the park.
In 1920, the uit India Movement in 1942 showcased two forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1942, the rapidity of the movement has increased so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi has also given the mantra "DoRD" and the people are behind it.
I sometimes think that once the history of India has been roaming around , the first freedom movement of India started in 1857 .
Then the initial freedom struggle of 1942 is happening in some corner of the country .
This long time has produced independence in the minds of the people of the country .
Everybody was ready to decide something or the other .
This industry occurring in 1857 had reached the last stage of the last stage of 1942 .
The garden of ueen India has changed so much that in the other five decades the British had to leave the country in 1947 .
1857 AD this independence reached all the people of this independence .
Besides 1942 AD along with the five decades of 1947 all the people were determined to give freedom to the country successfully .
These five stools are like a stool .
Now I will meet you with a stories .
In 1947 we got freedom .
Now 2017.
About fifty years were spent .
Governments came .
Arrangements have been made , Marai , increase , increase .
Everybody tried to get out of the problems of the country .
I noticed that the five dates of 2017 to 2022 were also associated with the contribution of five dates .
Try to complete them .
As from 1942 to 1947, five miles of freedom of the country
These five dates , i . . from 2017 to 2022 . India should also give miles for the future of India .
After five decades the freedom fighters of the country are celebrated .
Therefore all of us should make a strong alternative .
Our contribution should be done in the year 2017 .
Every Indian, social organisation, regional departments of local organisations, schools, art galleries, different organisations, each one will also enjoy a New India.
Come on, we are part of this conscious festival .
I would like to invite my young friends, my young friends and young colleagues to come forward to cooperate with creative methods for building a New India.
Bring new thoughts by using technology , video , posts , Blags , new thoughts .
We forget this procedure as a population .
In the Narendra Modi App, I will also explore uit India quiz for young friends.
This ueen is useful to introduce the freedom fighters by connecting with the history of our country .
I believe that you will definitely make an extensive proposal for this attempt , spread all directions .
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, I will get the opportunity to interact with the people of the country from the Red Fort as the Prime Minister of the country.
The sound of hundreds of old crores of people from the Red Fort reflects .
It is an attempt to give the form of words to the dreams . In the last three thrices of the country on 15th August I should talk about what things , suggestions , advices are being given .
This time too, I invite you to MyGov or Narendra Modi App that you must send your thoughts.
In the last three-three August 15 pregnancy I heard that my delivery takes long time .
That is why I decided to reduce the time of my progress this time .
My dear country residents , I proposed another thing .

Who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhiji
Mahatma Gandhi had many times said, "Any must care about a world one will not see".
That is , we should also think about the world to see , take precautions .
You must have seen that the power of nature is that when a glass of water comes very tired then how fresh it comes to the mouth .
On getting tired very tired , on opening the windows of the room , opening the doors , taking fresh air new consciousness comes .
That is why the world 's attempt to drown with the nature of June is also our own attempt .

I'm lying down to Akbar's father.
The beloved people of my country , this time we keep raining all around the country . environment changes .

My generation is many good wishes , thanks .
My beloved people of my country , Namaskar .
Perhaps people have become habit of these problems .
The subjects of children , youths , experience of elders etc . are coming in my sight .
While traveling in the bus , train someone comes to cough , immediately someone comes and gives some advice .
It is said that advice , suggestions are in our nature .
To reach me , to give advice , many people are doing something in their life .
With some good handicappedness their intelligence , strength , capacity keep changing according to the situation .
Some people also give advice to their advice at the place of working , the rest of the people who have heard that they have become a collective form and with the purpose of changing their help .

May is a day of the establishment of Maharashtra , Gujarat states .
This conclusion is many acquaintances of the people of these two states .
Both the states have constantly tried to cross many new development peaks .
In both the states the continuous efforts of Mahapurush , every kind of society of the society keep encouraging their life .
While reminding these great men , on the day of the independence of the state the seventy five decades i . . 2022 , we all our states , our society , all our cities , all our families .
Make a plan to confirm that alternative . walk ahead with the help of all the people .
On the second time these two states are my luxury .
In our country the rapidity of summers living in the months of May , June this time has to be felt in the month of April .
That is why this time I am consulting advice for words in mind , maximum advice has been given to take any precaution in this summer .
All these are also not new . but it is also good to remember them at the right time .
It is said that Balkani , Daba Pana , birds should keep water for birds .
In many families small children have also seen this work .
Once this work comes in their eyes , if birds come ten times a day or there is no water in the pot .
This is a unique experience of taking a feeling of experience in the minds of falling .
Although in our country the things related to animals , natural life with nature are very well known but it is necessary to give strength to such efforts .
When I was the main minister of Gujarat , Daudi Bohra society came to the Sayyadna of the Dharamshala of the society of the society of the society of the society .
They lived a hundred three times .
For the festivals of their hundredth birthday the society of Bohra society has run a very big garden for preserving the pinnacles by their Burhani Foundation .
I got the opportunity to start it .
They sent around the world about fifty two thousand bird federals.
This was also recognised in Guinn Film Book of World Records.
Sometimes we become so much that we are not able to take paper , milk , vegetables , Post Man , such that in this summer days somebody drinks good water in the gate .
Young friends , I want to tell some things with you also .
It is said that in our youth many people like to spend life in confert zone .
Mother 's parents are also reproductive in a protective environment .
There are also people living different from this but most of the people living in the computer zones are seen.
Now the test is done , to enjoy the cells .
After the summer season the cosmetics remain well .
I want to tell you how to spend your summers like a friend .
Somebody definitely use it , tells me that I am sure .
If you want to hear this , not seeing , thinking , unknown places then go .
Try to new places , new experiences , new experiences .
I want to know that why is your interest in these summer holidays try to know them .
Give new use .
Use is positive . You should bring you out of your computer zone .
We are of the comfortable families of the middle class .
What is the matter of those travellers , what do they do after getting down at the station
In the evening go to the buses with your football , Wali Baal or some other sports objects .
Play yourself with those poor children, then look at that game you will get the enjoyment of never getting in life.
If you get the opportunity of playing such a life in the society then know how many changes come in their life .
I can say with faith that if you go back once again .
This experience will teach you a lot .
To reduce the technological distances , the borders have come to scatter , but its ill effects have changed as if six persons living in one house are also in one room but it is also beautiful to imagine the distance between them .
Can you try to spend time with you away from technology
If we pay attention to the country full of many varieties then we get to learn something in our surroundings .
If you do not come to this , learn . Drinking , do not come to the best idol then try to give something a thousand .
If we feel small tasks then we can not learn some tasks of our mind at times .
You can learn to walk on car but sometimes it feels like learning auto rickshaw .
You might have come to put a cycle but never try to carry a triangular car to the people .
You see, this new attempts , new expertise can not only give you happiness , but also bring your life out of it .
Keep showing insects to your friends .
I am told by my experience , we can not even imagine how much learning the world , how much possible we can not imagine .
See new places , new villages , new cities , new villages , new villages , new places .
But before going wherever you are going , if you try to see a gynaecology , to know , to discuss with people , asking water etc . then the joy of seeing those places is different .
That is why you get the opportunity to learn how much .
Friends , this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity .
New generations are getting rid of the river nearby.
They are not necessary with river .
They started believing the digital currency .
Do you also believe , but do you ever think that you can get through this plan
The government of India has made a plan .
You've been loading the BHIM app down.
Send it to each other .
If you want to spend with twenty people in the day then you will get two rupees in the evening .
This plan is implemented till 14th October .
In this way, you will be able to create Digital India.
New India becomes your own copper .
The holidays , sandalwood .
Refer - Archaeologically .
Normally there is a climate of S . . . culture in our country .
Now even if the red light is not on the vehicles , the red light that has come out in the brain has not been able to say hard .
I am speaking from Prime Minister Garu and Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh to Shiva Chaube.
I want to talk about the government's decision red beacon light ban.
I felt very pride to read it .
Now my time has also been enjoyed as much as possible .
I don't want to narrow the traffic jams.
I want to tell you the blessings of my heart for this decision .
Red Fort is a part of the arrangement of Red Fort through the decision of the government .
The importance of EPIs in place of VIPs in the country is a New India spirit.
In place of VIPs, I say that my feelings are clear - every person is important.
Every person has the importance , every person has the importance .
If we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country , then if we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country , then how big power is to fulfill the important dreams .
Do this work together .
I always say that my dear countrymen , we keep reminding our history , our culture , our traditional traditions again and again .
Therefore we get strength , inspiration .
This year all the residents of 125 crores of our country are celebrating their thousand Jayanti .
Because of some reason we are so much that we are thinking so small that most of the centuries are thinking about for a century .
Do imagine cosmetics .
It is also so difficult to come out by bringing out the society .
How was it before thousands
Ramanajacharya had done very big fight against the opposite of the society , description , unconsciousness , species etc . during his time .
They embrace the society by their switching jewellery , they all embraced .
Before thousands he got permission to enter the house , to give them entry into the house .
In every age it is our vision to keep the great men from our society to end the evil of that time .
Today, we are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Ramanajacharya, we are inspired by him in our efforts to enhance social unity.
Tomorrow the Government of India has released a Tapala Bridge in the memory of the Swami Ramayana dynasty .
I am telling the prayers of Swami Ram dynasty .
My beloved people of my country , tomorrow there is another speciality of one Tarikh .
It is celebrated in many places in the world as the Day of Labour.
It is natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedakar in the memory of Babasaheb Ambedakar .
If I say about Babasaheb Ambedkar , Swami Ramayanas , then the twelfth century of Karnataka , the society of the society of the twelfth century is also remembered .
In the twelfth century, he had deep thoughts on the subject of labour and labour in Kannada language.
In Kannada Bashan he called Kai Kai Kailas .
It means that you can achieve the house of Shiva with your own industry.
That is , heaven is obtained by doing karma .
If you want to say in another thing , Shree Shiva .
It is natural to remind me of Dattupat Thangdi dynasty while talking about labors .
People of my favorite country , in some days we celebrate Buddhapurni .
All the followers of Lord Buddha celebrate festivals worldwide .
I am fortunate to celebrate Vesak Day by the United States on the occasion of Buddha Purnima.
This seventh is celebrated in Sri Lanka .
On this sacred day I get the opportunity to offer Buddha to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka .
The opportunity to remind their memories is available .
My dear countrymen, I have always tried to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' in India.
In India, when 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', it is not only in India but also in the world.
Especially our two neighbouring countries are also described .
Our neighbouring countries should be supported , development should be done for them .
Many uses are being done .
May 5 India has used the museum of South Asia .
This museum is capable of capacity , how much useful is to fulfill the economic , developmental priorities of South Asia .
This museum helps in making a picture of natural vegetation , tele-medicine Ina , electronic technologies , technologists , technologists , technologists , interactions between people .
People of my favorite country , sunshine are fast . Protect yourself , save you .
Most of the families of the country are standing in the tests of their children .
In the families of those who have been tested there is a climate with stress in the families of cosmetic environment , testing .
At such a time, I can say the same thing that I have told the students in Mansulo words again.
In a historical war against unjust opposite opposite opposite opposite to Bangladesh has been successful .
On such a special day independent Bangladesh 's brothers , brothers , brothers , brothers , brothers of Bangladesh want to go ahead in the development of Bangladesh .
Bangladesh is a strong friend, a good friend with you and it will continue to provide Indias full support to step in the direction of development by preserving peaceful security in this entire region.
The memories of our Ravindranath Tagore are pride with the tradition of our two countries .
Because Bangladesh is the creation of our Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore .
It is an interesting thing about Rabindranath Tagore that he was the first person who gave the Nobel Prize in 1913, and not only the British gave him the title of Knighthood.
In 1919 when the British created the Maranhom in Jalianwala Bagh , Rabindranath Tagore is also one of the great men opposite to them .
This incident is the time of showing strong effect on the mind of a twelve children .
In the childhood to spend singing this Jalianwala Bagh has given an inspiration to the life of that child .
In 1919 that small Bhagwan is the beloved of all of us , inspired Amarvir Bhagat Singh .
Three days Christian March 23th honey Bhagat Singh , his other two friends Sukhdev , Rajguru were climbed to the excitement of the English .
This incident Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru without the death of three , we all know that without the death of India the happiness of the mother of India has been left .
We cannot even put the story of the dedication of the life of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Raj Guru in the akshays.
The kingdom of Yavat was afraid of these three .
They were in jail while they were in jail , how much worry was the British .
Therefore nobody had to pay attention to the education of 24th honey in the month of March , on March 23th honey training was done .
Besides this their dead bodies were brought to the Punjab region by stealing them .
Many years ago when I went to that place for the first time there was a kind of progress in my body .
Whenever I get the opportunity, I suggest to the youth of the country to visit the maternal grandsons of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Raj Guru, and the tombs of Batukeshwar.
At that time it is called for freedom , its rapidity , its quantity is increasing .
On one side these people like Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru were inspired by the youths .
The truth of Mahatma Gandhi Champaran was done on the 10th April of 1917 .
This is the year of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the fight of independence of India Gandhi Waddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd .
Especially this incident is a milestone in the entire journey of fighting for freedom from Taluku methods .
During this time, the Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, Mille Labour of Ahmedabad, all of them have a strong impact on the thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi and behavior style.
Only two works made by a man who returned to India in 1915.
The power to know the society of the Indian society , the power to know the society of the Indian society , the people of the British empire , to fight , to inspire the people of the British empire , to fight , to fight , to bring in the market , to fight , to fight , to fight , to show the marvellous powers of Mahatma Gandhi , that is why we can see the world of Gandhiji .
If you know about the Gandhiji of the Champaran Satyagraha happening in one hundred years , then how much is the opportunity of knowing the truth of any person starting the normal life .
How to start ordinary life , how much industry itself , how much Gandhiji had done Gandhiji can learn from him .
Like Rajendra Babu , Acharya Kripalani dynasty we sent the village of Gandhi village at the same time .
In the work of people associated with people , how to teach it the color of freedom fighting .
A wonderful balance is in the work style of Gandhiji .
The desire of hundred crores of people to bring change , attempts , these are the strong foundation of new India , India .
There's a desire, a resolution, a zeal.
Beloved my countrymen, if we come out of all the lives of our country, seeing the works being done in the society with cosmetics , seeing what happens in the society , if we try to understand , then the goals of the goals are not able to do anything for the society , for the society , for the society .
It is also like a penance , meditation , like a kiss service they are doing their work .
There are many people who serve patients by going to the hospital daily .
There are some people who run along with blood donation .
They are some who give food to food .
Once seeing it in the form of social , incidents it is known with such a big power .
All these are not celebrated with the budget evening , government projects , government funds .
But whenever you look at the country, the dream of New India of the people of hundreds of crores of people of the country will be seen in front of our eyes.
It is said that everybody should participate the responsibilities of Paura .
Then the same New India starts a dream .
2022 Kalla is the independence of India and 75 years . Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Raj Guru .
Champaran Satyagraha is done .
Would we also participate in the journey of 'Swaraj to Suraj' by regulating our lives
In the last few months the environment of our country is monthd , very big people have participated in the designs , designs .
After the rubbing of mouth a lot of increase can be seen in the methods of various digital churches .
About one and a half crore people have made this app download for two-and-a-half months since the launch of Bhima App.
The people of my country , black wealth , they have to move forward to fight against water .
Can the people of hundred crores of old people of the country imagine that during this year two and a half thousand crores of digital Lavadevis can be celebrated
We declared in the budget.
This work done for the people of hundred crores of old people of the country has not been done for a year .
You can complete in six months .
All these can be done in daily life .
That is why you can not imagine how much service you can do to the country . Black money , which can change yourself as a soldier in fighting against water .
To give all these to the people , to make people aware of the people in the last few days many programs of Digi - Dhan Mela have been done .
In Jawad country such hundred programs have been concluded .
80 - 85 programs have been done .
The multicoloured multicoloured multicoloured multicoloured for traders were given fifty thousand .
Everybody has been able to run this work ahead .
Earlier April 14 Dr . Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti this Disease fair ends .
On the completion of hundred days a big event was celebrated .
The biggest drag is determined in it .
I believe that Dr . Babasaheb Ambedakar Jayanti has left us so much time , that is why Bhima Yap is being published .
Reducing the river , reducing the behavior with mouths , make our contribution .
My dear countrymen, I am delighted to have many kinds of suggestions when I asked for advice in Mansu.
But in the matter of cleanliness every time there are listening .
The eleventh class Gayatri had sent a message by phone from Deh Radon and sent a message . Honble Prime Minister Garu , Prime Minister Garu , my honourable greetings to you.
First of all this thing is that you have many luxurys to spend with maximum numbers .
I want to talk to you in my mind .
I want to tell people how important cleanliness .
I will travel everyday on a river polluted by putting a lot of garbage .
Our house is hidden on the Rispana bridge of that river .
I recognize it very well .
I want to get angry in the minds of hundred crores of people .
Once anger starts , satisfaction starts , we apply to do something or the other .
The best , active part is , the garden is very important for them .
But cleanliness is always drowned with a habit even more than the garden .
I believe that this feeling of waking up in the students of the country , in children , students , youths is a good result .
We know that we have eaten in the house , we also put food in our diet more than necessary in the food .
It becomes difficult to eat after putting everything in a spoon .
Half of them are not able to put in the stomach , leaving there .
Have you ever thought of how much damage we are leaving these sweet substances
If you do not leave by swallowing like this , then do you think that the stomach of lice can be filled with lice
It is not a matter of understanding .
It is said that in our houses how much food can be eaten as much as the child is eaten .
But such a thing is that it is also good for family .
They made some mobile yps .
At some places in every state of our country such people will be seen to you .
The life of water also gives us support to take as much as we can eat .
Look , these paths are there for change .
Those who take precaution to the body , health , sometimes they say that keep a little empty in the stomach , keep a little empty in the spoon .
It is a matter of health that April is the world health day of 7th Tarikh .
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) i. e.
This time Ikrajya Samiti April 7th Tarikh World Health Organisation has been paid attention to depression .
According to one estimate people are suffering from psychological depression on 35 crores of the world .
The danger is that in those around us we also consider this thing that we also like to talk about this thing .
The person afflicted with depression is also not talking about it because that person is also ashamed to discuss it .
I want to tell the people of the country that they do not think that they are free from depression.
On making a psychological environment one starts getting rid of .
The first mantra is that instead of supplementation x - ration is necessary .
Tell your friends , mothers , mothers , mothers , mothers , teachers , what do you think with meditations
Children living in the house sometimes suffer from loneliness.
The privilege of our country is that we have grown up in the spit families and have joined the big families so that there is no shape of depression.
They believe that the first step towards depression .
This is the best alternative .
This depression is the cause of physical , mental diseases .
As diabetes is the root of all kinds of diseases , such depression also does not stand , fighting , adventurous decisions , taking decisions .
There is also another method .
When you meet others , when you do any service , when you do not serve regularly , you can make the weight of your mind easier .

Several people do not know about the use of ISROs in the Narendramodi App called Shobha Jalan, so you want to provide some information about the interceptor Missels using 104 museums.
Blessed is the blessings of Bolede for reminding India's pride.
They have achieved a place that can be achieved through technology and science, if we want to discover poverty, prevent diseases, all knowledge and information from the world.
February 15th February is a glorious day in the lives of Indians .
Our scientists have done the important task of lifting up the head with the pride of the world .
He completed many unparalleled experiments in ISRO -LRB- ISRO -RRB- for some time .
The ISRO has set up a world record in the space sector a few days ago after successful uses such as "Mars Mission", "Mangalya Yan" etc.
Once 104 museums were sent to the space of the history , the first country of India was standing .
It is a matter of enjoying the use of 38th victory of PSA .
This is not only a history of ISRO but also a history of India.
This space programme, run by ISRO at a very low cost, has turned into a marvellous world
The scientists of India have displayed this victory with the large heart of the whole world .
Brothers and sisters , these 104 museums are main among the 104 museums of India cartosat 2 .
How useful is the pictures taken by this calculation , forest maping , economic estimations , development plans , city development plans etc .
Especially for my brothers and sisters wherever the roots of water are there in the country , how should they use them , and what is the main thing to keep in mind , on the other hand cartosate helps us .
Some pictures were sent while going to our Shatilate .
It started his work only .
It is a matter of joy that all this program has been done by our youth scientists , women scientists .
Youth , women , this strong partner is a prideful thing in the victory of Isro .

For people , for the service of the country , to keep the goal of space science forever they are also monthly new records .
Our scientists , how many adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurously we told .
The second question related to the Bhadrata of India has also been given .
In this matter India has also studied another important success .
There is no big church about this thing but it has been seen on this main thing .
In the protection of India Balstick International Missil has also been tested successfully .
Their tuberculosis of interception technology has been successful in identifying the tuberculosis of the enemies from the height of 100 kilometres near the ground .
Our scientists have seen this .
Its power is that even if any tuberculosis comes to capture India from a distance of 2000 kms, then our tuberculosis has the power to destroy it in space.
On seeing new technology , on getting any science new victory we get enjoyed .
In the journey of human life Taluku development the jynasty has played a very important role .
Special knowledge , talents do not let their gynaecology be like gynaecology .
The same gynaecology is the cause of new research .
Their questions are found peacefully , but the scientific people do not sleep .
If we discover the journey of human life Taluku thousands of years then we can say that this human life is not so much for the journey of Taluku development .
It is impossible .
Everything , creation rules , human mind keeps trying to know the mind .
Although every new technology , new science gives birth to a new age .
My dear youngsters, science and scientific industries, I have been talking about Mann Ki Baat many times in our youth to enhance the attraction of science.
Many scientists of the country are necessary .
Today scientists are the reason of a permanent change in the lifestyle of future generations .
Mahatma Gandhi says no science has droped the skies in a perfect form.
Scientists always keep in mind the needs of ordinary people , how can they use their principles naturally , they should take care of any technique , because the common man is very beneficial .
I felt that how much important work was done on seeing such creativeness , exhibition , exhibition , exhibition of people , such creative objects are useful for people , how to produce such a height , how to use them , how much important they have done .
I saw a discovery of Italy .
Several rains occurred in Mumbai in 2005.
Its meaning is that in the society , in the society , in the country , this kind of role is very important .
Our society also gives a lot of technological direction .
All the arrangements are also running in the direction of technology .
In a way, technology has become a different part of our lives.
In the last few days design has been very strong .
Gradually people move forward towards digital currency leaving the river .
In India also digital Lavadevi is developing very fast .
Especially youngsters are habit of making their digital phones from their mobile phones .
I think this is the sign of a humble sign .
A few days ago, our country has got a lot of strength for 'Laki Grahak Yojana' and 'DG-Business Yojana'.
Through these two schemes, an attempt has been made to transform river flow into a mass movement in India.
In this plan more than 100 Khatadars have been obtained according to lakhs of each other .
More than four thousand traders have got a gift according to fifty thousand .
Or if I ask the descriptions of this description , then I am enjoyed to know that besides the fifteen years of the adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous age .
Expressing his joy from Mysore, Shri Anand ji wrote that he received a thousand rupees prize in Laki Grahak Yojana at Narendra Modi App.
And I felt that the lice of that lice found me a thousand rupees , and gave her a thousand rupees .
Everybody keeps telling things related to digital .
How excited things are also encouraged , others are also encouraged .
The puja of Pizza of Maharashtra is also a young friend of Namade , how does the use of card , e-veils happen in his family , how much enjoyment is being done in his family , how much enjoyment is being done with his friends .
It is said that it is so precious to come to lakhs , he takes it a garden , encourages others for this .
In my view , everybody related to this work is a new team of water in this country .
One way you're clean soldiers.
April is a dragon of some crores of rupees .
There are 40,45 days near it .
Can you do your work while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Some days Christian Baba Saheb Ambedakar had done 125th Jayanti .
Remembering them also teach at least 125 people to do BHIM APP download .
This time both Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti , BHIM APP , give special special speciality .
Therefore I say that we should strengthen the foundation of Baba Saheb .
Go to the house and join all the hands with 125 crore hands, include BHIM APP.
The effect of this park happening for the last two-three months is that in many times , many villages , many cities have been successful .
Dear country residents of my country , agriculture is a big pillar of our country 's economy .
The economy of villages gives strength to the economy of the country .
Now I want to tell you a joyful thing .
Our brother , brothers , brothers have filled our grains .
This seventh year with the hard work of rails in our country grains have been produced in the record level .
Our rails told all the signals that all the old records were engraved .
This time the fruits in the fields seem to be celebrated everyday , Pongal , Baisakhi festivals .
This year approximately two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country .
This time 8  is more emotional than the emotional record named our rails .
This is so much successful .
I specially appreciate the rails of the country .
Because apart from traditional fruits they kept in mind the poor people , various types of lentils have been collected because the poor provide the most protein with dal .
Keeping in mind the need of the poor people of the country near about two hundred nine hundred hectares of pulses in the land of various kinds of pulses has given me a lot of joy .
This is not only the product of various types of pulses , but also the important service done for the poor people of my country .
My prayer , my hearing , my country ' s rails have produced the record of pulses by putting them on the ground . Therefore my brothers and sisters are a special kind of appreciation .
My dear countrymen, by the government of our country, by the society, by the society, by the institutions, by everybody, some work is being done in the direction of cleanliness.
In a way, everybody is seen to be very compassionately related to cleanliness in some form.
The government is also constantly trying .
Six house toilet pits were empty , healed them .
Town Pit Toilets were empty , then the rulers were seen themselves to use that toilet sheep again .
How do we clean other cleans , this toilet can also be cleaned in such a way .
Because when a AIDS ruler cleansed the toilet sheep himself then it is natural to attract the attention of the people of the country .
It has also been proved.
A Standard Town Pit Toilet for a family of six members is filled in five dates.
After that he can easily turn into another pit .
In six to twelve months the breasts accumulated in the toilet sheep are completely burnt .
The government takes this way in front of the government , others also use such a way .
Cleanliness Festivals continue to be held in various departments in the government.
In the first round of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with the Ministry of Women and Child Development, will also be giving a boost to the Swachhta programme.
We welcome the exhibition of our Divyang sportspersons in Rio Paralimpics.
The pride of this glorious work of Divya friends is proud .
Always have to learn from them that there is something or the other .
The matter related to sports , space related to space women of our country do not take anybody .
They are moving ahead while stepping in the foot . They are increasing the country with their victory .
Our country's women sportspersons have won the silver medal in the Asia Ragbi Senses Trophy.
My heartiest congratulations to all of them.
On the 8th honey of March the whole world also celebrates the day of women .
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Now this is not only a government program .
As a social movement, it has become a mass education programme.
Last two times this program attracted the hearts of the common people .
This problem occurring in all the corners of the country has been thinking about the people of this problem .
As soon as the child is born then how enjoys the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologists .
In a way girls are the reason of their social voluntary voluntaryness .
The girls can be stopped by a special program in the Kadlu district of Tamilnadu state .

Manki Baat , August 2019 .
Our country is enjoying rain on one side .
On the other hand all the festivals of Deepavali are held in the roots of Hindustan .
Perhaps our ancestors, in any situation, the cycle and the economic cycle of the society have created a system of life.
Till now we have celebrated many festivals .
The birthplace of Sri Krishna has been done throughout the Hindustan .
It is said that there is a personality , even after spending thousands of years every festival takes a new sports , it is said that nobody can imagine new energy .
Today I am talking to you two important mohans .
One Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan , one Charkhadhar .
And when Sudarshan Chakradhari had left the shore of Yamuna, and went to the sea shore of Gujarat, and established in the city of Dwarka, the jewel of the sea shore came to the edge of Yamuna, and spent the last moments of life in Delhi.
In the condition of Sudarshan Chakradhara Mohan had completely used his intelligence , ability , his scientific thought , to stop the war , to stop the war , to stop the war .
At the same time, India is organising another major festival.
Not only India , this church is happening throughout the world . O my favorite country .
I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served the rails of Vishakhapattanam in Champaran .
To remove many delusions related to the disease of blood pitta they themselves served the patients of blood pitta .
It has been an example of his life by service .
This thing can be understood properly from the life of Bapuji .
Mahatma Gandhi 's personality , society , humans , humanity was this very special .
Phinix Farm of Africa , Tol Stay Farm , Sabarmati Ashram , Wardha , all the places , in its special way the society of society , community mobilization was their support .
All these feelings of society , society community community community community community community is necessary to bring us into our business life .
It is true that this is the true faith of Mahatma Gandhi , real work .
We think that we are associated with people in the society , associated with all the classes , with all the ages , the village is a male or the society associated with everyone , one person can do what I can do with me .
The cost of the cost of my generation is good .
Community is our strength .
In the programs happening in this 150th year the collection , service is also not available .
Our woman is Ladys club .
We have done the work of Ladies Club in the modern era, but we have joined the Ledies Club with a service programme.
I can do a lot.
Recognizing books , scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific science .
There is no limit in the mind that if good aspiration, goodwill, goodwill, goodwill and goodwill are sufficient to serve with complete integrity.
It is also comfortable. It is enough for a unique joy.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
Dancy of salt Satyagraha is a very important turn in the fight of freedom.
I participated in the inauguration of a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
By this others also write three four things while expressing your feelings along with those photographs .
During the time of coming many programs , competitions , exhibitions have been organised .
But in this context I want to share an interesting thing with you .
Venice Biennale is a famous art exhibition where artists from all over the world meet.
This time, an interesting exhibition was organised with Gandhi Memorial at the Indian building of Venice Biennale.
In this Haripura Panels is specially interested .
In Haripura of Gujarat the concert of Kangras is celebrated , in which the history of being the student of Subhash Chandrabos is remembered .
This art panel has a beautiful past.
Prior to the meeting of Haripura of Kangras in 1937-38, Princepal Nandlal Bose, the technician of Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan Art Bhavan, was invited.
Gandhiji acknowledged the exhibition of his art work in this meeting to showcase his lifestyle in India through art.
The artificial work of our state is this Nandal Bose .
The state has given a special identity to the state .
The artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic .
After touring villages around Nandlal Bose Haripura , finally a art canvas was built by showing the life of rural India .
There was a great discussion in Venice about this invaluable artistic pragma.
On the occasion of Gandhijis 150th birth anniversary, I would like to convey a resolution from every Hindustan.
For the country , society , for others something should be done .
That's the right, real accuracy of Bapu.
This time it starts from 11 September .
At this time we came out of our houses and dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi with hard work .
But house , street , but sandalwood , but art gallery but in all public places clean parks should be organised .
This time pay more attention to plastic .
I said that while talking to the fort of August 15 hundred crore people of the country were encouraged with enthusiasm , energy , I told that in Bahraang places the work of getting free from excretion of excretion .
Likewise, all of us should stop the single use plastic's vault.
All sections of the society are enthusiastic about this process.
With this, money will be lost, it will play its role in environmental protection.
This time in the context of celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of 2 October Bapuji not only dedicated to India released from the excretion of Bahraang urinary urinary urinary urinary urinary urinary urinary tract but also the foundation of the project against plastic .
I am making an apple with all the classes of the society, every village, every city.
This year Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated to free India from plastic chest .
All the Municipality , corporation , district administration , village Panchayat government , private arrangements , all the institutions , everybody , everybody has my discovery that there should be a proper arrangement of plastic utensils .
I urge all the corporate sectors to explore how to set up the disposal properly if this plastic was collected at one place.
It can be recycled .
It can be used in fuel .
Today I want to say a very important thing with a culture .
There is a lot of importance for food in our culture .
As much as we were included in science .
Nutrition is being created in modern scientific methods across the country in the Nutrition Mission.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new interesting ways .
Once one thing came to my point of view .
In Nasik, there was a big garden called dry grains.
In it in the days of the fruit harvest the services of the angles are conserved one pinch of grain from the people .
This grain is made hot food for women , children .
The person donating in this is a aware civilization of society .
This culture is done while feeding the child for the first time .
There is no liquid food .
Gujarat had a thought in 2010 and why should not the need be given to the child by giving complimentary food to the child in the context of food practice
This is very important front , it can be participated everybody .
People in many states do eat food .
A marvellous collection of service , joy is seen .
Our country can be affected by fighting with malnutrition by many small methods .
Today the right information or poor , parents are also becoming victims of malnutrition .
The month of September is celebrated as a Poshan Abhiyan throughout the country.
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, it was sure that there was a lot of questions about this thing.
In the last few weeks, wherever I went, I met the people, there was a proposal about Man Vs Wild.
Since then I did not imagine the opportunity of touching the hearts of the world in my life .
But what happened .
Last week I went to Bhutan .
As the Prime Minister, whenever I have come to visit, I am thinking of the fact that someone has been talking to me about Yoga for five-ten minutes through International Yoga Day.
I am talking about Yoga in the world 's big ground . This thing I am told about the whole world .
Discovery channel has planned to publish this program in 165 countries in their language .
People want to know the churches taken in the direction of clean environment , clean environment in our country .
But another interesting thing is that some are talking to me , Modiji , say that you are talking to Hindi , beer Grills are not Hindi .
After this do the cost of cost .
Then what happened to the cost of shooting again .
It is questioned very swimming .
See , there is no secret in it .
Many people have this question in mind . Okay , I say this secret now .
Actually it is not secret .
In fact, technology has been fully used in the conversation with Bear Grills.
I told anything that it was done in English oppositely . Because of being happening in contrary a small card lease has been kept in the ears of Bear Grills .
Therefore, when I talk in Hindi, the conversation was simple because it was listening to him in English, it was the miracle of technology.
After this show many people are seen discussing about Jim Corbett National Park .
Definitely go to places of nature, wild animals, living places.
What is the nature
You will stay on seeing .
Your interval will also be large .
On 15th August I have conveyed to you on the Red Fort . At least 15 places in the next three years , 15 places in India will be completely tourist spots .
Go, look, study, take the family, spend some time there.
Your thought becomes large .
My dear countrymen , environment protection , conservation i . . conservation is natural .
In the last month I had the point of view of releasing the population of tiger in the country .
You know how many tigers are in India .
The number of tigers in India is 2967 . two thousand nine hundred sixty seven .
It was difficult to stay half in this number below the corners .
A tiger meeting took place in St. Peters Burg in Russia about tigers in 2010.
In it information about the number of tigers decreased , one contact has been taken .
The number of tigers in the world of 2022 Kalla is double .
But this is now a new India . we complete the goals quickly .
We doubled the number of tigers here in 2019 .
Not only tigers in India but also the number of wilderness , community reserves has increased .
I also recognized the Gir lions of Gujarat while releasing the Tiger Data.
When I responsible for the main responsibility there the residence of lions in the jungles of Gir .
Their number was decreased .
We took several churches together in Gir.
In 2007 we decided to make women gardens there .
We enhance the basic amenities to enhance the tourists.
Whenever we talk about nature , wildlife then the conservation of conservation is done .
But along with safety think about taking this church towards Karnataka .
Therefore it is not only necessary to protect forests , trees , wild animals , they should also give appropriate environment to increase in the right way .
My dear countrymen, how can I forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1993
My dear countrymen, you will be remembered that on 29th August we are celebrating the National Sports Day.
In this context, we are going to launch Fit India Movement across our country.
Keep yourself fit . make the country fit .
All their descriptions are now told .
Wait 29 August .
Not only 02 October is the whole plastic Kosam .
To get rid of plastic all of us should be with the mind at all places of house , home .
I know about this thing that the dust is run in the social media .
Come , a new aspiration , new acquaintance , new energy .
I'm waiting for your suggestions, for your words.
Come, let us come forward to fulfil the dreams of freedom fighters and to fulfil the dreams of Gandhi.
Mann Ki Baat -LRB- mind -RRB- .
My beloved countrymen , Namaskar

My young friends , you all know very well , I keep talking continuously in mind .
All the months of January , February , March , April are the time of observation in every family .
There is a test of two children in the house , that test is done on everyone in the house .
I told me that this is the right time to talk to the students , their teachers , their teachers because I went to some places , whom these tests were found to be a big problem .
Family , students , studyers are seen to be dreaming everybody . a big unique psychological environment is seen in every house .
Seeing them I want to share the thought that came in my mind .
The message of a telephone came from creation.
Listen, what is the creation , sir , I want to say to you , during the tests , in our house , in two neighbouring houses , in our society a terrible environment will be monthd .
Because of this reason students are unsuccessful .
It is beneficial that those who are considered to be stressful .
That is why my goal is like a festival . tests should be considered as a festival .
On the occasion of festival , festival the best Satta situated in us comes out .
Our society is also expressed during the festival .
What is the best that is published .
The atmosphere of the festival removes the burden of the environment .
Therefore I told all the parents that you change the atmosphere of all these three-four months .
The fact is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir , from Kutch to Kamrup , from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh tests are done for three-four months .
That's why I'm calling you all "Smile Mor, Score Mor".
If you are stressful then all the doors will stop . The thing outside does not go inside , the internal matter does not come out .
Nobody has to say the cost of cost .
Why did Venthana come to mind that you had come out of the pressure .
That is why it is important medicine to increase memory that it is relaxed .
Through my sweet experience I say that if we are stressed then we forget our things , but when relaxed then how many things are not able to imagine .
Therefore, A Happy Mind is a good mark-sheet for the sector.
Sometimes it seems that we can not see the test from the right point of view .
It is not a life test .
How you live , how you want to live , how you want to live , it is not a test of food .
Apart from the tests given by mouth book in the classroom there are many more tests in your life . Therefore , carefully get out of distress that are related to the glimpse of life .
J.
The important example of Abdul Kalan is in front of all of us .
He had reached the airways .
Not found .
Someone had sent a question to me - 'The biggest challenge to see me in this time is that education has become the center of test .
That is why I want to know your thought about the future of education , its future .
There is a question in their question . But Runcha Garu also wanted to know my opinion .
You tell me , if you have a family doctor to show all your family .
You see his experience , wisdom , how useful he is .
Rucha Garu also gave the title of Pratispartha.
This is a big psychological war.
Many people specially in the life of the sports of May is that they competition with themselves .
It is a marvellous life journey to move ahead by smiting his record , smiting himself every time .

Friends, can you cross the time of reading peacefully two hours before going to the test in every field of life
Before this they could not get up at the time of decision that they could not get up at the time of getting up . Now we are getting up at the time of determination .

It gives strength inside itself .
If you want to say simplely , if you are comparing with someone then three important storeys will be seen . That is , first - first you are unknown than before them .

Once you learn to accept , the main problems will end there .
It is believed that in the roots of the problem conservation , studies are believed .
Many years ago - we know that the person is in the hospital with heart attack .
Then the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha of our country, Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, his son, once again, came to see M. P. Purushottam Mavalankar, hospital.
If we want to say that when we meet the person with disease then we fear them with the name of disease .
I told the conservations that sometimes we also move with children like this .
Do you feel any time to give the situation of laughing to the children in the days of test
By doing this , the environment changes .
I got a picture phone call.
And he said , He hath not called his name .
You will understand why he can not tell the name of the thing .
That is why I started trying a lot .
I tried to discover its methods . That is why my time has become very old .
As long as I tried to see the time after keeping the buffalo , how much time I used to read the same time , they were obtained .
Seeing how you see that it will swim towards the path of failing life .
If you are taken in the test then your life will be destroyed .
If you don't get caught then I will do this in my lifetime, not only in your mind, but also in your mind.
When you have to tell your children then you can not talk to their eyes .
If you are also turning your roads into a ditch then I have seen that some people use so much in search of new methods to see how much they keep on looking at their entire creativity, they spend for the methods of not seeing their entire creativity.
At the same time it is not necessary to see the creative , on the subjects of testing the same time .
What results are available with their own difficulty , therefore the self confidence of increasing self confidence is unique .
Your gurus , your parents will anger me .
Because students pay attention to sports are generally considered to be less attention to studies .
Definitely the thought of Asli .
The rest of the body is also important for active parts .
Give break for at least five minutes .
You know that your work is easy .
It is not known for everyone but it is my experience .
In such a situation it is very beneficial to breathe deeply .
There is no room for breathing deeply .
Going to Dabba for five minutes deep breathing , sit for reading again .
Some people start reading more than waking up all night but definitely give sleep to the body .
Your concentration will increase .
Freshness increases in you .
The capacity of your entire capacity increases well .
When I participate in so many civilizations , sometimes my throat cries .
Once a folk song came to meet me .
It is said that if you go to sleep properly then you will get a lot of rest in your voice .
I don't think of my throat, my propaganda guerrilla, my throat.
Okay, but, young friends, you are trying to test, I kept you in words in mind.

The Government of India has taken a big decision to encourage it .
How big businessmen can estimate this decision very straight .
Those traders who celebrate digital Lavadevis, instead of money in their business, the online payment method has been developed and those traders have been given relief from the income tax.
For this, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Chandrabab Nadu, has also become a committee for the study of various schemes.
But the rest of the governments also started many stories in their way , I also considered to be implemented .
Somebody said that the Government of Assam is taking decisions to give 10 percent of the taxes and business licenses to those who have paid digital loans.
If the branches of rural banks have done at least 2 digital lavadevis from January 2017 to March with their 75 percent of their use then they will get 50,000 prizes from the government.

I also urge the state governments to organise such committees.
Every state cannot do.
Each state can choose one or the other sports and prove its strength.
I wish that all the events related to the sports are also indispensable.
The role of a mother in life is as much as a teacher.
We have seen many of the teachers who love more students than they are.
They ignore their life for their disciples .

Today, I see Gopichand as a sportsperson, an excellent teacher.
On the occasion of Teacher's Day, I would like to enjoy the success of rural Gopichand and his integral spirit towards sports and sports.

It is believed that in the days of coming our youth is filling with enthusiasm of salt everybody in India .
Today, India has organised important programmes such as "Run for Rio", "Ad-Jeeva" and "Development" in Delhi city.

Yavat has glorified the world .
But when we came to the memory of the name of Abdul Kalankara then science , technology , tuberculosis , tuberculosis , tuberculosis , this painting of India appears in front of our eyes .
You can not take technology in one condition .
If this research is not a new alternative then how water standing without flowing increases pollution and spreads dirt also becomes heavy .
If we live with the help of old technology without research , then we go behind us in this world changing in this world .
Therefore in the youth the research of science , technology , technology has done many programs of their recognition .
In our schools, wherever these tincture labs are set up, we will not only sanction 60 lakh rupees for them but also for the construction of these tinctures.
If I am talking about Atal Incubation Centre then in the direction of giving the whole of ten crore rupees to the government .
Goddess India has been cut off with many more problems .
We see many problems with daily life .
These scientists encourage the Government of India by giving special archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologists .
The real attention of Abdul dream is that for the treatment of research , innovation , innovation , technology , simple complications for the treatment of our daily life problems .
It is my belief that the truth of offering us to Abdul dreams is true .
The central government works without mixing the shoulders of the shoulders to provide support to the problems related to the state government .
How many smokes , races are running that once we do not even think about us .
Not working for that patient , not fighting with disease , making new medicines , scientific researches , so that these diseases are not able to take new problems .
Therefore it is very important to be cautious in the matter of disease .
The microbes spreading the diseases of tuberculosis , malaria take so fast changes in our body that there is no effect of medicine .
In the treatment it is called antibiotic resistance .
Therefore how to say antibiotics it is necessary to follow those rules as well .
This antibiotic resistance has been built by our government .
But in the last teeth the number of mothers die because of pregnancy during pregnancy has decreased but in the pregnancy there is no safety of life in the pregnancy .
Keeping this in mind, one scheme has been launched by the name of Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Maternity Abhiyan since last few months.
This technique is organised freely in all the government health centers of the 9th star pregnant women every month .
The physicians coming forward after forgetting my hearing were thousands .
But our India is easy .
Lacs of doctors should be given by this technique .
There is a discussion about it in the country and abroad .
It is said that in India youths are pressing this thing .
In the battle of Kurukshetra also Lord Krishna is proposed about trees .
Mahabharata has been described about this in the festival of Mahabharata .
It is said in the festival of Mahabharata that if any tree is planted then it becomes the form of their seed .
There is no doubt in it .
It is also beneficial by the tree that everybody gets half a half in heaven through his children .
Therefore the parents who want their consciousness should plant good trees . increase them like their children .
A few days ago I reminded one of the examples of the girls of Pune .
It touched my heart .
In the Pune of Maharashtra in the Narayanpur village of Narayanpur in the Pune of Maharashtra the Ratu had done his own marriage very sports .
It has been done that how much of the marriage of Sonal marriage the kinsmen , friends , guests , guests have given the gift of Kesar mango plant to all .
I am surprised when I saw that picture in social media .
There is no swimming of lips in marriage . so many plants are seen .
This view of hungry is in that picture .
The scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific science has come to itself .
Many people use such uses .
I remember that when I am the main minister of Gujarat then in the Ambaji temple there tourists came in large numbers in the month of Bhadrapa .
It is said that by giving a plant to the visitors of the temples this plant is the Prasad of this plant . If you take it carefully then if you take it in your house then you will get the blessings of the girls .
Although lakhs of people had sent plants of this year lakhs of plants to the travellers .
Temples can also start the tradition of giving plants instead of Prasad in this seventh rainy season .
This day, to build houses in our country, to make houses, to make houses, to make crores of rupees have to be descended from abroad.
If the trees are planted on the banks of our fish then if the trees of mixing the work of the house , furniture are increased then after 15-20 years the government can sell them by cutting them .
The central government has also stopped the Kampa Chatti . This place more than 40 thousand crores of trees are provided to the state governments for plants .
I know that the Government of Maharashtra has started a proposal of two crores of old plants on the 1st honey of July , the seventh year of the coming three crores of plants .
The desert area of Rajasthan started so much heavy in that state and started old lacs of plants .
Old lacs of trees are not a common thing in Rajasthan.
The situation of Rajasthan is understood to those who know that the situation of land , Saram is so big .
Andhra Pradesh also decided to increase the area of forests by 2019 to 50 percent.
The Ministry of Railways has undertaken this work under the Green India Mission under the Central Government.
In Gujarat also there is a big bright tradition of Nama Mahotsav.
But the tourism of South Africa is like a pilgrimage for me .
It is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela as soon as the head of South African .
As soon as the sounds of unconscious , love , satisfaction , sounds of Gandhi , Mandela appear in front of our eyes .
My South Africa tourism visited the Phinex Centlement and the place where Mahatma Gandhi lives is famous with the name of Sarvodaya.
The most friends of Nelson Mandela , Shri Ahmad Kathrada , Srilalu Chiba , Shrijarj Bijos , Shrironi Kasriles have got the opportunity to visit all these Mahabhavas .
We want good future for our children .
I am so ruined to the sculpture of the sculpture .

You can also deceive sometimes .
Some authority is sent to Mary by making a leather pad .
Your crade card number , debit card number .

The members of our parliament also bring people from their respective places to me .
Some students came to me from Aligarh .
Seeing that enthusiasm swallowing in childhood .
They showed me photographs and made Aligarh railway station beautiful throughout the week.
The artistic paintings were put on the station .
In the plastic bottles towards the railway station this virtual garden has been given a new form of station .
Whenever you go to Aligarh then definitely see this station .
It is said that from many railway stations of the country I am giving this news to me . Local people have displayed their identity through their arts on the walls of the railway station .
Congratulations to all those who are doing such work in the country, especially to all my friends of Aligarh.
Beloved my country , along with rainy season the festivals of our country also start .
The festival of Rakshabandhan is a special festival near us .
Like the year of Christ also this year you can not give the status of security of security to the girls of our country , the prime minister of Akshay Bima Yojana or life Jyoti Bima Yojana .
This is the right meaning of security.
Although I am the first prime minister born in independent India .
Like Diwali we need a festival of all of us . You also do something good with the patriotism of the country .
You can feel that these thoughts can be heard from the top of the Red Fort .
As the Prime Minister of this country, as the chief servant of this country, tell me about those things that I should hear from the Red Fort to the country.
I got the opportunity to discover words in my mind once again .
In my view, Mann Ki Baat is not a religious practice
I am encouraged to talk with you .
I really like to join you all in the original corner of the country through the programme of mind everywhere in India.
I express my gratitude to the Akashwani for successfully broadcasting this Mann Ki Baat programme in the Akashwani region at 8 o'clock in the night.
I hope that you will be more active and enthusiasmful in seeing our democracy working with the status of people.
The hot day of summer is increasing daily .
In such a situation the tuberculosis probably increased the dream of the tuberculosis coming for a week .
Approximately every country has stuck in the effect of rapid sunshine .
Heat keeps increasing rapidly .
Animals , birds or humans .
Everybody feels pain .
Due to the reason of the obesity of tourism these problems are becoming poisonous .
By cutting trees carefully the wildlife gets broken .
If you want to say a way , human knows the nature has put a ball for swimming through swimming .
This time, the United States Committee decided the theme of ero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade for the World Tourism Day.
According to the traditions of this government, I can hold a joint meeting with all the Chief Ministers of the States of Unfortunately, but I do not do that.
I have been departed from every state and I have spent about two and a half hours to each state.
I look forward to all that every state has said.
Ordinarily, such discussions have been made by the Central Government as states, how much money every state has been spent.
It is surprising to the Central Government officials to know that some states have made excellent efforts to take care of the afflicted humans in facing water, environment, illiteracy.
I have asked them to exercise the righteousness of NITI Aayog in the best practices in all the states.
Some states, especially Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, have fully used technology.
I would like to wish that NITI Aayog will also make the efforts made by these states in future to other states.
Public participation is a strong foundation for addressing such problems.
We pray five times while we are taking it along and wishing God forgiveness.
Water is also the Prasad of God .
Therefore, water conservation, water conservation, water conservation, water conservation etc.
It is necessary to introduce more than every drop of water by absorbing the microscopic system.
In many states, our farmers are enjoying the system of cycle microscopic water harvesting and other water harvesting systems.
The objective of this is to bring the land of two-three hectares to micro-water plants every year.
Our brothers and sisters of Telangana are trying to use the water of Krishna and Godavari rivers through Mission Bhagirath.
Water Pragati Mission in Andhra Pradesh
Chhattisgarh has launched the 'Lok Suraj-Jal Suraj' campaign.
Efforts are being made to return them to the goddesses of water in the oldest states of Rajasthan and Gujarat.
He also launched the Pradhan Mantri Jal-Swavalamban Yojana in Rajasthan.
Even though the forest area of Jharkhand, there is a water stream at some places.
This is a matter of concern for the rural, the poor, the deprived, the tribals, the farmers, the residents of Patna and all the villagers.
It is a matter of happiness that how much water can be hid this time when Diwali is celebrated, how much water can be prevented.
There will be no joy for us.
The power of water is so much that we have tired of ourselves, we have so much water on our faces and we will become fresh.
Well, when we saw a big pond.
We will not save the property by putting a cosmetic mind.
We will increase the water reservoir.
Increase water .
We can bring the water back into use .
I'm pressing this thing to you.
Don't leave the next time.
In order to save water from these drops of water for four months, we will transform the 'Jal Bachao Abhiyan'.
It's not the ministers.
The responsibility of all of us is that media and media have explained extensively about water supply in the past.
They also want to guide the people in the field of water conservation, and participate in the field of manufacturing and water conservation.
I also welcome those meditations.
Let us change our old habits.
If you help me in this regard, then we will be able to develop in that direction.
I was educated even at a time, there were no coins and no mouths.
If you want salt, you can give vegetables.
The world runs towards non-free economy.
We can take diabetes through electronic technology.
There will be no fear of pockets from pockets.
There are automate numbers.
It's hard at all.
But if the habit is gradually habited then this system will be easier.
Approximately all the households of the country have opened accounts by the Prime Minister's Jan Dhan Yojana, which we launched in this meanwhile.
In the coming days, this card will be in two ways of credit and debit.
There is no need to count the pockets out of the pocket.
I don't want to deceive the dubb.
Bank on Mobile-Universal Payment Interface Banking Transactions-UPI Policy, which we have launched.
Mobile phones will make us easier to train.
If this happens then Bahusha will not work to tie the Rupee card with you.
Nearly 1.
25 lakh banking corespondents are being provided to youngsters.
But it will be as soon as it happens.
How is Bhojana.
It will become a big force for the sportspersons to know that 125 crore people are with them.
If we don't have the desired consequences, life will not stop at all.
Spirit should live with faith and move forward with self-confidence.
But a new issue has come forward and I never thought about it.
My brother.
When an e-mail comes in the site, my sight turned towards it.
He gave me the issue of Gaurav Patel from Madhya Pradesh.
He sent it as a burden on my mind.
Earlier, I used to with you to develop further.
I want all of you to say that when your child brings the results of the examination to the house, confess them in reality, rejoicing, mindfulness.
Encouraging them to achieve further development, otherwise, they have brought 100 to 100, sir.
It will also be better if something else is done.
The people around me don't recognise our situation.
Those processes don't remember properly.
But the poet had come to the forefront that I had painted me on the egg of illuminating life.
It was suggested that those who looked at the painting should shine the blue color instead of blue color, it would be better if the songs were not here.
There is no understanding of the pain of the film, but most people say that it will illuminate.
However, if you are not happy to see the fruitfulness, you can never make new constructions.
It is a pleasure and helps in achieving more.
It keeps on waiting in life.
You must have heard about the medication of Santur.
Sometimes it was only in Janpad music in the Kashmir valley.
Cleanliness is the biggest weapon to prevent diseases.
Cleanliness is of greater benefit to the poor.
The second weapon is that it is yoga that I say every time.
It is called yoga .
June 21 is International Day of Yoga.
Yoga provides the power to live comfortablely in this world full of problems.
On June 21, Yoga Day is not a programme.
We must inspire June 21 to transform our lives.
Once a collective climate is transformed into human life.
You will be a partner on 21st June.
Can we use Yoga on 21st June to make Yoga a part of our lives
This time, I will be visiting the programme in Chandigarh.
On 21st June, I will meet the people of Chandigarh with Yoga.
On that day, you will also be giving Yoga services to all along with the world.
Sirena
More thanks.
Come on, huh
Now summer time .
Everyone prepares plans for summer holidays.
Because it is also the time of mango fruits, we must taste these fruits.
We feel that once in the afternoon we take a little bit of time we feel that it will be bear .
But this year sunshine destroyed all the entertainments .
It is natural to stop the species about the heat of the heat .
Since last two years , due to the ill effect of ill effects on the places of water standing .
Sometimes due to waste, sometimes due to sand clouds, water flows in reservoirs and other reservoirs.
As a result , reservoirs can keep water less than their capacity .
To discover the problem of famine , to provide relief from water conservation , governments are trying .
But this is not the same .
Citizens are working towards commendable efforts to meet the situation.
There is now a consciousness in many villages.
Those who experience the deficiency of water can know the synonym of water .
He said that in the village Panchayati of Hiv Rebazar district of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra, these villages have identified the deficiency of water as a major and very close problem.
Anyone can see the villages that have the power to store water.
Agriculturalists in the Hive Rebazar have changed the crop seed rate and solved the problem.
That is, they have decided to shut down the process of erosion and banana.
It's very easy to hear, but it's not really easy.
How big is this decision
Anybody can imagine how the responsibilities coming to know about the tourism of such water use to the masters of the workers who have excessive water .
But see the scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific .
He said that water is required to be used for harvesting crops, so he said that it should not be sown.
Besides these fruits , cow potatoes , how less water is being used .
They followed various programmes such as sprinklers, drops of information, water horticulture, water recharging.
I can talk about a small town like Hive Rebazar, but there will be many more such villages.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the residents of such villages for their good work.
Someone told me that Gorwa village is Panchayati in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
Approximately 27 crop ponds were constructed.
Approximately 20 percent of their farm production has increased.
When the water level comes up then the quantity of water also changes.
Clean drinking water is also a cause for GDP growth.
But we are surprising that how many efforts are being made to meet the unprecedentedness around us, how new methods are required to meet.
This time why shouldn't we take the soil from the pond to the field
The field will also shine well and the power to store water for the field will also increase.
Sometimes in cement bags, sometimes in empty bags, stones, soil and water can be blocked and prevented.
He wrote in MyGov, Shri Kumar Krishna and expressed a kind of compassion.
Without public participation, we can never succeed in this thing.
Therefore, everybody has to become a messenger to bring about changes for cleanliness.
Let us talk about this thing again and again.
It also contributes to social institutions and hygiene.
Several initiatives are being taken to prevent sanitation and industrial pollution.
Every day there will be a large amount of garbage in the river Ganga through poultry.
To clean up such trees, the work is being done to remove trees from above places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna.
All local institutions have been required to explain this and clean up the plants somewhere.
The Swachhta Abhiyan is being undertaken at a distance of 3 tons from 11 tons a day.
Pollution coming from paper was almost stopped.
We are moving forward in the right direction and we are aware of it.
Kevalam is not the one who lives on the banks of the Ganges.
It is very rare to have such programmes in so many villages of the country with 10 days.
Several initiatives have been transformed into this occasion for the betterment of the village, for rural development and for democracy.
Whatever consciousness has come in villages.
Therefore, if all of us are strengthening the progress of the village then we will get the expected results.
Sharmila Dharpure, from 1975, she made her protest through the phone.
(ii) Prime Minister.
Namaskar.
I'm talking to Sharmila Dharpure from Egypt.
Shermilaji, your movement is very helpful.
Now if there is a dream of parents in every family then it will be better to read the children.
If anything comes to you, go to yourself and talk to teachers.
This engagement will reduce the depths in our education system.
Technology plays a big role in education.
Some others are coming to me on the Narendra Modi App.
I am talking to Mona Karnwal from Bijnor.
They should also have a spirit of tea and also have a good quality of teachers.
Your stress, all your suggestions and suggestions are that I have organised a meeting like NCC, NSS, India Scouts and Guides, Red Cross Chiefs and Nehru Youth Centres.
He said that this is the first time that whenever the meeting was held before this time, it is the first time that such a meeting would be held in the country's independence.
Water is doing a lot in the method of water .
But if we organise our various methods in the collective sector, we can see the greatest achievements.
Inspired, a national perspective will increase.
I have got this benefit in childhood.
I also want to revive a new life in these institutions.
This time I kept something in front of them.
Several Blacks can be dedicated to the expansion of Bahrang in many districts by making us accomplish.
Now, I'm listening to all of you.
Please give information about these youth institutions .
Have we done something new in their work and their programmes
If you come to me on my Narendra Modi app, I'll send them to the right place.
I think they can take a new pace after this meeting.
Besides, you also want to work with them.
Crores of rupees have been spent on these committees.
But the matter was somewhere else.
This is everybody's experience.
Nobody thinks it more .
Today , my dear country residents , in this matter I am very happy to keep my own poison before you .
One crore families have sanitationly covered their gas subsidy.
These fort families are not families.
It is also easier to leave the subsidies above.
App can be done in mobile phones.
Online, the subsidies can be discharged by giving Missed Call to Number 3.
I salute the families of those forty families.
This is one thing that economists in our country have also thought differently.
We should move forward in this direction.
Another thing will come to me, why do I introduce class II, class III, class III, class III and class III.
Sometimes I feel that there will be no tickets on some routes in the railway journeys.
Once you make such a feeling, there will be untouchable benefits.
Okay, these thoughts in my mind cannot change them into government rules.
However, it can also provide the environment that is possible for such people.
He added, Please insist on your officers to post a good event every day.
Every newspaper and TV channel have a breaking neus that means everything is bad.
Whether it is a good thing about our surroundings in this country of 125 crore people.
Change this situation.
Ravi had expressed his anger, but his wrath was not on me.
You must be remembered, our former President, Dr. A.
P.
Abdul Kalam used to say, "Please give a good news in all the newspapers."
These days some T . . .
If a lamp lights, darkness will be removed, it will be removed.
The Government has launched a website called "Information".
To make any positive, to talk about positive things, to bring about positive matters, we have to come together.
Many of the world will be aware of the fact that millions of people will reach the banks of the river and bathe clean.
I have been proud to upload many Singhstha Kumbh Festival photographs over the past few days.
I am sure that the tourism institutions of the Central and State Governments should hold a picture competition.
Even though the Kumbh is a spiritual festival, we should consider it as a social occasion.

My heartfelt thanks to all of you.
Like ever, I am very happy to have an unprecedented relationship between the thoughts of your mind and the thoughts of my mind.
Manki Baat , July 2019 .
Mann Ki Baat is an act of waiting for you as well.
A large number of people shared the details of various books.
People are talking about books written about science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and life history.
Sometimes I would like to talk about some more books.
I will also talk to you about other books without any doubt.
However, I am convinced that there is no time to read more books.
However, it is a benefit that if you see the details of your writings then I have a lot of bookmarks.
It seems that we need to take it forward by the experience of this month.
Why should we not put a sufficient book corner for reading new books in this Narendra Modi App
You will give us a good name to this book carner.
This is an active platform for teachers and writers.
You should be reading, writing and share with all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat.
I would extend my heartfelt congratulations to the farmers of the state and to encourage the crops that are required to be affordable, rather than their traditional agricultural policies.
Why should not such places be used for water conservation

We will continue to be a champion when a sportsperson wins the tournament.
However, in this rare event, the Champions are not participating in the sports competition.
They're champions in fighting life.

From Jodhpur, Rajasthan to Sanjiv Haripura, Kolkata to Mahendrakumar, Dr.

Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share the details of the competition and competition with the students of the country and young colleagues.
I invite youngsters in the country - a quiz competition.
The quiz competition of space, space mission of India, science and technology is the main thing.
I would like to participate in this quiz competition for young colleagues and students and make it evident and unforgettable.
I specially urge the schools, enthusiastic teachers, teachers and guardians to do their best to achieve the vision of our schools.
They will also have the opportunity to look at Chandrayaan Chandrashetra on the heights of Chandrayaan in September.
This victory will be a historic event for the winners.
But we should not forget to participate in the quiz.
I would like to inspire many of them to participate.
My dear countrymen, you must have waxed a thing.
Our Mann Ki Baat has moved ahead after asking the Swachhta Abhiyan.
And all the efforts made for cleanliness are inspired by Mann Ki Baat.
This journey, which started five years ago, is reaching new milestones of sanitation through the cooperation of all the people.
We cannot afford to pursue our vision in sanitation, but in any case, from the ODF to the Cleanliness Campaign at public places, the strength of 130 crore people.
But we stop here.
This initiative will lead to cleanliness and ease of living.
A few days ago, Mr. Yogesh Saini, his team and his stories were seen in the media.
Yogesh Saini Engineer, who left his job in America and returned to India's Mata Seva.
He laid the foundation stone of Delhi in a short span of time, not just clean but also a beautiful effort.
They also interacted with their group and from the Chettakundis of the Lothy Garden.
Through the Street Art, many parts of Delhi have been decorated by beautiful paintings.
The tradition also provides collaboration between the overbridge and the walls of the slums through their composition of beauty and collaboration.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated by street paintings in Kumbh.
We also feel this in the beauty of the Swachhta Abhiyan.
This is the story written by Mohammad Aslam Bhai in Shopia, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote that it would be better to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am very happy to say that I have played an active role in setting up of Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in our Jammu and Kashmir State.
An online monitoring system should also be there on this programme.
In about four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state, the government officials have told the villagers about government schemes and programmes, whether all these government services are reaching them or not
He said how to increase the capacity of Panchayats.
How to increase their income
Conservation of literacy, sex ratio, health, cleanliness, water conservation, electricity, water, girls education and older pension.
In Khelo, India has played sports competitions for the children of the country.
At the same time, sports kits, man raga jab cards, SC and ST certificates were shared.
Financial Literacy (Economic Literacy) Camps have been set up.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering on the occasion of development of the people of Kashmir.
During this season, we have seen around us that the land will be covered with green garments.
The Rakshabandhan Festival will also showcase the love of Sodri brothers.
You will be happy to hear another thing when the month of Shravana came and more than four years after the journey of Amarnath was visited.
More than 3 lakh pilgrims have visited the Pavitra Amarnath cave since 1st July.
The number of people participating in this journey in 60 days in 2015 is more than 28 days this time.
I will primarily commend the people of Jammu, Kashmir and their guests for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
I know that in Uttarakhand, more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham from the beginning of Chardham Yatra this time.
Tirthankars have reached this place for the first time since the terrible calamity in 2013.
For all of you, I am convinced that you should go to those places where you are beautiful during the years of the country.
To see these beauty in our country, there will be no more big teachers than the tourism journey to understand the spirit of the people of our country.
On the other hand, there are heavy years in many parts of the country.
Today the Christians of the world are celebrated on the day of Eastern festival .
This is my best wishes for everybody .
My young friends .
On one side test . on the other side T . . . cricket is the world camp match .
I know that in the evening also you are waiting for India - Australia match .
Under some days India was spent in two straight matches with Pakistan , Bangladesh water .
We are looking at the best jump in this T20 Cricket World Cup.
On this day, India and Australia will be able to play the teams and these are my best wishes to the two teams.
In the population of our country 65 percent youth is not seen any reason to stay away from the world without participating milk in the world .
This is not the work of happening .
We need to bring revolutionary changes in sports.
We can see this place in the country of India .
Like cricket now there is an interest in football , hockey , tennis , Kabdi .
You will know that in the year coming to the Afghan Ardar-17 World Cup India will give the guests of India .
Our country has come to play twenty four waters from all the world .
In 1951 , in 1962 the Indian football hair had spent golden medals in Asian Gams . And in 1956 Olympic Gams the hair of India was standing in fourth place .
From the point of view of ill effect we slipped to places from there .
I don't even want to say that our rankings are so less in FIFA.
On the other hand , in the youth of India I am thinking that I am increasing so much that it is not English Premier Leg , or Leg , or Indian Super Leg match .
Indian youngsters are giving time to know the fresh information about these matches but to see them in the television.
I have to say that when this sports are increasing so much that the opportunity of giving guests to the Afghan Afghan Ardar - 17 World Complex then we will not only fulfil our responsibility .
Or will we encourage sports by using this opportunity to benefit us
The words of football, football, football, football should be created throughout this year - if we talk about changing environment, in schools and art galleries then India is the root of every country.
Our children should be wet with sweat while playing football in our youth , markets .
Although it has been done that for giving guests we get the joy of Sicily .
Therefore , we should try to take the beauty of football village , streets .
Since then, in 2017, the FIFA under-17 World Cup will fill the youth with a kind of drive.
It is good to give the guests of this program that many basic games are formed here .
We can make every young man of our country with this game .
How can we increase this sports in the youth of India by the Afghan Afghan Ardar - 17 World Cup of 2017
How to give comparison to this sports in the government , educational institutions , social institutions .
We are watching all these places in cricket
We should also try to distribute these parlors to other sports department .
I want this opportunity to recognise the potential of Indias youth power. It is not in the meaning of a match or a ship.
2017 Afghan Afghan Ardar - 17 World Cup is ready to the guests , we can exhibit them .
While doing so, we can also boost Indias reputation.
You can send your suggestions and suggestions related to the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup to me through Narendra Modi App
How should you have songs
There should be any store in Sawani .
Think friends .
Each young man should be a messenger of FIFA Under-17 World Cup 2017.
You should participate in this program .
It is a golden opportunity to build Indias reputation.
You will think to go somewhere in my favorite students , holidays .
The water going to foreign countries is very less .
We should take this work even more ahead .
This time also do this work .
It is said that the journey without discovery was like a bird without wings .
If you are really interested to see , then you should also prepare the international attention to see them .
The journey plays a powerful role in improving life .
Now the journey in the youth of India is increasing , gynaecology .
In the first days they do not go on the way to everybody , on the way to make them ready .
They want to do something new
If we see the pictures of the guests there , then how will we go there
But this coal tourism has shown the status of Western Coal Filds Limited .
Near Sawaner village near Nagpur, Eco French Man Tourist City has been toured more than 10,000 people till now.
If you want to see something new then this is a chance for us .
This time when you go to roam in holidays then you can also do something for cleanliness .
In the scientific method this attempt is not being done but the work is done .
But if we want to strengthen the tourism of 125 crore people of the country then we can attract the world .
We can make a big part of the world tourism .
Otherwise we can show the opportunity of the youth .
Government Gani , organization , society , society , people do the work of conducting it .
Come, let's try a way in this direction.
My young friends , holidays , I do not like to make some vain in the city .
If you do not come to swimming , then you can consult this in holidays .
If you do not come to the cycle then you can take the decision of cycle in holidays .
Nowadays if you think that only two fingers are tapping on computer then why do not I learn tapping in the right way
There are many types of experts for the development of our personality .
Why should not they learn
Now see a thought .
In these you need a lot of clases , training , very big figures , big budget .
You look around you.
You must use your holidays to develop your personality , to improve your skills .
This child reminded me of what I told me by phone .
That child told me about a good work by phone .
He told me that he was doing this work as a year . Many birds had also become friends of him .
How much love is the birds of Mahadevi Varma in Hindi language .
Come, let us also do the same thing as Mahadevi Varma had said.
I am telling a special thing that I remember a special thing .

My dear brother brothers and sisters . Digital India has heard many times .

It is not true .

Do download in your mobile phones of this routine . wide information related to environment related to agriculture , environment related to environment will be available in your hands .
The baton situated in it speaks to you directly with agricultural scientists , agricultural experts .
If you ask any question then they give answers .
It is said to you .
My brothers , brothers , sisters hope that this Kisan is done on their mobile phones .
Try to try once . If you are working in it .
There is some deficiency in it , there is less information i . . you can also make me physician .
Ratu waits for rain .
But if there is no water then what is happening is the matter of thinking about all our countrymen .
During this time we stop water flowing there due to the construction of water coming to our ponds , water flowing places in our area , water coming to the ponds , the ways reaching there , or the construction of miscarriage happening there .
In the past after excavating the places , places of water in the past we can make ready to reach more water after excavating .
Filling the ponds . if our rivers , canals are filled then after that there is no deficiency of water then we do not have much harm .
But if we stand on the lap of every forest water then it is possible .
This time we were able to dig five lakh water pools .
Although now it is necessary to make any more attempt in this direction .
My beloved brother , brothers , brothers , Italy Government of India has organised a heavy rail conference .
Everybody should be in balance .
That is why the expensive expensive money remains .
And our referendum has been reduced to less and less to more crops.
This very mantra should be done , follow that we should increase in scientific methods in our agriculture .
This year, the festival will be organised throughout the world with the aegis of Beat Diabetes.
It is estimated that about six and a half crore people of our country are patients of diabetes .
Three percent deaths are the cause of diabetes .
Two types of types of diabetes are type . . . .
Type . comes dynasty .
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause of diabetes .
Physical labor decreases .
Sweating does not take it .
We can do something in our personal life to smite diabetes from the 7th honey of April .
If you are yoga i . . yoga then do yoga .
Or at least walk or race procedure .
If everybody is healthy in this India then my country is also healthy .
On 24th March the world is celebrated on the day of Tuberculosis .
When I heard the name of TB then they knew that they were afraid .
It seemed to be near the other death .
But now there is no fear of tuberculosis i . . because now everyone knows that treatment of tuberculosis is possible .
Tuberculosis i . . people around , two neighbours also recognize .
There are 13 thousand 500 centres of microscope centres in our country . 4 lakh services are available .
This test is also done free .
Get your test done once .
This disease ends .
It is necessary to get the right treatment , getting the treatment done till the disease is completely cured .
There are some main contributions in the month of April . Especially April 14 Baba Saheb Bhimb Bhimbedkar Jayanti .
He had completed the year of 125th Jayanti .
His birthplace in Mahav, his education in London, his wishes in Nagpur, his house at 26, Alipur Road in Delhi, his last acts were Chaityabhoomi.
We are constantly trying to develop in these Panchtithas .
I had the privilege of visiting his place Mahav on 14th April this year.
Baba Saheb has inspired us to change an excellent Pauri .
We can glorified him in a honourable way by changing a good Pauri on his way .
In some days the new year starts in the new year .
It is celebrated in different forms in different states .
You can hear in your mobile phone .
For this only one missed call has to be done .
This service has started only for months but 35 lakh people used it .
You also come to November .
Staying with you that I am so happy .
I would like to know from you what your aspirations are about how excellently we can use the FIFA under-17 World Cup for our benefits in 2017.
How to do this program .
The program of AIDS has given a special opportunity to do this .
They have done photographs of such grand places that seeing them really enjoys how much .
I consider it a good signal .
Whereever there is no knee of feet , like to bear feet there .
This conclusion is considered to be special impressions of Kolkata India .
In comparison to the countries of the world India is very backward in the tourism sector .
You also think about this .
I'm telling you a thing to think.
Look - you'll be happy.
I am surprised to tell you this thing again in Mann Ki Baat.
If you want to say the truth , I forgot to recognize it .
I am happy to know this thing .
For the conservation of water we should take those churches with complete care .
Many other diseases in our body are considered to be the guests of our body .
You must think about this thing .
It is said that the tuberculosis comes to the babu test .
It is said that he had come to T . . .
Its meaning is that this disease is such that it can also be tested very quickly .
But , you do not think that this work is not because of the government , doctors , medicines , therefore my inspiration for the people of the country .
Therefore , in your mind also the same way remains in your mind .
I also want to meet you in this journey .
You have so much obstruction in the matter of tests of your children , I am so observed .
But if we change our thoughts according to the tests , then perhaps we get rid of this movement .
I have already told you in Mann Ki Baat that your experiences and suggestions should not be sent by Narendra Modi App.
Today, I would like to talk to my parents, examiners and their teachers in Mann Ki Baat.
I know that in some days the tests started .
Everybody asks how to get ready for tests .
How many times come , how much scorpion is done , I told something .
You decide your goal for yourself .
While playing cricket many estimations on me , how much hopeful they were from me .
The estimation of the time has been named even more .
Then how important is I to ignore the result of this .
I decided my goals myself , I am able to conduct them so much good for the country .
I was constantly trying to achieve those goals .
The central goals were fulfilled slowly on my sight .
Egg luck.
Make your future yourself .
It is my belief that these words of Sanctuary are definitely useful for you .
Why should we not keep ourselves
Where we reached , how far we came .
Do not get stuck in the number of numbers .
One of the greatest goals of life should be decided by a dream.
Therefore if a large , high dream is made then the tests are changed into a joyful year .
In them there is a healthy mind in the healthy body itself .
If we talk about that, 365 days of our daily church should be suitable for our dreams and concepts.
The information done specially is that go to sleep regularly , get up from sleep early in the morning , we should take care of it .
Taking the entry utensil of the test center , other things should be reached before the scientific time .
Do not do this .
I believe you don't do that.
Although , in life the foundation of nutrition of victory is standing because of the roots of keeping the foundation of victory .
A strong foundation falls by regular symptoms .
They do not remain comfortable , they do the work to do in the morning and do the work to do at noon after lunch .
Not only this , our daily routine also becomes unsuccessful .
Therefore we should not see all this small vision .
Definitely, look at.
Friends .
At times I saw , two types of water is seen in the students going to the tests .
Who can say this thing better than me that I would like to enjoy the joy of Champion Vishwanathan who built the sports of the sportspersons who returned from the world.
He shares his experiences with you .
Come , to build these tests as if he learns through him .
Hello, I enjoy Vishwanathan.
I am ready to test my tests , what else my experiences are now told .
I told me that these tests were like the problems faced before life .
Therefore if you are calm , eating nutritious food , sleeping straight then your brain can remember the right peace at the right time .
Therefore stay calm .
In the last minute very important storey , see the storey that you seem to be more important , you will not remember very well again .
The joy of Vishwanath is really an important thing .
You will be able to discover how much healthy he sits in the international chariot competition .
Is Arjun not able to stand on the eyes of the bird
You are standing on the bank of a pond . Several things are seen in the water below .
Before that when there is no cost of cost then it was seen after putting stone as if there was no cost .
If water is deep , then things are also seen in it .
It takes 30 , 40 , 50 seconds but once my mind is ready to understand things .
This can be my experience and it is also useful for you .
Rajat Agarwal is a good thing .
He wrote in my App that every day we will meet at least half an hour with friends and family members in a peaceful manner.
Whenever you go somewhere with parents , then wear things .
Recognizing the present situation of Ranchi Manas, there is an attempt to reach that culture across the world outside the country.
Such a priest Murari Baba had sent an important picture for the students .
He is also a teacher , thinker , therefore there is a synonym of his words .
In your test if you move ahead with peace without any stress then definitely get successful .
It is also the pride of success .
By saying a poet, I will convey my message and good wishes. There is no law for everybody to be thankful.
Learn to live together with vacines also .
Our Honble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has said that the Mann Ki Baat programme is valuable.
I also thank him for giving a very good message to all of us .
It is a matter of how happy to me .
So much gynaecology came to be born . It seems very good to me .
I just say that you should start doing yoga from tomorrow's dawn - it will be wrong to you.
Very light results .
You must pay attention to it.
Look, you can do them.
Why does all these things do hygiene
Read these suggestions carefully . two minutes , three minutes , five minutes will go .
If the question is not understood then sometimes the question seems to be difficult .
Therefore tests of competition .
Do not lie down , work without your strength .
And I said unto all my young friends , That is .
At the same time, remember one thing - there are many opportunities in this country.
Decide what you want to do in life , do not take it forever .
You're gonna win.
Don't forget about this world mother's children.
Besides trees and mountains, you also have the right to stay here.
You have to take care of Kandalla , unparalleled feeling , meditation .
With these symptoms you will be excited in all the tests .
I want to achieve victory in every matter .
Bless you God .
Seeing , how is a great scientist talking
Whatever thing I take half an hour to say , that thing is said in three minutes .
This is the strength of science . This is the strength of scientists .
I am telling thanks to the children of the country for giving support to the children of the country .
If you are strong then fear will also be scared .
The future of gold is waiting for you to do better .
Now a message from the taste of the taste of the taste of the taste of my app has tasted the experience of its tests.
It is said that during the tests the members of their family members are constantly trying to stay in a social environment , this is the same kind of exercise happens in their families .
Sometimes there are many things that we do not think that the words of Bolead inspired us are only inspired by the students.
We all read in our schools about Thomas Elva Adison, who has discovered the electric ball.
It is said that light is filled in our life also .
The cost of victory is also hidden in the victory . Srinivas Ramanjan meaning nobody knows .
You will know that there is no traditional education in Ganesha .
Raling . Hori Poter Siris this day is changed worldwide .
Tests are not only for the students , but for the entire family , school , teachers .
But without mother , parents , teachers the situation of alone is not good .
Vijay Jindal was written on the children that they should not bear their weight .
Today there is no need to say more to the parents .
Please do not fall in tension .
If someone is talking to a friend - do not stay.
Why do I say , friends , today national science day .
The national science festival of the country is celebrated on 28 February 28 national science day .
1928 February 28 Sir C.
V.
Raman declared his research - Raman effect.
That is why he got the status of Nobel Prize .
Therefore the country is celebrated in the form of 28 national science destination .
Keep an eye on every wave .
Science , technology is not possible without technology .
Today National Science Desert has strengthened the disciplines of the country .
Knowledge , science , technology , all these should be a natural part of our development journey .
Moreover, this time, the National Science Day is the 'Make in India'.
Science Technology based innovations: Sir C.
But I want to say this thing again to all the people of the country .
The main scientist of the last century along with this research the principle of i . . steine has also been recognized in physician science .
This is the opportunity of all human species , worldwide .
In this research procedure our country kissed children , our meditation scientists also participate , to participate in it is the joy of all of us .
I would like to convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the scientists
In future also our scientists keep artificial in taking this research forward .
In the artificial situations happening in the international level India is also a partner .
In the past one important decision has been taken . In this research laser interference to conduct many more successes in this research it has been said to be the conservation of gravitational observation .
There is such arrangement at two places in the world .
India is the third .
Once again I tell all the scientists , good wishes .
From tomorrow onwards, you can listen to my Mann Ki Baat from November by giving a missed call to November.
You can also hear in your mother language .
81908-81908.
Once again I say November 81908-81908.
I also have to test tomorrow .
125 crore people of the country tested me .
That is what is known .
Tomorrow is the budget .
On hearing my words you will know how healthy I am , how much self confidence is .
Manki Baat , January 2016 .
I bow down to all of you.
This is my speech of Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
We will talk through Manki Baat in 2016.
India is a country full of diversity.
These festivals will provide an opportunity to the poor in the society to provide economic and income-payment.
Greetings to all the people of the country on the occasion of Christmas Festival 2016.
You know that I will use technologies all over the world.
It recalls that the tourist seizures will come in large numbers of countries and foreign tourists, and many Christmas holidays will go to different countries.
This news about Dilip Sinha Malviya, an old labourer in Bhojpura village of Sihore district of Madhya Pradesh.
In the village of Bhojpura, he had constructed 100 more households for now, as a pure work without taking his physical hard work.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Dilip Sinha Malviya.
I will listen to many desperate news about our country.
This is the ability to lead us ahead.
That is why it seems to be very good and collaborative to keep Dilip Singh in Mann Ki Baat.
This is the occasion of Yoga Day that our country also got such a humiliation.
Cleanliness is transformed into every household.
Nevertheless, this discussion was not widely discussed in the media.
However, I am confident that the media will reach such villages and will showcase the momentum of light.
The biggest advantage of this is that the government enterprises in this power supply will get great happiness and satisfaction.
Let us all work towards good things, good things, good things and good things to the common man.
This is also a service programme.
But you say that I should do it too
Everybody will load the Narendra Modi yp down on his mobile phone and join hands with me.
I will share small things in this app.
It is my pleasure to tell me a lot of things through this yp.
You should also be part of this effort in your own way.
How can I reach hundreds of millions of Indians without your help
Come, let us meet the common citizens and give them in the language of common man and inspire them to achieve their rights.
Can we start new start-ups, innovative and various start-ups in the midst of our states and for our youth
The world has not moved forward without new innovations and creativity.
Start-up India Stand-up India has brought a big opportunity for the youth.
My youngsters, the Government of India has brought the Start-up India-Stand-Up India to the entire work plan on January 16.
We have a feeling that the digital world and the IT industry are just start-ups.
That's the idea.
There is a reflection of the youth of Indias basic infrastructure.
On the 16th of January, I will come to you without any doubt and talk about this.
Your suggestions are always welcome.
Swami Vivekananda Jayanti on 12th January.
My people who are inspired by Swami Vivekananda are millions of people in this country.
From 1995 to 12 January, we are celebrating Swami Vivekananda Jayanti as National Youth Day.
This year will be held from 12th to 16th January in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
Dilip Chauhan, a teacher from Ahmedabad and Gujarat.
Sir, we are celebrating the Oxasable India Festival in our school.
Dilip, thank you.
Once it is called handicapped or disabled, specially a disabilized person - so many things are heard.
We know about the importance of goods as well.
Why don't you use Diabetes in place of development in our country
Whatever they are, they have one or more components full of divinity.
Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stands, railway stations, camps, parking and lifts, all the journals in the Brailley Lippy should have a creative effort to facilitate such a variety of things - technologies, systems, organisations - a close and harmonious approach.
They cannot remain dead and ruined in files.
For the common man, for the poor.
At present, there is no way to know or not.
The government has brought about some changes.
Opening of Jan Dhan Account - Aadhar card, with the help of which the subsidies have been directly accessed to the accounts of the beneficiaries through the worlds largest river replacement scheme.
I am sure that there is a place in the Guinness Book of World Records under the world's largest Electronic City Challenge Programme.
This scheme has been implemented by the name of Pehel, which has been successfully used.
On the one hand, Aadhaar card, opening of Jan Dhan Account on the other, setting up of the list of beneficiaries of the third state and central governments - linking them with Aadhaar and accounts.
The National Rural Livelihood Homi Yojana is being implemented in villages.
Now approximately 40 thousand crore rupees have been directly transferred to beneficiaries accounts through various schemes.
I am sure that obesity is being implemented by 35 to 40 projects, especially through river replacement.
It is a good congratulation to be the 125th birth anniversary of our Constitutional Secretary Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
There was also a special discussion on the Constitution in Parliament for two days.
My thought is that if you are possible in your language on the subject of Duty, Creation and Procedure before January 26, then send me a composition and composition in Hindi or English.
I want to know your ideas and ideas.
Please send my portal.
I want to know what the youth thinks about the creation of the country.
The new business activities will also be encouraging.
On the other hand, arrangements for Christmas festivals will also be started.
The festival is very important for us in social life.
Once the festival uses us to remove our wounds and once again gives new strength.
In our country, how many years of pride, immemorial years have come down.
The impact of these years in Tamil Nadu was especially affected by other states.
But now the shore of the market has changed.
It has become necessary to work towards increasing our capabilities at every level.
The government, the citizens, the people and the smaller institutions have to enhance capabilities with a deep scientific perspective.
I spoke to Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shri Nawaz Sharif after the earthquake in Nepal.
He suggested that all SAARC countries have to jointly address the vision of combating markets.
I am very happy to hear your words.
But this problem is not in one Punjab or in one Haryana.
But the feelings that you have expressed now are very true.
It's not real.
The residue of crops is also very precious.
It will help in eating cattle, so that our land will also be better.
This kind of reservoir will be benefitted twice in the land.
Once there was a chance to talk to the farmers of banana.
They told me about a good experience.
When the banana was sown, the barley was not left.
Five fingers, ten fingers and fifteen thousand rupees were spent for each hectare to read such land.
My dear countrymen, on the 3rd December, I will celebrate the International Disabilities Day all over the world.
I have spoken to you in Mann Ki Baat before this.
I also talked about the Noto Helpline for organ donation.
Organ donation saves many invaluable lives.
Organisation brings each others immortality.
I have already said that on December 3, I will be celebrating the Disabilities Day.
Today I want to tell you about Javed Ahmed.
He will be 40-42 years old.
In 1996, the terrorists were blamed on Javed Ahmed in Kashmir.
Digestion has become a part of the intestines.
Acute wound on the back.
How to improve arrangements for the disabled in the outskirts and government offices.
He also bought his readings in this regard.
He took Master Degree in social service.
There is also some factor in it.
A few days ago, the Government of Odisha was particularly proud of a hope worker on Independence Day.
In addition, the entire village of Mani Singh has been continuously evacuating mosquitoes.
Likewise, malaria has met.
My dear young friends, I have made three e-books in the MyGov site for my young friends who are very active in the Internet and Social Media.
For the satisfactory stories of a Swachh Bharat programme, the Parliament is concerned with e-books and health sectors related to villages.
Please send it to MyGov.
Bulb Bathak is one.
Once again, I have said that on the occasion of Puranami, I would like to enjoy all the lamps of the lamps and enjoy the waters in the spinal cord for an hour.
Because it's Link Jee News.
Noor Jahan of Kanpur is a woman.
On seeing TV, she doesn't seem to be more reading.
But no one can think about her doing it.
Solar power is using sun-charge to provide light to the poor.
It's fighting in the dark.
On the evening of the evening, she will take her to Lantar.
I have heard that about 500 households at a very high height will come to the dais and take lanterns.
But the whole house is light .
However, this nur Jahan will be able to recharge the solar power throughout the day.
I also congratulate GTV as it shows the world over and over the world that this work is being done once again in Kanpur.
Many congratulations.
I had a phone call from Uttar Pradesh to Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey.
I am talking to Abhishek Kumar Pandey from Gorakhpur.
I wish to convey my best wishes to the Prime Minister.
I sent a message from Gorakhpur.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana will provide funds to the underprivileged.
Mudra encouraging incentives.
Mudra Production is expected to be obtained.
Mudra really empowers.
The Mudra Yojana is going on to comfort small businesses.
The faster the speed it is required to grow.
But the beginning took place very well.
About 66 lakh people have been given Rs. 42 thousand crore from Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana in such a short span of cost.
Abhishek said that he was self-reliant about his enthusiasm.
My team also has a lot of news.
I am now aware of the fact that there is a person named Shailesh Bhosle in New Delhi.
I said that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is encouraging innovative industrialists.
The style Bhosle had shown it .
I would like to say that the aim of our Mudra Yojana is also that.
He said that he has received 40 thousand rupees from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana in respect of our motherhood in Bhopal.
She's working for the courses.
And for this, she used to do a lot of money in the past and used to do a lot of business.
Now she is doing her work better because she is coming to hand in hand once again.
She was spending more due to other reasons.
At present, there is an increase of approximately one thousand rupees per month with the availability of bank loans.
Their family has a good business gradually grown.
However, I want more publicity to this scheme.
As much as possible, small businesses should help them.
We want to give them strength.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Sardar Patel Jayanti of October 31, I propose that 'Okk Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat'.
In some cases, social life has to be sustainable.
The freedom of Maharashtra, awakening and awakening will be empowered by the sufficient absurdity.
India is an integral root.
I told you that all these suggestions are coming.
But I hope more suggestions.
I want a clear plan.
I am told that the participants are getting certificates.
Some of the big gatherings have also been made.
You also use your creative power.
Fill life .
I am sure your suggestions will be sustained.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is all over.
In order to keep the body healthy, we have done some exercise and yoga in this winter.
Therefore, we will have a good habit in good weather.
Once again my beloved countrymen greetings.
Jaihind.
I salute all of you.
The Siris was named Gandhi-Mandella Siris.
Congratulations to them because many people have started the Mann Ki Baat-Mansu in Mannsu.
I have to talk about Kerala today.
I have written a script for the first school students of St. Mary in Kerala-Kochi and Chittor.
I have sent a picture of Mother India in the shape of India.
I am surprising that why did they paint in the shape of India with their fingerprints
But I am aware of the writings written by those who want to give a very important message to them.
These girls have done the work of consciousness of the Prime Minister only.
Their aim is to transform organs into a professional and prosperity.
In my script, these girls mention that you should invite the people on the part of your Mann Ki Baat-Mansu in the programme.
Sudke Guruji, an 80-year-old ancestor of Maharashtra, has always been running a campaign.
He said that the participants should be celebrated.
In this meanwhile, I have many messages on the phone.
Devsh of Delhi also sent me such a message .
However, in this country, only 5 thousand parts of the country have been successful.
Every year, there will be a need to showcase one lakh eyes.
We are reaching up to 25 thousand.
At the place where four eyes are required, we are giving the same thing.
Once again in the road, the body parts can be donated.
There are also more statutory problems.
The National Organisation and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTO) has been established to encourage ecosystem.
1800-114770 services are available for 24-hour health lines.
It is said that the honeytechten is Bhanji Tha.
The joy of sacrifice and its best description is in the mantra of Honey Tekteen Bhanji Tha.
We have seen all these in TVs.
Today, we have celebrated the occasion of victory overnight.
Ganesh Chaturthi was also celebrated.
For the first time, we have been holding the Indian Origin on such a large scale.
We invite 54 African countries and nominees of the gathering.
Africa is the largest member of African countries.
If both of them meet then we will be the third largest population in the world.
More than 25 thousand African students are studying in India, the development of human resources, the Capacity Building.
Many of those who have been studying here are now among many countries in Africa.
It is well known in our strong relationship.
With this point of view, this event is very important.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has done a good job.
Millions of students have educated this vision.
The people of the village have seen it.
People are aware of the importance of Mahatma Gandhis role in African-India relations and the impact of Mahatma Gandhis personality in both these lands.
This was followed by several Parliamentarian friends.
He worked very carefully.
A workshop was held in Bhopal last month.
Adarsh Gram Yojana was discussed in detail by all the elders of the village, district collector, Parliamentarians and Central and State Governments.
Fortunately, if there is a bloody land in Jharkhand, we will hear all this.
Many places have been destroyed due to the impact of Left Wing Extremism.
The officers encouraged tourism.
I congratulate Shriman Kariyamunda, Members of Parliament.
Although the archaeological beauty of Nako is from Andhra .
He was elected Lok Sabha from Mizoram, the North-Eastern State of Ruwala.
He did a good job to elect Rawala Hilling village in the North-Eastern Adarsh village.
Shri Ruwalaji inaugurated the Kurtai jaggery festival on 11th March in this village.
Congratulations to Shri Ruwala ji, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, who has worked towards achieving the ideal village as well as a well-being village.
My dear brothers, brothers and sisters, how will it not be mentioned about cleanliness in this programme
This message was sent by a woman from Mumbai to Savitarai.
This time, we will also clean our houses along with Diwali.
As a result of this, the campaign on cleanliness started on the occasion of Diwali.
You have said that what we think before the festival should be brought into the form of festival after the festival.
We should do this in every public programme.
Today, I extend my best wishes to all the media institutions in the country.
On October 2 last year, I got the opportunity to participate in the meeting held on the cleanliness of the India-Today newspaper on the occasion of the completion of the year of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti programme.
Clean India Awards were conferred by the Institute.
I am glad that such people have worked for Swachh Bharat under the One Light One Mission.
We have cleaned such countries in our country.
All these have come to light and I heartily congratulate the India TV Group, which has done so wonderfully.
He also participated in the programme at least 51 lakh children in approximately 55,56 thousand schools in Andhra and Telangana states.
Overseas States, Railway Stations, spiritual states, hospitals and parks have been published on cleanliness in areas such as Swachhta.
Now these news will give us the power to achieve the goals of Swachh Bharat through these programmes.
Therefore, all the people of the country are now taking forward this programme, which has been suggested by Smt. Savitarai.
He further said that this village has been awarded the cleanest village in Asia.
It is a pleasure to note that there have been awards in the field of cleanliness in many villages in a beautiful north-eastern region of our country.
My dear countrymen, I have said that there are some things that have been sinned in policy during my address from the Red Fort on August 15.
When the poor goes to small jobs, how many pieces he gets for the recommendations, however he gets dubbed from the army, however he gets dubbed, when he doesn't get the job, the money will be lost.
I have never heard in the world how many psychologists have understood a person in an interview of one or two minutes.
I convey my best wishes to all young friends on this occasion.
And in the following budget, I have made a major project.
In our country, gold has become a part of the society's life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the banks.
Now do not keep gold in the house .
Another thing is that you will have gold rings in your hand in Savarin Gold Bond.
But now we started it .
This is why there is no need to buy gold now.
This scheme will be implemented by the people of the country in the coming week.
I am very happy to say that we are also bringing gold coins and gold coins with Ashoka Chakra.
Why shouldn't the country's country be sealed
Thus, in the coming week, we will facilitate the common man before Dhan Teras, and we will launch Indian gold coins with 5 grams and 10 grams of Ashoka Chakra.
Besides, 20 grams of gold bullocks will also benefit the people.
I would like to assist you that this new scheme will bring about a new change in the direction of orthodox.
But the Ekta Mantra - the system of individualism should be sustained for our thoughts, our commitments.
There is a diversity in India .
Many classes, fishes, traditions, many languages, different species and cultures.
That is why diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony, unity and divine medicines for development.
In the last few years, the run for units has been undertaken in several places in the country on 31st October.
Take the Ekta Mantra forward.
Now you will be in the process of Diwali and you will continue to clean the houses.
New goods can be bought.
The festival of Deepavali is being celebrated in one form everywhere in the country.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Diwali.
But in the days of Deepavali, we are listening to some questions.
Therefore, I am particularly enthusiastic about my visit to Britain.
Several years ago, the work done for women empowerment for Bhagwan Vishwaswar democracy has to be studied in the world.
It is best to say that the statue of Bhagwan Vishwashwar on the land of London is about to think about Indias great men since centuries.
We must learn languages in a country like India.
I will also try to reach you in your language for 8 hours at night.
And there was a good relationship between us.
Last year has been completed.
Now we are entering the new year.
Once again my beloved countrymen greetings.
Prime Minister Mann Ki Baat Programme (September 2015)
My dear countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat - one year, many things.
I don't know what you have achieved so far, but I can tell you how much I have achieved.
The power of the people is very important in democracy.
In my life, there is a primarily thought, and I am very sure about the power of the people.
However, through Mann Ki Baat, I learnt, I know, I know, I have said that we think, we are more dangerous than that.
Our ancestors say that the people are part of the honour.
But in the number of lakhs people used to be aware and send me advice.
This is a great power on its own.
These lakhs have taught some of the major teachings.
The information should be reached from the lower level to the lower level, which is actually going from above to the lower level.
Somebody said that the story will change in Mann Ki Baat-Mansu.
But it happened.
Likewise, Mann Ki Baat has transformed into a need to showcase the strength of the society.
I have requested all the citizens to take care of the tourism sector in India, incredible India, brothers and sisters.
But how big aid has been made.
People have sent photographs from every corner of the country like lakhs.
It is a feeling of peoples power.
Once I have spoken in Mann Ki Baat, Mann Ki Baat, the poor households will be lighted, the children will be crying.
It is hard to leave the benefits of the common man of the society, the middle class and the lower middle class.
There is nothing from Siachen but from Kutch, but from Kamrup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari to Gani-Phone.
Phones were done from all the places .
This is a pleasant experience.
All adults sent their message.
I like to hear some messages myself, it is very good.
My team works on them.
But this is the reason why they cannot see TV and listen to radio.
I know how important radio is for those who don't see.
I see another new angle, how many good things they have told - it is enough to make the government aware.
The message of Pavan Acharya was sent from Alwar in Rajasthan.
The soil pieces are also invaluable.
My dear countrymen, I have got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with our soldiers on the occasion of distinguished Chaviti.
Our Army, Navy, Air Force, Air Force, Navy, Air Force, Navy to protect the landscape and seas of the country.
In 1965, the war with Pakistan was completed 50 years.
In this regard, India Gate was also organized by the Government of India in Delhi.
I have seen it very comfortable.
The battle that took place in Hajipur, but the war that took place in Chaminda and the north of the day, but the hair will surpass the vision of the vision of the vision of Mandi and Hajipur pass.
The history will meet with our heritage.
I would like to visit you and your families - if you are around Delhi, I would like to see this vision for a few days.
Don't go to see me quickly.
I went back in two and a half hours.
A young child asked the Prime Minister, but the child soon forgot his name.
After independence, for the first time, discussions have been held on the issue of cleanliness in the Parliament for hours.
I see good in this .
It also looks forward to discussing cleanliness in the country's parliament.
On the one hand, Parliamentarians and others of the country are talking about cleanliness.
You know what Mahatma Gandhi would say.
Once again, he said that if one is to be selected in both freedom and cleanliness, then he will choose cleanliness, he added.
Gandhiji's cleanliness is more important than independence.
He said Deen Dayal ji wants to know about the birth anniversary.
On October 2, Pujaya Bapu was the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
5 per bbl, fifteen or fifty per bbl, if any taxation or pricing is available then it will be all the accounting leaders.
This joy also gives you some share.
When I went to Kolkata in May, members of the Subhash Chandra Bose family were present.
Chandra Bose, son of his brother, was organised all.
This evening was happy and happy with the members of the Subhash Babu family.
Chandra Bose and his family members were present in the same arrangements and last week, more than 50 members of the Subhash Bose family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
But it is a matter of greater joy that the opportunity to honour such a person will never come to the Prime Minister's residence, which will be available to me in October.
More than 50 Subhas Babu family members living in different countries are especially coming here for this reason.
Is it a joyful moment or not.
Is it safe that the precious power I have received
In this meanwhile, I have visited Kashi.
I met many people.
One of them was a student of Kshitij Pandey.
There is something in the Central Universities of Banaras Hindu University.
However, in such a young age, I have seen things related to physics.
He said that there was a microscopic knowledge but I saw his belief and belief.
I would like to encourage all children in the country on scientific matters.
Sometimes it enjoys a bit of such moments.
Sometimes our Akashwani collaborations are half an hour.
But I would appreciate your feelings.
Thank you for your suggestion.
It's already a monthly period.
You know the year of Mann Ki Baat programme has been a different year.
You know how much Subhash Babu used radio.
He greeted Azad Hind Radio with Victory News Bulletin.
He used to conduct radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu, Pasto and Urdu all languages.
I also had a year to talk to the minds of the sky.
My Mann Ki Baat - the word in my mind is your reason and your mind has become a word in your mind.
I am, but those fruits will be yourself.
Your suggestions will continue to be given.
The government will also benefit from your suggestions.
It's gonna grow.
Mann Ki Baat , August 2015
Once I got the opportunity to tell words in my mind .
In the southern direction people are drowned in Omnam sanctuary . The sanctuary of the country has celebrated the festival of sanctuary .
The Government of India has entered many new ways for the social Bhadrata of the common people .
11 crore families have reached this scheme since the beginning of this scheme for my obesity.
I convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the occasion of Poetry Rakshabandhan Day.
Today, I am talking to you that the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been done at a large scale one year ago.
The opportunity of youth has also been found . In one year Bangkoking Rang , economy , poor .
Don't stop opening accounts.
I have been able to get dibs from the bank.
These banks are you, you don't leave them anymore.
I have brought them to you and now it is your duty to buy them.
All our bank accounts should be alive.
I know you're gonna buy yourself.
Incidents and instruments of Gujarat have been stirred across the country.
Anything happens in the area of Gandhiji and Sardarpatel will affect the entire country.
However, in a short span of time, all the elders of Gujarat, my brothers and sisters and citizens of Gujarat have brought about the situation.
He played a key role in preventing the situation.
This is the right path of peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Their words, their speeches, the generosity of the Sufi tradition, and the harmony of it, contains the composition of music.
I feel all that was between them.
I believe that the real form of the world has to be explained to the world in a proper manner.
I am sure the love of the Sufi community and the generosity in it will reach this message far-flung areas.
I am also telling them that there is a need to understand the Sufi tradition even when we follow any other thing.
I am fortunate to have another opportunity at the earliest.
Buddhist scholars from many countries of the world will come to Bodhgaya in India.
I am invited to participate in it and I am very happy to invite them to come to Bodhgaya.
The Prime Minister of our country, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodhgaya.
Even before this, I have mentioned this in Mann Ki Baat programme.
We issued an Ordinance on landslides.
The Ordinance will be completed on 31st August, 2019.
But there was a depth in it .
Therefore, on 15th August, I said that we have taken this decision very fast, not just the Department of Agriculture, but now it will become the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.
You don't need to be afraid.
When the 1965 war proposes, it is an extraordinary remembrance of Lala-Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also a common mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
It is very commendable to recall the achievements of the Indian Trivandrum and its pride.
Such historical incidents always inspire us.
Last week, I got the opportunity to meet the Sufi community.
I have got the opportunity to interact with the eminent scientists of the country for hours.
How to connect the workshop in the area
It is necessary to take it forward in a chance.
I said in a programme in the following minds that there is a need for students to move forward towards science and there is a lot of opportunities and I would like to recall it again.
Especially tell my young friends one thing.
Everybody is running . They can also be the reason behind water in the lower level .
The decision to get rid of small industries from Interviews is now approximately implemented.
This is the first time that this meeting was held in other countries outside America.
Till now, every year, about 50,000 pregnant women and 13 lakh children are living in our country at the time of delivery or at the time of delivery.
If we get rid of polio, we get rid of tetanus and infant mortality.
There are reports about dengue in this midst.
We should not make death more easier.
How precious life is .
Not paying attention to drinking water and sanitation are the causes of death - it is not possible.
Dengue Assessment Examinations are available in 514 Centres across the country.
Now we will not get the opportunity to die for the country, but we will not get the privilege of living for the country.
Both of these brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
Sometimes, we are unjust to our youth due to lack of understanding.
I believe that this is centuries.
My experience with the youth is different.
Sometimes talking to the youth, there is a chance to learn from them.
It is said that 'Sande on Cycle' is called 'Sande on Cycle'.
It is said that we are playing a cycle day a week.
Manki Baat , June 2019 .
My beloved countrymen , bow down .
Sometimes we encourage ourselves .
You can imagine how I spend time in this middle .
On Sunday , the last Sunday I felt as if I had lost something .
Certainly it feels .
Perhaps this is not a simple program .
In this program there was a life , feeling yourself , mind was observed , heart was observed , therefore I felt very difficult to come to this program .
But this Sunday was very waiting .
He said that in the last few months many messages have come and people are also missing the Mann Ki Baat.
When I read them , I will be very good for listening .
Why did I travel to Kedarnath in how many acquaintances
I can enjoy your curiosity .
I also feel that feelings with you .
But if they talk then the form of Mann Ki Baat will change.
In how many acquaintances , Jaypjayals , even more polio I am Baaldera .
Many people have discovered the meaning of Rajiki in it .
My virtue is this , I have a chance to spend with me .
I would like to say all of you now that there was a chance to fill the cave in the valleys of Kedar due to the small breakthrough of Mann Ki Baat.
I also try to fulfil your curiosity one day .
I do not say when I do but definitely do .
Because you have that hiccup on me.
In the matter of Kedar how people were surprising about the same surprising thing that you should pay attention to some positive things , many times in your words .
Sometimes the work of paying attention to my thoughts also keeps your words .
People , country , society , problems , challenges , challenges are also telling their results .
If someone is writing about cleanness , then try to express his wrath towards pollution .
That is , how does the solution of problems of one kind seem to be seen in your words in the society .
The country of Mann Ki Baat is like an oxygen for society.
It is known by this that there is no dearth of the internal power , strength , talent situated in the country .
There is a need to consolidate those strengths and talents by giving an opportunity.
Moreover, it is from Mann Ki Baat that 130 crore people want to participate actively and efficiently in the development of the country.
When I analysis of such things, you can imagine how much power I get in my mind.
Actually I didn't come, you brought me, sitting. You gave me the opportunity to talk again.
With this feeling, we will take forward the tradition of Mann Ki Baat.
There is an attraction in the mind of all the people .
Therefore the country has invited how many people for the protection of democracy besides its own self-confidence .
Perhaps in any country of the world, the people of the world have not only put an opportunity for democracy but also for democracy, for the rest of their rights, powers and requirements.
Today, how many accomplishments of democracy have been organised in our country today, from wealth to the poor, everybody participated in this festival with joy and enjoyed the future of our country.
When something is with us, we ignore it, we also ignore its administering effects.
We can see this number normally, but if we leave a China in the world, then we can say that more than a country's negative population in the rest of the world have been voting today.
How many people have voted in the council in 2019 , that number is more than the total population of America , approximately twice .
The total number of Ooty of India is more than the population of Europe .
It introduces the vastness of our democracy.
The number of members in 2019 is still the biggest democracy of the world in history .
In such a way you can imagine how big level human power , arrangements are necessary .
Lacs of students , rulers , workers , workers are difficult in the night .
About three lakh Paramilitary teams have conducted their responsibilities and 20 lakh police personnel from various states have also been laboured at the grassroots level to fulfil this glorious sacrifice of democracy.
As a result of their hard industry this time more than this time Ooting has been done .
Approximately 10 lakh Polling Stations on the entire country , about 40 lakh EVM machines , over 17 lakh Vivipat -LRB- VVPAT -RRB- machines , how big arrangements you can imagine .
It has been done that one Ooty also does not come to use its Ooty .
A Polling Station has been set up for only one woman porter in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
If you have to travel for two days to reach there then you will be surprised .
But this is the pride of democracy .
Polling center of the highest place of the world is located in India .
This is at a height of 15000 feet in Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Not only this , there is also a chance of pride of this place .
Perhaps for the first time in history women also participate in Ooting as enthusiasm with men .
The quantity of women , men , polio is approximately equal .
Although the reality of enthusiasm is that today 78 -LRB- seventy eight -RRB- women are epilepsy in parlor .
My dear countrymen, you must have listened many times to say "Boke No Book".
In welcome - welcome we pray to give books instead of flowers .
At many places of Approximately such books are being given .
In the meanwhile, I gave a book titled 'Prem Chand Ki Lok Priya Kahania'.
It liked me a lot .
I did not get much time , while staying in labor I got the opportunity to read some stories again .
Their stories reflect the feelings of the whole of India.
When he read the story of 'Nasha', he turned his eyes towards the economic inequalities of the society.
When I was young then I remembered how many nights were spent in this matter .
We know that when the effect of evil conservation falls through this story of the son of Jamindar Ishwari, the poor family of the poor.
The second story Id Ghah, which tied my mind, is the heartbeat of a child, his love for his grandfather, and his magnificence at the younger age.
It is said that taking 4 . years from Hamid Sanctuary to my mother , actually it is said to be the pride of human heart .
The last lines of this story are not so emotional, the younger Hamid is playing the old Hamid Part - old Amina , Amina sinned .
In the same way, Pus Ki Rath is a miraculous story.
In this stories a poor painting is seen .
It is said that if his fruit was destroyed then Haldu Ratu had no need to sleep as a copper for the field in winters .
In reality these stories are a century old , today it seems sufficient to be suitable .
After reading these I felt a special experience .
If you talk about reading, in some media I read about the Akshatra Library of Kerala.
If this library is in a village of dense forests -LRB- Idukki -RRB- then you will not be surprised .
The primary school there was P . . .
K.
Both of them were polluted for this library .
Once the buildings of books have to be brought on the shoulders .
Today this library is seen everybody along with the tribal children .
Vanche Gujarat (Chudu Gujarat) is a successful experiment in Gujarat.
All the ages of lakhs participate in this park .
Definitely write about the book that has been read in the Narendra Modi App, so that everyone can know about it in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the people of our country are thinking about the future cooling.
I read your descriptions in the Narendra Modi App, my books. Many people are writing about the problem of water.
Pavan Gaurai in Belgavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida in Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related problems.
There is a lot of importance of water in our culture .
It has been said about the water of Apostle in Ragveda . Apostle Hishta Mao Bhuvas , Sthan Urjadhat , Maharnaya Chakshas , Yovaswamy , Vaswamy , Vaswamy , Vaswamy , Vaswamy , Shakti , Shakti , Shakti , Shakti , Shakti .
Everybody is lifting up the problem of water in many places of the country .
In the water of rains falling along with the year we can hide only 8  water only that you are not surprised .
Only 8  .
The result of this problem has to be discovered .
Like all the rest of the problems this problem is also discovered with the capacity of people , with the capacity of hundreds of crores of people , with the capacity of hundreds of crores of people .
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been organised in the country, considering the importance of water especially.
Through this decision can be taken fast in all the cases related to water .
I did a new work .
All the surprising villages of the country were written in the north .
It has been written that to collect every drop of rain water for the villagers , to collect water , to collect every drop of rain water , to make them a collection of a collection in the village , to discuss the villagers .
In this work hundreds of crores of people were distressed in the 22th honey of this month by participating completely enthusiasm .
People in the villages have resolved every drop of water.
Today, I will listen to you a serpent in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Lupung Panchayati surprising of Katkam Sandi Black of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand gives us a message to all of us and my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
The people there were ready to play their role for water conservation once again .
Everybody 's mainstreams , everybody 's activity is many acquaintances .
People of the village feel like competition to build their villages .
Before me , with the attempt of social attempts the positive results of flexibility are seen .
There is no fertilizer for the solution of water problem throughout the country .
Therefore, efforts are being made in various ways in different parts of the country.
Therefore the problem of waterlogging is prevented .
Small ponds built in fields in Kabirdham, Rajasthan have brought about a major change.
20 thousand women have made a collective effort to revive the Naga river in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.
I also read that in the Garhwal, all the women are working very well on water harvesting.
It is believed that such efforts are being done very much . if we try to forcefully then I also feel that it is impossible .
My first announcement: How did the people of the country make cleanliness and a mass movement for water conservation
I believe that water is the prasad of Parmeshwar.
To save each drop of water we have a joyous garden .
Talk about the problems of water , talk about water conservation methods .
My request is to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation especially for the chiefs of various areas.
Leave the film rang , not sports , let us not our friends of the media , let not the people of social institutions , let not the people of cultural institutions , let them not everybody in their own ways .
Wake up the society , work together with the society .
Look, we must see changes before our eyes .
I have to share the traditional methods of water conservation.
If you have the opportunity to visit the birthplace of Porbandar , Pujaya Bapu , there is a house behind the house of worshipped Bapu where there is a tank of 200 water storage tanks .
That is why I always say that if someone goes to Kirti Mandir then definitely see that water tank.
Come , we have inspired the conservation of water conservation by making maximum methods related to water conservation .

Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
If the Manki Baat starts then the mind is India .
Ten days Christma Bharat had lost his sons .
These marvellous people lost their lives for the protection of our 125 crore people of our country .
For the people of the country sleeping peacefully these brave sons saved us from their sleep .
Our soldiers are always presenting unique adventurous adventurous adventure , tradition .
The feelings of the martyrs of Bagalpur, Bihar, Ratan Thakur, the father of Ram Niranjanji, in such a painful moment, inspire all of us.
He told us that he also sends his second son to fight with enemies , if necessary he will also fight .
Seeing the courage of the wife of Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur Talu of Orissa the whole country praised her .
This small charm is this that every small child of India tells us all .
We see such feelings , our virgins , traditions , Amravis houses .
Their families also have no minerals in it .
The Amar of Deoria, the family of Vijay Maurya, the parents of Tilak Raj of Kangra, the son of the fort, Hemraj, the son of six, is full of the stories of every family of these martyrs.
I am trying to understand the feelings exhibited by these families , to understand the feelings exhibited .
The living witnesses situated in front of our eyes are an inspirational example of the future of India .
My dear countrymen , independence came home , all of us are waiting for the memorial of war .
I am surprising that there was no memorial of national war in India .
It is a memorial to keep the bravery of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the country .
I have decided to make such a memorial symbol of the country .
It is very happy to complete this construction at a very little time when we decided to build a national war memorial .
To morrow , i . . February 25th honey , we delivered this national soldiers to the army .
It is a small attempt to fulfil their contribution .
This memorial has been organised near the heart of Delhi i . . in Delhi where there is a gate of India , martyrs .
It is my belief that visiting this national soldiers memorial is like a pilgrimage of the country .
After the independence of the country the soldiers given maximum sacrifices for the country are the symbol of this national soldier memorial .
The shape of this memorial , exhibits the unique adventurous adventurous adventurous adventures of our martyrs .
The National Military Memorial is based on four concentrate circles, in the first round, the entire journey from the birth of every soldier to the sacrifice was painted.
The jewellery of Amar Chakra is symbol of the martyrs of the martyrs .
The second cycle is Shaurya Chakra .
Dense trees are in this wheel .
Seeing on the soft , to know the important martyrs of our country , to tell them thanksgiving thanksgiving , to discover them with the purpose of discovering them it has become a place to discover this national soldiers .
There are stories of those who sacrificed their lives to stay safe from our lives , to develop the country .
For the development of the country it is not possible to say in the words of our army , police , Para Military teams .
In the last year of October, I got the opportunity to dedicate this national military memorial to the nation.
This national police memorial is a reflection of the thoughts of proclaiming thanksgiving thanksgiving to women police , even more male police Sibbadi .
I hope to see all the memorials of your national soldiers , national police memorials .
When you go there , definitely Sherter the photographs taken there in social media , so that others also get inspiration to go there .
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, you will get the opportunity to read thousands of answers, extensions and meditations.
This time, when you read your speeches, I have seen an interesting suggestion written by Atish Mukhopadhyay.
What is he that on the third day of March , 1900 , March , on the third day of March the British had done Birsa Munda .
In Mann Ki Baat, Birsa Munda, Jamshed Ji Tata, both of them have been reminded of the history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two important officers were not only Jharkhand but also the fame of India .
Together with them Ganu Yavat India is grateful to them.
It is necessary to know about any inspirational personality of the youth , which is the victim of Mahabharata Birsa .
And the British hid , and took him as he was asleep .
Do you know why they have done such a church
He had seen this in his small lifetime .
The sunlight has been filled in the life of the people of the mosquitoes , mosquitoes .
Mahabhava had sacrificed his life in the small age of Birsa Munda .
But the point of view is that the story of the stories of the people of those places , beauty , sacrifices are not present today .
He is well aware of how it is necessary for future to create India as a science, technology and an industrial hub.
From the point of view of his distance Tata Institute of Science has been established which is now called Indian Institute of Science .
Besides this he established many world level institutions , companies etc .
Jamshed jeeep Tata Garden , Samvaswamy Swami Vivekananda had taken place in a ship in America .
My dear countrymen, on February 29, the birth anniversary of the Majid Prime Minister of India, Murarji Bhai Desai .
This day only four years come .
Muraji Bhai filled with natural , peaceful personality is one of the most educated officers of India .
The name of Morarji Bhai Desai was registered as the person who entered the highest budget in the Independent India Parliament.
During the difficulty in the construction of the country 's democracy , the country was run with its expert leadership .
To save delivery of democracy he also drowned in fighting against the emergency of Murji Bhai country .
Therefore in his old age also he had to pay heavy roots .
Since then the government had also kept him in jail .
In 1977 he became the prime minister when he had achieved the victory of January .
He brought 44th kingdom in the eleventh century .
Why is it important that as per the 42nd Constitution Amendment in the emergency situation, reducing the power of the Supreme Court and the rest of the systems such as destruction of our democratic values.
Similarly , in 1975 in the age of emergency as the democracy of democracy was done , in future without any time in future Morarji Bhai Bhai had been organised .
In order to keep the magnificence of Indian democracy the future of his beauty is always remembered .
I dedicate to such an important leader once again .
People have shown how excitement about the Padmasampuras of my favorite country , every time .
This is why we are stepping towards a new India therefore we should pride those who go to their work with self-confidence in the condition of self-confidence .
People are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways with their problems .
Without the name of which name the work of standing on the ground is believed to be done by standing on the ground . Yoga is shown the message of Bhagwan dynasty .
The city of Odisha is not known by the name of Kanal Man . Dautari Nayak had made the path of water problems , water problem with his industry only by excavating the hill with his hands in his village .
Take Abdul Gafur Khatri dynasty of Gujarat . He has done a marvellous work of reviving the dynasty of the dynasty of the dynasty of the dynasty of the dynasty area .
He is doing an important task to give this art to new arts .
I gave a gift to the President Barack Obama of America 's Majijid 's President Barack Obama .
The beauty of Padmasampur is recognized as the service of Shebbir Said Gomata of Marathwada .
After listening to the Tao Porchon-Linch of America, you will be surprised . Linch has become a living Yoga institution .
In the age of a hundred years also she has given training in yoga to the people of the world . She has now made fifteen hundred yoga training .
Famous by the name of Lady Tarzon in Jharkhand, Jamuna Tudu, Timber Mafia Tonu and Naxalites have been adventurous works and inspired ten thousand women fighting for protection of trees and wildlife.
Kisan Chachi of Muzaffarpur in Bihar i.e. the story of Raj Kumari Devi is very inspiring.
In the direction of making women empowerment , other trade beneficial is an example .

In the meanwhile, wherever I go to the country, I would like to meet the Prime Ministers Jan Arogya Yojana and the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana PM-A.
Brother , Sodri Manulara , last five months approximately twelve lakh families were available due to this technique .
I have seen what kind of changes have been brought about in the lives of poor people.
If you are not able to do the treatment , the poor people who are distressed because of not getting wealth then tell them the symptom about this technique .
This technique is the wish of such poor families .
My favorite country has come to the time of testing in schools .

Students, their teachers and parents can see the entire recording of this programme in YouTube and my Exam Warriors wishes to all of them for the coming tests.
If you talk about my favorite country , India then there is no proposal about festivals .
Without any importance in our country , there is no day without any festival .
I went to Kashi for some days , my favorite country , where I got the opportunity to spend with some Divya brothers .
It is said that I will mix the prime minister .
Besides listening to me , people also remember many times besides listening to Manki Baat .
Actually I was affected by seeing the power of that Divya brother .
My dear countrymen , through the medium of Mann Ki Baat program I am a special experience for all of you .

I am an impossible thing myself .
The pride of healthy democracy is on the Sunday of the month of May , on the Sunday of the month of May .
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shri Shri Shivakumar Swamiji is no more architect .
Shiva Kumar Swamiji dedicated all his life to the society of the society .
It is believed that Lord Basaveshwar had taught us Kai Kailas i . . while doing hard work it is considered that it is like going to the residence of Shiva .
Shivakumar Swamiji walked on this very ball .
He is a church .
Only to give people food , shelter , education , spiritual knowledge , spiritual knowledge he was with his life .
The rails are the most important thing for him in life .
Definitely animals , agricultural vegetation is being done by the Siddhaganga Math .
A poet of Swami Swami Swami Swami had also heard that contribution .
The life of Shri Shri Shiva Kumar Swami Swamiji , Siddhganga Math , all the goals of Siddhganga are dedicated to this poet .
Once I offered my tribute to this great soul .
My favorite country Prajalara , 1950 , January 26th honey came to the state of our country .
That day our country has changed into a democracy country .
We have celebrated our reproductive day with pride , pride .
But now I want to tell me .
Seeing how many acquaintances happen in India the world is surprised .
You must have heard about Gujarat.
In a beautiful area of Gir forest only one polio boot is put for one o'clock .
With the purpose of getting the opportunity to use his Ooty for one Ooty , with the purpose of using his Ooty he sees how many accidents going away from all the places .
This is the beauty of our country .
I am giving so many accidents to keep our reproductive system strong .
I also congratulate all the industries of all the states who help in participating in the process of so many types of activities , independently , independently , independently .
The responsibility of all that we should be responsible .
I believe that in large numbers our youth Ooty river their names , with their participation we give more strength to our democracy .
My beloved country , sacred Bharatgarh some great men were born on this sacred Bharatgarh . They have done some marvellous , unforgettable tasks for humanity .
On the 23rd January the Yavat India celebrated his Jayanti in a different way .
I got the point of view of starting a museum built in the memorial of the Mahavirs of India 's freedom fighters .
Do you know that many rooms were closed in the Red Fort on the day of independence .
Although all the rooms closed were fulfilled so beautiful museums .
A museum for Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Ki, Indian National Army, Aura 1857-Eighteen Fifty Seven and India's First War of Independents have been set up.
In every brick of the rooms situated in these museums our glorious history is filled with Taluku .
At this very place the British government had conducted Dawa on the brave sons of Mother India - Karnal Prem Sehgal, Karnal Gurbhaksh Singh Dilo, Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When the memory of Netaji in the Kranti temple of Red Fort is being displayed, the family members of Netaji presented me a rare hat.
It is necessary to concentrate again in different forms about the courage of our officers , national devotions .
In the last month of December 30 I went to Andaman Nicobar Island .
Where 75 years Christian Netaji had flyed the Trivarnapattanam , right at the same place Trivarnapattanam again .
People were surprised to see the Trivandrum flying in the Red Fort in October 2018 because there is a habit of flying national power only for the fifteenth of August.
Azad Hind Circular made 75 years in the complete context .
Subhash Babu is always remembered as a soldier , a specialist .
Several years have been desired to make the fruits related to Netaji .
It's my joy that we can do it.
I remember the day coming to the entire prime minister of Netaji family .
We told many pockets about Netaji associated with us .
It gives me a lot of joy to develop some places covered with some great officers of India .
26 related to Babasaheb Ambedkar, Alipur Road, Sardar Patel Museum, Kranti Mandir etc.
If you come to Delhi then definitely visit these places .
My dear countrymen, now we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, that too in Mann Ki Baat, so I want to share a story related to the life of Netaji.
I always considered radio as a medium of meeting humans .
The method of talking to Subhash Babu in Radio was different .
People liked the programs of Prasar in Azad Hind radio .
Due to this program our freedom fighters also got a lot of strength .
A sight museum has also been built in this Cranti temple .
The attempt to say how attractive about Indian arts , cultures has been done here .
In the museum some important artists like Amritsar Shergil , Raja Ravi Varma , Avindranath Tagore , Gangendranath Tagore , Nandal Bose , Jamini Roy , Sailoj Mukherji have been exhibited here .
You will definitely want to see the pictures of Gurudev Ravindranath Thakur there .
Talking about the pictures of Chitrakoot Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore is considered to be the best pictures of Tagore .
Till now you will know that Gurudev Tagore is a writer , a musician .
But Gurudev is also a painting .
The main thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not kept any name for his most pictures .
Seeing his pictures , understanding that picture itself , he would understand the message situated in that picture with his point of view .
His cheetals have also been exhibited in European countries , Russ , America .
I believe that you will definitely go to see his pictures in the Cranti temple .
My dear countrymen, the land of Indian saints.
Our friends , their thoughts , their works have given the messages of harmony , equality , social civilization .
Such a monastery is Ravidas .
February19 is the birthplace of Ravidas .

Sant Ravidas used to give big messages in small words only .
He says that if the layer of the layer of the layer of the layer of the layer of the layer of the layer comes out then there is nothing inside and the pus of the tree is completed.
The birthplace of Guru Ravidas was done in Varanasi .
Sant Ravidas had tried to tell the importance of labor , more labors through his country throughout his life .
It is not necessary to make an attempt to tell the importance of trouble to the world .
He means that if your mind is a heartbeat, then it means that this man lives in the heart of God.
The provinces of Santravidas have affected the people of all the classes . Chittormaharaja , Rani , Mirabai were the first week of Aishay Kshetra .
In the students like talking to things like increasing interest in the international programs , some new , students want to think about the situation of the sky , do not want to talk to me , rays , specially for our children .

In the arrangements along with devotion , cleanness is also there , far away from this is a good thing about it .
This time after the sacred confluence of every traveller the pilgrimage of Akshay tree is also found .
The symbol of the belief of the people this Akshayya tree was not in the fort of hundreds of years , therefore devotees could not visit it .
Now the door of Akshay tree has been opened for everyone .
When you come to the Kumbh Mela , take photographs in different contexts there , Sher with everyone in social meditation so that many people get inspiration to go to Kumbh Mela .
Full of spirituality this Kumbh , Indian philosophy should be an important Kumbh .
This Kumbh of devotees should be an important Kumbh of the world tourism .
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of our priest Bapu .
The President of South Africa, Shri Siril Ramposa, is fortunate to visit India as the chief guest of our Republic Day celebrations this time.
The priests of Bapuki , South Africa is so unparalleled bond .
Mohan has turned into a great spirit in South Africa.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa . Where he faced the opposite to the description .
Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms have been established there from where the sound of justice and peace has been heard to the world.
2018 - Nelson Mandela is also celebrated by the name of Madiba .
To spend all the years in his jail , inspiring power , inspired him came from our priests Babu .
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only the basis of sports in the world but their ideals always encourage us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, the DGP conferencing was held in Kevadia on the Narmada shore of Gujarat, where the highest statue of Kella was 'Statue of Unity' in the world, there was a strong discussion with the top police officers of our country.
In order to increase the protection of the country , country , people of India some churches should be taken on the matter of food .
In this context, I have declared that Sardar Patel Puraskars are going to be launched for national equality. This book will be given to those who have made their contribution to national equality.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life for the equality of the country .
It is said that India has been done along with staying unconscious .
It is believed that the power of India is hidden in the diversity here .
By prideing this feeling of Sardar Patel dynasty they pay tribute to them by this time .
My dear countrymen , on the eleventh January the holy birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh .
Guru Govind Singh was born in Patna.
He spent a long time in his life in north India and sacrificed his lives in Nanded, Maharashtra.

After the death of his father Shri Guru Teg Bahadur -LRB- Teg Bahadur -RRB- Guru Govind Singh was sitting in the place of Guru in the small age of nine years .

Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On the 3rd October 2014, on the day of the Vijay Dashmi festival, Mann Ki Baat program was started and we started a journey together through Mann Ki Baat.
The journey of this Mann Ki Baat is fulfilling fifty bags with this journey.
That is why this is the golden festival of Golden Jubilee Episod , that is , the golden festival of Manki Baat .
This time the phone calls coming from all of you , Uttaranchal also proposed to recognize this golden festival .
Anshu Kumar, Amar Kumar, Patna to Vikas Yadav, Delhi at My Gau
What is the whole week , people say that you are more than the latest technology , social media , mobile ypnotise , mobile ypnotise .
But why do you choose radio through the medium of contact with people
I want to tell you a story.
This is the matter in 1998 .
This is the time when I work as an institutional member of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
"Does India name a bomb
I didn't mean "I said.
Sometimes it is said that if radio listen to radio , then in radio the same thing has been discussed .
Since then our prime minister Atal Bihari Wajpey had come forward , it was told that on that day the examination of the media was done .
I used to estimate the power of radio .
It is natural to forget my eyes towards the most powerful meditation after I became the Prime Minister .
Feedback coming in this survey is very interesting .
How extensive church has also been done about puja .
This is an example of the positive emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotions situated in the minds of all our countrymen .
Some have also shared their experiences that the feeling of voluntaryism i . . clean service has also increased in the people due to the Manki Baat program .
People are coming forward for the service of the society . This is a change .
I am very happy to change radio more favorite for people because of the Manki Baat program .
The north , online expansions , phone calls , photographs , all these are clearly visible .
Modi comes , goes but this country remains stable . our culture remains stable .
This small stories of 130 crores of the country are always alive .
All these give new inspiration to this country , with new enthusiasm the highest peaks of this country .
My experiences also participate with water .
After that gradually this thing moves towards a change by buying houses , social meditation , Watsp .
Teaching all his households as well, sometimes all those youngsters who have given the message to the Prime Minister in the phone calls.
Can any government ever come from the small village of Haryana and not only in the country but also in the country
Many times Mann Ki Baat has also become the victim of the discovery of the bat but in my mind sometimes all the people of the country are always there .
They are all my mind .
Mann Ki Baat is not the word of the government , it is the word of the society .
Mann Ki Baat is an optimistic India, a reputable India.
There is a kind of spirituality in your question .
The biggest glorious gloriousness of the fiftyth Manki Baat Taluku is that besides a prime minister you will ask the question of a nearby man i . . this is the democracy .
If you want to make peace easier to your question then there is nothing to be prepared.
Absolute Manki Bath is a very easy task for me .
Every time people come in front of Manki Baat .
In My Gau and Narendra Modi Mobile App, people share their thoughts, there is also a Tol Free No. 180017800.
People who photographed this number record their message with their throat .
Before the beginning of Manki Baat I try to read more north , more expansives themselves .
I hear myself many phone calls .
I will read the thoughts that I sent you at the time of traveling near the Mann Ki Baat program , how carefully I will read .
Every moment all the people of my country are in my mind . Therefore nobody reads any north , the situations of the northern writers , their feelings become part of my thoughts .
This north is not just a piece of canal .
In reality things i . . water village , person 's name etc . mouths .
I thank everybody participating in Mann Ki Baat for examples, emotions and excitement.
Their north , expansions are not able to read , then again the number of people sending north , wildlife is in lakhs .
An attempt will also be made to introduce unparalleled answers and information related departments in Mann Ki Baat.
Blessed is also told to all my colleagues of Radio , Durdarshan , remaining T . . Chhanals , social meditation .
Due to their hard work many people reach the bat of Manki .
The program of every Manki Baat program is published in many languages .
Some people are also listening to the sound of the sound near the throat in the province languages , with the same voice Manki Baat .
In the same way they are turning into Nrandra Modi along with those thirty minutes .
You all also want to listen to the program of Manki Baat in your language .
Everybody is also considered to be less conservation about themselves , or the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologists .
But the media has changed many things proposed in Mann Ki Baat as its own things.
Media has done the work of moving forward in a new way for cleanliness, road safety, drugs free India, selfie with daughter etc.
If there is no support of your support then my journey of this Manki Baat was incomplete .
"Thank you very much for your phone call.
If you want to say the truth then I have no secret .
It is easy to understand anybody in front of us that old things of our own life are not obstructed .
Sometimes our bird sanctuary gives the biggest obstacle to the conferences .
It is my first priority to understand something instead of confessing , not confessing , responsibilities .
I keep trying to talk with youth in various programs or social meditations .
I keep trying to understand that they do , thinking .
It is very good to question the youth .
They're reproductive in multi-tasking.
If we look at our surroundings then the social enterprise enhancement ina, startups, sports, or any other kind of change in the society has brought about big changes.
Does the youth dare to dream big dreams , do not dare to dream .
If we bring youth thoughts on the ground , give them freedom to express them then they can bring changes in the country . They are also doing it .
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to Vinita Mai Gau, I would like to talk about the state day to be held tomorrow in Mann Ki Baat i. e.
It is said that this day is very special , because we are observing the state , today we are asking for the seventy years of the year .
Blessed is many thanks for your information .
All these Mahamahals have given us such an expansive , expansive state .
It is also an example of Time management cool , Productive City .
This also inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities during record .
It is the confluence of the great talents of the country that the people of the country should be empowered and the impoverished person should be able to build a kingdom.
The responsibility of Hakulu , responsibilities has been described in our state . That is the speciality of our state .
In the life of the country these two combinations take the country forward .
When Nakinka was identified, 60 years of the state of India was completed in 2010, in Gujarat, we bloomed the book of the Constitution on the elephant.
It is an attempt to remind them of the state to increase the estimation of the state in youth , to make them aware of the estimation of the state .
In the year 2020 we complete fifty years in the form of a republic . in 2022 we come to freedom and complete fifty five decades .
My dear countrymen, if you talk about the civilization of the kingdom, then the original male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male and female male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male male
Praswamy is in Babasaheb nervous system . India 's democracy has not come from outside .
What is the cost of the cost of the reproductive system meaning what is the cost of cost .
India First - This is the main mantra of Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar .
On the second time the priest Babasaheb Ambedakar dynasty was worshipped .
Guru Nanak Dev had always been associated with the category of people .
He always saw the way of truth , karma , service , karna , self-confidence .
In the coming year the joy of this festival of the country celebrates the 550th Jayanti festival of Guru Nanak Dev Dev Dev Dev Dev Devraj . The joy of these festivals spread all the world .
All the state governments , central governments have to celebrate this festival in honor .
Similarly the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak is celebrated in all the countries of the world .
Along with this a special train is also run by connecting all the sacred places related to Guru Nanak dynasty .
When I participated in a meeting related to this, I remembered Lakhpat Sahib Gurudwara.
Due to the earthquake of Gujarat coming in 2001 the Gurudwara also got heavy injury .
But the state government , local people together with the local people the shore of that Gurudwara is an example of this .
The Government of India has taken a major decision to build Kartarpur corridor so that our country's travellers can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
Come , move ahead this journey .
Manki Baat, October 2018
On October 31th honey we all are the beloved Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel .
Every year on that day also the country is ready to participate in 'Run for Unity' running for unity.
Now the environment is also fascinating .
All of you are also eagerly participating in this race for unity - Run for Unity.
Six and a half months before independence, on January 27, 1947, the world-renowned international journal 'Time Magazine' published an architecture on the journal composition of Sardar Patel.
This journal has given the status of a India in its Leed Storey .
But it is not like India .
It is a part of India divided into many parts .
Approximately 550 countries were there in the country .
The interest of English about India decreased but they wanted to go to India by pieces of pieces .
Time Magazine has also discovered other storeys of human life in his exercise .
In the floods in Ahmedabad in 1920, how he organised a helpful programme, how Bardoli was guided by the Satyagraha.
After discovering each problem of Sardar Patel , it has been seen that the impossible work of doing the country in comparison to the country .
To see all this India , our Bharatma , binding with the acquaintance we remind us of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel .
The statue established on the Narmada river in Gujarat will be twice the height of the State of Liberty in America.
This is the biggest idol of the world .
Every Indian is now proud that the highest statue of the world is in our country .
Nowadays the Sardar Patel surrounded by the earth is also increasing the glimpse of the sky .
It is natural to see this statue of every Indian .
It is my belief that the people of every corner of India consider this idol as the most favorite museum place.
My dear brothers and sisters , all our countrymen have celebrated ' Infantry Day ' .
I salute all the parts of the Indian Army .
I am also selecting the families of our soldiers for their adventure .
But you know why all our countrymen celebrate this ' Infantry Day ' .
On this very day our Indian soldiers saved the Kashmir valley from the slopes on the Kashmir grass .
This historical incident also has a direct relationship with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I read the old interval of Taluku -LRB- interval -RRB- of a great Indian army named Sammanekshaw once .
In that conversation, Field Marshal Sam Summanekshaw reminded him of the day when he was a Colonel.
At that time in October 1947 military wars started in Kashmir .
In one occasion of sending the army to Kashmir the Sirdar Vallabh Bhai Patel was reminded of the Fild Marshal Samshal Sanctuary . In this contemporary on seeing the soldiers of Kashmir were also not delayed .
Nobody likes the cost of my favorite country , sports .
Sport , strength , efficiency , capacity - all these are very important .
These are a sports of a sports .
These four qualities are so important for the construction of any country .
In the youth of the country all these qualities are there , that country not only develops in economic , science , technology but also in the sports itself .
Italy I had done two marvellous collections .
First of all, in the ASEAN Para Games 2018, we got the opportunity to meet Para Athlets.
Our Para athletes created a record by accomplishing 72 medals of India in these sports have enhanced the pride of India.
All these perfect Para athletes have got the privilege of themselves.
Similarly, there was a chance to meet the winners of Summer Youth Holympics 2018 in Argentina.
You will be happy to know that in the Youth Holympics 2018, our youth has exhibited their talent even more than this.
In these competitions, our country has won three other medals in addition to the Mix Event of the country with thirteen tables.
This time in Asian cricket also our country will be remembered for all of you .
See how many times in a few minutes I have used things like this , it is more important than this .
India is not only a sports but also a new record of India has been established in the way we have never imagined.
To live out of the orphanage temple, he worked like wire in DTC buses and Dhabal on the roads beds of Delhi.
At the same time Narayan is participating in the international competitions , golden medals of India .
Not only this , see the capacity of increasing in India sports .
India has never achieved any Olympics in both Judo, Senior Level and Junior Level.
But in the European Olympics Tababi Devi has created history by accomplishing silver medals .
Sixteen young sportsperson Tababi lives in a village in Manipur.
If the father goes to the cooling , then the mother was selling fish .
Many times there was no money for food in their house .
In such situation also the courage of Tababi Devi does not decrease .
The history has created the history of neck for the country .
Every youngster, his sports, the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, you all will be remembered, we have successfully organised the FIFA Under17 World Cup in 2017.
The world has grown as the most successful tournament.
We have also created a new agreement on the number of audience in the FIFA Under17 World Cup.
More than twelve lakh audiences from the stadiums of different places of the country have encouraged the youth sports by seeing those football competitions .
This year, India has got the privilege of hockey World Cup 2018 at Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Complex starts on 28 November 28 December 16 December .
The Indian sports playing any kind of game is definitely interesting on any Indian or some other game .
There is a golden sports for India in Haki sports .
The magnificence of Haki Matri is known about the medieval meditation of the world .
After that Balvindar Singh Sinier , Leslie Claudius -LRB- Leslie Claudius -RRB- , Mohammad Shahid , Uddham Singh , Dhanraj had decided a very big journey .
These are giving inspiration to new waves of hockey games with their industry , sports with their industry .
Watching the industrial competitions is a good opportunity for sports .
Going to Bhubaneswar , seeing the hockey match , encourage our players .
Many people are coming forward to organise social programs of my favorite country , social programs , all of them are also inspired to all the people of the country .
We can see this tradition at every place in the society of thousands of centuries .
But in this new age , new generations have come forward to do these tasks with new enthusiasm , new hopes , new dreams .
Its name is 'Self-4 Society'. My portal, and the IT, electronic industry of the country should not motivate their employees to make social programs so that they could not give them the right opportunity to give them this portal.
To organise this program all Indians are prideful to see the enthusiasm , adventures .
The journey from IT to society is not me, we are not awake, we are not awake.
Some children are reading , some elders are reading .
Some people are taking care of cleanliness , some are helping the rails .
There is no alternative behind all these . only the emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotionality .
A young man learned the wheelchair basketball to help the hair of Divyas .
Mission mode activity means this interest , this dedication is the feeling of dedication .
Definitely pride .
The feeling that I am not ours, inspires all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I see all your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I have seen an interesting description written by Shri Manish Mahabhatra from Pondicherry.
What is in Mai Gau, he wrote, "Speak in the Mann Ki Baat programme as an important example of Indian tribal traditions, customs, nature and life along with nature."
Mansh Garu , this thing is that I am impressing you to propose ahead of Manki Baat .
It is a good opportunity to inspire us to see our prideful culture , past , that is why the world , especially the western countries are celebrating the churches to protect the environment .
Our India also faces this problem .
For the result of this we should look at the same time we should see our history , traditions once .
Especially know the life style of our tribals . It is in the culture of our tribals .
Our tribal brothers are worshipped by considering trees , trees , teeth , goddesses .
In the central India especially in Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh region the tribals of Bhilgadh residents of Bhilgadh are worshipped .
In the desert area like Rajasthan the society of Vishnoi society has seen us how to conserve environment .
Especially in the matter of conservation of trees they are ready to sacrifice their lives but one tree does not allow harm .
It is believed that the Mishmi Tegs of Arunachal Pradesh are related to tigers.
The tigers are considered to be their partners .
In Nagaland, tigers are also considered as protectors of forests.
In the Briding Season of the Gond Tigers of Central India, fishing is stopped in some areas of the river Kethan.
Tribals make their houses with natural substances . Along with being strong they also improve the environment .
In south India a small smoke residing in the ecosystems of Nilgiri Peeth in the ecosystem of the southern India makes a small smoke of their habitation with small things .
It is true that my beloved brothers , sisters , tribal tribes believe in themselves to live peacefully , but if anyone harms their natural resources , they are not afraid to fight for their rights .
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we are talking about the people who have done extraordinary work for the society.
Seeing small , it has a very deep effect on those tasks .
I read about Gurubachan Singh of Punjab for some days .
A simple Ratu Gurubachan Singh 's son is married .
Before this marriage Gurubachan had married the parents of the married parents , but I was some Shert .
But after listening to the serpents of a common royal brother Gurubachan , all of you will also be surprised . That is the true strength of our society .
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh Singh had kept such an example before us .
I read about Kallar Majra, another small village near Nabha in Punjab.
Why did this village come to the churches of Kallar Majra , where people are put in the field instead of burning the cereals of grains , they are covered inside the soil , for which how much technology is necessary .
My brother Gurubachan Singh is my best wishes .
My best wishes to all the people who try to keep the environment clean , to keep the environment clean .
You are walking ahead of the true Indian tradition of clean life .
On getting drops , chicken pox , small precautions , good tasks , social works , always play a very big role in making the environment of social environment .
Establish peace everywhere in life, in heart, in thyself, in every particle of the world.
November 11th honey coming to India is special because the first world war was completed in November 111 .
The end of the war was completed , when the destruction of heavy destruction occurred , the destruction of the population ends a century .
The First World War is an important event for India.
If we want to say properly then we have no relation with the war .
Although our soldiers were fighting with so much virtue , how big role was played , most sacrifices were given .
On coming to the war the Indian soldiers had seen the world to take anyone .
In rare places , in poisonous situations also our soldiers have seen their bravery .
The one objective behind all these is to restore peace.
The world has seen the destruction of the world in the First World War.
According to the estimates approximately one crore soldiers , other people lost their lives .
That is why peace is so important that the world knows .
In the past the meaning of peace has changed .
It is not only peace , harmony i . . war .
From acute rapidity change in the environment , economic development has to be changed in the social judgment .
Nirodh is the true sign of the development of the person .
My beloved country , our north-eastern states are different .
The natural beauty of this area is the beauty of the people here .
The award for the best policy playing in this hole is equal to the oscar in that hole.
Besides this our Sikkim has spent this archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologists from twenty five countries .
For this I am telling many thanks to the people of Sikkim .
My favorite country , October .
Many changes are also coming in the environment .
Along with this the environment of festivals has also come . Dhan Terracotta , Deepavali , Bhaiya Duj , Chhat . if you want to say a kind of festivals in the month of November .
All these festivals of all the people of the country are many acquaintances .
I want all of you that in these festivals not only take care of your health but also keep in mind your health .
To make new decisions also this festival gives opportunity .
With a mission mode, I would like to make these festivals an opportunity for you to move forward in life and make a strong resolve.
Your development is an important part of the development of the country.
If you have so much development then the country will prove as much progress .
My good wishes for all of you .
