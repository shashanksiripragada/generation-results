Mann Ki Baat October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Many congratulations to all of you on Diwali and we have been told here - Swambam Karoti Kalyan and Wellness riches.
At the Deepjyotirnmostu in the enemy's bond.
How beautiful messages.
At present, Deepawali is celebrated in different countries of the world.
Not only Indians participate in this festival but also the governments of many countries, the citizens of that country, the social organisations celebrate the Deepavali festival with Harsh Ulas.
A kind of India is built there.
Friends, Festivals are a different attraction of tourism in the world.
Our India is the country of festivals, there is a huge opportunity for festival tourism.
Whether it is Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, we should try to spread all these festivals and join the people of other states and other countries.
There are so many festivals in every state and every region and people of other countries are interested in this festival.
This is why the role of Indians living outside the country is very important for the development of festivals in India.
My dear countrymen, I decided on the last Mann Ki Baat, I would do something different on this occasion of Diwali.
I said, Come, let us all celebrate the Indian women's strength and their success in this Diwali, that is, I respect Laxmi of India.
Immediately after seeing, there is a lot of inspirational stories in the synonymous media.
He said, "My mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took charge of five sons.
Today we are five brothers in a good organism.
My mother is my God.
Everything I have, if I look at it, he is India's Lakshmi.
Ramesh ji, I bow down to your mother.
In the tour, the active singer Swami said that he had a Major Khushboo Kuanar India Lakshmi, the daughter of Bus Conductor and she led the women's army of Assam Rifles.
His daughter is Laxmi of India near poet Tivari ji, who has his power.
He is proud that his daughter has a very good picture, and has a good place in the clutches test.
Meghala Jain says that a 92-year-old woman has been donating jewellery at Gwalior Railway Station for years.
Meghazi, this Laxmi of India was very inspired by the immense nature and compassion.
People have shared such stories.
You must read, inspire and share something around yourself.
I salute all these lakhs of India.
My dear countrymen, the well-known woman poet Sachi Honnamma wrote a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
That feeling, all those Lakshmis of India, whom we are talking about, it seems that they had done the same thing in the 17th century.
This poem of Kannada, how beautiful words, how beautiful has been explained, and how much high ideas are among the poems of Kannada - Peninda Permegandu Himavantu, Peninda Bhrigu Perchidnupendinda Jankarainu Jabdedunu, that means Himavantu i.e. Parvaraj for his daughter Parvati, Rishi Brigu for his daughter Laxmi and Janak became famous for her daughter Sita.
Our daughters have a strong identity and a bright future of our society through our pride and the great work of these girls.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November, 2019, the 550th Abirbhav festival of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev ji is not only in India but also in the entire world.
In many countries of this world, our Sikh brothers and sisters have dedicated their lives to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget my gurus travel in Venkuver and Tehran.
There is a lot of things about Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can share with you, but it will take a lot of time for Mann Ki Baat.
He has always placed service work on everyone.
Guru Nanak Devji believed that the work of selflessness was invaluable.
He fought firmly against social curse like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, his message has reached far-flung places of the world.
He was one of the most travellers of his time.
He had gone to many places and wherever he has been, he has won the hearts of all through his compassion, humility and purity.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has travelled in many important religious places.
It is said that the saints of Assam and Shankardev were inspired by their ideals.
He also traveled on the holy land of Hariddar.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water there.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb, which reminds us of him.
During a sad time, Guru Nanak ji traveled in the north of Kashmir and its surrounding places.
This has established a strong relationship between Sikhism followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji went to Tibet and he was accepted as Guru.
He traveled to Uzbekistan and he was also worshipped there.
And at a time of compassion, he traveled widely to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Afghan and Afghanistan.
He lives in the hearts of lakhs of people, who have followed their teachings and are still doing it.
And this journey was organised to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
There, all the envoys, Golden Temple philosophy and learning about Sikh heritage and culture.
He was a great hero who connected the country with unity.
As Sardar Patel had a surprising power to gather people, he was able to coordinate with those who had a psychological difference.
Sardar Patel also monitored and looked at the critical issues.
He was a man of detail in this regard.
He was also efficient in the organizational skills.
He was also a specially observed in formulating plans and creating skills.
When it is read or heard about Sardar Saheb's methodology, it can be learned how excellent Orplaining was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country participated in the 1990s Ahmedabad session.
He ensured that no one should suffer from water.
He interacted with the farmers and urged them to create Khadi bags.
Look again, that's why Khadi's sales have increased.
The country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing an important role in the Constitution Council.
He does the important task of ensuring our basic rights so that there is no possibility of discrimination on the basis of caste or community.
Friends, We all know that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, as the first Minister of Self Help, had done a historic and important task of uniting the regions and regions of the country.
There was a special feature among Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel that he had a look at nothing.
On one hand, his vision was focused on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
The Lakshadweep and his goals of the far south have not been left.
In fact, when we mention the efforts of Sardar Patel, we talk about his role in some specific areas of this country.
Like Lakshadweep he also played an important role in a small region .
Immediately after receiving this news, Sardar Patel immediately took stringent steps without delay.
He sent instructions to the brotherhood of Mudalia , Arkat Ramswamy Mudaliyar and Arkat Laxmanswamy Mudaliyar that after taking the kingdoms of Trekkker roamed the national flag there .
He was urgently temporarily televised and administered the neighbourhood over Lakshadweep.
After this, Sardar Patel told the brother-in-law of Mudalia that he should personally ensure that all the help is available in the development of Lakshadweep.
Today Lakshadweep is contributing to the progress of India.
It is also an attractive tourist destination .
I hope you will visit these beautiful islands and their seas.
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity built in memory of Sardar Saheb on 31st October, 2018 was dedicated to the whole country and the world.
This is the world's longest human statue.
This is doubled in the Statue of Liberty of America.
The longest idol of the world fills the hearts of every Indian with pride -LRB- as Indian -RRB- when the world thinks that the longest idol of the world is established in our country -RRB- .
Every Indian's head gets higher in self-confidence.
You will be happy to know that in a year 26 lakh tourists had come to see the Statue of Unity statue.
That is, about eight and a half thousand people have made the glory of the Statue of Unity every day.
For Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel the belief of his heart has been expressed .
Now there are several attraction centres like CACTAS gardens, leopards, jungle safaris, child nutrition parks, Ekta Nursery and that is why local economy is developing, people are also getting new employment opportunities.
Professional training is also being provided to the Hostels or Hostels at home.
The locals have now started the farming of dragon fruits and I am confident that it will become the main means of their livelihood.
Friends, For the country, for every state, for tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a study.
How can we witness this place become a world famous tourist center within a year where people from all over the country come .
Transit system, accommodation, presence of guides, environmental ecosystems, everybody has improved.
A large number of economic developments have started and local people are innovating the needs of the tourists.
The government is observing its responsibility.
Friends, there is an Indian who will not be proud to know that a few days ago the Time magazine has set up the Statue of Unity among the 100 best tourist spots in the world .
I hope that all of you will come out of your valuable time to see this statute of unity but I would like to see that every Indian who has come out for touring will visit at least fifteen destinations of the country and stay there at night.
Friends, You all know that every year from 2014, 31st October is being celebrated as National Integration Day.
This day insists on maintaining unity, integrity and security at any cost of our country.
The Ran for Unity is being organised this day.
This will include all sections of the society.
Running, mind and body are beneficial for both.
I hope that all of you will participate in the race of 31st October - to keep the unity of the country and to keep your body healthy.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country into unity.
This mantra of unity is a revival of our lives and should try to strengthen the mantra of unity at every level in a diverse country like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and vigilant to strengthen the unity and concerns of the country.
There will be many examples around us who are working for this purpose.
But sometimes their words are very quick in our memory.
Friends, I remember the month of September 2010, when Allahabad High Court gave the opinion of Ram Janmabhoomi.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Devi was also killed on this day.
My dear countrymen, today every household, every village, every village, every village, every village, from east to west, from north to south, every corner of India, every corner of the country and every corner of the country, it is cleanliness.
Every person, every family, every village, I want to talk about the experience of cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is a collective effort of hundreds of crores of Indians.
So, the benefits of this are 1. 25 billion Indians.
But there is also a joyous and thrilling experience.
I heard and wanted to hear you too.
In such a difficult situation, it is not a matter of less heroism.
In such a terrible situation, our desperate soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country in the heroes but are also running the Clean Siachen Abhiyan.
It's so cold there that doesn't smell anything.
It is an important task to distinguish the waste in such a situation.
We all know that Siachen is an avalanche which is the source of rivers and pure water.
Clean India drive at one such place means ensuring purification of pure water for those living in the lower areas and utilising river water like Nubra and Shiok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is such a festival that creates a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Deepawali, there are some or the other new shops, some of the smaller families from the market.
I was once trying to buy local things.
If we get things that we need in our villages then we don't need to get rid of it.
I don't need to go to the district if you get it.
As much as we try to buy local things, more than 150 Gandhis will be transformed into a great festival.
And I always urge you to buy something or the other made by our Khadi workers.
Many people have bought a lot before Diwali, but there are many who believe that after Diwali, things may be cheaper.
So there will be a lot of people who are still buying.
So, while conveying his best wishes to Deepawali, I urge you to come here to buy local things.
See what important role can we play in achieving the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on this pilgrimage of Diwali.
We use baji as everyone in Deepavali.
But many times the fire takes place after unconsciousness.
Sometimes hurt.
I urge you all to be careful and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
My best wishes.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Is there any Indian who is not proud of our Armed Forces, our Armed Forces
Yesterday, a hundred and twenty five crore nations have celebrated the Parakram Parv.
We recalled the incident of Surgical Strike in 2016 when our armed forces responded to those who were tragic in the name of Proxy War against terrorism in our country.
Our Armed Forces organised exhibitions in different parts of the country so that the lions, especially the youth of the country can feel the strength of our country, how much we are capable and how our armed forces save their lives.
On the occasion of Parakram Parv, our Armed Forces shared the glorious heritage for the youth of the country.
It inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a function in the land of brave warriors in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
It is sure that our armies will give a strong answer to all those who want to destroy the environment of peace and development of our country.
But they are compassionately and are not supposed to share the overall powers of the country.
India is always committed and committed to maintaining peace.
In the two-two World Wars of the 1970s, more than one lakh of our soldiers have sacrificed their lives for peace.
Our vision never falls on the land of any other country.
It was our commitment to peace.
A few days ago, on the occasion of the centenary of the Haifa War in Israel, we remembered the brave soldiers of Mahishur, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lansar who had freed Haifa from the invaders.
This was also an exhibition of our soldiers to protect peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest number of armed forces in various UN peacekeeping forces.
For decades, our brave soldiers have played an important role in the world's peace system.
My dear countrymen, our air force is comparatively uncomparable.
The Fly Past, which is the most interested part of the masses on the occasion of Republic Day, is a glimpse of the unprecedented artistic and energy of our Air Force.
We celebrate Air Force Day on 8th October.
In 1947, when the Pakistani invaders started a terrible attack, the Air Force ensured that the Indian Army and the warfare could reach the battlefield at the right time to protect Srinagar from the invaders.
The Air Force also responded to the enemy in the war of 1996.
Who doesn't know about the Bangladesh Empire in 1971
In 1999, the Air Force played an important role in eliminating Kargil from innovators.
In Tiger Hill, the Air Force sustained bombardments on the enemy's grounds.
The entire nation is grateful to them for the role of the Air Force, be it relief and rescue operations or emergency management.
Air Forces contribution in combating natural calamities like Tufan, Jhanjha, floods or terrible drains and helping the people of the country is an example.
The Air Force has also set an example to ensure the equality of Gender Equality in the country and open the doors of each of its departments for the daughters of the country.
Now, along with the Air Force Women's Short Service Commission, I have also given the opportunity to select the option of the Permanent Commission, which I have announced from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
India can proudly say that in the Indian Armed Forces, not only men's strength but also women's contributions are increasing day by day.
The whole country was worried about how to save him.
You must know that Abhilash Tommy is a brave, brave and brave soldier of the Navy.
Abhilash was the first Indian who was traveling around the world without any modern technology.
For 80 days, when the Golden Global Race in the South of the Indian Ocean was moving at a rapid pace, there was a terrible maritime storm.
He told me to do something such a brave thing again by cutting such a big risk.
I pray for the rapid health of Abhilash Tommy and hope that his courage, this bravery, this determination, the power to win this fight will inspire the youth of our country.
My dear countrymen, children also know the importance of the day of October 2.
This year, it has a special significance.
We are going to celebrate 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi over the next two years.
The ideas and thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have reached the world today.
Like Dr. Martin Luthar King Jerusalem or Nelson Mandella, everybody has gained strength from Gandhiji's thinking and has fought for equal rights and dignity.
In todays Mann Ki Baat, I want to interact with you with you about a greater work of worshipping Bapu, which should be known to all the countrymen.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started libelizing some thoughts as a Constructive Programme or a Constructive Programme.
Later, when the freedom struggle became strong in 1995, Gandhiji had made a revised copy of his thoughts.
Respected Bapuji brought his thoughts to the people of the country about the rights of the farmers, the people of the village and the people of the labour brothers, cleanliness, promotion of education etc. which is also called Gandhi Charter.
Respective Bapu was a public interaction.
Meeting with people, the specialty of Bapu, who adopted people, was his own nature.
This is the valuable feature of Mahatma Gandhi's personality.
He made the people of the country realize that they are important and important for the development of the country.
He made this achievement a universal mass movement which was his best contribution to the freedom struggle.
In the freedom struggle, the people of every section of the society dedicated themselves to the call of Mahatma Gandhi.
Bapuji gave us a inspirational mantra which we know is the magic of Gandhiji.
Gandhiji said, "I am telling you about a strategy that whenever you feel doubtful or unhappy, remember my thoughts.
Remember the poorest and the weakest person you have seen in your life and question yourself how much you are thinking of taking steps will be beneficial for that person.
Does it mean that millions of hungry and hungry people will achieve self-reliance
That's when you're gonna see you're suspected and irreversible.
My dear countrymen, Gandhijis strategy is equally important even today.
Financial power and buying capabilities of the country's growing middle class today.
If this benefit is reached to the poor, then my happiness will also grow multiplying.
Keeping in mind this strategy of Gandhiji, we must keep in mind that whenever we buy something, whenever we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, then we must keep in mind that due to every purchase, some countrymen will get better and those who have sweated in the production of goods, who have invested in their talents, who have been engaged in their talent, they will get some benefits.
This is Gandhijis Strategy, this is Gandhijis message and I believe that a small step can bring about a big change in the lives of the poor.
Likewise, today we may feel that we can contribute to the power of fighting against poverty in this small work and economic empowerment of our country.
And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's era.
Like, on the occasion of a special event, think of buying khadi and handicrafts.
Two days later, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri ji with a revered Bapu.
As soon as the name of Shastriji is high, there is an unlimited reverence in our hearts.
His harmony is always a matter of pride for every countryman.
The characteristics of Lal Bahadur Shastri were very soft from outside, but at the same time he was firmly committed.
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan was the director of his great personality.
During the last one and a half years, he has given the mantra of reaching the summit of the youth and the farmers of the country, which is the result of his selfless penance to the nation.
Millions of people have participated in this campaign and I am also fortunate to donate sanitation work with children in Ambedkar School, Delhi.
I went to the school where the foundation was laid by Father Father himself.
School children, college students, NCCs, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups and Corporate World have provided Swachhta Labour to the elderly.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Swachhta lovers for this.
Let's hear a phone call, "Namskar, my name is Shaitan Singh.
I specially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission has not only become a witness to the success of the country but also in the entire world.
This time, India is organising the worlds largest Swachhta Sammelan - Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Officials of the Ministry of Cleanliness from all over the world and experts from these topics will come and share the experiences and experiments related to transparency.
It is imperative to ensure freedom, peace and justice for the afflicted, afflicted and deprived.
Inspired by his thinking, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was constituted on October 12, 1994.
NHRC will complete twenty-five years within a few days.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but also helped in increasing spiritual pride.
Our favourite leader, former Prime Minister Prayat Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clearly stated that human rights are not a foreign idea.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal policy of the Vedic era is decorated.
NHRC has made widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing misuse of it.
The Commission has created an environment of hope and faith among the people of the country in this journey of 25 years.
I think it is very hopeful for the creation of a healthy society, for democratic values.
Now, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up along with the work on human rights at the national level.
All these great men have inspired us, we bow down to them.
Even this year, we are willing to organise Run for Unity in our villages in Ganj, City, Mahanagar.
This is the right way to remember Sardar Saheb because he has worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge you all that on 31st October, through Run for Unity, we strengthen this endeavour of connecting every individual, every individual, every individual, every individual with unity.
My dear countrymen, Navratri, Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi. I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all of you for this sacred festival.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today the whole country is celebrating the Rakhibandhan festival.
I convey my best wishes to all the nations on this holy occasion.
This festival of Rakhibandhan symbolizes the love and belief of sisters and brothers.
For centuries, this festival is a great example of social harmony.
There are many such incidents in the history of the country when a security link has been found to be linked to the people of two states or different religions.
A few days later, Janmashtami.
The winds of the sky will be heard by the window of 'Hathi horse pal-ki Jai Kanhaiya Lal-ki' and 'Govinda-Govinda'.
It's a different kind of joy to enjoy this garden by shouting himself in the color of Krishna.
You must have started organising Dahi-Handi in different parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra.
I am grateful to Chinmai for taking care of this thing.
Friends, Apart from Rakhibandhan, Shravan Purnima is celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I congratulate all those people who have been able to save, move forward and reach the masses.
Every language has its own importance.
There is a huge element of knowledge that works in every field of life in the culture language and literature.
Whether it is science or science, agriculture or health, science or architecture or management, economics or environment, the mantra of fighting challenges like global warming is detailed in our minds.
You all will be happy to know that all the people of Mattu village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka have chosen Sanskrit language as a medium of interaction.
You will be surprised to know that culture is one of the languages that can create an infinite word.
We can use English quotations and sometimes say shayaris.
But those who know the so-called words of Sanskrit, they know how much less the correct description of the matter can be done through these specific words of Sanskrit.
In fact, if a Guru gives his disciples a naked knowledge, there is no such thing or wealth all over the world that can steal the credit of the disciplinary Guru.
On the occasion of Teachers Day, we always recall the great admirers and the former President of India, Bharat Ratna, Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan.
Teachers Day was celebrated all over the country on his birth anniversary.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country for the coming Teachers Day and also recall their dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, our farmer brothers and those who labour hard, bring news of rains to them.
A few days ago, we have seen how floods have caused the lives of Kerala to die.
In such a difficult situation, the entire country has come near Kerala.
I convey my deep condolences to those families who lost their loved ones due to this disaster.
I would like to assure the families of those distressed families that have been damaged.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural calamity should be quickly healthy.
It is my belief that the life of Kerala will soon become normal by filling it with unprecedented life and courage.
The way disaster devastates life, it is extremely unfortunate, but in this rare day we also get the religion of humanity.
Everybody from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is trying to ensure that the areas where there is a terrible calamity, it is Kerala or any district or region of India.
People of all ages and people associated with all kinds of work are enhancing their help.
Everybody thinks how to share the sorrows of the people of Kerala so that it is impossible.
We all know that the Armed Forces are the hero of rescue operations in Kerala.
They have taken all the ways to save the flood victims.
Air Force, Navy or Army, BS-F, C-IS-F, R-A-F each has been insisting on rescue operations and relief.
I would like to specifically mention the hard work of the NDRF personnel.
The way they have worked in combating these dangers is a remarkable compliment.
The power of NDRF, their commitment and the ability to bring the situation to the income of all the nations has created a devotional seat.
Dear countrymen, I have read the suggestions for Mann Ki Baat that most of the people have written about it is our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
From Ghaziabad to Kirti, Swati Baats from Sonipat, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banarji from West Bengal, from Katihar to Akhilesh Pand in Bihar, many more people have requested me to talk about the various aspects of the life of Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov.
Everyone has condoled the passing away of Atal ji, the people of the country and the world on the occasion of 16th.
He was a nation leader who left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago and was said to be far away from active politics in the last ten years.
He didn't see him specially in the news.
The affection, devotion and condolences of all of them for Atal ji are the guardians of his great personality.
This country will always be grateful to Atal ji for bringing Good Governance into the original stream.
Today, I would like to tell you about another example of Atal ji's great personality that is the political culture that he has tried to bring about changes in the political culture and the efforts made to provide a systematic infrastructure to the political culture, it will benefit the country and it will be sure in the future.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the Economic Amendment Act, 2003.
This amendment brings about two major changes in our politics.
The first is to limit the Cabinet of the States to fifteen of the total seats in the Assembly.
Atal ji brought about a change in this system, as a result of which the efficiency of money and wealth increases.
Atal ji was the only visionary who brought about a change in the situation and made a healthy and well-being system in politics.
Atal ji was a real patriot.
In 2001, when Atal ji presented the budget, he made it eleven instead of 5 pm.
Another freedom we benefit from Atal ji through creation of Indian Flag Code.
It has been applied since 2002, which enables tricolor excitement in public space.
The ordinary Indians have the opportunity to excite the national flag.
This way he brought our favourite Tiranga to the masses.
You have seen how Atal ji brought about change in the polling process and strengthened the country by taking brave steps in the elections.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion about the Parliament today, it is said of constraints and haihalla, but when there is a good thing, there is no special discussion about it.
A few days ago, the session of the Parliament ended.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 74.
It is the result that the Lok Sabha 21 Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have passed 14 bills by quitting the party's interests.
This session of Parliament will be remembered for social justice and youth welfare.
Several important bills have been passed in this session for the development of youth and backward classes.
You all know, for a few decades, the OBC commission was being set up like the SCST commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled the commitment of the OBC Commission this time and has given this institution a constitutional right.
This step will help in achieving the objectives of social justice successfully.
The work of passing the revised bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has also been initiated in this session.
The Act will further protect the interests of the SCs and STs.
At the same time, it will protect their oppressors from the atrocities and increase their faith.
There is no civilization against the people of the country that cannot bear injustice in any way.
The criminals of this crime will be punished for at least 10 years and if the girls of less than 12 years are killed then they will be punished.
A few days ago, you might have read in the newspaper, a court in Mandsore, Madhya Pradesh has heard the sentence of slaughtering two convicts for the crime of killing a naval.
Earlier, a court of Katni in Madhya Pradesh was sentenced to death after hearing only five days.
A court in Rajasthan has also given such a rapid decision.
The Act will play a structural role in resolving the case of crime against women and girls.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
The Tin Talaq Bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, though it was not possible to pass this session in the Rajya Sabha, I would like to assure Muslim women, the entire country is with all the powers to provide justice to them.
When we come forward to protect the interests of the country, we can change the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
We have set up an ideal for each other in this emergence session.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, at this moment, millions of nations are committed to the Asian Federation organised in their vision.
Every morning, in the newspapers, in the televisions, in the news, in the social media, an Indian player has won medals.
Asian Games are still going on.
I congratulate all those who have won medals for the country.
I convey my best wishes to those who are still contesting.
The Indian sportspersons, especially the Shooting and Wrestling, are showing the best that we have not been able to do well in all the games that our sportspersons are taking medals like Wushu and Rowing.
These are not medals, it is a symbol of the courage to touch the sky of Indian sports and Indian competitors and their dreams.
The number of our daughters in the list of medal winners for the country is a positive one.
Even those youngsters who have won medals are 15-16 years old.
It is also a good sign that many of the sportspersons who have won medals have emerged from the well-known villages and mafshals and have achieved this success with hard work.
On 29th August, I congratulate all the sportspersons on the occasion of National Sports Day and also pay my homage to Hockey's magician Shri Dhan Chand ji.
I appeal to all the citizens of the country to play and look at your fitness because a healthy India will build a rich and prosperous India.
The bright future of India will be built when India is fit.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners of the Asian Games and convey my best wishes to the rest of the sportspersons.
But the Vrihadeshwar temple of Thanjabur in Tamil Nadu is that place where this unforgettable combination of architecture and engineering is seen.
Everybody was surprised to see Rani Ki Bao in the eleventh century in Patan of Gujarat.
The laboratory of engineering equivalent to the land of India.
There are many engineers in India who have imagined imagination and have made examples in the engineering world.
Our great engineers have such elements in the heritage of our great engineers whose work still surprises people.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
In that part of the country, he recalled him with great respect and respect.
In his memory, on 15th September, the Engineers Day was celebrated.
The engineers of our country have made their own independent identity in the East.
I recall the unprecedented achievements of the engineering world, in 2001, that terrible earthquake in Kutch of Gujarat.
He enjoyed seeing me, look at my house.
It's Bhunga in Kutch.
My house has seen three earthquakes.
He was very proudly talking about this thing and I feel that even a long time ago, the engineers of our times used to build houses in the local environment and conditions that would protect the people.
Now, when we are celebrating the Engineers Day, we have to think about the future, we have to organize workshops at different places.
We have to think if we have to learn new things in the changing times
Do you have to teach
The whole world is fighting with natural calamities.
What's the new use of stractical engineering here
What's his course
What should the students teach
I convey my best wishes to all of you on this spirit.
I'll talk again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
It has emerged the thinking of humans.
You must have seen a team of 12 adolescent football players and their coaches in Thailand in a cave.
It takes usually for hours to go to the cave and get out of there.
But that day Bhagyadevi had another desire.
When they entered the cave, they suddenly got a lot of water accumulated in the mouth of the cave due to heavy rains.
All efforts are being made to know where those adolescents are, how they can be brought out.
But I want to see this whole thing in a different way.
The government of the country, the parents of the children, the people of the family, the media, the citizens of the country have shown an integral behavior of peace and patience.
Everybody has joined this mission in a team bound manner.
I think it is a matter of learning and self-reliance.
Mother-father didn't worry or mother didn't leave the water.
Everyone's patience, restraint, the peaceful use of the entire society is really educational for us.
In this operation, a Thailand navy has to give life to a soldier.
The whole world is surprising that despite such a catastrophic situation, the rescuers have worked with courage and patience in the watery dark cave.
This is what shows that when people are united, there is a lot of surprise.
It is necessary that we think of ourselves in peaceful minds and continue to work for it.
A few days ago, the popular poet of our country, Neeraj, was an attempt.
The characteristics of the poet Niraj were hope, faith, determination and confidence.
Everything of poet Niraj can inspire all of us to give a lot of strength and inspiration.
He wrote: The darkness will be removed as soon as the rains are burnt, the darkness will be removed and the poet will pay homage to Neeraj.
The months of July and next month are very important for the farmers and for all the youth.
Because this is the time when Peak session for colleges.
Like truth, millions of youngsters go out of school and go to college.
In the month of February and March, the exams, questions and questions were written in the month of April and May, enjoying the vacations of Resolution, the future lifestyle and the career chase.
The month of July is the month when the youngsters take their lives in a narrow way, when the focus moves away from Kochhen and goes to Kat-of.
The attention of the students goes from Home to Hostel.
Students enter the umbrella of Professors from the umbrella of Parents.
I am confident that my young friends are very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of the college life.
For the first time, get out of the house, get out of the village, get out of a safe environment and make yourself a guide.
All these youngsters left their homes and left their lives to a new path.
There is no way to study without books, but there is a desire to find innovative things.
Old friends are very precious.
The youngsters who have left their homes and went out to find out the place and know about the people, languages and cultures there.
My best wishes to all the youngsters.
Her father has been supplied to the family forever.
I congratulate ASHARAM for this success in that situation.
There are so many afflicted families who have shown their hard work and concentration in adverse conditions that inspire all of us.
Like Prince Kumar of Delhi, a resident of DTC, or absent Gupta of Kolkata, who has been studying under the light of the footpath, the daughter of Ahmedabad, Afrien Shaikh, whose father Auto Challan, is the daughter of a school driver of Nagpur, Khushi of a school driver of Haryana, Kartik, son of a brick kid of Jharkhand, Ramesh Sahu.
The victim of a genetic disease called Spinal Mascular Autopsy since birth in Anushka Pand, a complicated girl from Gurgaon, has achieved the success of showing the world with a strong commitment and a strong obstacle.
When we look around us, we'll get such examples.
Any good event in any part of the country gives me strength and inspiration.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago I came to the notice of a news in which it was written: "Modi's dream was fulfilled by two youths.
After reading the inner news, I found out how our youth is trying to bring about changes in the lives of the common man through technology's smart and creative usage.
Once I had requested them to discuss with Indian youth in the city of Technology Hub San Jose, America, how to use their talents for India and take time out.
I requested Brain-drain to replace Brain-Gain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Vajpayee, have made an innovative effort by acknowledging this challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together have created a Smart Village App using their professional skills.
This app will not only connect the people of the village to the entire world but will now get any information or news in their mobile phones.
The App provides all the telephone directory of the village, News Section, Events List, Health Centre, Information Centre.
The App is also very important for the farmers, the App features and the FACT rates in Kisans are working to sell their products from one side.
Thank you very much for your phone
In fact, the pilgrimage of Pandurpur is a wonderful festival.
Friends, The eleventh month of the sixth month, which was on 23rd July this year, the pilgrimage of Pandurpur fled with Jakjamk.
Pandurpur is a sacred city of Kolapur district of Maharashtra.
The saints like Sant Gyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram have been dancing in the magic palanquin and dancing in the name of Bithal Bhagwan.
Devotees reached there for his vision of Lord Bithal, who is also called Bithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Bittal protected the poor, helpless and the victims.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have immense faith and devotion to this god.
You will go to the Bithoba temple of Pandurpur, there is a different experience of the glory, beauty and spiritual joy.
I urge the audience of the Mann Ki Baat programme to achieve the experience of the pilgrimage of Pandurpur.
Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram, such innumerable saints are still teaching the common man in Maharashtra.
We have a message of goodwill, love and brotherhood from them like Vrud or Abhang.
This mantra of society can fight against blind faith, we get from them.
They have shown the right way to the society in the right time and have ensured that the old mischief of the society is far away from the society and brings the feelings of compassion, equity and goodwill among the people.
This was a great man, Lokmanya Tilak, who made a deep impression in the minds of many Indians.
We recall Tilak jis birth anniversary on 23rd July and 1st of his death anniversary.
Lokmanya Tilak was brave and self-confidence.
He had the power and intellectuality to mislead the British rulers.
The British were so afraid of Lokmanya Tilak that there was a complaint of monarchy against him three-three times in 20 years.
I am telling you about the statues of Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
In the month of October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, think that more than 40 thousand people had gathered to welcome him 100 years ago.
Later, he decided to set up a memorial of His Excellency Tilak at Victoria Garden, the ueen of Vallabhbhai Patel, the ueen of the United Kingdom.
Normally, the British ruler was very dissatisfied in this regard and the calculators there used to repeat the construction of a memorial called Smaru Hela.
But Sardar Saheb is Sardar Saheb, he will quit but he will leave the idol of Lokmanya Tilak.
Finally, the statue of Sardar Patel was constructed and called on Mahatma Gandhi on 28 February 1929 to inaugurate the statue.
During the Maha-Udhatan programme, a revered Bapu said that the Ahmedabad Puraswamy has not only received a person as a Mayor but also got a power that has been able to establish the statue of Tilak.
My dear countrymen, one of the special features of this statue that Sardar Patel had established, is present here in the Chair of Lokmanya Tilak ji, which is written under this idol 'Swaraj is my birth rights'.
It was written to the English as God's instructions.
The first public Ganesh Festival was inaugurated by Lokmanya Tilak.
Even though the Common Ganesha Festival was traditionally enriched by reverence and organisations, it became an effective medium for social awareness, unity, integrity and equality.
Now the Ganesh Mandap is seen on the streets in the lap of any city.
The Ganesh Festival is organised by all the families of the streets.
This is an unprecedented opportunity for our youth so that they can achieve special capabilities like organisation and leadership and develop them within themselves.
My dear countrymen, I have also told you last time that even today I am recalling Lokmanya Tilak ji and you should celebrate the festival of Ganesh with Dhumdham but celebrate the festival of Parvesh Bandav.
The idol of Ganesh ji should be decorated and worshipped.
Those who dedicated their lives so that the country can breathe in a free India.
I'm talking to Chandrashekhar Azad.
There are no youngsters in India who cannot get inspired by listening to this poem. The poems like Sarforshi Kitmanna of Hamre inspired Tejis like Hai Jor Kaitna Baju-e-Katil May, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azads bravery and inspired many youngsters for freedom.
Azad had lived his life, but he never had a head in front of foreign rule.
It is my privilege that Chandrashekhar Azad has got the opportunity to visit the village Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I bow down to two great children of Mother India, Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, Jewish Church held in Finland in the 20th World Athletics Summit, India's Bahadur daughter, Kishanakanya Hima Das won the gold medal.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, has e-mailed me from Indonesia in my letter and is now preparing for the Asian Federation.
Ekta is writing in E-Mail. The moment in the life of an athlete is that when he has shrinked up and showed my pride that I have done.
Ekta, we all are proud of you.
His success is because he has made his challenges a medium of success.
In 2003, unity in the Road Accident was lost in the lower part of the terrible body, but this girl did not lose courage and empowered herself and reached her goal.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Ekta Bhayana ji, Yogesh Katunia ji, Sundar Singh ji for their courage and struggle.
Go ahead, play, improve.
My dear countrymen, many events of history in the past months are full of festivals but sometimes diseases enter home for weather.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the good health of the country, for the coming months and for many festivals that have been coming for centuries.
Mann Ki Baat will meet again.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, once again this occasion of Mann Ki Baat has been fortunate to be with you all.
A few days ago there was a historic cricket cricket cricket in Bangalore.
You might have understood that I am talking about the test test test between India and Afghanistan.
This was the first international test test test in Afghanistan, and it is a matter of pride for all Indians that this historical match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two sides showcased excellent sports skills in this match.
Rashid Khan, a member of Afghanistan, played a very good role in the IPL this year, and I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashrafgani, tagged me and wrote in his Twitter: "Afghanistan people are proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I also thank our Indian friends who have created a platform to showcase the sports skills of our sportspersons.
The best of Afghan, Rashid has represented him.
He was a treasure in the world of cricket, and he enjoyed a bit - No, I don't want to give it to anyone.
This match will be remembered for all of us.
Though it was the first match, it is normal to remember, but I will remember this match for another thing.
The Indian team has done a job that is unprecedented throughout the world.
At the time of taking the Indian team, a winner team has done what he can do.
At the time of taking up the Indian team, the Afghan team invites those who are playing international matches for the first time, and simultaneously photographs.
What can happen to sportsman spirit and sportsmanship.
The best way to find out the talent of the sports society and the talent of our youth.
My best wishes to the two teams of India and Afghanistan
My dear countrymen, on 21st June this fourth day of Yoga has seen a magnificent view.
Be it the Brazil-European Parliament, the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York, the Japanese Navy's fighter ship, people are exercising yoga at all places.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, the historic event of Yoga was organised and I have been told that many seats have been demonstrated by women.
India and China have together practiced Yoga on the high snow peaks of Ladakh.
If people from all over the world participate in the Yoga Day celebrations with so much enthusiasm, then why would it not be many times in India
Our warriors of the Air Force have embraced everybody from the ground to 15,000 feet high.
There was a sighting scene, they were not sitting in the air, they were swinging in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high houses or fields of sports, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
A vision of Ahmedabad was magnificent, where about 750 dynasty brothers and sisters have made a record by doing yoga at one place.
I believe, today Yoga is working for wellness and revolution.
Wellness is being tried by yoga, I hope that it will move forward.
Gradually many people will choose Yoga as a part of their lives.
Thank you for your phone.
Did you go to Kinan, Kabirdas jiken Imghar
The meaningful friend is the one who can understand the sorrows of others.
Whoever doesn't understand the sorrow and misery of others, he's foolish.
Kabirdas ji stressed on social coordination.
"Jugme Bairy Koi Nehi, Joe is cool.
Give me the pulses, please.
Kabirdas ji says, Please, that is religion, that is love and sin.
His invaluable speech shows a similar impact even after this day, now when we talk about Saint Kabirdas ji, he remembers a compassion.
This is the glory of the Guru and this is the Guru Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
Those who have shown the path of truth to millions of people, who have been inspiring people for a long time.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanakdev ji will be held in 2019.
There is another history that belongs to Punjab.
The terrible event of Jallianwala Bagh in 2019, which is going to be completed for 100 years, was the event that embarrassed humanity.
On April 13, 1919, somebody forgot the black day when all the limits of destruction by using energy were shot on innocent, destitute and innocent people.
This is going to be achieving 100 years of austerity, but we will always keep in mind the words of this incident that can never be solved through violence and destruction.
Peace, non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice are always conquered.
My dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, wrote the Narendra Modi Mobile App on 6th July, 2019.
Ramanji, thank you all for the first time
It is very good to see your interest in the history of India.
You know, Dr.
It might be very few people know, in 1937, Dr.
In the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had spoken in Bengal at the Convocation of the University of Kolkata.
This was the first example when a person was speaking in Bengal at the Convocation of the University of Kolkata during the British rule.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee was the first Minister of Industries of India and in a sense, he established a strong foundation stone for Indias progress in an industrial and holistic manner.
In 1996, the first industrial policy of independent India was based on their plans and visions.
Dr.
India will be self-sufficient, enriched and prosperous in every sector of industry.
He wanted India to create a big industry and also focus on MSMEs, textiles, textiles and textiles.
He has set up financing and organisation setups for proper development of cotton arts and micro-economics, for which all II between 1947 and 1950.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee had a great contribution.
He was very emotional about the development of West Bengal.
His thoughts, consciousness and activity have protected a part of West Bengal and is still a part of India.
Let us recall the message of this unity of Dr. Shyamaprasad Mukherjee and continue to strive forward India through harmony and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, for the last few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with those people who have benefited from various schemes of the government through video calls.
I got the opportunity to get away from the files and listen to the faces of the people.
People have said that their resolve, happiness and grief are about availability.
I think it was not merely a government function but it was a different kind of learning experienc and how can it be more satisfaction and satisfaction than the joy I have seen in the eyes of the people
When I heard the words of a common man, his simple words, compassionate feelings, it touched the heart.
I knew how adults from the Common Service Centre, the elderly from the pension of the elderly to the common man have been helping them create a passport.
A sister from Chhattisgarh is doing business of making ice-creams from it and providing affordable medicines to lakhs of youngsters of the country like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand.
The youth in West Bengal who were looking for jobs two-three years ago, now they are not only running their business with success, they have been providing jobs to 10-15 people.
In Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa, school students are working on important issues like West Management at the Tickering Lab in the school at a young age.
There was a story of such innumerable experiences and there was no corner of the country where there was no message of success.
I am happy to note that I have experienced the strength of the success of the common man from the success of the government, the strength of the country and the strength of the country, the strength of the dream of a New India.
There are some people in the society, unless they talk desperately, do not talk of despair, do not work to create unbelief, do not find ways to break instead of rocks, they do not get peace.
In such an environment, when the common man speaks about the availability of his life with new hopes, new zeal, then his success is not the government.
The daughter-in-law of a small village in remote areas also inspires 125 crore people.
I thank the people of the country.
You have connected 40-40, 50-50 lakh people with this video bridge programme and have given me new energy.
I once again express my gratitude to you.
I also felt that this smell of goodness.
In fact, it is a matter of fact that the corporate professionals of Bengaluru and the IT engineers together have created a 'healthy prosperity trust' and have executed this Trust to double the income of the farmers.
Through this Trust, efforts are being made to enhance the income of the farmers.
How to harvest organic farming with new methods of agriculture and how to harvest one crop along with other crops, all these trainings are being provided to the farmers through this Trust.
Earlier, all the farmers who were dependent on the same crop, not only the crops but also the benefits. Today, they are not only harvesting several crops.
The crop will be better when good species of seeds are utilised and the seed bank has been set up separately.
Women are also engaged in the Seed Bank care and women are also associated with it.
My dear countrymen, one year of GST is going to be completed.
The dream of One Nation One Tax has been realized today.
If I have to credit someone for this system, I will give this credit to the states.
GST is a beautiful example of Cooperative Federalism, where all the states have decided to take care of the welfare of the country together and as a result, such a huge tax reform system has been set up in the country.
Till now, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can be proud that the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken so far, despite the presence of representatives of different political thinkers, different states and different priority states.
Before GST, there were 17 different taxes in the country, but after the commencement of this system, the same tax system is being implemented across the country.
After coming to GST, check posts have also been stopped and thereby enhancing the movement of goods and other goods has not only saved time but also benefited in logistics sectors.
GST is perhaps the worlds largest tax reform system.
In India, such a huge tax reform has been successful because the people of the country have adopted this system and this manpower has ensured the success of GST.
It is generally believed that it takes 5 to 7 years to be implemented in such a large country with such a huge population.
But the enthusiasm of the honest countrymen, the flow of the festival of honesty and the participation of the people of the country is the result of this new tax system, which has created its place within a year, has been accomplished and it is being revised by the needy inbuilt system.
This is a great achievement that has achieved 125 crore people of the country.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
You must remember that a team of six women commanders of the Navy had been traveling for the past few months.
I want to say something about the name Navika Sagar Parikrama.
The six daughters of India have returned to India on 21st May, 2019 through the I-NSV Tarini of more than 250 days and the entire country has greeted them with warm welcome.
Approximately 22,000 nautical distances have been crossed by various oceans and some sea travels.
This is an unprecedented event all over the world.
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again I congratulate these daughters for their adventurous work, for enhancing the fame of the Navy, for enhancing Indias dignity, and especially the daughters of India for reaching this message to the world.
You must have seen that in the last few days, there has been new information about Mount Everest-Jai people.
On 16th May, five tribal students from a Ashram Vidyalaya in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisa Dhurube, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madabi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Swayam have won the world's highest series.
They were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Le-Ladakh since August 2017.
They were elected in Mission Shaurya.
And with the help of the name, they have won the Everest and have brightened the name of the country.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to these small students of Chandrapur School.
Recently, the sixteen-year-old Shivangi reader has won Everest in Nepal as the largest Indian woman.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Dia Everest win the first father-son jute.
Not only the youth are winning the Everest, but the 150th Mrs. Sangeeta Behal also won the Everest on May 19, 2019.
Some of the Everest ascendants are those who are not only efficient but also experienced.
This is not only a commendable task but also administering their responsibility towards cleanliness and environment.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the brave heroes, especially the daughters.
So many people from different fields will come forward to support this issue.
I will say about Fit I India, I believe that the country will play as much as we play.
In the social media, people are sharing their fitness challenges, while tagging others and challenging them.
I believe that this is a very good process and such challenges encourage us to fit and fit others.
My dear countrymen, many times in Mann Ki Baat, you have heard something about sports and sportspersons from me.
Chhabi Yadavji, thank you for your phone
These games were part of summer vacations.
There are two tracks in traditional sports.
Outdoor is also indoor.
Our countrys diversity might be seen in these sports.
The same game is known by different names.
It was played at the Square Board of 8 or 8 with a rope or a skull.
Its name is Attu in Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Dyam in Tamil Nadu and Changpo in Rajasthan.
If the people of different states don't know each other's language, they're right at the time of playing.
It's a village-city game that looks everywhere.
It is also known by the name of different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotivilla or Karabilla.
In Orissa, it is called Shootwadi, in Maharashtra, it is called Bittidalu.
Conventional sports are being created which helps in physical efficiency as well as enhancing our local thinking, concentration, awareness and swelling.
And these are not just sports, they teach the values of our life, to determine our goals, to achieve determination, to create team spirit, to help each other.
A few days ago, I was seeing that our traditional sports have been included in the training programmes of Business Management to develop a collective personality and improve inter-parsonal skills.
At the same time, we are aware of our culture and traditions.
Some sports are aware of our society, environment etc.
Now, we should move ahead with school, education, youth and encourage these sports.
We can create a museum of our traditional sports through Crowd Sourcing.
The video of this game can be made so that the rules of sports can be displayed on how to play.
Animation films can also be made so that our new generations can know about these games, play and grow.
This time theme Beat Plastic Pollution.
I urge you to understand the importance of this thinking and ensure that we will not use polythene, Low Grade plastic and try to reduce the harmful impact of plastic pollution on our nature, wildlife and our health.
I urge the World Environment Day website, Weddia 2018 to see all the data and try to use it in your daily life.
The loss of lives, the wealth is damaged.
All these changes have been made in the Weather Pattern.
This is what Mahatma Gandhi has said for his entire life.
Today, India is talking about Climate Justice, the COP 21 and the Paris Agreement. We have gathered the world through the International Solar Alliance.
In this Personnel Day, we should think about what we can do to make this world cleaner and greener.
How to move forward in this path, what innovation can be done
Rainfall is coming.
Now, we can plant trees in record numbers, not only planting but it is also important to take care of the trees till the trees grow.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
You are now remembering the 21st of June, not just you, but the whole world is remembering the 21st of June.
The International Day of Yoga has been celebrated all over the world on 21st June and it is acknowledged that the preparation of this event has started a few months ago.
It is reported that preparations are being made to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day across the world.
There is a boldness in yoga which always protects us like a serpent.
Forgiveness is created as mother feels for her child, mental peace becomes our sustainable friend.
Bharathuhari said that by doing regular yoga, the truth is our child, please our hypocrisy, self-confidence, our brotherhood, the world works to describe our bed and knowledge.
Whenever there are so many virtues, this yogi naturally wins all kinds of fears.
Once again, I urge all the nations to take forward the massive heritage of Yoga and create a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
My dear countrymen, today on 27th May, the first Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's thirteenth day.
I salute Pandit ji.
In the month of May 1857, the Indians introduced their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were embarrassed against injustice.
It is sad that for a long time, we have been calling the incident of 1857 as a rebellion or a soldier's rebellion.
This incident was not just a small one, it was an attempt to hurt our self-esteem.
This brave Savarkar was absurd and wrote that what happened in 1857 was not an enemy but the first battle for freedom.
With Savarkar, the heroes of India House in London celebrated the fifteenth birth anniversary celebrations.
He was both a devotee of arms and science.
Originally heroic Savarkar, who is known for his struggle against Bahaduri and the British Raj.
Besides this, he was also a poet and a social reformer who has always stressed on harmony and unity.
Savarkar ji has made a unique description about our dear Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Savarkar is taking both poetry and revolution together.
Being a compassionate poet, he was also a brave poet.
Our daughters, who were sometimes forced to visit the stupa of waste from the knees to the household, today they are learning the work of sewing and sewing the poor.
I convey my best wishes to our daughters full of hope and faith.
They have shown that if you are inspired to do something and you are grateful for it, you can achieve success in all the difficulties and you can see it not only in every corner of the country but also in every corner of India.
If you look at the neighbours around you, you will see how the people are destroying the problem.
You have experienced that whenever we go to a tea shop, we get satisfaction by eating tea there, discussions and discussions with some people are also done.
This discussion is also political, social, film, sports and sportspersons, the problems of the country should be solved in such a way, but most of the times this discussion is limited to discussions.
He organised education, health and food for all the children who came to school.
He kissed the darkness of their lives.
"Tamso Mother Gamaya" doesn't know who is a familiar, but it has been shown by D. Prakash.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for society and for the entire country.
A lot of inspirations will be around you too.
There may be innumerable incidents.
Come on, let us take forward the positive mindset.
It is so hot in June that people wait for rains and hope for the clouds of the sky.
After some time from today, people will wait for the moon.
Looking at the moon means the essence of the Egypt.
At the end of a month's fast at the time of Ramzan, the festival of Egypt is a symbol of the start of a wonderful festival.
My belief is that everybody will commemorate the joy of joy, especially the children will get good joy.
I hope that the festival of Egypt will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
My best wishes to all.
My dear countrymen, thank you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Currently, the Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April, 2018.
71 countries of the world including India participated in this.
When such a big event is organised, thousands of sportspersons from all over the world should participate in it and imagine how encouraging environment can be created

Every Indian has been proud of this achievement.
After the commencement of the sports, when the athletes representing India with the medals switched on the victory platform, playing national music, the feeling of happiness, pride and respect, this is a unique experience.
But I want to hear what I have heard from these players.
Indias exhibition in the Commonwealth Games was very good and it was a specialty.
Manika Batra has won medals in all the events.
Manika Batra is the first Indian woman who has brought India a gold medal in personal Table Tennis.
The 15-year-old Indian shooter Anish Vanwala has been named as the youngest sportsperson of India for the Gold medal.
He has won the medal in Para Power Lifting at the Commonwealth Games of India, the only Chinese in India.
This time the games have also won most of the medals of the specialist women player Ray.
Whether it is squash or boxing, weighing or shooting, women players have shown their parameters.
At the end of Badminton, two Indian sportspersons, Saina Nehru and P.
V.
The whole country has seen this game.
Sportspersons participating in the games have come from small towns from different parts of the country.
This place has crossed a lot of obstacles.
Everybody has an important role in this journey of his parents, parents, parents, coaches, other helpers, schools, schools and schools.
Their friends have also played a role in increasing the mindset of the sportspersons.
Together with the sportspersons, I convey my best wishes to all of them
My body is my weapon, my original substance water, my world is swimming.
Another person, I feel myself happy and healthy by roaming around in the morning by writing Ruma Devnath.
We will laugh when we are happy, he added.
Smt. Devnath, there is no doubt that happiness or happiness is fitness.
Dhabal patterns were written with their trekking pictures.
Traveling and trekking for me is Fit I India.
It looks nice to see that many people are also encouraging our youth for Fit I India.
The painter gave a video to the Akshaykumar Twitter.
I've seen that video, you will also be able to see that video shows him to exercise with a wooden piece.
He said that this exercise is very beneficial for stomach and back muscles.
I think this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
You're also making preparations.
The importance of International Yoga Day on 21st June has now been accepted by the entire world.
There is no need to tell anybody in India or the world about the use of yoga habits to keep the entire physical development, mental development and mental conditions normal.
You might have seen animated video, where I was shown.
The work that a teacher can do is being done through animation, so I thank the Animation Producers for taking care of this work.
My young friends, all of you are coming out of the tests and are now thinking of holidays.
I want to invite you for a new task today.
I have seen that many youngsters are now spending time to learn something new.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to live a new way from paper-column, computer.
My young friends, for a special internship, I would urge you all to join the three-four Ministries of the Government of India like Sports, Human Resource Development, Drinking Water Division, Swachh Bharat Summer II.
Those who have done a good job in the university will be rewarded at the national level and those who have successfully worked in the university will be rewarded.
I once again invite the students and the youngsters to join the Internship and benefit them.
I hope our youth will take forward the Swachhta movement.
I want to know about all your efforts.
You must send your experiences, send stories, send pictures, send video.
Regularly look at the India programme, how many people from different parts of the country are doing well and how good people are talking about.
A few days ago, I was seeing that some young children from Delhi are studying freely and freely. These youngsters have started a funny study for the education of the children of Delhi's Path Shishu and Basti.
Initially, they thought about the disintegration of the roads and the children who worked for smaller jobs were also involved in this developmental work.
Initiating 15 children of the township near Geetha Colony, Delhi has become a composition of two thousand children at 12 places in the capital today.
Young teachers are making efforts to change the society by taking out two hours of free time from their busyness throughout the day.
Brothers and sisters, Just like this, some farmers of Uttarakhand have established an example of inspiration for the farmers of the country.
They have not only changed their fate but also their fate.
Bhutta, yog cultivation is done in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand.
Because of the hilly areas, the farmers were not able to get the price of their crops, but the farmers of the copkot funds have directly disposed of their crops and made the path of value addition to their crops.
They have produced biscuits from field crops and are selling biscuits.
These farmers have created a government company in Munnar and opened the biscuits.
After seeing this efforts of the farmers, the administration has included it in the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit has spread only to about 50 Anganwadi centers of Bagheshwar district and Kosani Almora.
With this endeavour of farmers, the Turn Overseas has not only reached 10 to 15 lakhs but also provided foodgrains to more than 900 families.
Dear countrymen, I have often heard that the war for water will start in the next day.
Everyone says, but we have no responsibility
Water conservation is not a new thing for Indians.
It is not a matter of reading the book, it is not necessary to know any special language.
In the past, our ancestors have done it.
They have given maximum importance to the importance of every drop of water.
They have taken new ways to save every drop of water.
You will also see that in many temples of Tamil Nadu, sewerage systems, water conservation processes, water harvesting, Dighi making etc.
In the temples of Manarkobil, Chiran Mahadevi Kobilpatti and Pudukottai, large rocks are seen.
Even today, a lot of beauty is known as stepwells tourism sector, but in fact, it is a significance of water conservation of our ancestors.
If you go to Rajasthan then you will definitely visit the Chand Bauri of Jodhpur.
This is the largest and the most beautiful beauty of India. We have to remember one thing that is the largest beauty in a region where there is a rapid crisis of water.
Water conservation will be the best time for water conservation in April, May, June-July and the best time for water conservation.
Water conservation can be spent from the Manrega Budget.
Several efforts are being made in the last three years for water conservation and water reservoirs.
Approximately Rs 32,000 crore has been spent in the Manrega Budget for construction of water conservation and water dams.
In the year 2017-18, I can say that out of Rs. 64,000 crore, 55 have been spent on water conservation projects worth Rs. 35,000 crore.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of agriculture have been benefitted by this water conservation and water reservoir.
This work has been done by the people of about 40-45 villages.
I will say that April, May, June and July are coming and we can take up a lot of responsibility for water conservation and water harvesting in the coming days.
My dear countrymen, when Mann Ki Baat comes from all sides of the country, there are reports, letters and phones.
But people don't know anything about the philosophy that can be saved with the peaceful, beauty and integrity of Rabindranath Tagore.
Please tell you about Mann Ki Baat so that the common man can know it.
In his writing, he had a unique impression on all things, Rabindranath was a talented personality, a person of diverse thinking, but he was a teacher in him.
He wrote in Geetanjali, "He has the knowledge has the responsibility to inpart it to the students" i. e.
The entire meaning of roasting is that when people are indispensable, he can feel hungry for others.
When he himself feels thirsty, he feels thirsty.
This is the time to remember the teachings and messages of Paigambar Mohammads.
The education of his life makes us the responsibility of walking in the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a Pygambar asked him, "What is the best thing in Islam
Paygambar said, To feed the poor and the vulnerable people and to maintain harmony with everyone in an unaware manner.
Paygambar Mohammad was faithful in knowledge and compassion.
He wasn't afraid of anything.
He used to say that the immortality of the wisdom is absurd.
Paigambar Mohammads believed that if someone had anything more than required, then you should give it to someone who needs it. That's why there is a special significance of donation in Ramzan.
In this sacred month, everybody gave donations to the poor.
Paygambar Mohammad believed that the person's own sacred soul possesses him.
My dear countrymen, Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that the idol of compassion, service and sacrifice is the country of Lord Buddha who has guided lakhs of people in your world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the great obligation of striving, pledge and walking in his path by remembering Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is the human values that the world needs today.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar used to say that Lord Buddha had a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
He said, "My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
Whether the people of the country are trooped, afflicted, afflicted or deprived, Baba Saheb has empowered the people of the middle class through the Constitution.
Karuna can't be a bigger example than this.
This compassion of Lord Buddha was one of his great qualities for human suffering.
We are all Asians inherited by the teachings of Lord Buddha.
These traditions of Buddha and Buddha are also connected to the roots of Buddha in many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar and that is why we are building Buddhist tourism infrastructure which connects the important places of Southeast Asia with Indias distinguished Buddhist regions.
I bless the glory of the whole world that we can fulfil our responsibilities in a peaceful and compassionate world in his ideals.
Today, we recall Lord Buddha and you will also listen to the idol of 'Lafing Buddha', which is said to have the privilege of 'Lafing Buddha', but very few people know that this sympathy is also associated with an important event in the history of Buddha's security.
You might think that what can be the relationship between the Lafing Buddha and the Indian military power
You must remember that 20 years ago, in the evening of May 11, 1998, the then Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had made an address to the people of India, which brought the entire country in a message of pride, pride and happiness.
A new self-confidence was awakened by the people of India.
That day was Buddha Purnima.
Nuclear tests were conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan on 11th May, 1998 in the western part of India.
This test was conducted on the day of Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
India's test was successful, on the one hand, India was able to showcase its strength in science and technology.
We can say that day has been marked as a day to showcase his militarism in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has shown the world the need of inner strength for peace.
In this way, when you can become a nation, you will be able to live peacefully with everyone.
The month of May 1998 is not only important for the atomic test in that month, but the way it was possible, it is more important.
This incident showed the whole world that India has the power to reach new goals and heights by keeping in mind the land of great scientists and a firm leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan.
Today, when we are going to celebrate the 19th year of May 11, 1998, the mantra of Atal ji, Jai Vigyan, which we have given to us, must move towards building a modern India, to make a strong India, to make a strong India, to make a strong India.
We have to make our energy a part of Indias power.
And then we can also get a new joy to take forward the journey that Atal ji started to see.
My dear countrymen, I will talk about Mann Ki Baat again.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
On 26th January, representatives from ASEAN countries came here and brought together various cultural groups.
It is a matter of great pride that most of them had brought the Ramayana to us.
That is, not only in India but also in the ASEAN group countries of the world, the inspiration and impact of Ram and Ramayana is still the same.
My dear countrymen, I have received a lot of letters, e-mails, phone calls and opinions from you every time.
I read what I wrote in MyGov about starting the Online Course of the Komal Thakkar Sanskrit.
Being a IT worker, I am very good to see this feeling of you towards culture.
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about this.
I urge all the audiences of Mann Ki Baat to think about how this proposal of Kamal Chakkar can be taken forward.
Shri Ghanshyam Kumar, Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar, said the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi App.
It is really important that you have expressed your concerns about the decreasing geographical water level.
And the land of Ayushman can happen only when we take care of every animal living in this land.
You have requested to maintain water for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal ji, your thoughts have come to all the audience friends.
I would like to say something about the health of the youth this time.
He said that the youth of our country are physically weak compared to other Asian countries.
A few days ago, the Honble President of France visited Kashi and wrote Shri Prashant Kumar of Varanasi and inspired him to touch all the scenes of his journey.
He expressed his interest that all those pictures should be published in the video social media.
Prasad ji, Government of India shared all the pictures on the social media and the Narendra Modi App.
I want to tell all the children like Angha, Jayesh that if these letters are sent to them, then my whole day's hard work flew away.
All these letters, so many phone calls, opinions, which I have been able to read, which I have heard and there are many things that touched my heart.
They have written about their tests, shared the vacation plans and thought about the hydroelectricity of animals and birds in the summer.
Farmer brothers and sisters have also sent me a letter to the farmers about the Kisan Mela and the agricultural habitations that are going on across the country.
Some conscious citizens have advised me about water conservation.
In the season of the festival, there is a lot of letters about our festivals, our culture and traditions.
When I read the letters sent to you, I can know that Auli Ali, a resident of Karimganj, Assam, has made nine schools for the poor children filled with their will power, then this country has a unique will power.
When I heard the queen of Dr. Ajit Mohan Saheb of Kanpur, who walked on foot, treated the footpath brothers and sisters and gave free medicines, then it was proud of the compassion and humanity of this country.
The next year, due to lack of timely treatment, the sister of Calcutta taxi charter Saidul Lascore died.
It is my countrys identity that many such inspirations are inspired.
Today, the whole world looks at India.
Today, when the name of India is highlighted with great respect, the glory of children and children of this country is hidden.
My dear countrymen, the next few months will become very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
Because there is a lot of letters related to farming.
This time I have seen the video of the DD Kisan Channel which I have interacted with the farmer friends of Doordarshan and I have felt that this DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan should be seen by all the farmers and should use agricultural advice in their own fields.
Whether it is Mahatma Gandhi, whether it is Shastri ji or Lohia ji or Sadan Charan Singh or Sadan Devilal ji, they all considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and life of this country.
Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri always emphasized the need for conservation of trees, plants, forests etc. and better agricultural processes.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia spoke of the overall awareness among our farmers to ensure better income, improved irrigation and ensuring food and milk production.
In his speech in 1997, Shri Charan Singh urged the farmers to explore new technologies and explore new technologies.
Our Meghalaya farmers have produced records over the last five years in 2015-16.
They have shown that if the goal is fixed, there is complete confidence, if there is a commitment to the mind then it can be done.
Today, technology has been associated with the hard work of the farmers.
This will provide a lot of energy to the agricultural producers.
I have seen the letters that have come to me, many farmers have written about the MSP and they want to discuss this with them.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a huge decision has been taken to give farmers the price of crops.
It has been decided that MSP for certain crops will be reduced to one and a half times of investment.
Besides, the work on Agricultural Marketing Reform is being done in the country to ensure that farmers get the price of crops.
Efforts are being made to ensure that the local markets of the village are connected to the world.
The farmers will be connected to the APMC and e-NAM platform by upgrading the required infrastructure of 20,000 rural haats in the country.
This means that such a system is being set up from a single field to connect with any market of the country.
My dear countrymen, this year the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi is being celebrated.
How will the country celebrate this festival
I would like to urge you to share your thoughts with all through mygov.
What can happen to the Logo of Gandhi 150
All the work related to health was earlier assigned to the Health Ministry.
Private health care is too cheap and easier.
As much as we are aware of the Private Health Care, individuals, families and society will benefit from this.
Cleanliness is the first thing to keep life healthy.
Besides, efforts are being made to create Health Wellness Centre across the country.
Yoga has created a new identity in the world as a preventive health care.
Yoga promises to be both healthy and efficient.
It is the result of our commitment that Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
This year International Day of Yoga is not yet left on 21st June.
In the last three International Day of Yoga, all the people from all over the country and abroad have participated very enthusiastically.
We have to ensure that we will join ourselves and encourage everyone to join the family.
Newly and innovatively, among children, young and adults, be it men or women, Yoga has to be popular.
Television and Electronic Media of the country are performing different events with Yoga.
But from now on, can you create awareness about Yoga as an expedition from Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga but I am Yoga practice.
Some people have made me a teacher of Yoga through their own thoughts and made 3-D animated video of my Yoga.
I want to share this video with you so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Adequate efforts are being made to ensure that healthcare is incomplete, be it incomplete, be it cheaper and cheaper for the people.
Today, more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country, where more than 800 medicines have been sold at a low cost.
More new centres are being opened.
Heart State prices for heart patients have been reduced to 85.
The cost of artificial knees has also been reduced from 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in the existing 479 Medical Colleges of the country has been increased to about 68,000.
A new medical college will be opened in every three districts.
You need help to reach this awareness for every person.
To get rid of tuberculosis, we all have to try together.
A few years ago, Dr. Ambedkar spoke of Indias entrepreneurship.
Industry is a powerful medium in his thinking, which will help the poorest of the poorest of the country.
Dr. Ambedkar dreamed that India will be a powerful centre for labour industry at a time.
Today, when the Macine India project is moving successfully across the country, we are inspiring to see his dream.
Indias position in the world economy is now like a bright map, and the highest foreign investment in India is in India.
The world is now looking at India as we are now becoming the center of investment and new traditions.
Dr. Ambedkar was deeply confident of self-reliance and self-reliance.
Dr. Ambedkar said that even a person of the country is not living in poverty.
He also believed that poverty cannot be treated by the donation of the poor.
Today, projects like Mudra Yojana, Start-Up India, Stand-Up India are creating young entrepreneurs in our country.
Like him, the distinct people had said that the rivers and valleys were imagined by the Parliament and the various working committees for water conservation and use.
Today, the historic development of waterways and ports has started in the country.
New ports and old ports are being revised on various seashores of India.
In the decade of 1996, when the whole world was imagined by the second world, the cold war between the two powerful powers and the tension of the country, Dr. Ambedkar imagined the soul of Team India or India.
He realised the importance of federalism or friendship and believed that the Centre and the States must work together for the development of the country.
Today, we have been educated in the mantra of cooperative federalism and competitive collaboration of the United States at every level of the country and governance.
The most important thing is that Dr. Ambedkar is an inspiration for innumerable people like me in the backward classes of the country.
India's essence is completely different: this is an India that belongs to Ambedkar, the poor, the backward people.
The Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organised across the country from 14th April to 5th May, surrounding the birth anniversary of Dr Ambedkar.
This campaign will be a series of programmes of rural development, poverty welfare and social justice.
I urge you all to participate in this national campaign.
My dear countrymen, in a few days, many festivals and festivals are coming: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Ester and Vaishakhi.
May Mahavir Jayanti remember the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavir.
The life and philosophy of Ahimsa is inspired by us.
I convey my best wishes to all the nations on Mahavir Jayanti.
When Ester came, we think that Christ Jesus, who wanted to hear the peace of humanity, the truth, justice, compassion and compassion.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you for the coming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2018
We have seen that the colour of the sea looks blue, but we know from the daily experience of the people that there is no color of water.
Have we ever thought that the sea, the water becomes colourful
This question was a young man in the 1920s.
This question was the generation of a great scientist in modern India.
When we talk about science, first of all Bharat Ratna Sir C.
He was awarded the award for excellent worker on light scattering or radiation.
His discovery is known as Raman Effect.
We celebrate on 28th February as National Science Day every year, because it is said that he had discovered Light Scattering for which he was awarded the award.
Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana, scientists like Satyendra Nath Bose are proud of India.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose, a well-known particle, Boson has also been named.
Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in a function in Mumbai, to inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It is very attractive to know the surprising work in science.
With the help of Artificial Intelligence, there is a collaboration in manufacture of robots, butts and manufacturing machines.
Today, through selflarning, various machines are making their intelligence more smart.
This technology can help in improving the lives of poor, deprived and helpless people.
In this event of Artificial Intelligence, I would like to tell the scientists that what kind of artificial intelligence can be found to facilitate the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters
Can we get better predictions about natural calamities through Artificial Intelligence
Can Artificial Intelligence facilitate the Nagalpava of healthcare
A few days ago, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I was going to inaugurate the I Create Ceremony in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There a young man said that he has made a digital instrument in which if anyone cannot speak, then he will become frightened by writing about the medium of instrument, and you can talk in such a way as you can do with a person capable of speaking.
I think we can use Artificial Intelligence in such a way.
Science and Technology Valueutral.
You and you haven't got your value.
Any machine that we want to do is what we want.
But it depends on us how we want to work from the machine.
Tomasalva Edison, the inventor of Light Bulb, has failed many times in his work.
Once asked him about this, he said, "I have discovered ten thousand ways of not making a lightball," meaning Edison has made his own failure.
It is a matter of privilege that today I have been in the field of Aroville in Maharshi Aurobindo.
As an opponent, he challenged the British administration, fought against them and raised their regime in the face of sympathy.
In this way, he took a look at every life like a great sage, explored answers and guided humanity.
It is important to know the truth and ask for repeated questions.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, I have a lot of messages about safety and disastr during the crisis and people should send me something or the other.
From Pune, Shrimanarvindra Singh has sent his address on the Acupational Safety at the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He wrote that the saffestandards are not good in our country in place of factory and construction work.
If we are not aware of safety in our daily life, if we are not able to earn protection then it is more difficult to ensure safety during any major danger or malnutrition.
Most of the accidents are the result of our misunderstanding.
If we are cautious, follow the necessary rules, we can save our lives and protect our society from any big accident.
Sometimes I have noticed, there are several guidelines regarding safety in the field of work, but the rules are not followed at all.
My request is to all the municipalities and municipalities who have fire brigades once a week, but at least once a month, go to different schools and make a mock drill to the students.
There will be two benefits: Damkal will be a habit of cautiousness and new generations will be able to learn a lot.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading corruption in the entire country.
A scheme called 'Apada Mitra' has been launched to train voluntary in Cyclone or Banya-Pravan districts.
Training and awareness are very important.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year in Lu or Hit Wave.
Since then, NDMA organised a workshop on Heat Wave Conflict and launched a campaign to increase public awareness.
We have a good result in all the joint initiatives.
In 2017, the number of deaths decreased unexpectedly due to heat flows in about 220.
This shows that if we focus on safety, we can be safe.
I would like to appreciate all those who are present at the site of the incident in the moments and help the victims to put their hands on rescue and help them.
The number of heroes who don't know about this kind of name is not less.
Friends, Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Para-Military Force and Armed Forces, who are always in danger of their lives.
A few days ago, India and other BI MSTEC countries, namely Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal, participated in this Exercise.
We all heard them many times.
But today I am sure if someone takes us to the plane and asks where it is, where the live jacket is, how to use it, no one can answer it.
If all of us are aware of our safety then the security of the society is also included in it.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, emphasis has been laid on the construction of Wasteto Wealth and Wasteto Energy through Village Biogas to create Swachh Bharat.
Efforts have started for this and have been named as GOBAR Dhan, Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of this GOBAR Dhan Yojana is to clean up the villages and to generate income and energy from the compost and bio-gas after cattle and cultivation of animals and animals.
In any European country and China, the cattle and other biological ends are used to generate energy.
But it is not being fully used in India.
We are moving towards this direction by incorporating the Mission Grameen scheme of Swachh Bharat.
The objective of implementing bio-Gas residual energy is to ensure that the cow dung, the residual waste after agriculture, the waste of kitchen etc.
Through the Govar-Dhan Yojana, the farmers of rural India, the rural brothers and sisters will be encouraged so that they can see cows and wastes as a source of income not just as waste.
Self-sufficiency will also increase by using biogas in cooking and power generation.
This will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
New employment opportunities will increase in areas such as wastecollection, transportation, bio-gas sales etc.
A Online Trading Platform will be set up to facilitate the Gobar Dhan project to communicate with the farmers, so that farmers get the right price of cow dung and agricultural waste.
I would urge the enthusiastic, especially the sisters living in the village to come forward and make self-help groups, organised by the ASEAs to utilize this opportunity.
Let me invite you, let us also join the movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs to convert our villages into waste-health and to create cow salt from Goa.
But in Raipur of Chhattisgarh a unique attempt was made and it was that the first waste festival organised in this state .
The objective of the Festival organized by the Raipur Municipal Corporation is to create awareness about cleanliness, creation of waste products and awareness about various methods of reuse of carbage.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Nagar Nigam, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and the administration there to showcase the importance of waste management and cleanliness in a new way.
The International Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
Several events are held in the country and the world.
On that day, all the women who have done integral work in the last few days have been honored with the award of Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development.
Today, in this moment, I feel a narrative of Swami Vivekananda.
Independent. This idea of Swamiji, a hundred and fifty years ago, describes the spirit of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our responsibility to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
Today, our women's power has shown self-confidence and self-confidence through their work.
They are not only moving forward but have also taken the country and the society forward and have worked to take it to a new height.
Finally, our dream of New India is that where women are equally partners in empowerment, sabal and development of the country.
A few days ago, a person gave me a great advice.
He suggested that on 8th March, there are various events in the celebration of Women's Day but what can be organised to honour all the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village and town
This number is not small and 15 lakh women have been organised and have been organised by Swachhta Abhiyan for a month.
In this campaign that started on 26th January, 2018, in just 20 days, these women have set up a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets.
14 lakh women, 2,000 women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand Jal Sahia i. e. Jal Mitras, 10,000 women Swachhagrahis and 50,000 women Rajmistries.
You can imagine how big it is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women's strength is such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will make the campaign of cleanliness in everyday life, the reform of cleanliness in the form of masses with force.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I had seen in New Jews that electricity has reached the three villages of Elephanta Islands seventy years after independence.
You are well aware that Elephanta Island is 10 kilometres away from Mumbai in the sea.
This is an important tourist destination.
I am amazing to know that Mumbai is near and despite being such a big center of tourism, Elephant has not reached electricity even after so many years of independence.
Until seventy years, the three villages of Elephanta Islands - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sentbandar - the darkness that was in the life of the people there, all these darknesses have been removed and they have glorified their lives.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that now the cave of Elephanta and Elephanta will be lighted in the light of electricity.
This is not just a power but a new commencement in front of development.
My dear brothers and sisters, a few days ago we have celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
The importance of Holi Utsav is the Holika burning because of which the evil is burnt in the fire and destroyed.
On the day of Holi, sit together in all the psychological lands, sharing each other's happiness, sharing of joy, a beautiful moment and Holi festival is a message of love, unity and harmony.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
And two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Day in solidarity.
It was the first time in history that the top leaders of ten countries were present at the celebrations.
My dear countrymen, My dear countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathy has written a long letter to me in the Narendra Modi App. He expressed his desire to touch his letter.
He wrote, "February fifteenth February is the death anniversary of imagination.
He has taken care of us in the Kalambia Spacecraft accident but has inspired millions of youngsters of the world.
I express my gratitude to Bhai Prakash ji for starting his long letter imagination with the departure of Chir Chir.
There is nothing impossible if there is a desire and a firm commitment, if there is a hurry to do something.
Various electricians of this country have contributed to the creation of different parts of the buds.
Lopamudra, Gargie, Maitrey. I don't know how many names
Today we talk of Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, but hundreds of years ago in our scriptures, in Skandhapuran, it is said that 'Dashputra, Samakna, Dussehra Promotion.
This is what we understand in our society.
And that is why women have been given the status of strength in our society.
This lady power binds the entire country, the entire society and the family to unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathy has given many more examples.
He wrote, Our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's 'Sukhoi-30' warship will inspire him.
Three brave women, Bhavna Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturbedi fighters, are now training Sukhoi-30 fighters.
Today there are several areas where women are living before all, our women are showing something or the other.
It has also been integrated as e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, women have an important role in changing the current positive changes of the country and the society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment. You might think what could be the link between them.
Matunga Station in Mumbai is the first railway station in India where all level employees are women.
Women workers in all sections.
Whether it is the Commercial Department, the Railway Police, the Ticket Observer, the Declarator, Point Person, and more than 40 women workers are participating in this station.
Today our Nari Shakti is leading from the front.
When the talk of tribal women comes up, everybody feels certain that there will be jungles, mountains will be there, there will be a sight of girls walking on their heads.
But our tribal women in Chhattisgarh have made a new picture in front of the country.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh is one of the Maoist affected areas.
The violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols have created a terrible environment there.
Tribal women living in such a stalwart situation are making their self-reliant by e-rickshaws.
In a very short span of time, all the women there were participants of this process.
On the one hand, as they are empowering themselves through self-employment, they are changing the pictures of Maoist-affected areas.
Besides, it is also possible to provide special energy to the environmental conservation.
I also appreciate the district administration there and the district administration is playing an important role in the success of these women from grants to training.
We are listening again and again, people say, "Who is something that does not lose our existence.
Whatever ethics are avoided, which is necessary to adhere to the reforms.
And the characteristics of our society are to continue the process of revision of spirituality.
The identity of any living society remains in the process of self-revision.
Many centuries of efforts against social evil, misrepresentation, misrepresentation are continuing in our country individually and socially.
Through this campaign, efforts were made to create awareness against social curse such as balloons and wrestling.
He was sworn in the State to fight against misrepresentation and illiteracy.
The youngsters, mothers, sisters, who are full of children, elderly, excitement and enthusiasm, have embarrassed themselves in this fight.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, this human reservoir started connecting to the borders of the state.
It is necessary that all the people of the society participate in the real development process, such policy-free.
Let us all resolve to overcome such misrepresentations together and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the State, the administration of the state, the people of the human system and the people of the country for the distinction of such specific and comprehensive things towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, My dear countrymen, from Mysore in Karnataka, Shri Darshan My Gov used to spend six thousand rupees per year for his father's treatment.
He was earlier not aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
But whenever he knew about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, he bought medicines from there and reduced prices up to fifty percent.
He expressed his desire that I should talk about Mann Ki Baat while talking about it so that a large number of people can get information about it.
Several people have been writing to me about this.
I have also seen a lot of video and social media. You are taking the benefits of this scheme.
And when I know this thing, I feel very happy.
I have a deep satisfaction.
And I felt very good that Shri Darshan ji's feelings have come in the minds of others.
This will benefit the common man, especially the elderly people who are forced to take medicines everyday.
Buying life-saving medicines from here is being prepared as per the approved standards of World Health Organisation.
This is the main reason for affordable quality medicines.
Today more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
These are not only affordable medicines but also a new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available in the Amrit Stores of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendras and Hospitals.
The only objective behind these is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor of the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, from Maharashtra, Shri Mangesh shared a picture in the Narendra Modi App.
The picture was such that my attention was attracted to that film.
This was the case that a grandmother joined the Clean Morna River Cleanliness Campaign with his grandmother.
I have come to know that the citizens of Akola had organised Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morna river through Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna river used to flow for twelve months before, but now it is dependent on the weather.
The second thing is sad that the river was filled with wild grass and cattle.
There was a lot of waste in the river and around it.
So, an action plan was set up and the two coasts of the Morna river were cleaned up at four kilometres in the first phase of Mission Clean Morna from 13th January, a day before Makar Sankranti.
The Swachhta Abhiyan was carried out on 20th January and I was told that this campaign will continue every Saturday morning as long as the Morna river is completely cleaned.
This means that if a person takes a determined pledge to do something then nothing is impossible.
It is possible to bring a big change through the mass movement.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Akola, to the people of the district and the administration of the city and to all the citizens who have been involved in making this work a mass movement.
My dear countrymen, you have also heard a lot of discussions about Idining Padma Puraskar.
Discussions on news papers and TVs have attracted attention.
But if you look at this thing with some attention then you will be proud of yourselves. It will be a matter of pride that the great people of our country are among us and will be proud of the fact that how ordinary people of our country are reaching this height without any recommendation.
Every year there is a tradition of Padma Puraskar, but the entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can educate any person.
This has led to transparency in the entire process being online.
This award has become a complete transformation of the election process.
All such persons have been given Padma Puraskars who cannot be seen in big cities, news papers, TVs.
Now, the importance of his work is not being individuals' identity in the awards.
You may have heard about Shri Arvind Gupta ji.
He has been creating sports for four decades so that children can encourage science.
His efforts are to encourage children to enhance scientific experiments from useless things.
For this, children are inspiring to showcase films in 18 languages by visiting 3,000 schools in different parts of the country.
This kind of a caravan is the Sitaba Jodatti of Karnataka.
He is not called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades, he worked greatly to change the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi.
He dedicated himself as a goddess at the age of seven, but then added his entire life to the welfare of the goddesses.
Not only this, he also worked unprecedentedly for the welfare of Dalit women.
You can hear the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh. Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a poor family and tribal family.
He used to do a simple job for his life, but his traditional tribal paintings were fond of production.
Today, he is honoured not only in India but also in the entire world.
His pictures have been displayed in many countries like Egypt, Germany, England, Italy.
Bhajju Shyam ji's talent to be recognised and Padma Shri awarded to India abroad.
You will be surprising to hear the story of the tribal lady Laxmikutti of Kerala.
Laxmikutti teaches in Kollar area and still lives in the shadows of the shadow in the tribal areas in dense forests.
He made five hundred medicines based on his memory.
He has the skill to manufacture snake bites.
Laxmi ji is serving people from his knowledge about this herbal medicine.
This unknowing personality has been identified and he has been honored with Padma Shri for his participation in society.
Today, we are keen to mention another name and the 150th year Subhasni Mistry of West Bengal has also been awarded for the award.
Subhasini Mistry is such a woman who has sold vegetables for the construction of hospitals and utensils for others.
When he was thirty years old, his husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in the hospitals constructed due to their hard work.
I am convinced that there are many such morons in our multiple rituals, women and women who don't know.
Sometimes they should come to school and college and know their experiences.
Outside the award, there should be some efforts in the society.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas every year and not January.
This is the day when the revered Mahatma Gandhi came back to India from South Africa.
This day, we celebrate the festival of untouchable bonds among Indians and Indians living in different parts of the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we have organized an event where all the Indian dynasty MPs and mayors were invited from different countries of the world.
You will be happy to know that Indian dynasty MPs and Mayors from Malaysia, Egypt, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa, America and other countries have participated in this event.
Our Indian dynasty, who lives in different countries of Europe, who are working on cyber security, some are associated with Ayurveda, some are enjoying the minds of the society through music or poetry.
I would like to thank the European Egyptian Egypt for the recognition of Indian dynasty, and to inform the people of the entire world through them.
On 30th January, a revered Bapu Punya Tithi, who showed us a new path.
These were not just the original elements.
At present, we can see every step that the message of Bapu was very correct.
If we take a pledge that we will walk on the path of Bapu, as much as we can walk, what can be the greater tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I conclude to all of you by conveying my best wishes to all of you.
Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2017
This is the last phase of Mann Kibat this year and the last day of the year 2017.
This year, I and you have shared a lot of things for almost a year.
On the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, the contribution of your letters, comments and opinions will always fill me with a new spirit.
And only a few hours later, the year will change, but this sustainability of our messages will continue.
In the coming New Year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
A few days ago, the festival of Holcrismas is a fool throughout the world.
This festival is celebrated with great joy throughout India.
On this occasion of Christmas, we recognise the teachings and teachings of Jesus Christ.
This service is also accomplished in the Sarasatya Bibel.
Ramakrishna Paramahansadeva has also said that the serving of life in the knowledge of Shiva and all these things have human values all over the world.
Dear countrymen, this year was also the year of Guru Gobind Singh Jis 350th Prakash Parv.
Guru, poet, poet, poet, great warrior, all these poets have always inspired human beings.
He taught the truth against injustice and atrocities, he gave the way to get rid of the bonds of nation and religion.
And in this endeavour, however, he had lost a lot in his personal life.
Every moment of his life was full of love, sacrifice and peace.
Come on, we are committed to inspire Guru Gobind Singh Jis education and his great philosophy of life, and we will recognise his ideals in our lives.
You will be surprised to think that the new year comes every time and the pilajanaury also comes every time and what is happening for another day
The entire India is eagerly waiting for you to welcome you in the 21st century.
You are surely proud of yourself in the 21st century voter seat.
The power of exchange is the greatest power of democracy.
Because you can also play an important role in building India in the 21st century and starting from Paylajnauri.
In this phase of Mann Ki Baat, I wanted to specially address the strong and determined youth of the 18-25 years of Tagbagjivan power.
My belief is that our dream of New India will be fulfilled by filling the skills and strength of this youth full of life.
The New India that we are talking about the coming days is a poison-free India of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
India is free from cleanliness and poverty.
New India, which will have energy, peace, unity and harmony.
Take a road for yourself, connect those who are associated with you, and move forward in this way.
Think how will we plan before 2022
Mahatma Gandhi gave the form of a mass movement to freedom movement.
My youngsters, it is a time when we also give the form of a mass movement to the dream of a beautiful and positive India in the 21st century.
Today, new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From Skill Development to Innovation and Entrepreneurship, our youngsters are moving forward and succeeding.
I would like to think about how this New India Youth is available at any place, and there should be such a system in which the world is able to facilitate all these things, and it is necessary to take advantage of it.
My dear countrymen, I had talked about PGTV in the previous Mann Ki Baat programme.
Nothing is impossible for a person filled with positiveity and zeal.
Everyone in English also said that Passimism Leedsto Weekness, Optimism to Power.
I had requested the people of India to share their positive moments in 2017 and in a positive Atmosphere 2018.
I am happy that people have shared their experiences and shared their experiences in a large number of social media platforms, MiGovs and Narendra Modi Apps.
Millions of lakhs of Positive India Hashtags have been made available to more than 1. 500 crore people.
The transmission of one economy has started in India and spread all over the world.
The Tweet Arresspons that came was inspiring.
There was a feeling of happiness.
Some nations have discussed all the events that have had a special impact in the minds of this year.
Some people shared their personal achievements.
Sound byte  Myname Minu Bhatia.
I stay in Mayur Bihar, Pocket One, Faiz One, Delhi.
 My name jyothi Rajendra grows.
And he died in the accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
We were very beneficial with this help of the government and we were able to handle the situation.
 My name's satisfaction.
The National Highway was constructed by our village, from different villages in 2017.
Two incidents that were made by our Indian soldiers - one of the surgical strikes made by the Pakistani soldiers, which were destroyed by the launching pads of the rebellion, and that was unprecedented by our Indian soldiers in Dokalam.
 My name is Satis Bawani.
Over the last forty years, there was a problem of water in our region, depending on the pipelines built for our armed forces.
Now we have a pipeline.
So it won't be a big deal for us in 2017.
There are many people who are working at their own level so that there is a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India that we are building together.
Let us enter this small joy in 2018, start the New Year and take strong steps towards Positive India.
When all of us are talking about positiveness, I am also trying to share one thing.
At present, I have learnt about the inspirationalists of the Topper Anjum Bashir Khan Khatk of the administrative service of Kashmir.
He got out of the slaughter of wrath and hate and tapped the administratorial service of Kashmir.
You will know that in 1990 the warriors burnt his ancestral house.
There was wrath and violence so much that his family had to leave their ancestors.
The atmosphere of such violence around a small child was enough for darkness and tirelessness in the heart, but Anjum did not let it happen.
He never hoped.
Today he has not only inspired the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also inspired the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that the desperate clouds can be destroyed through positive work as bad as the situation is.
This week, I met some of the daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
I have inspired myself as long as I have done with those daughters and this is the strength of the country, this is our youth and the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, only our country, whenever the world's famous religious places are discussed, it is very natural to discuss the Sabarimala temple of Kerala.
In this world famous temple, millions of devotees are present every year in the blessings of Lord Ayapaswamy.
Where such a large number of devotees come to the place where such a great importance can be such a big challenge where cleanliness can be maintained
And especially those places which are in the midst of mountains and forests.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan started a programme called 'Punyam Punkavanam' and launched a Swachhta Abhiyan to enhance awareness about cleanliness.
A pilgrimage cannot be completed until a pilgrimage is being done for cleanliness.
There is no small difference in this campaign.
Every pilgrimage has been part of the worship of God in some way or the other way.
Every morning, a wonderful view of this safari is seen and all the pilgrimages participate in it.
Be it a celebrity or be rich or be a big officer or be it a common pilgrimage. Everybody participates in the Punyaam Punkavanam programme and has to move ahead with cleanliness.
There are many examples for the countrymen.
The Swachhta Abhiyan was launched in Sabarimala, Punyam Punkavanam was successful and all the pilgrims participated in it.
And we took the pledge that when Bapu is the 150th birth anniversary, we will do something or the other to offer Swachh Bharat to his dream.
Efforts are being made across the country for cleanliness.
The changes are being made in rural and urban areas.
The Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be organised in the worlds largest survey of the world from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the progress of cleanliness at the city level.
This programme will be done between about 40 crore people of more than 4,000 cities.
The Swachhta App will analysis for amending the availability and service sectors.
It will be seen that in the nature of every person of the city, the process of keeping the city clean and transforming the habits of the city.
My dear countrymen, something seems to be very small, but it becomes far-reaching for a society.
Today, we are referring to such an incident in this programme of Mann Kibat.
For decades, this injustice has been done to Muslim women
He has not given the right to the Muslim women of our country.
I am very happy that our government has taken care of this thing.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken important steps in this regard and has transformed this 70-year-old tradition.
Today, a Muslim woman can go to Hajkar without Maharam and I like this time, about 1300 Muslim women have requested to leave Maharam and from different parts of the country - Muslim women from Kerala to all parts of the country have expressed their desire to go to Hajj.
I have advised the Ministry of Minority Affairs to give permission to those women who want to go to Haj alone.
Our efforts will be to ensure equal rights to our women, to get equal opportunities so that they can share the path of progress in the same way.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic day of our country.
However, on 26th January, 2018, the day is to be remembered.
This has never happened before in India.
The year 2017 was remarkable for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years this year and 25 years of Indias agreement with ASEAN countries in 2017.
It is a matter of great pride for us to meet the ten great leaders of the world on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals and our country is a country of festivals.
Perhaps there is no such day when there is no power.
Recently, we all have celebrated Christmas together, the new year is coming forward.
May the New Year bring happiness, prosperity and happiness to you all.
We all move forward with new initiatives, new zeal, new hopes and resolves and the country also moves forward.
In the month of January, the sun was sunrise and the festival of Makar Sankranti is celebrated.
It is a festival related to nature.
On the one hand, each of our festivals are attached to natural events in some way, but our culture is diverse.
All these festivals have emerged from 13th to 17th January.
The name of these festivals is different, but the same thing in its depth is the combination of nature and agriculture.
I convey my best wishes to all the nations for their sake.
Once again greetings to all of you on the New Year 2018
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There will be no one who does not remember or honor him all over India.
He is a witness to all of us, and to all the events of the country.
He completed the New Year on 28th September.
I had the privilege of talking to sister sister before a foreign trip.
This story was just as a younger brother spoke to his elder sister with immense gratitude.
Modi ji: Latadidi, Pranam.
I'm talking about Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Prayer.
Modi ji: I had called for this reason because this time on your birthday, "Lata ji yes", "Modi ji:  I will be busy traveling through air.
Modi ji: I will return on 28th of the night, and even on 29th of the morning, your birthday will be over.
All right, okay.
Lata ji: At the age of many people, but it is very big to get the blessings of those who grew up with their work.
Yes, but I think this is the blessings of my parents and the blessings of all the brethren.
Modiji:..
I am also happy when you were proud that your mother was Gujarati...
No, I don't want to hurt you anymore because I can see and I know how busy you are and how much you work.
How much you have to think.
When you brought your mother's footsteps, I also sent one to him to bless him.
Modi ji: My mother was also very happy to see this love of you.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you on your birthday.
But it was so busy that I couldn't take time.
Yeah, yeah, sure
My dear countrymen, with Navratri, the joy of festivals will again be filled with new zeal and resolve.
It's the season of the festival.
The festival will continue to be happy and bright for a few weeks across the country.
The house will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of this joy of festival.
And this is the darkness under the lamp.
Perhaps this debate is not just a thing, it is an instruction for us, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Think that some houses are lighted on one side
On the other hand, in front of him, some people surrounding the darkness.
In some houses, sweets are destroyed, then in some houses, children are stupid for sweets.
At least the extra household or transportation can be made delivery out.
The start-ups of the young friends of several NGOs are working in many cities.
They gather dresses, sweets, food from the house of the people, and then they found the ill-being and brought things to them.
Can we sleep that darkness on the banks of Pradip with full consciousness and determination in this season of festival
Laxmi was welcomed in traditional traditions.
In our culture, girls are considered as Lakshmi because girls bring good luck and prosperity.
This year, can we keep a massive programme to honour the girls in our society, in villages and in cities
Can we keep the programme of honouring all these Laxmis of India on this Diwali
There are many daughters around us, many daughters who are doing excellent work.
Somebody is working to teach the poor children, some are creating awareness about cleanliness and health, some are serving the society by becoming an engineer, some are trying to justify someone.
Our society should be proud of these girls in their recognition and respect.
The programme to honour them should be all over the country.
One more thing can be done, share as much as possible in the social media about the achievements of these girls and use HashtagBharatkilakshmi.
As we all together launched a massive campaign called Selfie With Dotter, which spread all over the world.
My dear countrymen, I have already told you at Mann Ki Baat that it is a fun that I am fortunate to talk directly or indirectly to many well-known people.
A few days ago, a student from remote Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tayong sent me a very attractive letter.
I'm roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
I felt very good to read, I thought it was very beneficial for me to read before the book test.
I liked a lot of things in this book, but I also noticed that there is a lot of suggestions for students, but there is nothing in this book for parents and teachers.
So, see, my young friends also have the confidence that if you talk about any work to the country's leading servants then it will happen.
My little student friend, first thank you for writing the letter.
Thank you for reading the Ekzam Warriors two-three times.
If I can take time for a new edition, I will definitely try to write something for parents and teachers.
But I'll make a request to all of you.
Can you help me
I'm sure to look at them.
I will think about it and I will definitely try to write some of them in my own language and in my own way.
It may be that if your suggestions come in large numbers, then my new edition will also be sure.
So I'll wait for your opinion.
I once again thank our young student friend Arunachal Alina Tayong.
My dear countrymen, you people have also talked about the busyness of the Prime Minister of the country through news papers.
But you know that I am a common man like you.
I also heard that statement and saw the match.
The compassionate and transformed feelings of a 23-year-old Daniel Madbhadhev are like affecting everyone.
I'm definitely affected.
Just a while ago, he was finally defeated by Grandslam winners and Tenny's Ladgend Rafael Nadal.
Somebody else would be sorry and disappointed.
He praised the sportsman spirit for losing his sports in the end after a tough fight.
On the other hand, Champion Nadal also appreciated the game of Danil.
In the same match, the morale of the winners and the winners are both academic.
If you don't hear the speech of Daniel Madbhave, then I would urge all of you, especially the youth to see that video.
It's all ages, all the conditions have to learn a lot for the people.
There is also a moment that is above the defeat, this moment teaches us that the defeat is not really the meaning of victory.
My dear countrymen, especially my youngsters, what I am going to say is for you only.
Definition, the Bak-Vidanda will continue, but it should be solved before the issue is diagnosed.
Otherwise, the problem takes an old man and solving him becomes a tough thing.
If we are conscious in rooting, we can save a lot.
From this point of view, I feel that my young friends must talk about an important thing.
We all know how harmful to tobacco intoxication and it is difficult to quit it once.
Tobacco nicotine addiction.
Consumption of this tobacco in adolescence also affects the development of the brain.
We all know about these things, but today I want to convey you a new thing.
You know that recently the prohibition of India-cigarette has been issued.
E-cigarette is an electrical device different from normal cigarettes.
In e-cigarette, a kind of chemical smoke is produced by warming of nicotine liquid substances through which nicotine enters the body.
We know about the danger of generalcigarette, but there is a misleading idea about e-cigarette that it is not harmful.
Aromatic chemicals are used to prevent ordinary cigarettes.
We are aware of the fact that even in a family, he tried to smoke and smoke so that none of the family is smoking.
Stay away from the kids of Chanwadi.
There is no smoke about cigarettes, who are selling, who are buying or seeing, they all know that cigarette is harmful.
But the e-cigarette thing is quite different.
There is very little consciousness about this.
The common man is not aware of the harmful aspects of e-cigarette and this is why the transmission-cigarette has entered the house.
Many times in the family, children are showing magic games in front of their mothers and mothers, without fire, without fire, without smoke.
You know, when somebody has eaten cigarettes around us, we can understand it with a smell.
Even packets of cigarettes in pockets can be understood through smell.
But it doesn't happen in e-cigarette, whether it is unknown or fascinating, or in their bags, in the middle of the book or in the middle of the book, they are in the grip of this intoxication.
Youth power is the future of our country.
The e-cigarette has been observed so that this new instrument of intoxication does not deny our country, does not destroy the dreams of the family, does not destroy the lives of the children.
In some way, this intoxication disease cannot be associated with the society.
I urge you all to quit tobacco and stop nutrition of any misconception about e-cigarette.
You must remember Fit India.
Fit India is not just going to Jim everyday morning and evening.
The name of saving from all these misleading ideas is 'Fit India'.
I believe, I don't want you to be bad, but it's good.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of privilege for us that India has dedicated its lives to all such great personalities who are not for themselves but for others.
Our India, our land is multi-ratna basindra.
Many humanitarians have gifted this country.
A human soul is going to be honoured in Vatican City on October 13, which is a matter of pride for the entire country.
That day Pope Francis is going to declare Marium Threasia a Saint.
Sister Maryam Threasia has contributed to human welfare in the short age of fifty years.
Once again I convey my tributes to Sister Maryam Thressia and congratulate the Indians, especially my younger brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, not just India, it is a matter of pride for the entire world that today when we are going to celebrate Gandhi 150, and at the same time, 130 crore Indians have resolved to completely stop the use of single use plastic.
The world is now looking at India in the way India has played a leading role in environmental conservation.
I am confident that all of you will join the Single Use Plastic-II campaign on 2nd October.
People are contributing to this expedition in their own way.
But the youth of our country has started a unique campaign.
His work attracts my vision and I am talking to him on the phone and try to know about his new plan.
Perhaps these things will help other people of the country.
When I heard the plogging language for the first time, it was also new to me.
This language is perhaps used in foreign countries.
Modi ji: Hello Ripudaman ji, I am Narendra Modi.
We will not only take care of our health but also protect the health of the mother of the world.
I believe that 130 crore Indians will move forward in this direction to create a plastic free India once.
Ripu Daman ji, thank you once again
My dear countrymen, the preparation of October 2 is going on throughout the country and all over the world, but we want to take Gandhi to the path of 150.
I want to contribute my life to the welfare of the country.
This is our dream of Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat and that is why every year 31st October, we organise a run for the unity of the country.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August, I had told you from the Red Fort that by 2022 you will go to 15 places of India.
Go to at least 15 places and try to stay there at night.
Look at India, understand, feel.
We have so many diversity.
On the occasion of Deepavali, everybody goes on a tour so I would urge you to roam around 15 places in India.
You will be happy to know that India has improved a lot in Travel and Tourism Competitive Index and it has been possible due to your cooperation.
This has been possible due to the importance of roaming especially.
This means that we have moved a lot in this time and if we try further then we will be able to achieve one of the worlds largest tourism sector before 75 years of independence.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of various festivals of this diverse India.
It must also be seen that in the days of Diwali, there is no fire or any harm to terrorism.
Once again, my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
My dear countrymen, bow down to all of you
Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
Six days later on Diwali, the Mahaparav Chhat is one of the most important festivals in our country with regulations.
Everything is observed in traditions from eating to vessels.
Chhat Puja is completely connected with the unparalleled nature and the worship of nature.
On the one hand, in the sun and water, at the centre of worship of Mahapravachhat, on the other hand, utensils made of bamboo and soil and roots are common items related to the worship process.
It also contains the significance of cleanliness in our life.
Before six o'clock, the safai of the entire house, along with rivers, ponds, surrounding Khankhand, the puja place i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhat Puja - Conservation of Environment, Disease Redressal and Governance.
Behind this pattern of food than Prasad, it is also given the reason that the hazard is destroyed, the feeling of a hazard that hinders the progress of a person.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am confident that Mann Ki Baat has been linked to the people of this country.
Take examples of Khadi and Handloom.
The only store of KhadiR Handloom was sold so much, you are very happy to hear that.
The sale of Khadi Gift Cooperation during Diwali has increased by six hundred and eighty percent.
The total sale of Khadi and Handicrafts has also increased by about ninety percent in the year as compared to last year.
It is being seen that today the youth, the elderly, the women and the people of every age group like handlooms.
I can imagine how much the family, the poor family, the family that worked with handicrafts have benefited.
And we talked about Khadi for fashion, but in the last few years I can say that Khadi for Nation and Khadi for fashion are now taking the place for transformation.
In the life of the poorest of Khadi, Handloom has emerged as an efficient instrument to make it empowered by changing the lives of the poorer.
We are playing a very big role for the villagers.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt wrote in the Narendra Modi App that he wanted to know about the experience of my Diwali with the Defence Forces and wanted to know how the Defence Force has laid down the lamp.
Shriman Tejas Tagorewad also wrote the Narendra Modi App - What can our home surplus be made available to the defence forces
We also think of our brave defence forces.
We also think that the sweetness of our houses should be reached by the soldiers of the country.
You all must have spent the Diwali in a very horrific manner.
This time Deepavali has a special experience for me.
Once again, I am fortunate to celebrate Diwali with our brave defence forces.
This time, I am unforgettable to celebrate Diwali with the Defence Forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute every soldier of our defence forces on behalf of all nations to protect the country by combating the difficult situation in the border.
When the opportunity comes to us, we should know the experiences of our soldiers, they should listen to the pride of them.
Many of us do not know that our defence forces are playing an important role not only in borders but also in peace all over the world.
As the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, they are shining India all over the world.
A few days ago, on 24th October, the UN Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone remembers the efforts of the United Nations in establishing peace in the world.
And we have accepted Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, the whole world is our family.
And for this belief, India has been actively contributing to various important initiatives of the United Nations since the beginning.
You will definitely know that the proposal of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter, both started with the words of Wi The People.
India has always emphasized on equal rights of women and is a living example of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
It was proposed in the initial edition of Al Man and Burn Free and Equivalent to Indias representative Hunsa Mehta, and later it was Alhuman Beings and Burn Free and Equal.
It seems to be a very small change, but we have a healthy philosophy.
The most important contribution that India has made in UNA is Indias role in UN peacekeeping.
India has always played a major role in the United Nations Peace Education Mission.
There are many of you who might know this for the first time.
Over 8,000 defence personnel have contributed to the UN peacekeeping efforts.
Currently, about 7,000 Indian soldiers are connected to the United Nations Peacekeeping Initiative and is the third largest in the world.
Until August, 2017, about 50 of the world's efforts to protect peace have contributed to them.
These efforts are being made in various parts of the world like Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kongo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan etc.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated at the Indian Army Hospital in Kango and South Sudan and have been saved.
The defence forces of India have not only protected the people of different countries but have also conquered their hearts to maintain peace.
Indian women have played a very leading role in peace establishment.
Very few people know that India is the Egyptian country that sends women police units to the UN Peace Movement in Liberia.
And see, this initiative of India has been inspired by all nations since then.
Since then, all the countries started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to hear that Indias role is not only limited to peacekeeping but also to train the peacekeeping forces of 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our Bahadur peacekeepers are sending messages of peace and goodwill all over the world.
Peace-security drive is not totally helpful.
Our security forces have to work in the remote areas of the armed forces.
They have to understand different situations and different cultures.
Remembering him, the hearts of all the nations are very proud.
He was the only member of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force - he was a brave man who was honored with Paramvir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeeping Forces, who also received special recognition of his work in Cyprus.
At the age of 72, 1996, he was appointed the Army Commander in the campaign of Namibia and served to ensure the freedom of Namibia.
The former Chief of the Indian Army, General Thimaiah, led the United Nations Peacekeeping Force at Cyprus and consolidated all of them in peace.
India is always a messenger of peace, unity and harmony.
Our belief, let us live a peaceful and harmonious life and move towards building a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our sanctuary is conserved to all the great men of India who have served humanity in a lifeless manner.
Sister Nivedita, whom we love, I know that Goddess Nivedita is also one of these great personalities.
Margaret Elizabeth was born in Ayerland and later named Swami Vivekananda Nivedita.
The meaning of Nivedita is that which is completely dedicated.
Later, he showed his name's best signature.
Yesterday, Sister Nivedita was the 150th birth anniversary.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his life for the poor and the poor.
Sister Nivedita was suffering from the atrocities of British Raj.
The British tried to treat Indians not only physically but also mentally as a slavery and slavery.
There was always an attempt to reflect our culture underneath and uninterrupted.
Bhagini Nivedita was the pride of Indian culture.
Inspired by national consciousness, awakening, helping people together.
He visited different countries of the world and became a victim of oppression of religion and philosophy.
The renowned nationalist Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati will be renowned for his brilliant poem 'Pudumai Penn', 'NewWomen' and 'Nari Empowerment'.
It is said that this was the source of inspiration for Lord Nivedita.
Bhaginini Vedita also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose in different ways.
Through his writings and conventions, he helped both the publication and publicity of Shri Bose's exams.
This is a surprising event of our India where the spirituality and science of our culture are each other.
Sister Nivedita and Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose.
In the year 1899, when he looked at the magnificent plague in the Calcutta Mahanagari, he fell into the lap of death.
Sister Nivedita, ignoring her health, Rastaghat, Nardama Safai Abhiyan.
This is the lady, who left the discipline and discipline for the poor and the miserable people.
It is resting here that Sister Nivedita, who has given everything to India.
Undoubtedly, it's all the truth.
This will be our recognition to this great personality if every Indian learns from his life and follows the path of his displayed service.
Thank you for your phone.
First of all, I convey my best wishes to all the children on the occasion of the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the most important part of the construction of New India, the next hero.
Your anxiety is correct and all the diseases that were seen in old age are being seen in the earliest times.
It is surprising to hear that even children are victims of diabetes.
But now our lifestyle has changed a lot.
Nowadays these diseases are called Lifestyledisorder.
The main reason for these diseases in young age is the lack of physical labour and change in food habits.
Both the society and the family need to look into it.
It will be observed that there is no need for unnatural or terrible change.
Whatever is needed is to pay attention to smaller things and make them under their habits.
I want the people of the family to try awareness so that the children have a habit of playing in the open field.
If possible, the elders of the family should also participate with them.
Children should be habitually used to change their lifts.
After dinner, the whole family will walk with the kids.
India - Yoga will help us create a habit of healthy lifestyle of our youth and save from lifestyle disorders.
Yoga is simple because Yoga can be taught only.
There is no need for specific equipment or fields.
Several tests are underway in this regard that Yoga is effective in diabetes control.
A lot of work is being done in AIIMS and the results that have been achieved so far are very hopeful.
Ayurveda and Yoga should not only be considered as a disease-free method but should also be a part of daily life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have been happy with the world of sports in the last few days.
There is also a pleasure for India in a badminton like Haqi.
Badminton star Kidambi Srikanth has won the Denmark commemorative game and has glorified every Indian.
This is his third superficial victory after Indonesian Open and Australian 1998.
I congratulate this young man for his success and for his pride in India.
Friends, this month the FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organized.
The teams from all over the world have come to India to participate in it and have enjoyed their sports skills.
I had a chance to see a match.
The sportspersons were very enthusiastic.
The world cup is a big event, where the world is looking at you.
I was surprised to see the enthusiasm, swelling and enthusiasm of the young sportspersons.
The World Cup has been successfully organised and all teams have shown their best skills.
Even if India cannot win it, the Indian sportspersons have won the hearts of all.
India and the entire world sports have enjoyed this festival and the entire football tournament for football lovers was very interesting.
The future of football is very bright and its prediction is being achieved.
I again congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sports lovers.
My dear countrymen, if I have to communicate with the people whom I have to talk about Swachh Bharat, then every day I have to commemorate Mann Ki Baat and everybody will have to discuss this cleanliness.
Somebody showcases the efforts of small children and sometimes the success of the team effort of youngsters.
Innovation happens at some places with cleanliness and now the enthusiasm towards the work of an officer becomes new.
A few days ago, I got a bigger port, where there is a description of the new form of Chandrapur fort in Maharashtra.
The entire team of NGO, named Ecological Protection Organization, launched a sanitation campaign at Chandrapur Fort.
They sent me two pictures before and after Safai.
I am amazed to see that those around who have been desperate to see the waste, filthy environment, think that how to clean such dirt can be done, I will tell them how the labour, determination, jed and livelihood of the youngsters of the Ecological Protection Organisation has been reflected.
Seeing them, the depression of yours, the unbelief will go away.
This Bhagirath Prayag is a wonderful example of beauty, commitment and sustainability for cleanliness.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of all the nations to protect and conserve historical heritage.
I thank all the workers of the Ecological Protection Organization and all the members of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on 4th November, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.
Guru Nanakshudhu is not the first Guru of the Sikh community, he is Jagadguru.
He thought of the welfare of the entire humanity and gave the same word to all the nations and communities.
He stressed on womens souls and empowerment.
Guru Nanak Dev has travelled 228 thousand kilometres and spread the message of humanity in this pedestrian.
He has joined the people, guided them to be honesty, sacrifice and dedication.
He didn't just say anything in his mouth, he had done it in his life and his work.
He started the langarkhana and served the people.
Equality and equity are awakened by eating food in the silky field.
Guru Nanak has said that three means of economic life, the name of Paramatma, be fond of labour and help the distressed.
Guru Nanak also created Guruvani for his speeches.
The 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak will be held in 2019.
Come on, we try to move forward in life by following his words and education.
My dear countrymen, two days later on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be celebrated.
We all know that he had created an integral modern India plan.
We can learn a lot from the life of this great child of Mother India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had worked as a consolidation for India.
I have ensured millions of Indians in the shadow of One Nation One Constitution.
He had the power to cross all the obstacles.
He has set a goal and has moved forward to achieve that goal in Purnodaya.
He said that the work of connecting the country can only be done by humans who have dreamt of a nation where all people have equal rights.
I want Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to inspire us forever.
He said that we cannot change the diversity of nations and communities, every woman and every woman of India should decide the future of the people of love and mutual love and goodwill.
Sardar Saheb's speech is still the inspiration and strength of our New India vision.
And that is why his birthday will be celebrated as National Unity Day.
The contribution of making our country an integral form is unforgettable.
Run for Unity will be organised across the country on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, where children, women, youth and elderly will be shamed.
I urge you all to participate in this festival of Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holiday of Diwali, you have returned to your daily life with a new resolve.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for fulfilling their dreams.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2017
Three years have been completed to make Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani.
Today this is the 36th phase.
Most of them inspire me.
And I took half an hour in the month, but people start talking about Mann Ki Baat for thirty days.
And that is why the government is also making an easier idea of focusing on the sensitivity and the strength of the society.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the people of the country, their thoughts and feelings.
And perhaps I am very grateful to the people of the country for the opportunity to know the feelings of the common man of the country in such a short span of time.
In Mann Ki Baat, I often remember the idea of Acharya Binoba.
Acharya would often say, unemployed, effective.
I am sure, now three years later, sociologists, universities, researchers, media experts will definitely analyze this.
And I believe that this analysis will be very beneficial for Mann Ki Baat in the future, there will be a new consciousness and a new entrepreneur.
And when I told Mann Ki Baat once, we should think that we will not destroy it as much as we need.
But then I have seen that so many social organisations, many youngsters have been doing this thing long ago.
And then I have seen how many people have come forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I have seen the Selfie With Dotter of a Panchayat Head in Haryana and I am present in Mann Ki Baat.
It is not only from India but also from all over the world that the Selfie With Dotter has started a big campaign.
A few days ago, I was sitting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
Incredible I send photographs from wherever you go to India.
Millions of pictures from every corner of India have become a very strong source of tourism.
I have experienced how small incidents create a big movement in Mann Ki Baat.
Today is keen because when I think it's been three years, how many things have been happening in my mind for the last three years.
The country is moving forward every minute to the right path.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the betterment of the society and for the betterment of the country.
During my three-year visit to Mann Ki Baat, I know it from the countrymen, I understand it, I learned it.
For any country, this is a very big wealth, a very powerful power.
And I have seen that there has been a lot of attraction towards Edening Khadi and I naturally said that no one has to read Khadi.
But there are so many fabrics, why not eat
There can be room sheets, rooms, layers, and it seems that the youth have grown attractively towards Khadi.
Khadi's sales have increased and there has been a direct relationship with the poor.
On 2nd October, Khadi was released, a lot of discounts were released.
Once again, I will say that we will take forward the campaign for Khadi.
We work with this idea that we will buy Khadi and burn the lamp of Diwali in the house of the poor.
The poor of our country will get a strength from this work, and we should do it.
And in order to enhance the interest of this Khadi, the people of Khadi sector and the people associated with Khadi Government of India have been encouraging in a new way.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase manufacturing capacity, how to bring solar energy and handicrafts
How to revive the old heritage that had been closed for about 20, 25, 30 years.
A Khadi Ashram of Sevapur in Varanasi was closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Several methods have been added.
Many people have got new jobs.
The Khadi and Village Entrepreneurship Training Centre at Pampore in Kashmir has been reopened and Kashmir has a lot to provide for this.
Now this training centre is being resumed, the new generation has been helping in modern construction, weaving and creating new things and I am very happy that the gifts given to big corporate houses during Diwali have started giving me the gifts.
People are also giving a gift to each other as a gift.
We are all feeling the way we are moving ahead.
My dear countrymen, in the last month we all made a pledge in Mann Ki Baat and we decided that the 15th day of Gandhi Jayanti will celebrate Swachhta Festival across the country.
I will connect people with cleanliness.
In our respect, the President has started this work and the country is associated with it.
Everyone has become a part of the Swachhta Abhiyan.
When I talk of pledge tools, we can see how our Swachhta Abhiyan is moving forward in the way of a pledge tool.
I'm sure some people are working to put it on.
This time, I saw one more thing - Firstly, we might clean one place, secondly it may be that we cannot make any place unconscious, but if we have to make cleanliness habit, then there is a diverse change in our thoughts.
This time several competitions were organized in the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign.
More than two and a half crore children participated in creation of Swachhta.
Thousands of children have painted.
They have pictured their own imaginations about cleanliness.
Whenever I talk of cleanliness, I have never forgotten to express my gratitude to the media.
We are looking at the Swachhta Hi Seva Movement, how much the Electronic Media and Print Media can serve the country.
A few days ago, somebody attracted my attention to the 18-year-old Bilal Dar of Srinagar.
Since the age of 12-13, i. e.
Plastic, polythene, used bottles, waste wastes are also cleaned by Asia's largest lake near Srinagar.
I am glad that Pauranigam has not only created Brand Ambassador-E, has given Bilal this time a car, uniform and Bilal is also educating people from other areas and inspiring them to get the desired results.
Bilal Dar is inspiring to those who are young but interested in cleanliness.
I convey my best wishes to Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we have to acknowledge that the history of future is born in the womb of history and when we talk of history, it is natural to remember the great men.
The month of October is a month of remembrance of many of our great men.
From Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel was born in October this month, who led us in the 20th and 21st century, showed us the path of walking and suffered a lot for the country.
When former President of India, Shriman Abbas Kalam ji talked to the youth, he used to talk about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
He mentioned the programme in depth and went to the village to witness the work of Nanaji.
Remembering these great men, we recall them that there is no benefit to them, so that they can find ways to move forward so that there is a right direction for the future.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely talk about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We are easier to say that unity between diversity is the specialty of India.
Have we been proud of the diversity and the diversity that we are proud of, do we ever try to realise that diversity
I want to repeat all my countrymen in Hindustan, especially to my younger generation that we are in a conscious situation.
Please feel the separation of India, touch it, enjoy its pride.
This diversity of our country plays a huge role in the development of your inner personality.
You go abroad, I don't have any problem, but sometimes you can see your home
The people of Northern India don't know what is in South India
The people of West India don't know what is in East India
Our country is full of diversity.
Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Absolute Kalam ji, when they had visited India, there was a new inspiration for the country to see and understand.
All these great men have seen this country in a wide range.
At the beginning of their work, they have tried to know and understand India.
We have tried to make India self-reliant.
Can we not even learn from different states, different societies or groups of our country, their traditions, their dresses, their dresses and their dresses as a teacher
The value addition in tourism will happen only when we are not just audience but also a student to take, understand and understand the characteristics of those places.
I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of my own Hindustan.
It was also experienced to live in more than four and a half districts.
Today, when I am taking over this important responsibility of the country, the experience of this visit is very useful.
That's why I have a lot of things to understand.
I urge you to see that unity in diversity in this large India is not just a slogan but also avail this treasure of our immense energy.
If one type of new food is eaten every day for the entire life, it will not be repeated.
This is the great power of our tourism.
I would like you to get out of the house and get out for a bit of change.
Your worries will grow up.
What can be the greater teacher than the achievements
Normally, from October to March, the time is ready for tourism.
If you meet the people there, send them pictures.
Learn not only the architecture but also the natural beauty of the people there.
Please send yourself to MyGov and send it to the Narendra Modi App.
I have seen this thing that for the development of the tourism industry of India, if you can have seven best tourist destinations of your own state, every Indian should know about these seven items of your state.
If possible, we have to go to those seven places.
Can you give any information about this
You see, if all the people of the same state send this information then I will tell the government to scrutiny them, and to make publicity about the seven common matters that have come from every state.
That is, how tourist destinations can be improved from the inspiration of a human being.
Similarly, the seven things you have seen all over the country are the best of you, if you want to see it, if you need to go there, then you must send the names of such seven places in MyGov, Narendra Modi App.
The Government of India will work on this.
The government will acknowledge that the films will be made, video-production, propaganda literature will be decided by you.
Come on, join me.
In the months of October to March this year, you can also be a big observer in the development of tourism.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, because of being a human being, many things touch my mind.
I have a deep impact.
Because I'm a man like you too.
A few days ago, perhaps your vision was attracted - a wonderful example of women's power and patriotism was seen by the countrymen.
The Indian Army, Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi, have received two heroes, who are an excellent heroine.
It is a wonderful reason that the husband of Swati and Nidhi was martyred to serve Mother India.
We can think that if the world is destructive at this young age, how will it be
But Martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadik's wife Swati Mahadik fought against this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to realize his husband's dream.
Likewise, Nidhi Dubey, his husband Mukesh Dube worked as a hero in the army and when he was martyred for his motherland, his wife took a decision and he was admitted to the army.
It is very natural for every country to showcase our respect for this bravery on our women's strength.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to these two sisters.
They have created a new inspiration and a new consciousness for millions of people of the country.
Many congratulations to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, this time between Navratri festival and Deepawali is a great opportunity for our younger generation.
The World Cup of FI FA Under-17 is here.
I believe that the football will be heard all around.
Every generation's football will be attracted.
There will be no school-college fields in India where our youth will not be able to play footballs.
Come on, when the whole world is playing on the soil of India, we have also made this game a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
The time of Mother Durga's feeling.
The entire environment is full of sacred aroma.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I congratulate the countrymen, pray to Maternity, to meet the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of the country.
The power to overcome every challenge should come to the country.
We have started a five-year road map to fulfil the dreams of the freedom fighters in 2022, the resolve of 125 crore Indians, the resolve of immortal labour, many men and determinations.
My best wishes to all of you.
Celebrate the festivals, brighten the enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2017
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who is dedicated to the unity of the country.
Since ancient times, our ancestors have embraced the common values, the harmony and harmony that our ancestors have been associated with our lives.
Ahingsa Param Dharma, we are listening to it.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be suppressed in the name of faith, it can be communal belief, it can be believed in political thinking or a person can believe in any tradition or violence will not be suppressed in any case.
No one has the right to take the law in the name of faith.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar has ensured that every person has the right to get information.
I want to assure the people of the country, against the people who have taken the law, whoever goes through violence, whoever individual or community, the government or the country will not be blamed.
Everyone has to be deceived by the law, the law will judge him and the culprit must be punished.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Many of our festivals are directly connected to the farmers and the fishermen brothers and sisters.
Today, I am talking about the festival, so first of all, I want to call you "Manchami Dukkaram".
Yesterday, the festival of Sambatsari of the Jain community was celebrated.
The Jain society is celebrated in the month of Bhadra in the month of Parushan Parva.
Festivals are a symbol of forgiveness, ahimsa and friendship.
And it is also called 'Kshama-Vani' festival and on this day there is a tradition of congratulating each other as 'Michami Dukkadam'.
Besides, our scriptures are the landscape of 'Kshama Virasya Bhushanam' i. e.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated everywhere in India with great enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
And when Ganesh Chaturthi talked about it, the issue of all the Ganeshotsavs is normal.
This great festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasted for 10 days.
And we know this festival as a symbol of unity, equality and sanctity.
I convey my best wishes to every countrymen on this occasion.
Now, Onam festival is being celebrated in Kerala.
Onam is one of the major festivals of Kerala among Indias Golden Festival.
This festival is famous for its social and cultural importance.
Onam Festival recalls the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
And now this festival has also become a center of attraction for tourism.
Besides, I will also tell the countrymen that like the Navratri Festival of Gujarat or the Durga Festival of West Bengal today has become the main attraction of tourism.
There is a lot of opportunity to attract foreigners in other festivals of our country.
We have to think about what steps we can take in the coming days.
Eid-ul-Juha will be celebrated in this festival.
Congratulations and best wishes to all the nations.
Festivals and sanitation are incorrectly associated with our family life.
The preparation of the festival begins with cleanliness.
It is not new but it is very important to transform cleanliness into a social form.
Cleanliness is not only in our houses but also in every village, in every city, in our states and in our country, this cleanliness and festival must be tied in a bond that is incomplete.
My dear countrymen, the language of modernization is changing respectively.
Nowadays, this new immunization has become a new parameter.
You will be seen in YouTube today, children are building a statue of Ganesha with soil at home.
The Swachhta Abhiyan that we started three years ago is the third year of October 2.
At the same time, the JAMIAT-ULEMA-E-HIND members of the Banaskantha district of Gujarat took over the work of sanitation and sanitation of 22 temples and 3 mosques.
If this effort is a permanent part of our nature for dedicated cleanliness then wherever our country can reach.
My dear countrymen, I would like to invite you to come back once again, on 2nd October, 15-20 days of Gandhi Jayanti, I started the campaign of Swachhta Hi Seva, as was earlier said, 'Jal Sevai Prabhu Seva' and 'Swachhta Hi Seva'.
We create an environment of cleanliness all over the country.
And whenever we get the opportunity, we should find and use the opportunity.
Labour donate.
Come together on holidays or Sundays and work together.
Go to the nearby habitations, go to the nearby villages, give it the form of a movement.
I appeal to all NGOs, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government officials, clinics and panchayat heads, to create such a joy before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October, to create a clean environment so that the dream of Gandhiji is fulfilled.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
In-law, a department has been created where after the construction of toilets, you can list your name and the name of the family which you have helped in this work.
My social media friends can drive a creative campaign in the virtual world which can actually be inspiring.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MoHWWC) can organize a competing of ethos, short-term films and photographs under Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi campaign.
You can write in different languages and there is no specific age limit for this competition.
Out of the participants, three will be selected and awarded at the district level and three at the state level.
I urge you to participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
Definitely take some steps for cleanliness.
Millions of people and millions of people sometimes send messages or phones, send messages that I have a supreme gain and rare wealth.
This is a great opportunity for me to know the feelings and feelings of the people of the country.
The more you wait for the Mann Ki Baat, I am waiting for your news.
I wait very interested because I can learn a lot from you.
I try to see, listen, read and know yourself as much as possible.
"Prime Minister, I am abusive from Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my friends.
He always tries to help people, but he has a fate that I'm surprising.
I'm supposed to buy him once.
I saw that he bought a sari of two thousand rupees, spent Rs 450 for Pitzer.
In order to go to Mall, Autovala has spent a long time for five rupees.
He did the same work while buying vegetables on the way back and saved four-five pieces.
I was so bad.
We spend a lot of money in the big shops without any money, but with our labourer brothers and sisters, I don't trust them.
I believe that after listening to the news of this phone, you are not just aware, you have decided not to make such a mistake.
You don't think that whenever anybody comes to sell things around our house, comes to ferry, some small shopkeeper, vegetable seller, sometimes we need auto-rickets, whenever we work with a person who works with a hard worker, then we wander whenever we work with a hard worker.
And when people like us go to eat food in a big restaurant, don't see what is written in the bill, I'll get the money out immediately.
Not only that, if you buy saris in the showroom, you don't want to get rid of it, but if you work with the poor, you don't get rid of it.
Do you ever think that you're gonna have any fault in your life for two rupees, five rupees, but you're gonna see how deep it hurts him
Madam, I'm grateful to you, you called me such a heart touch and gave me a message.
I am confident that if my countrymen have a habit of behaviour with the poor then they will definitely leave it.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the entire nation celebrates the National Sports Day.
This day is the birthday of Major Dhyan Chand ji, the magician of Hockey Sportsperson and Hockey.
His contribution in Hakiki is invaluable.
I recall this thing because I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports.
Sports should be a part of our life.
If we are the world's triangle nation then we should also look at the fields of sports.
Sports means physical fitness, mental alarms, personality enhancement.
It's an excellent answer to the heart of the sports.
The younger generation of our country should come forward in the world of sports and today in the age of computers, I would like to be aware of the fact that the playing field is more important than the play station.
Play the computer but also the fields outside and sometimes look at the football.
Perhaps in the computer, cricket games, but in the open fields, the joy of playing cricket is different.
Today, the situation is such that the kids start watching the cartoon movies in a corner of the house, or in a mobile game, and then the mother is screaming - when will you go out
The time changed, she was an age when she told the boy when you would come and today it was a situation that the mother had to say, Dad, when would you go out
Young friends, the Ministry of Sports has created a Sports talent search portal for exploring talent in sports and development, where a child from all over the country has a talent in the field of sports, he can upload his biodata or video.
The Ministry of Sports will train Selected Emerging Players and will launch it tomorrow.
The news of happiness for our youth is going to be held in India from 6th to 28th October, 2019.
Twenty-five teams of the world are going to make India their homes.
Come on, welcome to our young guests coming from the world with the festival of sports, enjoy sports and create an appropriate environment in the country.
Today, when I am talking about sports, I remember that last week's auspicious event, I want to share with the people of the country.
I and some of them were born in the lap of the Himalayas and those who had no connection with the sea.
Six such daughters of our country, who work in the navy, their emotions, their enthusiasm will inspire us all.
These six daughters, with a small boat, I-NS Tarini, will cross the sea.
The name of this campaign is Navika Sagar Parikrama and they will reach India after several months after the entire world tour.
Sometimes there will be forty days of water.
Sometimes we spend thirty days together in water.
This is our brave six daughters in the midst of the waves of the sea, and this is the first thing in the world.
There are no Indians who will not be proud of our daughters
I am telling the experience of these girls and I told them to share their feelings with the entire country.
I will also make a different arrangement for their thinking in the Narendra Modi App so that you can read it.
Because it's a bold idea, it's a matter of feelings, and I'm very happy to bring these girls to you.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters, blessings of swords.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, we all celebrate Teachers Day.
Dr. Radhakrishnan jis birthday is the birth anniversary of our former President.
He was the President, but he made himself a teacher for the entire life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was a dedicated life to education.
The importance of a teacher is to awaken the mindset of creation and enjoy knowledge among his students.
Can I launch a campaign in a mission mode
In our country, when it comes to transformation, just as the mother of the family remembers, the role of teachers in the society will be remembered.
Teachers have a huge role in transformation.
In the life of every teacher, there is a transformation technologies of any student and we are making a comprehensive effort.
It will play a big role in transformation of the country.
Let us move forward with this mantra of Teach to Transform.
My name is Dr. Absolute.
I am a resident of Mumbai and connected to the India Research Centre of Howard University.
This scheme was started with a dream of 28th year of 2014.
Tomorrow, the next three years of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed.
30 crore Indians have opened their first bank account by participating in this scheme.
The number of new account holders is more than the population of many countries in the world.
If there is money in the house or in the pocket, then it's hard to pay.
The poor people of our country have deposited about Rs. 65,000 crore in Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
Those who have opened the accounts in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, have also got the benefit of insurance.
With a premium of only one and three rupees under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, today a new confidence has been created in the lives of the poor.
The benefits of a premium are being received at Rs. 2 lakh when this poor person is infected in many families.
I have told me a lot of encouraging results of Jan Dhan Yojana, Rupay Card, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the benefits of the common man for insurance.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you, "Mickami Dukkadam"
Mann Ki Baat, July 2017
Man's heart is such that the rainy season is very pleasant for the people.
Animals, plants, nature, everybody gets brilliant in the rainy season.
But sometimes when the rain takes a terrible form, it seems that the destructive power of water is so much.
Nature is our lifestyle, our responsibilities, but sometimes floods, natural illusions like earthquakes, its terrible form becomes very devastating.
This change in the weather cycle and the change in the environment has a negative impact.
In the last few days, there is a lot of natural hazards due to heavy rains in some parts of India, especially in Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal.
Observation of flood affected areas is underway.
Broadly rescue operations are being carried out.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are reaching there.
The state government is also making every effort to help the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations, civilians who want to work in service are making every effort to help the people in this situation.
It has an impact on agriculture, animals, infrastructure, cheaper, electricity and connectivity.
We have created schemes for the loss of crops and farms, especially the agricultural insurance companies to play a positive role, so that the farmers' claims can be made very fast.
People are talking about their misery.
Before the rainy season, the entire government programme was prepared by mock drilling most of the places.
The team of NDRF was appointed.
Gradually, we have made us such a way that we will do our work according to the prediction of the rains so that we can get rid of the losses.
Whenever I am prepared for Mann Ki Baat, I can see that my country is more developed than me.
This time there are so many letters about GST, so many phones have come and people are still expressing happiness about GST, asking questions.
I want to listen to you a phone call - Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am telling Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I am extremely impressed by listening to your statements on Chartered Accountant Day.
That is why Goods and Service Tax (GST) has started in our country last month.
I'm gonna listen to you.
Thank you.
It has been almost a month since the GST is introducing, and its beneficial results are being seen.
And I am very happy that whenever a poor man writes a letter, how the prices of goods for the poor have been reduced, how the goods have become cheaper.
Any person living in the North-East, remote mountainous regions, forests are writing in a letter that he was scared of what would happen before, but now when I learned and understood it, I think that work has become easier than before.
Business has become simple.
And the biggest thing is that the confidence of the consumers is increasing.
Now I see how GST has affected the transportand logistics sector.
How the traffic has increased.
As a result, there is a strong smooth transition, so that there is a strong migration, a new registration, and a new belief is being created across the country.
And sometimes economists, managing experts, technologies and technological scholars, through their research, they will definitely distribute the use of GST in India as a model in the world.
It will become a Case Study for various universities in the world.
Because such a big change in such a large measure, the contribution of such millions of people in such a large country is the topic of its success.
The world will definitely research about this.
GST has been used, every state has participated in it, every state has its responsibility.
All the decisions have been taken by all the States and Centres in collaboration.
And as a result, the primary goal of every government is to ensure that there is no pressure on the poor for GST.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries, Departments, Central and State Government workers associated with this work.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias overall energy.
This is a historical achievement.
This is a campaign for social reforms.
I once again salute millions of Indians to achieve such a huge effort in a very heartfelt manner.
My dear countrymen, the month of August Movement.
Yusuf Meher Ali.
What happened on 9th August 1942, our new generation windows.
From 1857 to 1942, how much they had to bear, how much they had to bear, how much they had to bear with the aspirations of the people of India, the leaflets of history are inspired to create a better India.
This was the time when every corner of Hindustan - every corner of the city and every corner of the city, every corner of the city, the educated, the poor and the poor became the victim of the uit India movement.
In the call of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians dedicated their lives to the struggle of Karenge Ya Marenge.
After the call of Mahatma Gandhi on 9th August, whenever the British took all the big leaders, Dr.
Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan, the second generation leader.
Two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi were shown in the 'Cooperation Movement' of 1920 and 'Clease of India' movement of 1942.
The face of non-cooperation movement was similar, then the situation stood in 42 and the rapidity of the movement grew so much that the great men like Mahatma Gandhi had given the mantra of 'Karenge Yamreng.'
This was followed by public support, public strength, public commitment and mass struggle.
The whole country fought together that day.
I would sometimes think that whenever I gather the leaves of history, I understand that India's first freedom struggle was in 1857.
The war that started in 1857 was going to some corner of the country till 1942, and this long time it gave birth to a rapid demand for freedom to the people of the country.
Everybody is committed to doing something.
The generation has changed, but the rapidity of their determination is nothing.
A group of people have come here, they have joined the struggle, they have joined the struggle and they have tried every moment to explore the British empire.
From 1857 to 1942, this endeavour has brought the movement to an extreme extent in 1942, and the toxics of Bharatchato were so bad that they could go to English in five years in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, the freedom fighters came to every country and from 1942 to 1947, the five-year pledge was due to achieving the countrys independence.
This was five years of the original commander.
Now I want to connect you with this process.
In 1947, we were free and today 2017.
It's about 70 years.
The government has come.
The policy regulations have been created, changed, changed.
Everybody has done his own way to tackle the problems of the country.
In order to increase the income of the common man in the country, to overcome poverty, to improve the growth of the country, there is a constant effort for development.
Aspirations have also increased.
We will celebrate this 15th August, 2017 as the inauguration of the resolution and when 75 years of independence takes place in 2022, we will certainly achieve that pledge.
From 1942 to 1947, as the five years of independence, from 2017 to 2022, it will be a decisive year for Indias future.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of independence.
A pledge that we will be able to achieve in the next five years.
Come on, bring about new ideas like video posts, blogs, registers and new ideas by using technology.
This movement will have to form a mass movement.
uit I India uiz competition will be organized for young friends in the Narendra Modi App.
This uiz competition is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am glad that I had a lot of proposals from every corner of the country to discuss what should be said by 15th August last three years and the main objectives of these proposals are to make their dreams a form of words.
I will try to discuss these proposals as soon as I get on 15th August.
I'll finish it in 40-45 or 50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I want to talk about another thing today.
Socio-economic relations with the economy of India.
It should never be duplicated.
Our festivals, festivals and festivals are not merely for joy.
Our festivals, festivals are really a campaign of social reforms and our festivals are directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the country.
A few days later, Rakhi Bandhan, Janmashtami, then in the phase of Ganesh Festival, Chauth Chandra, Ananth Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Deepavali etc.
With this festival, a simple natural joy is also mixed.
When we talk about the economy, hundreds of households have become compelling in small families since the Rakhibandhan Festival.
Various types of silks, silks, etc. are kept in different ways, and today people like homemade.
Hundreds of thousands of businessmen are associated with a festival like those associated with Rakhi manufacturing, selling and sweet business.
Small soil lamps are made, they are related to the poor families but Deepavali is directly related to them.
Today, when I talk about the economy of festivals, festivals and the poor people associated with it, I would like to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware and active than me and I have also achieved it.
In the last one month's specific situation, the aware citizens wrote a letter to me.
They have requested me to keep in mind that I should talk about eco-friendly Ganesh in the fourth year so that people like the soil of Ganesha and make plans.
Lokmanya Tilak started this great tradition and this year is the 125th year of the Common Ganesha Festival.
125th year and 125 crore people.
Lokmanya Tilak Ganesh Festival was started by keeping in mind the spirit of social unity, awakening society and social reforms.
Come, let us also remember him, this year we have organized a composition competition, discussions etc. during the Ganesh festival.
Let us all try to enjoy this festival with the economy of the poor, the joy of our festivals should be the economic festival of the poor, the economic joy of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the coming festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that in the field of education, in the field of economic sector, in the field of social sector or in the field of sports, our daughters are brightening the country and are reaching the top of new achievements.
Our countrymen are proud of our wives, we are honoured for them.
Just a few days ago, we showed great skills in women's cricket.
This week, I had the opportunity to meet these players with girls.
They had an impression on their faces.
I told those girls about my different values.
I have seen that if the Indian players are failing, then they are also angry with the sportspersons of the country.
Some people say something that breaks down the gentlemen, gives some things that are very painful.
Not all this, the girls have done it, they have respected it.
I have seen a beautiful change in this thing, and I have told these girls that you should see this fortune is only for you and that you have not succeeded.
You have won the minds of 1. 25 billion Indians.
In fact, the youth of our country, especially our daughters are doing a lot to brighten the name of the country.
My dear countrymen, once again I would like to remind you of the August movement and once again I would like to recall the 9th August.
Let every country make a pledge of five years to fulfil their resolve.
Come on, we walk together, do something or the other.
Let us move forward with this belief that the fate of the country and the future of the country will be better.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
Weather changes.
It was very hot.
But it is fortunate that the rainy season is following its footprints.
Rainfall has started in some parts of the country.
After the rains, the cold wind is feeling comfortable in the summer of the past.
We all have seen that as much as excitement or anxiety in personal life or in public life, the emergence of rains changes our mindset.
Today, the chariot journey of Lord Jagannath Dev in different parts of the country is encouraging and rejoicing.
Today, in some other places of the world, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated.
The poor people of the country are specially associated with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
Very few people know that there is a word in English, Juggernut, which means a beautiful chariot that does not stop.
It is imperative that this word has come from Jagannath Dev's chariot.
This shows that people of the world have acknowledged the importance of this journey of Jagannath Ji in their own way.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ed-ul-Fitr.
Let us all come together and take the country forward by inspiring the festival of this festival.
In this month of Ramzan, I was able to know about a very inspirational incident in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In this small village, he lived thousands of 2000 brothers and sisters and said that most of the Muslim families here are Muslim families.
In the month of Ramzan, all the villagers decided to build toilets together.
17 lakhs have been provided with the support provided by the government for making personal toilets.
You will be happy to hear and will be surprised at the same time that in this sacred month of Ramzan, the Mughal brothers and sisters of the country have returned Rs 17 lakhs to the government.
17 lakhs for other services.
I thank all the villagers of Mubarakpur on this auspicious occasion of Ramzan.
Everything of them is very inspiring.
The biggest thing is that Tamburakpur has been defecated free from uninterrupted areas.
We know that our three states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared Open Defecation Free.
I specially express my gratitude to the administration and the people of this five-state state for fulfilling this work.
We are very well aware that we have to work hard to do some good work in a personal life or in social life.
If my hand is bad, it's a long time to make it clear.
Thus, there is a change in physical and mental conditions.
Cleanliness is the same.
Some bad habits have become our habit.
Everybody has to attract attention.
The inspirational events will also be repeated.
I am happy that cleanliness is no longer a government programme.
It is taking the form of a mass movement in the society.
When the people associated with the administration take this task forward with the participation of the people, the power grows in a normal way.
I remember a good thing last day that I want to tell you.
This incident is the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
Their aim was to build 71,000 household toilets in the village panchayats in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that the work of creating 10,000 toilets in 100 hours has been done successfully.
71,000 villages have become Open Defecation Free.
In-A, through the letter, all these suggestions are made in the Akashpani.
It is important to be aware of democracy and that is why it is necessary to recall the democracies that hurt democracy and encourage the good wishes for democracy.
On June 25, 1995, a black day that no Indian devotee of democracy can forget.
The entire country was transformed into a single prison.
The voices of the opponents were stabbed.
The dignitaries of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were captured.
The jurisdiction has not been relieved from the needy situation.
The newspaper was completely unusual.
Today, the students of the world, the people working about democracy, reminded the black day and continued to enhance the awareness of democracy.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also jailed.
Atal ji had written a poem on the occasion of the year of urgent situation and described the mental situation of that time in the poem.
We have to make this heritage stronger.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud of the world by raising his head.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world became compassionate.
From the sea to the mountains, people welcomed the rays of sun through yoga morning and morning.
Is there any Indian who won't be proud
It was not such a yoga practice, but today, when Yoga was tied to the roots of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have taken the opportunity of this Yoga.
On the one hand, in China, the Great Wall of China, people have practiced Yoga to cover the world heritage site of Peru at a height of 2,400 metres above the sea level.
People shadowed the IFL tower in France.
More than four thousand people have joined Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
India-Afghan Friendship Dam at Herat in Afghanistan has contributed a new gift to Indias friendship.
In a small country like Singapore, there have been seventy-five programmes and they have launched a campaign throughout the week.
The United Nations has released 10 postal stamps on International Yoga Day.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and the United Nations.
Employees of the United Nations, the world's diplomators, participate in this.
Once again, Yoga has made world records.
About 50,000 people have joined together in Ahmedabad in Gujarat and have created a new world record.
I also have the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But I am fortunate to join the rain for the first time.
Our soldiers have also practiced Yoga in Siachen, where there are twenty-five, twenty-five and forty degrees temperatures.
Whether it is our Armed Forces, BSF, ITBP, C-RP-Fook, C-IS-F, everybody has participated in Yoga with their own duties.
On this Day, I had said that three generations, since it was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that the three generations of the family will join together and share their photographs.
Some TV channels have moved this thing further.
I got a lot of photographs about this, some of them have been simultaneously simultaneously embraced by the Narendra Modi app.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to go to a very dear hospitality.
For a few days, a good event is being held in Kerala, a habit of reading among the people has been created under the P. Enpanicor Foundation. People are enthusiastic of reading books, so that reading day, reading minds are being celebrated.
I had the opportunity to go to the beginning of this and I was told that we don't have flowers, books.
My good guy.
This time I also remembered the thing that went away from the center of my attention.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I made a tradition in the government that we will not break, we will give it or welcome with a romal.
He's gonna be a room for Khadi so that he's gonna be in Khadi's garden.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this was the habit of all, but after coming here, my habit goes away.
But he went to Kerala and got the habit again.
And I have started giving notices to the government again.
We can gradually create a habit.
The age of flowers is very low.
We have to take it from the hand once.
But if you give a book then it becomes a part of the house, it becomes a member of the family.
When I went to London, the queen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth invited me to dinner.
How many years have passed and ueen Elizabeth took care of Mahatma Gandhi's room.
And he showed me very happy to go.
When I was looking, I don't know if he wanted to touch me once.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
I am confident that these habits don't change the night and sometimes they have to be critical.
But despite this, such things should be highlighted, efforts should be made.
Now I can't say that I'm somewhere and somebody's gonna drive the flower, then I'm not gonna tell him, I can't do it.
But whatever is the matter, it will be discussed, but it should be continued, it will gradually change.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of work in becoming the Prime Minister.
I have to drown in the files, but I have made a habit of myself, I read some of the letters that I have received and there is a chance to protect connectivity with the common man.
Different kinds of people are writing.
I think you're supposed to have a letter.
A housewife of Tamil Nadu in the far south, Aurulmozhi servant wrote a letter.
What are you writing in that letter, I said that I took care of my world, I thought of doing something in keeping with the children's education so that there is a financial balance in the world.
Likewise, I started the work of buying some goods from the market by lending some loans from the bank in the Mudra Yojana.
In this regard, the Government has set up a system called 'Government e-marketplace'.
So I took a search and registered myself in this system.
Whoever wants to supply any goods to the government, can be electric bulbs, can want to supply dustbins, swords, cheese, tables, whatever you want to sell, you can register.
He wrote, First of all, I got the money from the Mudra Yojana and started my business and then registered my sales in the e-GEM and then I received the order from the Prime Minister's Office.
I wanted to know what the PMO wanted to buy
He told me that he bought drunk thermos and got 1600 Payments.
Yeah, that's Empowerment.
There is a transparency, empowerment, as well as entrepreneurship.
Government-Marketplace-GEM
I want that the number of people who want to sell something to the government is increasing like this.
I understand that this is an invaluable example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and aims at Minimum Price and Maximum Price, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on one hand, we can be proud of the success of Yoga and in the space science.
It is Indias specialty and Yoga is the land of our country and our country is also a remote space drive.
Earlier, India has shown a lot of success in sports and science.
Today, India is not only in the earth but also in the space.
Two days ago, ISRO has launched 30 nanosatilates along with Cartosat-II satellites.
These satellites include about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom and America.
And from these nano satellites of India, there will be a lot of beneficial information in the field of agriculture and the priorities for the benefit of the farmers.
A few days ago, we all remember that ISRO has successfully launched GSAT-19.
Imagine how many of our scientists have founded in space research.
1,000 days of Mars Mission on 19th June.
You all remember that for this Mars mission, we were successfully set up in Orbit and the period was fixed for six months.
It was 6 months old.
But what extraordinary skills of our scientists have crossed a thousand days after six months.
Our scientific journey to complete this thousand days is a great success in our space research.
As well as in the field of sports, our younger generations are brightening their skills and their physical capabilities.
This day, Indias Badminton sportsperson Kidambi in Indonesia and Spain enhances the respect of the country.
I congratulate Shrikanth and his Koch on this occasion.
T.
Sports plays an important role in development.
Sports contributes to the development of the overall personality.
There is no dearth of representation in the country.
If the boys and children of the family are swinging towards sports, they should be encouraged.
Once again, the countrymen, the festival of rainy season, the festival of festivals gives a unique recognition to this time.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2017
Today, when I talk to you, the Holy Ramadan month has begun.
In the holy month of Ramzan, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the people of the world, especially the people of the Muslim community in this holy month.
During Ramadan, special attention is given to prayers, spirituality and kindness.
We are very fortunate to the Hindustanis. Our priorities have made such a tradition that the Indians can proudly proud.
We can be proud of the hundred and twenty five crore nations that are the people of all the world in India.
It is such a country that the faithful or the Nastik who worshipped the idols or those who oppose the idol worship, all kinds of thoughts, all kinds of worship processes, all kinds of traditions have embarrassed the strategy of living together.
And be it religion, community, thinking or tradition, whateverever, gives us one message - peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramadan will help in furthering this stream of peace, unity and harmony.
I convey my best wishes again.
Last time, when I did Mann Ki Baat, I used a word, especially the youngsters told them to do something new and get out of the comfortable zone with a new experience.
And it's an old man who lives like this... to be a little risky, to be constrained with hardship.
I am glad that many people gave me feedback.
Everyone individually encouraged me to talk to me.
There is such a message that I can't read everything, I can't even hear the messages sent by everyone.
But I have seen in my sight, some are trying to learn songs, some are showing their hands in a new musical instruments, some are trying to learn new things by using U-tubes, some are learning new languages, some are learning cooking, some are learning dancing, some are learning dancing and some are writing poems.
The habit of my studies was almost closed.
That's why I tried to read on this holiday.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I realized that how many freedom fighters had to live for Indias freedom struggle, how many years have been spent in jail.
I have been inspired by the life of Bhagat Singh, who has done a lot at a young age.
That is why I urge you to say something about this in today's phase.
I am glad that today's youngsters are expressing their desire to know about our history, our freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for our country.
I went to Andaman Nicobar several years ago.
I went to see the cellular jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote a book "Manji Janmathe" sitting in jail.
He wrote poems on the walls of the prison.
He was kept shut down in a small house.
How hard it was to bear for freedom.
When I read the book 'Manji Janmathe' of Savarkar ji, I was inspired to see the cellular jail.
There is a light and sound show that is very inspiring.
There is no such kingdom of Hindustan, there is no language speaking person who did not enjoy Kalapani for freedom, in Andaman's jail - this cellular jail did not lose his life.
And if you ever get the opportunity then you will definitely visit the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, the first Monday of June 5.
And this year the theme of the 1980 Nationals is Connecting People to Nature.
Otherwise, Back to Basics.
And someone else said better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi has said many times: "One Must Care is a world one will not see", that is, our duty is to think about that.
After getting tired, the window of the house opens the doors and takes a fresh breath in the air.
When contact with that Panchbhut which is created in our body, then it is from you that a new life and a new yield is created in our body.
We all saw it, but we didn't think about it, and we couldn't bind it in one corner.
Then you will definitely see that whenever you are associated with various natural conditions, you will have a new consciousness inside you.
And that is why on 5th June, to connect with nature, our campaigns should be done all over the world.
We see some of our ancestors who worked to protect the environment.
If we protect the environment, our next generation will get its results.
Veda: The world and the environment are considered to be the root of energy.
We are told here: Mother Land: son Aham Prithbia.
The Veda says that the sacredness that we have is for our world.
The earth is our mother and we are his children.
If we think of Lord Buddha, one thing must come out that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana were all three in the trees.
But we need to connect him with modern dialects in modern words.
This time I have news from different states.
As soon as the rains come, a big campaign to plant trees in almost all the states started.
Crores of trees are planted.
The whole world celebrates this day as World Yoga Day.
Within a short span of time, this World Yoga Day of 21st June has been expanding everywhere, people are participating.
At the same time, World Yoga Day is a major contribution of India to showcase the worlds distinctive powers.
Through Yoga, we have binded the entire world in one corner.
The way Yoga tied the body, mind, intellect and soul together, Yoga tied the world together.
In this situation, Yoga has played a major role in achieving stress-free life.
Yoga is not just a exercise but it is a healthy body, mind, justice and it is possible to feel this combination through Yoga only.
Two days ago, I wrote a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world on Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some awards.
A funny proposal.
He said, This is the third International Day of Yoga, I would like to urge the three generations of the same family to exercise Yoga together on this third International Day of Yoga.
Whether it is a grandmother or a grandmother, parents, boys and daughters should exercise yoga together and upload the pictures.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow, a lucky combination of Yoga will showcase a new direction.
I am grateful for this proposal and I feel that as we have launched the Selfie with Daughter and have made a pleasant experience, the pictures of the three generations of Yoga will create light on the entire country and the world.
You must send me a picture of the three generations where three generations are doing yoga together through the Narendra Modi App.
This will be tomorrow, today and tomorrow's pictures, which will be a beautiful time guarantee.
I invite you all.
Till now, about three weeks of International Yoga Day remains.
Start the habit from today.
You should also propagate about uncomfortable yoga for three weeks, spread, join people.
It's a kind of private health care movement.
I invite you all to participate in this.
From the day you took over as the chief servant, and from the Red Fort, I had the opportunity to speak on my first 15th August, I had told about cleanliness.
From that day to today, I have been visiting different parts of India.
Today, on Modiji, TV and social media, I have seen that wherever you are going, all the people of that place are paying special attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, in your call, people have embraced cleanliness as a mission.
Children were also aware of cleanliness with the elders.
Many times the youngsters have seen them throwing the jungle of the elders.
The cleanliness that you have started from the valley of Kashi has taken the face of a movement through your inspiration.
You are right, wherever I am going, the work of sanitation is done by the government, but today a festival of sanitation starts in the society.
But when this phone call came, I also thought and saw that yes, it's right.
The rest of the preparations will be made to welcome the Prime Minister, but the first will be cleanliness.
It will automatically enjoy anyone who loves cleanliness.
I would like to thank everyone for giving this emphasis on cleanliness.
Someone gave me a proposal.
It's a funny proposal.
I don't know if I can do it.
Modi ji, when you go to an invitation, I will say, if you invite me, then on the basis of which level of cleanliness, how many tons of jungles you will gift me, I will decide to visit me.
Dear is very good, but I have to think.
Again, it is right that there is a movement, and as a gift, you will clean up a few tons of jungles instead of other things.
How many people will be saved from illness.
How big humanity will work.
Once it is considered as a health, the new way of Waste Management will come forward.
Young people associated with start-ups will come forward with new plans, be it the beginning of new machinery.
It is expected that the dry waste in these four thousand cities will be blue dustbin-A and wet waste green dustbin.
The waste of the kitchen, such as vegetables, vegetables, cotton, eggs, trees, leaves, all these are wet wastes - green dustbin.
All these things are such that if the color of food is green, then it will be remembered that what should be done in green dustbin.
And the rest of the wastes like unnecessary papers, iron, card boards, glasses, clothing, plastic, polythene, rubber and other metals - which are required to be recycled in machines and are not usually used in blue dustbin.
I am confident that if we have to take new steps for cleanliness then we can fulfill the dream of Gandhijis dream of cleanliness.
Today, I would like to mention a matter of pride that if a person does so, he would create a mass movement.
Cleanliness is such a thing.
In the last few days, you must have heard a news that the smelling Barsoba Beach of Mumbai has become a clean, clean Barsoba Beach.
This is not a sudden but a citizen has changed the pictures of Barsoba Beach for 80-90 weeks and has made Barsoba Beach clean, clean and beautiful by removing thousands of tons of wastes.
And Versova Residents Volunteer has taken over it.
An individual, Mr. Afroz Shah, was embarrassed with all power since October 2015 and gradually many more people joined this work and took the form of a mass movement.
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has awarded Afroz Shah for this work.
He was the first Indian who was awarded the Champions of the Arth Award.
I came to know that the local women have led the most in this work.
In order to create awareness among the people, they have brought to the mosquitoes, every street, every household and every household, they have inspired everyone.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these mothers and sisters.
I convey my best wishes to the empire of the people of Jammu and Kashmir for open defecation free and a beautiful launch.
My dear countrymen, the work of the present government for the last three years has been continuously discussed in the newspapers, TV channels and social media.
Three years ago, you gave me the charge of the chief servant.
People from all levels of society have analyzed it.
It is a good tradition for democracy.
I am grateful to all those people who have given optimistic and important feedbacks, have the opportunity to improve the error, error, error etc.
For a conscious nation, it is very important for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I and a simple citizen like you, that is why I have the same effect in the minds of a simple citizen.
There are hundreds of families who have written this to me.
As a simple man, it has a special impact on my mind as a simple citizen, this incident has encouraged me.
I am grateful to Akbar.
Come, let us all move ahead with nature in this environment.
I convey my best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dear countrymen, namaskar
And the aspirations of the children, the aspirations of the younger generation, the aspirations of the elders and the aspirations of the elders come forward.
Every time the inputs that come to Mann Ki Baat are analyzed by the government.
What is the complaint, what is the feeling of people, etc.
If you look at the motor, people's habit is to advise others.
On the train, if someone wants to go to the bus, then do this to others.
But when I tried to see these things, I was compassionate.
In most cases, those people have sent advice and tried to reach me, who have actually done something in their lives.
They tried to do some good work according to their understanding, energy, capabilities and opportunities.
And when I realized that, I felt that these advices were not simple.
This is from the experience of the people.
Some people feel that where they work, wherever they work, they are working there, if others listen to these things, then it can create a comprehensive shape and benefit many people.
Not only this, when I mention something, I remember all this and I am very happy.
I have never thought that today, especially the youth of our country have been working on this matter for a long time.
For a few years, I knew that some social organisations were working on this matter, but I can know that the youth of my country is working on this matter.
Many have sent me a video.
There are many places where the bread bank is running.
People deposit their bread in the bank of bread, deposit their wheels, and collect them for themselves.
Those who are giving love to them, and whoever is going to don't think they are small.
It is an example of how it works through cooperation in society.
It's the last day of April.
On May 15, Gujarat and Maharashtra were recognized as an organisation.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
The two states have been making efforts to reach new goals of development and are engaged in the development of the country.
And in both the states, their livelihoods are inspired by the great men and their livelihoods in every field of society.
On the occasion of the inaugural day of the two states, we should imagine that our states, our own people, our society, our cities, our families should reach the heights of their families, that is, 75 years after independence in 2022.
It should be planned to work out this vision and all citizens should further enhance their cooperation in this work.
It is time to feel the warmth in our country in March-April this time.
When I was consulting the people in Mann Kibat, I had suggested what should be done in this summer.
These things are prevalent, not new, but also in special times it will be used to reflect.
And I have seen that the children of the family are doing this work very well.
Once they understand why this water should be filled, they can see if they have water in the utensils ten times in a day.
And the birds are here or not.
I think this game is going on, but it is a wonderful way to express condolences in the minds of the boys.
In our country, we live together with animals and birds and birds, their colors are coloured, yet we should focus on concerted efforts for their conservation.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Daudi Bohra Samaj had completed a hundred years of Dharmaguru Sahina Saheb.
He was alive for 103 years.
And for his hundred years, the Bohra community runs a big campaign to save the climbers through Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to commemorate this campaign.
Approximately thousands of bird feeders have spread them in the corner of the world.
Guinness Book of World Records has set up this campaign.
Sometimes I was so busy that those who came to my house with news papers, milk, vegetables, postmans, I forgot to give some water before them in summer.
Young friends, I want to talk to you too.
Sometimes I feel that some of our younger generations are enjoyed living from the comfort zone.
Their mothers and fathers have administered them in one of their accomplishments.
Some people pass through extremist oppression, but most people spend this life of comfortzone.
Now the test is over and there have been a lot of plans to enjoy holidays.
It's very funny to get hot in summer.
But I want to talk about how to make your holidays as a friend.
My belief is that some people will surely change my words and tell me.
Sometimes something is seen on TV, reading or learning about it and feeling it by itself.
Whether the tests are positive, you can get out of the comfortzone.
We are a middle-class family, a happy family.
Friends, I have ever felt that without conservation of seats, I have traveled 24 hours in the second class room of the train with tickets.
Sometimes feel it, I'm not telling you to do it again, but do it once or half.
In the evening, with his football, with volleyball or other means of sports, he went to a poor habitation.
Play yourself with those poor boys, you will see, you will feel that you have never enjoyed this game in life.
The children who live in such a way of life will have the opportunity to play with you, what do you think will change the lives of those children
This experience will show you a lot.
Several volunteers are working on this service.
Sometimes a lot of commemorative camps are organised for personality development and there can be a lot of development in it.
If you are participating in the Samar camp, you are doing the course of personality development, you will go free to all those who have been deprived of all these courses and teach them what you have learned.
How to do this, you can teach.
We insist that the technology has come to reduce the distance, but it is a result of the fact that there are six units in the same house, but the interaction between them has grown so much that is imagined.
Everyone is busy with new technologies.
Staying together is a reform, the same is power.
Secondly, I want to say with skills, don't you want to learn new things
We try to make good results, lose ourselves and get admitted to some coaching classes in the vacation, there is a feeling of observation.
Sometimes scared, our younger generation is not getting robots.
We can focus on skill development.
It can be tried to communicate with oneself from technology - somebody or Tamil, Telugu, Tamil, Bengal, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi languages.
If you don't know the swimming, swim, swim, swim, swim, swim, swim, swim, swimming, swimming, swimming.
You want to learn to drive your car, ever want to learn what auto-rickshaw
You can see that these are new experiments, the skills that will give you joy and you will get rid of what you have tied up in the shadow of life.
Get out of her life, do something, guys.
This is the opportunity to make life.
You think all the exams are over, you will learn when you go to the new career, but there will be no chance.
Then you're gonna get involved in a problem, so I'll tell you if you want to learn your magic, then at least learn the magic of it.
Keep showing your friends magic.
Try to know what you don't know, you will definitely beneficial.
The human qualities within you will be awakened and there will be a lot of improvements.
I am telling my experience that we cannot even imagine what we can learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages, new villages, new areas.
But before going, wherever we are going, the traditions of that place, the way we see, understand, talk, asking, all these efforts can be made, then the joy of seeing that new place increases.
Go to the same place for four days.
Go to another place and stay for three-four days.
You can learn from this.
Where did you go
You share your experiences using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity.
New generations are almost free from cash transactions.
They need cash.
They're starting to believe in Digital Currency.
But if someone else refers or joins someone else and the new person does the transaction of money thrice then you will get your money for this thing.
Your account will deposit ten rupees from the government.
If you get 20 people in a day, you will get 200 rupees in the evening.
Businesses may also have income, teachers may also have income.
This scheme is on 14th October and it will be for you to create Digital India.
Now the red embankment has gone, so no one can say that the red embankment that has entered into the mind may have emerged.
I got an interesting phone call.
This phone also expressed the apprehension, but this phone shows that the common man did not like it at all, they felt a distance.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am speaking from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh to Shiva Chaube.
I want to say something about the Red Backen Light Bank of the Government.
I don't have to get rid of the traffic jam, and I don't have to wait for him.
I want to thank you very much for this principle.
Thanks for the sanitation of the PPs.
Training is a part of the government system.
But we have to look forward to this idea.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that our history, our culture, our heritage have to be remembered again and again.
With this, we save energy, get inspiration.
This year, we are taking a blessing of Saint Ramanujacharya.
India is an ancient nation that we have the opportunity to remember thousands of years or more of its old memories.
Thousands of years ago, he made a movement with the authority to enter the temple and succeeded.
We are so lucky that at all times, no great man has been born in this country to denounce the faults of the society.
We can inspire him to reflect the spirit of socio-economic unity that is the source of socio-economic unity.
The Government of India will release a postage stamp in memory of Sant on May 01.
I recall Santaramujacharya with respect and salute him.
Dear countrymen, there is another significance of May 1 tomorrow.
This day is celebrated as Labour Day in many places of the world.
And when it comes to Labour Day, the talk of labour and labourers, then I will remember Babasaheb Ambedkar.
We are grateful to Babasaheb Ambedkar for the welfare of the workers today.
Babasaheb's role in labour welfare is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb Ambedkar and Saint Ramanujacharya, I remember the great saint and socialist Jaganguru Basaveshwar of the twentieth century Karnataka.
In the twelfth century, he talked about labour and labour in Kannada.
He was speaking in Kannada - Kay Kave Kailas.
This means that through hard work you can reach Shiva's Alaikailas.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Dattopant Thangri.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
All the Buddhists of the world celebrate that day.
And in India, the journey from war to Buddha in the life of Mahamati Ashoka is a unique symbol.
It is particularly aimed at our neighbouring countries.
May Indias neighbouring countries continue to collaborate and develop them.
Several projects are underway at the international level.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on May 5, 2019.
This satellite will facilitate the economic and other development sectors of South Asia.
This will help us in the development of the entire world of South Asia, with the mapping of natural resources, telemedicines, education, IT connectivity and people-to-people relations.
It is an important step from India to enhance cooperation with the entire South Asia - an invaluable gift, an exemplary example of our commitment to South Asia.
I convey my best wishes to the South Asian countries who are connected with this South Asia Satellite Project for this special effort.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2017
Most of the families in every corner of the country are busy testing their children.
There is some comfortable environment and where the test is going on, all those families are still under pressure.
But at such a time, I will say that last time, listen to the things I had told about Mann Ki Baat.
Those things will surely be used for you during the test.
Today is 26th March.
The Independence Day of Bangladesh on 26th March.
Historical battle against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh.
Today, on this great day, I convey my best wishes to the citizens of Bangladesh and to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh.
And I would like to assure Bangladeshs progress, development and Bangladeshi people that India is a strong partner, a good friend and we will contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region.
We are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memory, our heritage.
The National Music of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
It is a very attractive thing about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore that in 1913 he was not only the first person of Asia to be awarded the Film Award but also the British gave him the Nighthood award .
And when the British used to fight in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, then Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who were oppressed and at that time when a child of 12 years had a deep impact on this incident .
A new face in the life of the boy who shook in the plains, brought the drunken killing of the Jallian Walabagh.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagwat is our beloved, inspired by all of us - martyr Bhagwat Singh.
Three days before today, on 23rd March, the British shook Bhagat Singh and his companions - Sukhdev and Rajguru and we all know that the incident on 23rd March - Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru - there was no fear of satisfaction on the service of Mother India .
All the dreams of life were sacrificed for the liberation of Mother India.
And those three heroes are still inspired by us.
We cannot describe the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
The entire British administration was scared of these three youths.
They were imprisoned by the British on the day of fascination, but what they could do with them.
And that's why on March 24, there was a slaughter on 23rd.
It's hiding. It's not normally seen.
And after that, the British quietly burned their dead bodies in Punjab today.
Many years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I felt the vibration of that land.
And I will definitely tell the youngsters of the country that whenever they get the opportunity to go to Punjab, they must go to the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Datta.
At this time, the embankment of freedom, its intensity, its intensity increased.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth of the Armed Revolution.
At the same time, 100 years ago, Mahatma Gandhi had Satyagraha in Champaran on 10th April, 1917.
This year, the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the freedom struggle of India, it was first seen in Champaran.
In the entire movement of freedom, it was a pattern of change, especially from the perspective of the congressional system.
This festival, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Khada Satyagraha, the labourers of the factory in Ahmedabad, and all these were showing the deep impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and the style of work.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and inspired the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the pictures of Mahatma Gandhi.
Imagine a man who returned to Hindustan in 1915 had worked only for two years.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that the organizational strategy of Mahatma Gandhi, the power to know the nails and nails of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, the impoverishment of the British administration through his behaviour of Mahatma Gandhi, the creation of an unconscious person for fighting, inspiring the battlefield of a magnificent power was displayed.
So we can feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think about Gandhi a hundred years ago, then it is a matter of deep study that Champaran Satyagraha is the part of the life of the people.
We can learn from him how to work hard and how Gandhi did it.
And it was a time when we heard the name of Tabor Tabor Tabor, who was Rajendrababu, Acharya Kripalani, sent everyone to the village Gandhi.
On the one hand, if the jail is filled then on the other hand hand it over to constructive work.
There was a marvellous balance between Gandhi's style of functioning.
What could be the meaning of Satyagraha , what could be uncomfortable , what could be the meaning of unbearableness in front of such a large empire - not only through words but through successful discourse , Gandhi had presented a whole new idea.
Everyone is happy in the interests of the people. The unprecedented effort to do something for the country and for the society will fulfil the dreams of all the great men who gave life for the freedom of the country.
And in the 21st century, there are no Indians who do not want to change, who do not want to participate in the progress of the country.
This will enhance the progress of 1. 25 crore Indians to market the seeds of a New India - New India.
There are many people who go to the hospital regularly to serve the patients.
Our country's Ratna Garbha and the service of the people's service is our birth.
If we look at this thinking in a systematic manner then it will be understood how big it is.
If we talk about India, it is very natural and inevitable that different opinions and visions will emerge.
But it is also true that if the entire country is taking steps to fulfil it, then the dream of a New India can be achieved.
It is not necessary that a lot of work should be done at the budget or government cost.
If every citizen makes a pledge that he will follow the traffic rules, fulfil his duty, at least one day in a week stop the use of petrol - diesel then through this small step we will stop using New II .
I will see the dreams of India to be realised and I will say that everybody should celebrate his citizens' religions and obligations.
In this way, a New India can be started.
The 150th year of Indias independence is going to be held in 2022.
I urge you, let us embrace and commit your lives and participate in this journey of Swaraj to Suraj.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to express my gratitude to you.
BHIM App has been started two and a half months ago, but about 1. 5 crore people have already downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
You cannot even imagine that you can become a big partner of the country and you can represent a brave soldier against black money and corruption.
A few days ago, Digidhan Mela was organised for public education and awareness.
About 12. 5 lakh beneficiaries have been awarded and 75,000 beneficiaries have been awarded for traders.
Let us contribute to this effort to reduce cash transactions and the use of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that whenever I want your advice for Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of opinion.
But I have noticed that there is no lack of interest in cleanliness.
I think how important cleanliness is to understand the common man.
I go through a river every day, where people destroy the river by throwing a lot of waste.
This river is coming through the Rispana bridge and flows through our house.
In order to keep this river clean, I went to Pada and talked to the people, mixed, but there was no special benefit.
I would urge you to send a team here or publish it through a newspaper.
Brothers and sisters, see how much trouble a girl from the eleventh eleventh eleventh eleventh eleventh eleventh eleven.
Looking at the dirty waste in the river, how fucking he was
I think it's a good sign.
I want that 125 crore people should be angry with waste in their minds.
Once there is anger, if there is dissatisfaction, if there is anger, then we will be able to do something in the campaign against waste.
It's a good thing that Gayatri has expressed his anger, suggested me and told me something that he has made a lot of efforts but failed.
Since the movement of cleanliness has started, awareness has increased.
Everyone is actively associated with it.
It took the form of a movement.
The hatred of waste is increasing slowly.
Whether people are aware, actively participate in the movement, it has its own significance.
This movement is possible in a whole way.
It's hard to work, but we have to do it.
I am confident that the awareness among the youngsters of the country, among the boys, among the academics and the youth is indicating a good conclusion.
Today, I would like to tell all those nations who listen to the songs in my Mann Ki Baat that the words of Gayatri are spoken to us all.
As much as you can do, half of them don't go to the belly, and leave it there.
Sometimes you have seen how much we waste the unregistered food that we left.
Have you ever seen that if you don't defecate, this food can fill the stomach of the poor.
There's nothing different about this.
Normally, when the mother feeds the children in our house, she said that as much as you can eat.
There is a lot of efforts in this field, but in spite of this, the apathy of social disorders is reflected.
This is injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if there is a balance, the family will also get financial benefits.
It is a good idea for the society, but it is such that the family will also benefit from it.
I don't want to say anything about this, but I want to increase awareness.
I know some youngsters who are associated with this kind of movement.
The youngsters of our country work like this.
This kind of people will be found somewhere in all the states of the country.
Their work can inspire us so that we do not waste food.
We'll take as much as we eat.
This is the way to change.
And those who are healthy are always saying - keep the plate empty , keep the stomach empty too .
When it comes to health then say, 'World Health Day on 7th April.
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) has set a target of 'Health for All' by 2030.
This time, the United Nations focused on Depression on World Health Day on April 7.
According to a history, more than 150 crore people in the world are victims of mental depression.
The problem is that many people around us are victims of this disease, but we don't understand it, and maybe we feel sorry to talk about it.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not such that it is not possible to get rid of it.
He started getting rid of a psychological complex.
The first thing is depression - who doesn't suppress it must express it.
Tell your friends to parents, brothers and sisters, to the teachers, what is happening in you.
Did you ever think why the man is doing this
You must be sure this is the first symptom of depression.
If you want to keep yourself away from the midst of everybody, take care of it, don't let him go alone.
Let's stay with those whom he likes to live with.
Encourage him to speak openly in a funny funny thing, find out what he's hiding in deep hearts.
In diseases like diabetes, such as physically weakened, depression reduces the mindset of the people, bravely cuts, reduces the strength of fighting for life and destroys all our lifestyle.
Your self-confidence will come back if you start resolving the problems of others with the mind of service.
If you are able to celebrate yourself with others, serve yourself and if you can do it unbelievable, see if your mind becomes lighter.
Yoga is the best way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is a very effective way to get rid of mood, to get rid of obstacles and to get rid of happiness.
The International Day of Yoga is celebrated every year on 21st June.
If you are to give some suggestions to the International Day of Yoga, send me all the thoughts through my mobile app, show the path.
Whatever poems, songs and songs can be written about yoga, keep writing, so that a zeal can come in the common man.
This time I will say something to the mothers and sisters.
A few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
This is why the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
During the pregnancy of the working women, during the pregnancy, during the pregnancy and post-children, the maternity vacation that was given was about 12 weeks ago.
Only two or three countries of the world are ahead of us.
When these children grow up, they will have the wealth of the country.
New Year Festivals are celebrated in different parts of our country.
The festival of New Year is celebrated in the New Year of Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra-Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmir Navreh in Aodh, Sanvatsar Puja in Aodh, Jud Cold in Mithila in Bihar.
A large country is full of diversity in India.
Congratulations to all of you on the New Year
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
The bird's bullshit brings a jewelry of pleasure.
Not only flowers but also fruits in the branches of trees are brightened in the sun rays.
The seasonal fruits are also seen in this spring.
Similarly, in the field of farming, mustard yellow flowers are expected to grow.
The red flowers of Palash reflect the emergence of Holi.
Amir Khasru has given a beautiful description of this time of climate change.
He says, The forest is boiling, the mustard is boiling, the plague is boiling, the Kokil is calling, the Kuhu-Kuhu.
When the color of happiness in nature touches joy in the form of a saint, people also enjoy that joy.
Spring-panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals make human life colorful.
And that is why he said that I should say something about 104 satellites and interceptor missiles.
Shobhaji thanked you very much that you have recalled the pride of India.
Be it fighting poverty, protecting themselves from diseases, connecting with the world, inspiring knowledge, technology and science have proved their role.
The 15th February, 2017 is a glorious day in Indias national life.
Our scientists have raised our head in front of the world.
And we know that in a few years, ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented projects.
ISRO has set up a World Record in the field of Space Expedition after the success of sending Mars Mission Mangalyaan to Mangal planet.
India is the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together.
And it is also happy that this is the 38th sustainable launch of PSLV.
This is not just ISRO but also a historic achievement for the entire India.
ISRO's cost effective space programme has shown a miracle to the world and has appreciated the success of India's scientists in the open world.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters will be able to know how many water resources are being used in our country, how should it be used and how should it be taken care of, our new satellite cartosat 2D will help us in this regard.
He sent some pictures to our satellite room.
He started his work.
It is also a pleasure for us that our young scientists and women scientists have led these campaigns.
This terrible collaboration of youth and women is a great pride of ISROs success.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
For the common man, they have always been absorbing the aim of using mahakash science for the nation's service and are creating new achievements every day.
Our scientists, their entire team will be reduced as much as we appreciate.
Sobha ji had another question and it was related to Indias security.
India has successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor Missile for Defence.
Interception technologies, this missile has been successful in carrying about 100 kilometres above the soil while flying its tests.
This is an important achievement in defence.
When we see new technologies, see new scientific achievements, we are happy.
And asking has played a major role in the development of human life.
And whoever intellectuals do not let him ask in the form of asking, he also communicates with him, finds new questions, creates new questions.
That's the reason for a new discovery.
They don't get calm until the answer is received.
And if we look at the stream of development of human life for thousands of years then we can say that there is no constraint in the stream of development of human life.
Perfection is impossible.
Brahmind, the rules of creation, the efforts of mankind continue to be made to know.
New science, new technologies are born out of it.
And every technologies, every new form of science, gives a new generation of age.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about science, talk about scientific hard work, I remember that this Mann Ki Baat programme should be attracted to the science of younger generations.
There are many scientists in the country.
Today, scientists will launch a sustainable change in the lives of future generations.
Keeping in mind the needs of the common man, when science is studying, discovering and innovation are inspired by the feelings of the common man, science becomes a man's own then science becomes greater.
This is where I have seen an innovation as our poor fisherman.
All such innovations were found from this competition.
Various services are going to be driven by technology.
Technologies have become an integral part of life.
Indias digital transition rate is increasing.
Especially the youth are eradicating digital payments from their hands.
I think it's a good symptom.
Lucky Grahak Yojana and DG Dhan Bipar Yojana are getting a big boost.
It has been almost two months since these two schemes, 15,000 people are awarding Rs. 1,000 per day.
A lot of people have received Rs. 1 lakh in this scheme.
More than four thousand businesses have been made up of Rs.
Smt. Santosh, Mahishur, has conveyed happiness at the Narendra Modi App that he has received a prize of Rs.
Then I think that Mr. Santisfaction should share with you.
I feel so fond of knowing that Santosh ji, your name and work both have given us a lot of joy.
On the one hand, as he is driving, he has become the Ambassador of the Lucky Consumer Scheme.
Travelers of the car are also encouraging the digital system with inspiration and many of them have started participating in the digital system.
A young companion from Maharashtra, Puja from Namad, was talking to his friends about how the use of Rupee Card, E-Wallet is being done among a schoolchildren.
One lakh rupees prize is important for him and he is also encouraging others to take this mission.
This work plays an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
Remembering one day.
A few days ago, Babasaheb Ambedkar lost his 125th birth anniversary.
Remembering him, you also learn to upload at least 125 people to BHIM.
Learn how transactions are made through this.
So I want to say that we have to strengthen the foundation stone of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
125 crore people will have to reach the BHIM App by going home.
The success of this movement that has been going on for the last two-three months is being achieved in many villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has a lot of contribution to the economy of our country.
The financial power of the village provides strength to the economic pace of the country.
Today I want to tell you a joy.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have laboured hard and filled the grains.
This year, the maximum production of rice has been due to the hard work of the farmers of our country.
Everything is telling us that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This year, the way the crops have flown in the fields, it seems every day that the festival of Pongal or Vaishakhi is celebrated.
This year, more than 7 crore tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
The last erect of our farmers was more than eight percent.
It's a wonderful achievement.
I specially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I am happy that the farmers of the country have heard about the poor and about two lakh hectares of land have been harvesting pulses.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service to the poor of the country by the farmers.
I am very grateful to the farmers and sisters of my country for their hard work and record production of pulses.
My dear countrymen, some of the programmes are being run by the government in our country, by the society, by the institutions, by organisations and through the medium of cleanliness.
In some ways, there is an awareness of cleanliness in a way.
The importance of seminars and seminars of cleaning has been highlighted in Warangal, Telangana.
Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February.
Six household toilet pits have been cleaned and the officers have shown themselves how to use the Twin Pit Toilet.
They also showed how comfortable toilets of this new system, and there is no other discomfort or constraint to cleaning it.
We also do the work of cleaning small toilets like we can clean the toilets.
A Standard Twin PitToilet for the family of six members is filled in about five-six years.
Our farmers are well aware of the NPK.
Various Government Departments and Cleanliness Partners have been accomplished in different ways.
For the first time in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will also participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
On the second day of March, the Ministry of Commerce Industry (MoNER) and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will run the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does a significant job, the entire country gets a new energy and confidence.
We all welcomed the way our Divyang sportspersons have achieved in Rio Paralympics.
In the Blind T-20 World Cup Finally held this month, India lost Pakistan for the second time in the world champion and enhanced its pride.
I once again congratulate all the players of this team.
The country is proud of the success of our Divyang friends.
I always don't know that Divyang brothers and sisters are incomplete with a strong mind, courage and determination.
We can always learn new things from them.
Whether it is in sports or space science, our daughters are not behind.
They have moved on foot and are proud of their success.
Just a few days ago, our women sportspersons won the silver medal in the Asian Ragbisevens' Summit.
I convey my best wishes to all these sportspersons.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Movement is progressing at a fast pace.
This is not just a government project, it has now become a campaign for social consciousness and public education.
In the last two years, the common man has been associated with this scheme.
All the flames that are being obtained from every corner of the country are compulsory to think of the common man and for years, the old traditions of the people are changing their minds.
It is really enjoyed when the festivals were celebrated on the occasion of birth of the daughters.
This kind of emotional thinking towards Kanyastan enhances the path of social recognition.
I came to know that the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu has been able to shut down the balcony.
More than 175 balloon marriages have been closed so far.
More than 55-60 thousand bank accounts have been opened in the Sukna Samriti Yojana.
In Madhya Pradesh, a campaign to educate daughters at every household is being carried out in every village under the Har Ghar Dastaka Yojana.
Rajasthan has been running a campaign to encourage the students who are not able to finish their education through your Children's Apana Vidyalaya campaign.
New visions are also connected to this.
It has been changed as per local requirements.
You are actively associated with it.
I can know something from you.
What is happening in the world, the thoughts of the poor people of the village are reaching me.
I am very grateful for your cooperation.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Perhaps our ancestors have decorated our seasonal cycle, economic ethics and social systems in such a way that there is no restlessness in society.
In the last few days, we have celebrated a lot of festivals.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Shri Krishna was celebrated in the whole of India.
Shri Krishna is an individual who has created innovation, inspiration, innovation and innovation in every festival even after thousands of years that is the past of our imagination.
He can inspire and inspire him to solve any problem even today.
Any person who can find solutions to any existing problem from Shri Krishna's life.
On the other hand, despite such a great personality, it can also be said that Sarathy is willing to work in the battlefield.
Sometimes the mountains get up and sometimes the food streams.
Today, when I am talking to you, my heart is moving towards two fronts.
A Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan, others Charkadhar Mohan.
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan left the banks of the Yamuna river and settled in Dwarka city on the seashore of Gujarat and spent the last day of his life on the banks of Yamuna.
Thousands of years ago, Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan used his own intellect, duties, courage and thought to avoid the war.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The Porbandar seashore, which we called Kirti Mandir today, was born on 2nd October, 1869 at the smaller house of Kirti Mandir.
Mille Majdur who did not get the labourers served them.
He used to serve the poor, helpless, hungry and hungry people as one of the duties of life.
He served leprosy patients to inspire others to prove the misconception among the common man about leprosy.
Whenever any person is in danger, Mahatma Gandhi used to get rid of him.
He not only emphasized on service but also knew the importance of self-reliance in service.
The word 'Seba' is realised only if it is done with joy, then it becomes 'Seva Param Dharma'.
But Immediately, the real joy of 'Swant Sukhai', this feeling is also interrupted in service.
We can easily understand this if we look at Gandhiji's life.
In the life of Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and society, humanity and humanity were the only thought.
Whether it is African Phoenix farm or Tolstoy farm, Sarbarmati Ashram or Vardha, he was focused on community mobilization in social development.
I have got the opportunity to pay homage to him by visiting various workshops of Mahatma Gandhi, the privileged fortune of my life.
Gandhiji used to focus on the spirit of service as well as the organizational power.
We want to use both social service and social integration, community service and community mobilization.
Will you come and go, can we accept this
There is no obstacle that if he works in the minds of the people, in the minds of the people, in the minds of the people, in the minds of the entire self-dedication then it will be a unique joy.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
Several programmes, competitions, exhibitions etc. are being organized in the coming days.
I'll give you a wonderful news on this occasion.
Haripura panels were specially psychologists.
You remember that there was a meeting in Haripura in Gujarat, where the events of Subhas Chandra Bose's election were recorded in the history of the Presidential election.
These Art Panels have a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura session of 1937-38, the then Chairman of Mahatma Gandhi had invited Nandlal Bose to achieve Shantiniketan.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and showcase the Art Work Session.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose architecture enhances our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
This discussion of his artificial art has also given immortality to Nandlal Bose along with the Constitution.
Nandlal Bose reviewed the villages around Haripur and then constructed someart canvas about rural India.
This valuable artwork was discussed in Venice.
Once again, with the congratulatory congratulations of Gandhiji, I urge every Indian to make some pledges.
For the country, for the society, for the others, something needs to be done.
This will be our beauty, truth and true tribute to Bapu.
Children of Mother India, you must remember that for the last few years, we have launched the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign in the country for two weeks before 2nd October.
This year it will start from September 11.
This time we have to focus on plastics.
There is enthusiasm among all the people of the society about this campaign.
Many of my business brothers and sisters have put a placard in a portion of the shop where Khariddar has written that he should bring his bag immediately.
It can also save money and also showcase its partnership to protect the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when Bapu is celebrating 150 years, I will not only dedicate him to the Open Defecation Free India, but on that day the foundation stone of a new Jan Andolan against plastic will be laid.
I would like to urge all the communities of the society, every village, every village, every village and the residents of the city to join hands and pray that this year's Gandhi Jayanti should be celebrated in a way to free our mother India from plastic jungles.
On 2nd October, it's a special day.
It can be recycled.
It can also be used as fuel.
There is no need to see here for inspiration, no one can be inspiring than Gandhiji.
My dear countrymen, our culture is well-defined, a gem of knowledge.
Today, I want to touch an important issue by a culture-specific, it is a long time ago, but even today it has a huge importance.
The fools are called stones.
There is a lot of pride in our culture.
Even we have transformed the knowledge of foodgrains into science.
We all need sustainable and nutritious food, especially for women and infants.
People are fighting against malnutrition in a new and entertaining manner.
On the day of harvesting, Anganwadi sewers used to collect one fold from everyone.
These foodgrains were used to produce hot food for children and women.
Those who donate this will become a conscious citizen and a social servant.
After this, he dedicated himself to this goal and also became a soldier in this movement.
Liquid food is not solid food.
In Gujarat, in the year 2010, it was thought that in order to provide complementary food to the child in the event of Annaprashan, thereby bringing awareness about this in the minds of the people.
It is a very important initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
People in many states have celebrated their host meals.
If there is a birthday or a good day or a memorial day in a family, then the family members go to Anganwadi, school by making tasty, nutritious food, and the family members share their joys with their own children, which further enhances happiness.
Thus, a unique combination of service and joy can be achieved.
Friends, There are many such small things that our country can fight a fruitful fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to the lack of awareness, Nutrition has affected the families of both the poor and the rich.
POSHAN Abhiyan will be celebrated across the country in September.
You will definitely be connected to this campaign, collect information and add new ideas.
If you can save two persons from malnutrition, then our country will also be able to protect them from malnutrition.
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was confident that there would be a lot of questions on this matter and that would happen.
In the last few weeks, wherever I visited and met, the Man Vs Wild has been referenced.
With this episode, I have been united not only with India but also with the youth of all the places of the world, I have never thought that I will create such a place in the minds of the youth.
I have never thought of how many diverse things our country and the youth of the world are looking at.
I went to Bhutan last week.
That's what I feel.
Tiger, Lion, Life Creation, I am amazed that people can encourage how many things.
I am confident that people are now trying to know the steps taken in India regarding climate justice and clean environment.
Has it been educated later
Look, there's no secret in it.
Some people have questions about this, so I'm unveiling this mystery.
It's not a mystery.
I used to say Hindi but he listened to English, that's why talks were very easier and this was the work of technology.
After this show, I have noticed that many people are discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You also need to go to Nature Wildlife. Natural and Wildlife.
I said before, I'm saying again, you must go to the North East.
Your mind will spread.
On 15th August, I requested all of you from the Red Fort that in the next three years, 15 places of India should go to 15 places for 100 percent tourism, see, discuss, take family and spend some time there.
Your life will spread your thoughts.
Last month, it was fortunate to release the country's citizens.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, half of it was suffering.
The Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010 about the tigers.
A resolution was taken here by expressing concern over the reduction of tigers in the world.
This resolution was to double the number of tigers worldwide by 2022.
But this is New India, New India, where we have achieved our goals very fast.
We have doubled the number of tigers here by 2019.
Not only the number of tigers in India, but also the number of producted areas and community reserves has increased.
When I was publishing the statement of tigers, I also remembered the lion of Gir Aryan in Gujarat.
When I was in charge of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the lion's residence in the jungles of Gir was narrow.
Their number was decreasing.
We made a lot of efforts in Gir.
In 2007, I decided to appoint a female guard there.
Tourist industry can be improved through infrastructure management.
In terms of nature and wildlife, we only focus on conservation or conservation.
This time, we have to think about the compassion or compassion of our conservation.
My dear countrymen, can anybody forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1993
This young Indian saint has awakened the bright speech of the entire world among humanity.
While India was the porter of Karuna in the world, it was forced to find a new India in the words of great husband Vivekananda in the year 1893 of the World 11th September.
Come, let us build the power that Swami Vivekananda had seen in India.
On this occasion, we are going to launch Fit India Movement across the country.
We have to keep yourself fit, make the country fit.
This will be a very attractive campaign for the elderly and the elderly.
But today I am not detailed about this.
Wait on August 29.
Totally Dedicated Plastics for 2nd October.
With all our power, we will join the campaign to keep houses and plastic free around it.
I am confident that this campaign will create light on social media.
Let us start this campaign with a new zeal, a new resolve, a new energy.
I waited for your messages and advice.
Let us go through the mantra of joy and service.
Thank you very much, namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January 2017
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, it is a revival that makes the next generation aware of the responsibility of democracy and the responsibility of democracy.
But even today, the responsibility of the citizens and the rights of the citizens in our country is not that much of the discussions should be discussed as deep as it should be alternate as it should be discussed in a wide range.
I hope that at every level, at every moment, as much as the emphasis is given on the right.
On both the paths of rights and duties, Indias democracies can move forward.
Tomorrow 30th January, our revered Babapur Punya Tithi.
On 30th January, at 11 o'clock in the morning, we pay homage to the martyrs of the country.
In a united society, as a nation, on 30th January, at 11 o'clock, we should become a common habit.
On the eve of Democracy Day this time, I congratulate the brave soldiers who have been awarded the various brave index awards and their family members.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Saurya Chakra, the highest distinguished service medal, the Volunteer Service Medal.
I specially urge the youngsters to say that those who are very active in social media, can you do something
This time, those who have been honored with this honour, find the Internet and write praises to them and bring them to your friends.
When we know about their courage, valour and valour, we are astonished, we are proud and inspired.
On the one hand, when all of us were happy in the news of the festivals and inspirations of the 26th of January, our soldiers in Kashmir, who are committed to the security of the country, are their brave lives.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage.
My young friends, you are well aware that I am continuously listening to Mann Ki Baat.
January, February, March, April, all these months are the months of testing in every family.
Half or two children of the world are tested, but the entire family is under the pressure of the test.
A very different psychological ecosystem is seen in every world.
And I have always been convinced that I should come out of it and that is why I want to talk to the young friends in detail.
When I announced this thing, many teachers, parents, students sent me messages, asked me questions, suggested, written about pain, reference to tension and after seeing all this, I would like to share it with you today.
I sent a message on the telephone to create.
Anyway, the question has been raised, but this question is certainly your mind.
Exams should be a joyful experience.
There is a chance to say that the whole year has been laboured and it should be a festival of hope and zeal.
You're gonna have to decide that you're gonna think of it, please.
And when the festival takes place, the best in us comes out.
During the festival, the society is observing its strength.
During the test, there should be a festive atmosphere between the family and friends.
Please play the role of yourself in achieving this festival like a team, see how soon it changes.
It is true that from Kashmir to Kanyakumarika, Kutch Sekam Rupee, Arunachal from Amreli to Arunachal only three-four months of testing and testing.
It is our responsibility that every year these three-four months, in their own ways, in their own ways and in their own ways, we understand the environment of their own family and make it a festival.
And so I'll tell you "Smile More Score More".
And you have seen that when you are happy, laughing, you feel relaxed yourself, comfortably relax yourself.
A year ago, you remember what the teacher said in the Clasruum.
Sometimes it seems like that we can't look at the test.
I think it's a question of life and life.
The test means the evaluation that you've been studying throughout the year.
J.
The glorious example of Absolute Kalam.
He wanted to contribute to the aeroplane but was incomplete.
Remember, if he had been disappointed after this failure, he would have gone away from time to time, would India get such a big scientist to a President
This has not only increased competitiveness among children but also increased stress.
I want to know your views about the current situation and future of the education system.
Whatever you realize in your life is your wonderful knowledge, your skills, your confidence and determination.
You think he's a good doctor, that's what you need to go to him.
When you go to Namyukil when you are facing a big case, do you find his marksheet
You have seen his experience, his knowledge and success.
That is why sometimes the burden of this number is on our right path.
If you analyze, you will see that when you run for numbers, you will find the easier ways and pay attention to certain things, but if you are facing any problem outside this shrine, you will be unconscious.
And that is why sometimes it happens that we face failure in life even if we are very successful in testing.
Richa has produced one more thing, that is competition.
It's a very big psychological field.
In this regard, we can give examples of Chinese Tendulkar.
Friends, When you are going to test in every field of life, especially when you are going to test it, then take care of it, if you used to give two hours for the first time, have you been able to do it for three hours
It was too late to think of getting up in the past, can you get up at the right time
Shri S.
This way he helped me.
My mother couldn't pass the test of the tenth edition, but it was not possible for me to pass the CBSE test if she didn't get the help.
Beautiful-jee, you're right.
You have decided that the number of women among those who asked me is more.
If you learn to acknowledge, then there will be many problems there.
If it doesn't acknowledge, it will open the way to solve this problem.
Hope makes the way harder.
Acknowledging the current situation, there is a chance to open the path of solutions.
So accept what you have.
Look, you're going to be free of weight.
We talk about the weight of the school bags of small children, but sometimes I think that the aspirations of the parents are more than the school bags of the aspirational children.
Many years ago, because of heart attack, one of our well-known persons was in the hospital.
In fact, we go to the sick person and fear him about the disease.
I would like to tell the parents that sometimes we are like this with children.
Have you ever thought that on the day of the test, I will give you a chance of laughing and laughing for children.
You're gonna see the situation will change.
I've got a funny phone.
The gentleman didn't want to say his name.
If you hear the phone details, you can understand why he doesn't want to publish his name.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I have done something in my film that I can't tell my name.
I tried to fake once in my childhood.
I have lost a lot of time to think about what I will take for this thing.
If I spend that time for study, I could get the same number.
When I tried to duplicate, I was found and for me, many friends around me were distressed.
I'm telling you the same thing.
So where will you reach
Remember, you yourself are exploring your roads, creating real obstacles.
I have also seen that some people are using all their talents and utilising the creativity.
If I talk of sports at the time of testing, then everyone will say - how Prime Minister
Because the students who think about sports will be unconscious in studying.
Besides the brain, the rest of the body should have the right activity.
If you take a break for five minutes, you will feel that you're thinking too much.
I don't know if Sabbar likes this, but I'm talking about my confidence.
Once a folk song came to meet me.
He asked me how long did you sleep
I wanted to know, brother, are you a doctor
He said, "No-No, you don't say, it's a relationship with your throat to give it.
If you sleep properly, you're gonna get your lunch card.
I didn't think about my sleep and throat before.
He gave me a simple totoca.
Don't forget it, so your feelings will be satisfying me.
Otherwise, when the marksheet comes, the parents will be able to replace yourself and look at me.
If you sleep, you're gonna work.
Sports also play a very interesting role in keeping mind, intelligence, body smooth.
Go ahead with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, on 1st February this year, the Indian Coast Guard is celebrating forty years.
On this occasion, I convey my heartfelt gratitude to all the personnel and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their commitment to the nation.
Our Coast Guard has achieved its pride among the four best coast guards of the world in collaboration with 126 warriors and 62 airplanes built in our country.
Recognizing this commitment of the Coast Guard, the Coast Guard Force has always been prepared to protect the maritime boundaries of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard Force was planning to keep the seashore clean with their original activities and thousands of ordinary citizens were involved in this work.
We have a female pilot officer in the Coast Guard, and they are also observing the honor of the MNKI Hovercraft.
Spring king.
Sarasvati is worshipped in spring-panchami.
It is observed for the teachings, for the worship.
Not only education, but also a festival of inspiration for bravery.
This is the inspiration of Mere Rang Devasanti Chola.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of the country for this spring-panchami celebration.
My dear countrymen, the Akashwani has filled the Mann Ki Baat programme with a lot of narrative ideas.
Last month, after my address to Mann Ki Baat, the Mann Ki Baat has been heard in the regional language.
There is a great success in this effort.
The country has written a letter from far off places about this.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to them for this self-provoked effort of Akashwani.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
My best wishes to all of you on Christmas.
Today is the day of service, sacrifice and compassion in your life.
Rescue Jesus said, "Our recognition is not beneficial for the poor, but for them."
There is a very popular story about this.
Lord Jesus was standing at a temple treasury once.
Many rich people came and donated a lot.
Just after that, a poor widow came and paid two copper money.
If you look at it, you don't have any money as a pay of two copper.
Mahamati Madan Mohan Malavya ji was also the birth anniversary of Malavya ji, who awakened the resolve and confidence of the Indian people, had shown a new direction to the modern education system.
On his birth anniversary, I pay tributes to Bhav-Gabhi.
Just two days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Banaras.
He also laid the Foundation Stone of the Mohammati Madan Mohan Malavya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University.
Cancer Centre is being set up for this entire region, not only in the eastern region of Uttar Pradesh, but also the benefits of the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today, the birth anniversary of the Prime Minister of India, Bharat Ratna, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Our country is also headed by him in the field of Atomic Energy.
Atal ji had established an ideal in every role of leader, MP, minister or Prime Minister.
I bow down to Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for his health.
I am fortunate to work with Atal ji as a worker.
Several memories are looking in front of the eyes.
This morning when I tweeted, I shared an old video and how Atal ji's affection for a small worker was rained, it will be understood by the video.
As a big gift, all the countrymen are going to benefit the benefits of two schemes.
Everyone wants to understand and learn each other.
To encourage this thing, the Government of India is introducing an encouraging scheme of consumers and small businesses to make e-payment habits in order to enhance the strength of mobile banking.
Encouraging consumers is the name of Lucky Consumer Scheme and Business Scheme - DG-Dhan Bapar Yojana.
And on 25th December, as a gift to Christmas, the Drug system will deposit Rs. 1,000 each in the account of 15,000 people.
Today, not just for a day, this scheme will last for 100 days.
15,000 people will be awarded every day.
Millions of rupees will be provided to lakhs of families in 100 days, but it will be worthy of them who are Mobile Banking, e-Banking, Rupee Card, UPI.
Use the Digital Transaction Systems such as USSD etc.
DG-Dhan Bapar Yojana is for businessmen.
As traders themselves connect themselves with this scheme, the consumers will also join their business in cashlessness.
The traders will also be awarded separately and the number of awards will be thousands and thousands.
Those who can buy more than Rs. 3,000 will not have the facility of this award.
With the help of the USSD, the poor can sell and sell the money through the phones and the common phones and all of them will get the opportunity to get the awards of this scheme.
The people of rural areas will be able to win the award by failing through AEPS.
The children of ten or twelve classes in your family can teach you this method well.
It's easier. It's easier to send a Whites App from a mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know how to use technology in the country, how to make e-payment and how to make online payments.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased by 200 to 300 per cent.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to encourage this process.
Businessmen can easily guess how big this decision is.
Those traders who exchange digital transactions will be extended online payment systems instead of cash in their businesses.
I have learned that the Government of Assam has announced 10 deduction by providing per capita taxes and commercial licenses to digital.
5,000 will be awarded by the Government of India for at least two Digital Transactions from January-March 75 of its consumers.
If any village has been digitally transformed by 31st March, 2017, the Government has announced a award of Rs. 5 lakh through the Northern Panchayat for DG Transaction Scheme by the Government of Assam.
For the farmers, the Government of Assam has decided to award Rs. 5,000 to the first 10 farmers who are fully pursued to buy seeds and fertilizers under the Digital Kisan Shiromani Scheme.
I congratulate the Assam Government and congratulate all the States that have taken such initiatives.
It's funny that GNFC's fertilizer sales increased by 27 per cent compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, we have the importance of unorganized sectors in our daily life.
Most of these people are paid wages, money for work or pay cash, and we know that workers are also disbursed.
80 instead of Rs. 100, when Rs. 80 is given, 50 is given and many other facilities including health insurance such as insurance are disbursed.
But when cashless payments are being made, the money gets straight into the bank.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easier for us.
The country like India should move forward in this regard.
Our youngsters have improved a lot through start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity, our younger generation should take as much as possible with new ideas, with new technologies and new techniques.
We have to join the campaign to free the country from black money and financial corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge every Mann Ki Baat to people, send your suggestions, suggest your opinions and this time thousands of opinions have come to MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
The writers of the second group, who emphasized the importance of this thing, work for the good of the country, work for the good of the country, have given details of how new methods are being adopted against it.
Mr. Gurumani Keobal wrote in MyGov: This step is worthy of appreciation for taking money in black money.
As a citizen, we are very happy that we are cooperating in the fight against corruption.
We are playing the role of the army in the war against corruption, black money etc.
This feeling is coming up from all parts of the country.
We all can feel that.
In fact, this is the perfect element of Agent of Change.
I would like to thank everyone for another reason, not only for the difficulties they have tolerated, but also for those who are trying to distract the common man.
Not only this, some people have opened their mouths with their intellect, power, creativity and have brought the truth to the fore.
I salute this power of the people for centuries.
Jana Janardan is God's favour, the blessings of the people are God.
I thank the people of the country, salute the people of the country for taking part in this great zeal against corruption and black money.
I wanted that as the fight against corruption and black money is going on, there should be detailed discussions about political parties and political funding as well as if the Parliament was going on.
Those who are running political parties have a lot of discounts - they are wrong.
This government is the government of the masses.
On the other hand, I said on the first day-8, this is a wonderful fight.
A lot of news from the government is coming from the common citizens.
The success that we have achieved is basically because of the awareness of the people.
Can anybody imagine, how much of our conscious citizens are risking to open their faces
If you get your help, this fight will be very easy.
Those who send letters to me have a third team, who are in numbers.
They are saying that Modi ji does not stop, do not get tired, take as hard as possible.
We have to win this war, there is no question of tiredness.
We have brought it out and we have made the Benami Property Act very strictly.
This law will play its role in the coming days.
Our primary duty is that which is composite for patriotism and public interest.
In the past, India has established itself with pride in many sectors in the world economy.
According to the World Investment Report published by UNCTAD, India has reached third place in 2016-18, Top Prospective Host Economies.
India has improved 32 ranks in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
Likewise, the World Banks Logistics Performance Index-2016 envisaged 19 pages of Indias progress.
Likewise, some other reports are also showing rapid growth in India.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of Parliament has created warmth among the people of the country.
Their anger has been expressed in a variety of ways in the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their humility in this regard.
But sometimes sometimes there is a good thing in these things, the heart is filled with happiness.
There is also a good work in the House of Parliament which does not look at the people of the country.
Brothers and sisters, Today, I am happy to note that a bill has been taken in Parliament for the people with disabilities keeping in mind the goals of the government.
Our government is committed to persons with disabilities.
My Divyang brothers and sisters have added strength to this endeavour when Para has won four medals in Olympics.
This victory has not only increased the respect of the country, but has surprised the people of the country.
Like other citizens of the country, our Divyang brothers and sisters are an invaluable wealth and strength.
I am happy to note that due to the passage of this Act, there will be more employment opportunities for Divyangjans.
Reservation limit has been increased by four per cent in government jobs.
The Act provides special provisions for education, convenience and grievances of Divyangjan.
The Government has enacted this new legislation in accordance with the vision of the Nation.
A few such articles have been set up for persons with disabilities so that they can get the right opportunity and justice for the first time.
Thalassemia, Perkinsons and Bammans have also been linked to this.
My youngsters, in the last few weeks, there is such a news from the field of sports so that we all are proud.
It is natural for us to be proud of being an Indian.
The Indian Cricket team won 4-0 in England.
The performance of some young sportspersons is very commendable.
Tensions have not only done a good deal, but also led a good leadership.
My best wishes and best wishes to all of them.
Even after 15 years in Hakiki, there was a good news.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to these youngsters for their success.
This success is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey Party.
Last month, our women sportspersons have also achieved great success.
The Indian women hockey team won the Asian Games and the Indian women hockey team won the medal in 18 Asia Cups a few days ago.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the players of the cricket and the hockey team.
My dear countrymen, the year 2017 is a new year of hope and enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month we all celebrated Deepavali.
I went to the border of China for Diwali every year and for the time of Diwali.
I have celebrated Deepavali in the higher areas of the Himalayas with the jawans of ITBP.
Every year I go to the border, but this time Deepavali's experience is very different.
He was full of the feelings and not only did I see a wonderful response from the people of the country who had sent their best wishes to the soldiers.
When I was looking at these things, I'm surprised to know what he was supposed to be in a wonderful imagination.
But it is true that we don't feel like this during the Deepavali festival.
On the contrary, it seems that 125 crore Indians have joined the Deepavali festival.
Dear countrymen, the intimidation, happiness, love and joy that has been communicated among the soldiers of our armed forces should not be confined to Holi-Deepavali alone.
You all have to ask me, come to society, to make it a part of the nature and nature of the nation, to keep the soldiers of our Armed Forces in mind whenever there is any festival or festival or joy.
The strength of the Armed Forces will also increase by 125 crore when it is united with the Armed Forces.
A few days ago, the heads of all the villages of Jammu and Kashmir met me.
He was here to attend the Panchayat Convention of Jammu Kashmir.
Approximately 40-50 chiefs from various villages of Kashmir Valley.
For a long time, I had a chance to talk.
They came to know about some demands for the development and development of the village, but naturally, the recent situation of the Kashmir Valley, laws and future of the children came up.
A few days ago, the Board was examined in Kashmir and about 95 percent of the students were studying there.
I am clearly aware of the participation of students in this massive study of the Board that our children in Jammu Kashmir are committed to the development of a bright future through education.
I thank the students not only for their commitment but also for their parents, parents, teachers and all the village heads.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I asked the people to discuss Mann Ki Baat this time, I acknowledge that everybody has made a proposal.
Everybody wanted me to say something detailed about a note of five hundred thousand rupees.
On 8th November at night, I spoke of a great campaign for the nation for the proper development of the country.
Whenever I took this decision and told you that decision, it was clear that it was not a common decision, it was a difficult step.
At the time of declaring the decision, I warned that the effect of this proposal was so impressive that it would take at least 50 days to get out of it and then we could move towards normal conditions.
It is not easy to recover from the diseases that have spread over seventy years.
125 crore Indians have a deep faith in their own country that they are committed to universalization for the development of the country.
This is the reason why we are successful and the banks and the post office workers are working in adverse way.
And whenever they are talking about humanity, they are becoming more active.
When the local bank employees entered the ears, they immediately reached the house of the elderly brothers.
Not only this, he has arranged for his treatment.
I am overwhelmed by this incident.
They are taking legal measures to save their black money.
One request, do not play with the poor to meet their unjust interests.
Your injustice is linked to the records of the poor, after investigation, you are not, these poor people will be thrown away, they will suffer.
A very stringent regulation has been made to bring down the beneficiaries which are being implemented in all fields.
I am an ordinary citizen of the districts of Madhya Pradesh, Tahsil and Village Tirali.
It is very commendable for your five hundred thousand notes of bondmen.
My request is that through Mann Ki Baat, you have welcomed this initiative for the development of the nation even when the common man faces many problems.
Thanks to you, you said that the day is coming, but no one can think that you can take such a big step.
By shutting down the notes of five hundred and thousands, you have taught the corrupt black people right.
Every citizen of India does not have any longer than this.
I once again thank you for this.
When this kind of news is heard through media, public and government sources, the enthusiasm to work increases.
People had eaten there, and after two or four days, when they returned with the lunch, the bill was executed.
This is the strength of my country, wherein service is the main religion of perseverance and sacrifice.
The news that I used to meet during the election was spread all over the world.
Many countries of the world learned the use of tea-bathak languages.
But I didn't know that even if there could be a Cha-Vethak
I've been told that there was a marriage in Suryah on November 17.
In this marriage, only tea was organised for the invitees of the Parties, and no one was a feedback and breeding programme because due to the closure of the notes, there was a lack of cash in them.
They also supported this matter and established an example of Surya's Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar fighting against corruption and black money.
When there is a crisis, people find new ways and once I have seen an incident in Dhekiyajuli village of Assam in TV.
Village tea workers and these tea workers get weekly wages.
Neighbouring four women simultaneously bought and made payments for two thousand rupees.
You are well aware of the fact that even though the poor people have deposited the minimum wages two days ago.
Every municipality tax has only fifty percent of the taxes.
But after the announcement of the 8th day, there was a hindrance of hindrance in the old notes among the people.
You will be surprised to know that there has been a deposit of Rs. 3,500 crore in a week.
We are seeing such multiple exhibitions, which have the direct benefits to us.
Brothers and sisters, Village and Farmers are the spine of our economy.
I would like to specially congratulate the farmers of the country whenever we are adjusting every citizen due to this change in the economy.
I was calculating this year's crop seed marketing.
I am happy to see that the number of wheat, pulses or sesames has increased this year as compared to last year.
In all the opposites, the farmers have taken new paths.
Some important decisions have been taken from the Government, where priority is being given to the tribals and villages.
Small businessmen of our country have also created employment opportunities and also contributed to economic development.
I had taken an important decision in the budget last year for them and small shops of the village like the city's big malls will also be able to do business for twenty-five hours and no law will stop them.
Adequate initiatives have been taken to provide loans to them through Mudra Yojana.
Millions of rupees have been given to these small businesses through Mudra Yojana, because innumerable people who are connected to this small business have started commerce transactions of crores of rupees.
But due to this decision, all these small businesses are also complicated.
You also download the bank's app on your mobile phones.
POS Machine for Credit Cards and learn how to do business without notes.
You have seen that big malls are trading through technology.
In the same way, a small businessman can also deal with a simple User Friendly technologies.
There's no chance of absorption.
I urge you to contribute to the creation of Cashless Society.
You can facilitate the entire banking on the mobile phones for business promotion and continue the business without cash note transactions.
These are technological methods which are safe, safe and fast.
I want you not only to help in achieving this campaign but also give your leadership and I am confident that you can lead this change.
I am confident that you will be able to fulfil all the business transactions in the village through technology.
I want to tell the labour brothers and sisters that there is a lot of exploitation on you.
There is a wage in the paper and what is being given in the hands is another way.
Sometimes the entire labour was found and it was seen that there was a standing outside, it was to be divided and the labourers were forced to consider this absorption as a part of life.
Now, in the new system, we want the bank to have your accounts, deposit your wages in the financial bank so that the minimum wages are supplied.
You can get the full money, nobody can cut it.
Today, I specially want to talk to young friends.
We say that India is a country where 65 percent of the population is 65 years old.
You, the youth and the youth of my country, I know that my decision has been followed by you.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you will also contribute a lot to take this thing forward positively.
But brethren, you are my real soldier, real friend.
My brave youth, can you help me
Just stay with me, it won't work.
The idea of today's world is not of old generations.
It might be that even the elder brothers of your family don't know so much that Arma-Baba, Kaka-Kakima, Mama-Mami too don't know.
You know how App Kizins, Online Banking, Online Ticket Booking is.
This is a common thing for you and you also use it.
But today the country wants to do a great job, our dream is the Cashless Society.
It's right that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible.
But once we are able to formulate the Less-Cash Society, the goal of the Cashless Society will not be halfway.
And I know that you will never despise me because we all want to change the lives of the poor people of Hindustan.
You know how many opportunities are available for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking today.
Every bank provides online access.
Every bank has its own mobile app in Hindustan.
Every bankernies have a walt.
Walt's white mean E Manibag.
There's a lot of cardpaws.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have Rupee a y card which used to be used very less.
Since the 8th of the day, the poor people who have been using their plurals have increased by about three hundred.
As a pre-paid card is available on mobile phones, cards are available for bankruptcy expenditure.
And it's so simple that you send your Whats Appeburta.
Cashtransfer can also be found in common features.
Whether it is smoke or vegetables, milk, news papers, tea, chilly sellers, it can be used unnecessarily.
And I also emphasized the need to simplify this system.
All the banks are working together.
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation that is unaware of all these things.
And by you, I know very well, this great work is active.
The creative power of the younger generations in the face of the challenges, it seems as if this year's specialty was the birth of Geeta during the war period.
And today, when we have been transformed into such a big change, we are showing the basic creativity within you.
But my dear youngsters, I am telling you once again, I need your help in this task and my confidence, you and millions of youngsters of the country.
Do one thing, let us make a pledge from today that you will be a part of the Cashless Society.
Use the technologies that are online on your mobile phones.
Not only this, every day half an hour, at least one hour, at least ten families will understand how to use this technology, how to download their bank apps, how to spend the money in their accounts.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business.
You will automatically enter this cashless society, I have to expel the society from the square of this note, the campaign to liberate the country from corruption, the campaign to liberate the people from black money, the campaign to liberate people from corruption and problems.
I invite you to come, let us not just support, but we are the soldiers of this change and let us change.
We will take forward this fight to liberate the country from corruption and black money and there are many countries in the world where younger generations have changed the lifestyle of that nation and believe that the changes that come, the youth and the youth have made a revolution.
M-PESA has set up a mobile system, technologies, M-PESA has named and today Africa has taken the perspective of changing the entire business in this area.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, once again, I am telling you that you will take this campaign forward.
I would like to invite every school, college, university, NCC, NSS to work in a collective manner and individual level.
You have seen that the most popular composer of this time, Amitabh ji, is taking forward the Swachhta Abhiyan with hard work.
My dear countrymen, now through the Mann Ki Baat your thoughts, through your emotional papers, at MyGov, Narendra Modi App and connecting me with you.
Now, the Mann Ki Baat is published at the time of Bella Eleven but after the end of this broadcast, the system of listening to the regional language is starting.
I am grateful to the Akashwani and those who have taken this new initiative so that all the places where Hindi is popular, the people of the country will get the opportunity to join it.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, October 2016
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
In every corner of India, the festival of Deepavali is celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
India is such a country where for 365 days, there are festivals in any part of the country.
We have simplified the changes in the festivals in accordance with time and society by finishing a series of festivals.
But in all these things, we are capable of seeing that for the entire year in India, the journey of the festival, its intensity, its impact on every person - all these things are connected to one original mantra - moving the person towards the group.
An attempt is being made to spread individuals and individuals, to spread their limited thoughts from Gandhi Periasmaz to Periyasmaz.
And it can be done through this festival.
Sometimes in India, there is a festival of eating and drinking, but there is also a feeling of consciousness - the festival of any season and what should be eaten there.
What kind of crops are being produced by the farmers and how to connect the crops with the festivals, how to improve the disease-free, all the thoughts of our ancestors have been associated with the festival in a scientific manner.
Today, the world is thinking about the perspective.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
In India, this tradition of festivals strengthens the nature love and makes everybody more comfortable from child to child.
And science has proved that the changes in the water of the oceans in Purnima and Amavasya have affected the nature and its impact on the minds of the people.
That is, till now, our vacations have been associated with science and a tradition of singers.
Today, when we are celebrating Diwali festivals, as I said, every festival of us is academic, a sense of learning.
This festival of Deepavali gives the message of Tamasoma Digmaya to light from darkness.
The festival of Deepavali is a festival to liberate the lamp from the shadow of personal innocence and bring light from darkness.
We are well aware of the fact that the Swachhta Abhiyan is being carried out in every family during the Dhanir to Dhanir or Dhanirgarh to the poor at Deepawali.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
The government of any place in the world, the Parliament of the country, the ruler of the country, the people of the world are part of the Deepavali festival.
The Prime Minister of Singapore, through Instagram, shared the pictures of Diwali festivals with great pride in the world.
The 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament took photographs outside the Parliament after the Indian sari and the pictures were spread on the social networking site.
And all this has been done for Diwali.
On every road in Singapore, Diwali festival is celebrated in every area.
I mean to say that this festival of Diwali inspires everyone from the dark to the light of the world.
The news of the accidents, the news of the fire, the news of the deaths and the news of the deaths is very stressful.
And it is a discomfort that on the occasion of Diwali, Dr. Babu went to the house to celebrate Diwali with all the family on Diwali.
It is not empty for a long time, it has been going on for a long time from Govardhan Puja, Vyphota, Love-Punchmi to Kartik-Purnima.
This is a festival, which has been running for four days.
But there is a special feature - this festival gives a deep message to the society.
It is observed that all the people of the world worship the sun.
Chhat Puja is a festival where the sun is also worshipped.
There is a huge social message among them.
This is the time of expressing gratitude and thanks to all of you, especially to the people of the country on this occasion.
In the last few months, every soldier of our armed forces has sacrificed everything for our health care.
In my mind, the sacrifices, adolescence and hard work of the soldiers of the Armed Forces have a special impact.
And that is why I feel that this Diwali is to be dedicated to the name of the security forces.
I have called upon the people of the country to participate in an expedition called Sandesh to Solagers.
But today, I would like to say that there is no such person in India who has no unlimited love for the country's army, no pride for the army and the defence forces.
The way people have published it will give strength to the nation.
We cannot imagine the security forces, how much the message of you gives them strength.
Whether it is Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Navy, Air Force or Coast Guard, I can't mention the name of all, I can't mention what kind of hardships our soldiers have suffered.
When we are celebrating Diwali, somebody in the desert, somebody in the Himalayas, somebody is protecting the arts, somebody is protecting the airports and their responsibilities.
I really want to express my gratitude to the people of the country.
The artist who has been inspired by artists, has produced pictures, alpnas, cartoons, who have been composed of Sarasvati.
I can imagine how proud it is for the soldiers of my country.
The message of Sandesh to Solagers is very fond of the message.
Mr. Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has written a poem and I want to read it.
I celebrate the festival, sympatheticly, tell you today, this is possible that you say.
My dear countrymen, whose father's house and the house of the mother-in-law, a sister who worked in the army has sent me a telephone message.
Come on, let us hear what this soldier's family is saying: Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am saying Shivani Mohan.
The Sandesh to Solzer's Abhiyan that was launched on this Diwali has given a special boost to our fellow brothers.
My family is a soldier family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and mother-in-law were the army officer.
This Sandesh has inspired all the army officers who have been in the border and all the Armi Circle.
I want to say that the army officers and soldiers have to sacrifice their wives and the entire family.
My dear countrymen, it is true that not only the borders of the army personnel, but also the presence of their awareness in various fields of life.
Whether it is a natural calamity or an administrator, or administrator, or administrators, or administrators, or administrators, our brave soldiers are working in patriotism in all the fields of life, a thing that I want to tell you.
This discussion shows that some families are unable to build household toilets due to lack of money.
Developing Tagore has given strength to 57 families from their pockets to the Swachhta Abhiyan.
Similarly, Himachal Pradesh has become an open defecation free state.
No one goes there easily.
These youngsters walked on their shoulders with bricks, cements and other toilets and reached the jungle all day.
More than 1. 500 municipalities and corporations have been declared toilet-free in Gujarat.
Ten districts have also come to this list.
My dear countrymen, the government has made a lot of plans and if there is a better plan after the first plan then it has to be removed.
But normally no one looks at this matter.
There is no need for kerosene in all the houses that have gas connections and electricity in our country.
But who's in the government looking for Aarta
I have heard that seven or eight districts have been freed from kerosene.
I think the entire state will become very sighgiri kerosene-free.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide to all of us.
Whatever the country will do, how to do, how to do, all his mindsets are still considered as a miracle.
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you plan, you will remember the poor and weaker sections of the country and then think that what you are going to do will benefit these people.
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the problem.
Our ancient ideals, however, have to remove the distinction between boys and daughters in society.
This opportunity is an example of distinction in Indian society for our daughters.
The government has vaccination but even then lakhs of children are left out of the vaccination programme and become victims of diseases.
Mission Indradhanush is such a vaccination campaign, which includes children who are evacuated, which provides strength to children to get rid of dangerous diseases.
The village will be dark in the 21st century, it doesn't happen.
In order to free the village from blindness, the campaign to reach the village is progressing successfully.
The work is going on before the timeline.
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore families from smoke and this mission is also successfully moving forward.
Small businessmen, small shopkeepers, vegetables, milk sellers, minerals snatch on the loans made by the Mahajan.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account, all these are a successful campaign to get rid of the beneficiaries.
Financial benefits are being provided directly to the bank through Aadhaar cards.
It is time to get rid of the dalits in the lives of the common man.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2019, the great man of this country, who had made the original mantra of life and showed the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October, on the one hand, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the leading great personalities of the country's unity protector and the death anniversary of Smt.
Excellency, you know that 31st October is the birthday of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel is an individual who has given his life to the integrity of the country and I think he has succeeded in this regard.
He has collected all, and we can say the misfortune of the country or say that Gandhiji was killed on that day.
And we all know what happened in the country after his murder.
Excellency, I want to tell you how we can stop such a unfortunate accident.
Dear countrymen, this sadness is not one.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, History is a witness to this incident, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done the great task of uniting the country after Chanakya.
But it is also sorry that Sardar Saheb had sacrificed his life for unity, fought for unity, the main objective of the country's unity.
But on the birth anniversary of Sardar, thousands of Sardars, thousands of Sardars have been imprisoned after the killing of Smt. Gandhi.
The great men who have spent the entire life for unity, who have spent their lives on the birth anniversary of Sardar, this background of history hurts us all.
But in this crisis, the mantra of unity has to move forward.
Oneness in diversity is the power of the country.
There are many languages, nations, nutrients, foods and diversity but unity in these diversity is the strength of India.
Every generation has one responsibility, every government has the responsibility, the example of unity in the corner of the country and the policy of unity of the country.
We should protect ourselves and our nation from the spirit of discrimination.
Sardar Saheb has given us 'One India' and our responsibility is to create 'Shreshtha Bharat'.
The main mantra of unity enhances the creation of Best India.
At present, sometimes we have heard the name of 'Aamul'.
Today, the people of India and India are also aware of all the items of Amul.
But few people know that the visionary Sardar Saheb had imagined the creation of a unit of Cooperative Producers.
We have a vibrant example of what Sardar Saheb had done for the happiness and prosperity of the farmers of Khada district, which was known as the district in 1942.
I pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
On the Ekta Day of 31st October, wherever we are, I will remember Sardar Saheb and take a pledge of unity.
My dear countrymen, after this Diwali, Kartik Purnima is also a part of the festival of light.
Guru Nanak, his teachings and teachings, for the entire humanity, not only for India but also for the entire humanity.
This is the message of Guru Nanak.
Peace, unity and goodwill were his original mantra.
The campaign to free the society from discrimination, blind faith and mischief was in every word of Guru Nanak.
I salute Guru Nanak from the heart of the heart on the auspicious occasion.
My dear countrymen, once again, this Diwali, dedicated to the soldiers of the country, my best wishes to you all on this Diwali.
Your dream, your pledge will be successful in all ways.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, bow down to all of you.
A few days ago, we lost eight brave children of the country in an ambush attack in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay my tributes.
And that is why I will tell my countrymen what I said on that day I will repeat it that the culprits will be able to get rid of it.
My dear countrymen, there is faith in our army.
We are proud of our army.
Today, I want to talk to the people of Kashmir in a special way.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the country's powers.
And those who understand the truth, they have started walking on the path of peace by separating themselves from that power.
Every mother-in-law is fast and in full duties, all schools and colleges.
The farmers also want their fruits to reach all the markets of the country.
And in the last few days, the business has started to be smooth.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the roads of our progress and our development.
We have to cross new heights of development for the future generations.
I am confident that we will find solutions to all the problems together, find solutions and set up a better way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The responsibility of this administration is to protect the citizens of Kashmir.
In order to maintain law and order, the administration has to make some arrangements.
I will tell the lawmakers that we have the power, the power, the law, the rules and regulations, to maintain the law and order, to provide the lives of happiness and peace to the common man of Kashmir.
Sometimes the people of different thoughts are nurtured from what we think.
I have a chance to know a lot in the social media today.
From every corner of Hindustan, the feelings of the people of all kinds are enhanced by this.
A few days ago, Harsh Vardhan, a student of the eleventh class sent me a different kind of integrity.
He wrote: "After the war attack in Uri, I was very desperate.
I had a question of what I can do for the country's interest.
I promised that I will read three hours every day.
I will be a eligible citizen who can work in the country.
I am delighted to know that Bhai Harsh Vardhan, in this environment of adventure and in such a young age.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried to bring this country to the entire world.
And he inspired the common man through the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jaikishan and showed how to work for the country.
Red Bahadur Shastri ji showed the patriotism in the voices of bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to conduct a movement, when there was a need to create a frontline at the rapid pace of movement, then he used to use this rapidity to reorganize the constructive work within the society with great success.
All of us and the Armed Forces should take up their responsibility, the people of the administration should take up their duties and our countrymen should contribute to the spirit of this patriotism in some or the other constructive work then the country will reach new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T.
S.
Kartik has written to me through the Narendra Modi App that all the athletes went to Para Olympics have created history and their victory of Jai Humanspirit.
You are not just two, but an emotional attachment of every person of the country has been set up to the athletes participating in Para-Olympics.
Perhaps the exhibition of Para Olympics and our sportspersons, from the perspective of humanity and our vision towards the disabled has completely changed.
And I can never forget this thing of our winner Deepa owner.
When he got the medal, he said, through this medal, I lost the disability.
There is a lot of strength in this thing.
This time, in Para Olympics, three women and nineteen athletes from our country participated.
If we comparison to other sports games, physical ability, sports and sports, it becomes a big thing - the strength of will, the strength of resolve.
You will be happy to know and wonder that our sportspersons have won four medals by showing them the best and among them are two gold medals, one silver medal and one medal.
Twelve years later he brought the gold medal for the second time in spreading the Gold medal.
Twelve years of age grows a lot, once you get the gold medal, you get hungry.
But Debendra showed that the condition of the body, the old age never let him sleep and he won the gold medal again after twelve years.
He wasn't Divyang from birth.
Because of the electric shock, one of his hands left.
You should think that the person who took the first gold medal at the age of thirty years and the second gold medal at the age of thirty-five years has done so much in his life.
Mariyappan won a gold medal at Thangavelu Hijamp.
Thangavelu loses his right leg at the age of five.
Poverty couldn't hamper the path of his resolve.
He didn't come from the big city, he didn't come from the middle of the clean family.
In the life of twenty-two years, he has brought medals to the nation in the power of resolve despite physical problems.
There's a lot of victory in the name of the Athletespa owner.
Varun C.
He won medals in Bhati hijamp.
The medals of Para Olympics have been very important in our country, in our society, in our country and in our society, these medals have done a great job in changing our vision for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Very few people want to know how the Divyangjans have performed in Para Olympics this time.
A few days ago, there was an Olympic competition in the same place.
Not only that, I was surprised when I knew that the fourth among those who did not receive any medal, he was running in less time than those youngsters who had received the gold medal, I once again congratulate all of us.
In the coming days, India is moving towards making a good plan for Para-Olympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, I am surprising in the Navsari of Gujarat last week.
It was a very sensitive moment for me.
The Government of India organised a Mega Campaign for Divyangjans and that day many world records have been conducted.
There, I met a little girl Gaurishardul, she couldn't see her, she came from the far-flung forest of Dang district.
The Government of India has set up a World Record on the land of Nabasari, which is very important.
In eight hours, six hundred Divyangs, who did not hear, were able to provide machines to listen to them.
This has been placed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
The establishment of three world records by Divyangs in a day is a matter of pride for our countrymen.
Dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we started Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Bapu.
On that day, I said that cleanliness, cleanliness should be our nature, every citizen should be duties and should create a hate of hatred towards cleanliness.
On 2nd October, when two years are over, I can say with confidence that there has been an increase in awareness about cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore people.
I had said that we should move forward towards cleanliness and today we all can say that everybody has made an effort to move forward.
That is, the country has moved towards 125 crore cleanliness.
Therefore, the common man, the ruler, the government office or the roadghat, the bus-depot or railway station, the school-college, the Dharmastan, the poor from the child to the village, the farmers have contributed something to cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role in this regard.
I think we have to move far away.
If you are healthy, you will have to stop the habit of toilets in the open for the honor of the citizens, especially the mothers and sisters.
And that is why an expedition of Open Defecation Free (ODF) i. e.
I have recently visited Gujarat and officials have told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will reach the vision of ODF this year on 2nd October.
Congratulations to those who have already succeeded in this endeavour, I extend my best wishes to those who are trying to achieve success.
My condolences to the countrymen - for the honour of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children, we will free our country from this problem.
Come on, let's make a pledge to move forward.
I want to introduce a new scheme for the youth friends, especially those who are engaged in the use of technology today.
The Government of India has given a telephone number 1969 to know what the Cleanliness Mission is in your city.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
And in 2019, we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In this 1969, you will not only know the data of toilets in your city but also ask for new toilets.
You, especially the youth, take advantage of this.
The Government of India is also urging the corporate world to move forward and urge the professional youth to sponsor such as those who want to work for transparency.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat worker.
And that is why we have to move forward with the Swachhata Mission towards the Wasteto Compost.
The chemical fertilizers have been told to buy the composts from Waste.
The farmers who want to go to organic farming will provide necessary juice to them.
Those who revive their land health, those who have suffered from the use of chemical fertilizers, those who have suffered the most damaged due to the use of chemical fertilizers, they also need such fertilizers in some quantity.
Mr. Amitab Bachan has contributed to the Brand Ambassador.
I see that there is a constant new news about cleanliness.
One day, I published the news papers: Students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started a campaign of awareness about toilets.
The Government of India has also created a calendar of one year in its different parts.
Every Department is focusing on cleanliness for 15 days, especially on cleanliness.
My request to the common citizens is that if you are related to the work done by these government departments then you are also involved in this campaign.
This time, more than one lakh populations are about five hundred cities.
That is why there is a feeling among the people of every city that we are behind, we will do something better next time.
A competitive environment has been created in Swachhta.
I hope that all the citizens will participate in this campaign.
The birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on 2nd October, 2019.
Two years of Swachh Bharat Mission are being completed.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepavali, I urge you to buy some products from Khadi to Deepavali.
I will also urge every family to buy any material of Khadi, which will burn the lamp of Diwali in the house of the poor.
Though on 2nd October, however, as a citizen, can we participate in Swachhta Abhiyan somewhere or the other
You should work hard for at least two hours in the work of cleanliness and share a photo on the Narendra Modi App.
If there is a video, you can share it too.
Our collaborative efforts will give strength to this campaign and will get new speed.
Let us remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and do something good for the country.
Dear countrymen, there is a different joy in donating somebody in a recognition manner and a wonderful happiness.
In the past, I have also seen that when I had requested to leave the subsidy on gas, the way the common man has been associated with it is a very inspiring event in our national life.
Some of our youngsters, small organisations, the people of the corporate world, the students of the school and the members of some voluntary organisations, together, will celebrate the joy of living Week in many cities from 2nd October to 8th October.
Their expedition is aimed at connecting various food items, clothing etc. to the deprived people.
When I was in Gujarat, I have seen that our administrators would go to different families and collect the old games in their houses and give them all anganwaris in the poor towns.
It's really good to see the joy of those poor children who have got all these games.
I feel that the Jy of Giving Week will be celebrated in all the cities, the enthusiastic youth will have to inspire and help.
This festival is a festival of donation.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the youngsters who are doing the Academy.
Dear countrymen, today on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and the birth anniversary of Christmas is being celebrated.
How can the poorest of the poor get the benefits of development
He spoke of his economic thinking, both the words of work and water in all lands.
The country will celebrate his birth centenary as 'Grib Kalyan Year'.
Societies, governments and others have to focus on how development benefits benefits the poor and we can free the country from poverty.
My dear countrymen, I started the Mann Ki Baat on Vijaya Dashmi two years ago.
The common man of the country is always in my mind, which has always been published in Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the kind of enthusiasm and blessings you have given to this event on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat.
I also express my gratitude to Akashwani that they did not only preach the programme but also made every effort to reach the audience in all languages.
I am grateful to all those nations who have written, suggested, published the defects of the government system, Akashwani has created special programmes on all these letters and have set up a platform for solutions to the problems of the government employees at the function.
That is why Mann Ki Baat has not only been a speech of twenty-two minutes but has become a new medium of social transformation.
What else can be the reason for anybody's satisfaction
For this reason, I thank all those associated with it for making this institution a success.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi will start in the next week.
The spirit of Navratri or Durga Puja - Shakti must be worshipped by the unity of the society.
It will be a festival to connect together.
But that will be the means of real energy and that is why we can celebrate the victory festival together.
Come on, I pray for the power, we move forward with the mantra of unity.
Tomorrow, 29th August is the birthday of the magicians.
The National Sports Day is being celebrated across the country.
I would like to pay tribute to Dhyan Chand ji and also remind you of his contribution.
He played an important role in winning the Gold in the Olympic Hockey in India in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
We all know the name of Bradman.
He spoke of Dhyan Chand, He Scores Goals Like Runs.
Dhyan Chand ji was a sportsperson and a living mosquito of patriotism.
Once at a match in Kolkata, the opponents hit the hockey stick on the head of Dhan Chand ji.
It's just 10 minutes to end the match.
Dhyan Chand ji rolled three in that 10 minutes and said that I took a turn in the attack.
My dear countrymen, whenever it comes to Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of suggestions in MyGov portal or Narendra Modi App.
Smt. Ajit Singh wrote in the Narendra Modi App, Please tell us about his participation in the education and sports of the 'Man Ki Baat' and because he has won medals in the Reo Olympics and honored the country.
Smt. Shachin wrote to you, this time, in Mann Ki Baat, you will observe the work of Sindhi, Sakshi and Deepa.
One of them is from north India, one of them is from South India, one of the eastern India, and one of the other parts of India.
It seems that the girls of the country have taken the burden of shining the name of India.
In the My-Gov portal, we were able to make better results in Olympics.
He has written, Honble Modi, sir, I congratulate you for winning two medals in Rio first.
But in this regard, I want to attract your attention to this thing - what was the best for us to participate in other competitions
The answer is: 'Na'.
And nobody else can do it better than you.
Similarly, Shriman Satyaprakash Mehra wrote in the Narendra Modi App, "Mann Ki Baat, we need to focus on additional educational programmes, especially on children and youngsters.
Thousands of people have expressed such feelings.
It's no way of denying that we couldn't show the results as expected.
In some cases, it has also been said that our sportspersons could not reach the same level as they have shown the sports sector.
And in the medal list, we are only two medals.
However, even if we are well aware of it, it will be seen that India has shown a lot of vision for the first time.
Look, in the shooting, our innovation has occupied the fourth place and the medal for a very short time has become his post.
In Gymnastics, Deepa worker also performed a very good sports sportsperson and empowered the fourth place, he was awarded a very few medals.
But how can we forget that he was the first Indian lady in Gymnastics, who has eligible for Olympics and for the final phase of Olympics.
About such incidents have happened in the field of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna Juti.
This time we showed good results in athletics.
After 32 years, Lalitababar achieved the ability to play at the Track and Field Final Final Finals.
Boxing-Vikash Krishan Yadav reached the end of the quarter but didn't get medals.
Some of the sportspersons like Aditya Ashoka, Datu Bhoknal, Atanu Das are also among those who have performed very good sports.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot more.
If we do what we've done now, we might be disappointed again.
I have announced the formation of a committee.
We will go deeper and discuss how the games are being played in the world.
We'll make a roadmap for how we can do better.
We have planned the idea of results by 2020, 2024, 2028.
I would also urge the State Governments to create such a committee and see what we can do in the world of sports.
I would also urge the institutions associated with sports world to do brainstorming in a neutral manner.
The State Governments should look into their own consultations.
And I am confident that we will be able to make 125 crore Indians, 65 percent of the youngsters and the world of sports.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September, Teachers Day.
I have spent some time with the students on Teachers Day for a few years and spent time as a student.
You learn a lot from these little boys.
I have the same education day as on September 5.
But now I am going to the G-20 Summit, so I want to express my heartfelt feelings in Mann Kibat today.
As far as the mother's place is in life, the teacher's place is.
This time, after the Rio Olympics, the Pullela Gopichas are being discussed again and again.
He's a sportsperson right, but we found how good he was.
Today, I have seen Gopichand as an excellent trainer than a sportsperson.
On Teachers Day, I convey my heartfelt joy to Pullela Gopichand, his compassion, his soul towards sports and his disciples in his own way.
We always feel the role of teachers in all our lives.
5th September, the President of India, Dr.
Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji's birthday is celebrated as a Teachers Day.
He always tried to spend his day as a teacher, wherever he didn't reach his life.
Not only that, he always used to say, "Good teachers are the ones whose inner students never lose.
Dr. Radhakrishnan ji has lived this wonderful life even after being the President to spend the day as a teacher, to keep the student's identity alive.
I sometimes feel that I remember a lot of teachers because they were our ideals in our small villages.
Today, I am happy to say that my teacher, who is now a new year old, has come to his hand every month.
If there is a picture with your teachers, if there is a good thing with your teachers, if there is a message to your teachers then you must share it with everyone in the Narendra Modi App.
See, the teachings of teachers in the country are valuable to see them from the point of view of education.
My dear countrymen, the Ganesh Festival will be celebrated a few days later.
Lord Ganesha removes all the disturbances and we all want our country, our society, the family, all the persons and their lives.
Whenever we talk about Ganesh Festival, it is very natural to remember the name of Lokmanya Tilak.
Lokmanya Tilak had given a massive shape to the Ganesh festival.
Through Sarva Janaganesh Festival, he made this religious festival a festival of national consciousness, a festival of social reform.
Everything that affects the lives of the society should be discussed through the Common Ganesha Festival so that the society becomes new and new in the new energy through the disciplines organised at this time.
However, in the same way, the mantra of Lokmanya Tilak, Swaraj is our right to be the center of all discussions.
Today, not only Maharashtra but also Ganesh Festival is celebrated all over the country.
Specially youngsters have started preparations for the festival with enthusiasm.
Some people still looked forward to following the ideas that Lokmanya Tilak had started.
Discussions, composition competitions, composition competitions were organised on various issues.
Everything that affects our society is well demonstrated by the idol's beauty.
A campaign of public education is being organised in this massive Ganesh festival.
Lokmanya Tilak gave us this inspiring mantra of Swaraj Our birth rights.
But now we live in independent India.
We will now say that the Su-raj is our right.
We will move on the path of Su-raj, the Su-raj will be our main demand.
Wouldn't we move forward with this mantra
Come on, I urge you.
Our life is impossible without festivals, but we have to change it according to the times of time.
This time many have written to me about Ganesh Festival and Durga Puja.
They are particularly worried about the environment.
An individual named Shankar Narayan Prasad said to me, "Modiji, through the programme of Mann Ki Baat, everyone would know that they use the idol of Ganesh without using the plaster of Paris.
Conservation of the environment, rivers and floricultures and conservation of small animals living in water from pollution is a transformation of the service of God.
Lord Ganesha - Vighanhari.
So we will not create such statues.
I don't know how you're going to take these things, but I'm not talking alone, but many others are saying.
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
Durga Puja is still left for some time.
Now we have to determine that if the statues of our old families and those who built statues are built then they will get the opportunity to get the opportunity to build the idols of Pushkarini or the river.
And after the festival, they will be re-deserved and the environment will be protected.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Madar Teresa will be visiting Santa on September 4, 2019.
Mother Teresa had served the poor people of India for his entire life.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud of this Mother Teresa's 'Sant' recognition.
A delegation of officers headed by our Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj will be present on behalf of the Government of India to participate in the event on 4th September.
We can always learn from the saints, sages, Munis and gentlemen.
I hope we'll drink new things, keep learning and do good things.
Jan Shakti is considered as a form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the common man to the Ganga Safai Abhiyan for the sanitation of five State Governments.
Village chiefs present in Allahabad have taken a pledge to witness the Mother Ganga and they will now shut down the traditional habits of toilets in the open villages, they will not allow toilets to be constructed, they will fully participate in the Ganga sanitation campaign.
I thank all the ministers and ministers of the Government of India who have made this event possible.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of Panch who have taken an important step by connecting the common man in the Ganga Safai Abhiyan.
The boys and girls of seven to seventeen years of age have done this work.
This letter has an impression that the next day after getting the letter, when the children came to the school, some parents gave a letter to the school teachers, they would make the house toilets in a specific day.
A sixty-six-year-old girl Mallamma in Koppal district of Karnataka is sitting in Satyagraha against her family.
When the village chief Mohammad Shafi could know that Mallamma was supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to have toilets in a week.
Like Mallamma, the village head like Shakti and Mohammad Shafi is really remarkable.
This is the manpower that can create a way to solve the problem.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has now become a dream of all Indians.
It's a pledge to anyone.
And some Indians have chosen it as their goals.
The Government of India has thought and told all the people to make a film on Swachh Bharat for two or three minutes and send this shortfill to the Government of India.
Detailed details of this will be available on the website.
It will be a competitive and awarded to the winners of Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
I'm also telling TV channels, you're competing like this.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to deepen our relations with our neighbours, be it easier and vibrant.
A few days ago, an important incident took place, the President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, greeted the Akashwani Maitri Channel in Kolkata.
Now maybe many people think that the President will educate a radio channel
But it's not a normal radio channel, it's a very important step.
Our neighbor is Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are taking the same cultural traditions even today.
So, on the one hand, Akashwani Maitri and on the other, the Personal Better will be accompanied by various events and people from both sides of Bengal will enjoy the Akashwani festival.
Akashwani has contributed a great deal to peoples contacts.
The Honble President inaugurated it.
I want to thank Bangladesh as well as those who are associated with it.
I convey my best wishes to the friends of Akashwani and they are also playing their role in foreign policy.
This is the source of inspiration for the people of the country.
Just a few days ago, I got a letter that drew my mind.
Almost twenty-four-year-old mother, who was a retired teacher, wrote this letter.
If not, he used to forbid his name to be published in the letter, I wanted him to tell you all.
In the letter, he wrote, "When you requested to dispatch gas, I left the gas supplies, then I forgot it.
Our countrymen, you know, I tried to send a letter to those who left the gas subsidy, and any representative of myself is present and observed.
I'm trying to write more than one crore letters.
It is not important that this mother's emotion is not important here, the blessings of millions of mothers and sisters like her help in building the future of our country.
My dear countrymen, last year we were very worried about Khara, but in the month of August, we are suffering from continuous floods.
Several floods have occurred in some parts of the country.
The state government, the central government, the local administrative institutions, the social institutions and the citizens have done so much.
But there are reports in the floods that we need to remember.
Those who are trying to create restlessness in Kashmir by moving ahead with these small boys, they will have to respond to these innocent children.
My dear countrymen, our country is rich in multiple varieties.
Thank you very much.
This morning, I had the opportunity to interact with the young friends of Delhi.
I am confident that in the coming days, the atmosphere of excitement and excitement of every young man will spread all over the country.
We all knew that in a few days, the greatest sports sports sports event is being organized in the world.
Our ears will be descended again and again.
Today, the Government of India has organised a massive and beautiful run on Run for Rio, Khelo and Bachao, Sports and Flowers in Delhi.
I will do something to encourage our sportspersons wherever I stay in the coming days.
I will also be with you to enhance the enthusiasm of all these sportspersons as a citizen like 125 crore Indians.
Come, let us all fulfil the efforts of each sportsperson as much as possible in the coming days.
Today, when I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poem has been taught by Surjprakash Upadhyay, a poem of Premik-Panjav Central University.
There may be many more poets who have written a lot of poems, maybe somebody writes it in every language, but I want to enjoy the poem that Surajji has taught me.
A young man, Mr. Ankit, reminded me of the death anniversary of President Jubilee Kalam ji.
Last week, the nation and the world have paid tributes to Abdul Kalam ji on his death anniversary.
Whenever the name of 'Kalam-Ji' is named, then science, technology, missiles - the image of a powerful India in the future will be put in front of us.
And that is why your government is doing what to make the dreams of Kalam-Ji for the people
If we drive out research and discovery to the old technologies, then we will be out of the changing era of this world.
And that is why the government has taken several schemes for the development of new generations of science, technology, research and research.
So, I say, Let us aim to innovate.
And when I say "Let us aim to innovate" then AIM means Atal II.
If we have to entrepreneur the next generation then we have to connect with this work.
And that is why the Government of India has been making Atal Tinkering Labs.
We want that if there is a strong and improved laboratory, then for discovery, for innovation, for innovation, for enabling him to work, to reach him to a certain goal.
As there is a need to create new research centers, it is also necessary to improve the old research centers.
We have to find a technological solution to these problems everyday.
We have called upon the youngsters to look at the Atal Grand Challenges. If you look at any problem, find technology, research, discover it.
The Government of India is encouraging the innovators to be specially rewarded by discovering such innovative technologies to address our problems.
I am glad that people are very interested in this.
When we talked about Tinkering Lab, more than thirteen thousand schools were requested and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand academic and other institutions were requested.
The State Government and the Central Government are working together to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to help the flood affected people.
Even though there is some problem in the rainy season, the minds of every person gets dried up in the rainy season because our entire financial paintings are at the centre of rain and cultivation.
Sometimes there is such a disease that our lives have to be exploited.
But if we are cautious, be cautious, be cautious, be cautious to deal with diseases, it is easy to save it.
Try to keep an eye on cleanliness, be cautious, try to be safe.
Give special attention to the children and there is no misconception that Dengue happens only in the poorest of the country, it is not right.
Dengue spreads first in a happy, prosperous place.
You must see the vision of Doordarshan, but sometimes we are eager to use it.
Once again, my dear countrymen, I want to attract your vision.
Life is so vibrant, so that there is a race in it, so there is never a chance to think about it.
I'm sick, I think I'm sick soon, so I'm gonna get any antibiotics.
Immediately get rid of diseases, but my dear countrymen, the habit of eating antibiotics can cause serious problems.
Maybe you're relaxed for some time, but we should stop eating anti-biotics in consultation with the doctors.
The bacteria that are tuberculosis and malaria are rapidly changing ourselves so that the efficiency of medicine can be destroyed.
This is called anti-biotic registration in the medical language.
Anti-biotics should be used in accordance with the rules.
You're gonna take care of it.
When health is related, I want to add another thing to it.
The mothers who have pregnant mothers in our country, sometimes think about the loss of life.
Nearly three crore women are pregnant every year in our country, but some mothers die during childbirth, sometimes mothers die, sometimes children, sometimes mothers and children die.
It is true that the maternal mortality rate of maternal mortality has decreased in the last decade but even today it is not possible to save the lives of many pregnant mothers.
Nobody knows when there is deficiency of blood during pregnancy, infection during delivery, high blood pressure.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign since last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
As per the mission, all pregnant women will be tested at the Government Health Centre on 9th of every month.
Mother and children will be able to save their lives, and I would like to say to the physicians that you cannot pay for the poor mothers on the day of the month or on the ninth day.
Cannot my doctor brothers and sisters compete for the poor for twelve days a year
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is especially worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
During the war in Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also spoke of trees in the battlefield. We must guess the importance of thinking about trees in the battlefield.
In Geetha, Lord Krishna says, "Ashwath: Sarva Vrikshanang" means that I am ashwatha among all trees.
It has been stated that there is no such tree of Nasti Maulang Anushadhang which has no medicinal properties.
The tree that donates, crosses the tree like a plant.
That is why the parents who are talking about their welfare should plant good trees and feed like a child.
Whether it is our science-Geetha or the Sukracharya Policy or the Governance Parv of Mahabharata, there are some of the present generations who have shown this philosophy of science in their own way.
A few days ago, I feel the example of a daughter of Pune, Golden, who touched my heart.
On the occasion of Mahabharata's discipline, the trees also perform the responsibility of the child and the golden one has worked to meet the needs of the society, besides the responsibility of their parents.
The peasants of Narayanpur village of Punnar Taluk of Maharashtra have made their granddaughter marriage in a miraculous manner in Maruti Mahatra.
Other temples can also start the tradition of sapling trees instead of prasad in this rainy season.
Currently, in order to build houses in India, to make money, we have to import crores of rupees of wood from abroad.
If we plant such trees on the banks of our food, which will be used to build houses, then after 15-20 years you can get government permission and sell them.
This can be a new source of your income and save India from wood imports.
In the last few days, several states have been campaigning for the convenience of the rainy season and the Government of India has also passed a CAMPA Act, through this mission, more than 40,000 crore rupees are being sanctioned for tree plantation of states.
The State of Rajasthan has observed so many forest festivals and has taken a pledge to plant 25 lakh saplings.
It's not a small thing to plant fifty lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who meet the soil of Rajasthan will be able to understand how difficult it is.
Andhra Pradesh has also set a target to increase the greenery of the State by 50 by 2029.
The Green India Mission, which is being run by the Central Government, has been enhanced by the Railways.
There is a bright sustainability of forest festivals in Gujarat too.
This year, Gujarat has observed several schemes namely Amban, Ektavan, Shahid Van as Forest Festivals and has been campaigning for crores of plantations.
I can't mention all the states but it's worthy of appreciation.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa a few days ago.
And whenever there is a visit to foreign countries, there is a talk of diplomaticism, artistic talk, security, sometimes it is a signature.
But I had a pilgrimage to South Africa.
Whenever South Africa is considered, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever the words of non-violence, love, forgiveness come in this world, their faces grow in front of our eyes.
I went to Phoenix Setlement during my visit to South Africa, which is known as Sarvodaya, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
I was fortunate to visit that train from Peter Maritzburg station, but I would like to talk about this thing that this time I had the opportunity to meet those great people who have lived in their lives for equal rights and equality for all.
Even after doing so much penance, they didn't see any need to get anything else.
I could see the duties in Geetha as a result of the duties that have been mentioned.
I'll remember that meeting.
There can be no mantra of equality and equal opportunity for any society or any government.
You all think equally and you all think this is the path that leads us to a bright future.
We want a beautiful life, we want a good future of children. Everyone needs different needs.
Priority can be different, but the path is the same, and that path is development, equity, equal opportunity, equal feelings and feelings of all.
Come, let us feel proud for those Indians who have consolidated our lifestyle in South Africa.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to artist Varma, he told me about an incident.
Prime Minister, I am telling artist Burma from Bangalore.
A few days ago, I have read in a newspaper that a gentleman has lost his suicides in a magnificent and magnificent manner.
I have great condolences for her family as a woman.
I want to know what you are thinking about this tragic and e-mail.
Some people are crushed and snatched the money.
This new way of square through technology is spreading all over the world.
As technology has played a major role in economic development, people who use it have also fallen on the ground.
You've missed sometimes because they're so beautiful that you think they're real.
Your credit cards, debit cards and your bank accounts are empty through technology.
This is a new kind of smoke, digital smoke.
We have to stay away from this kind of mood, be careful, and in such a lie, the Message Allenzes will have to share it with friends and friends and warn them.
Our parliamentarians also bring people from their respective areas, meet me, talk to me and talk about them.
But recently I have a good experience.
Some of the students of Aligarh had come to me.
You've got a wonderful picture at the station.
Not only this, in the village, the waste of plastic bottles or oil canes washed out and made a virtual garden by planting soil.
In this way, they have given a new form to the railway station.
If you ever go to Aligarh, you will definitely see the station.
There's a feeling of newness.
This is an example of the change in the participation of the people.
Thanks to those who are doing this kind of work in the country, especially my friends of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, as soon as the rains come, the season of festivals starts in our country.
The fair will be held at various places in the coming days.
Festivals will be celebrated in the temples and the Aradhana place and you will also celebrate the festivals at home.
Rakhibandhan is an important festival.
Like last year, can you not offer the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of the country on the occasion of Rakhibandhan
My dear countrymen, there are many of us who have been born after independence.
I am the first Prime Minister of the country, who was born in an independent India year.
The 8th August was launched by the Bharatchado movement, which is 75 years of this year, and the 15th August is 70 years of independence.
We are enjoying the joy of freedom and feeling the pride of being an independent citizen.
The 75 years of the uit India Movement and 70 years of independence can inspire us to inspire us, give us new zeal and take a time to take a pledge to do something good for the country.
I hope you too will do something or the other in the inspiration of indigenous love.
And today, the technology has become so comfortable that you can give me something that you can easily and I invite you to remember the sacred life of the freedom fighters.
Everybody plans a lot during the holidays.
And this holiday is my season, so I think I'm tasted.
Sometimes it seems that if there is a chance to sleep in the afternoon, it's very good.
But this time the terrible heat has funny all around.
It is very natural for the people of the country to worry.
And there is a decrease in the storage of water collection.
That is why people are trying to do something about water conservation and sensitivity.
A few days ago, somebody was telling me that the village panchayats and the villages of the village of Hivede Bazar in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra have given great importance to the needs of water in the villages.
They have decided to quit all the crops that are required for water in the crops like walnuts, bananas etc.
It's not as easy to hear, it's not as easy to hear.
Everyone together made a big pledge
If a factory uses water and we talk about shutting down the factories because the use of water is increasing, then you know what will be the result.
It's true that I talked about a small village Hived, but there are many more villages like this.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the villagers for this kind of good work.
The people have told me that the Gorava Gram Panchayat of Devas district of Madhya Pradesh has tried to create agri reservoirs in their efforts.
They built about 27 agricultural reservoirs.
This led to an increase in the geographical water level, the water had risen very high.
I'm going to say they're more than rail.
The nature of the human beings is as much as the day is spent in the dangers, it seems that there is any harmony that has been cut off.
When the possibility of 110 percent of the rainy season has increased from 106 percent, it seems as if there is a very funny message of peace.
There is still a delay in rainy season, but the news of good rainfall has created a new zeal.
The farmers need soil, the crops are being used for the crops.
This time we can't take the soil from the village ponds and put it in the field
It will also enhance the fields and its water harvesting capabilities.
Sometimes in the cementhouse, sometimes the water can be stored by putting stones and soil filled with water in the empty settlement of the salt
The water level will grow, the water will come in our well.
So as much as possible water is required to be stored.
The water of rains and the water of the village will remain in the villages and if we do something for this purpose then it will be possible in the collective efforts.
So today, the water crisis is very good, it's going on, but we have time for the next month and a half.
Shriman Kumar Krishna asked "My Gov" whether the Ganga sanitation campaign will be possible in our lifetime
How many governments have come and how many schemes have been constructed.
And that is why it is very natural to raise this question in the minds of millions of people of the country like Brother Kumar Krishna.
The Ganga provides us the power to save ourselves.
Just as the Ganges flows, it also provides a new transformation to the economy of the country.
A Bhagirath brought us the Ganges, but it needs millions of bhagiraths to save it.
This work will never be possible without the help of the people.
We have to be a change agent for its cleanliness and cleanliness.
Several projects are underway by the government.
Efforts are being made to take full support from all the states that are on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to connect social and voluntary organisations with unity.
Several measures have been taken to prevent pollution through environmental pollution and factories.
Every day, there is a huge amount of drainage in the Ganges.
To clean these jungles, the trash skimmer starts cleaning the jungles with water at various places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc.
All local organisations have been informed and requested to continue the work and regularise the climate cleaning.
Earlier, I was told that there is a need to clean up the climate everyday from 3 to 11 tons.
So it's right that we are able to clean a large quantity of climate.
In the coming days, there will be plans to install Trash Skimmers in other places.
And it will help the people of the Ganges and the edges of Yamuna to understand soon, an effective plan has been set up to control the pollution of pulp and paper, distillery and Sugar Industri.
The waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste from the Pulp and Paper Industry Bablack Liquor factory.
All these things prove that we are moving towards the right goal and awareness has also increased.
People are also providing financial assistance to clean the Ganga, which is very well being done.
My dear countrymen, today 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Divas in India.
Today, the Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
And today, the Panchayati Raj system is working successfully as the sole of our democracy.
We have celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 24th April and today on 24th April, Panchayetti Raj Diwas.
This is a beautiful accomplishment, the most important part of our Constitution is our village.
He inspired to work towards connecting the village with the Constitution.
The 10 days of his birth anniversary from April 2014 to April 24 and April, was launched from Bipi Gramoday to Bharatodaya.
It is my privilege that on 14th April, I had the opportunity to visit Mahu on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and bow down to that holy place.
Today, on 24th, in Jharkhand, where most of the tribal brothers and sisters are present, I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Diwas.
I will once again interact with all the Panchayats of the country at 3:00 pm.
This expedition has done a greater awareness.
At the same time, so many events have been going on in such villages of India for ten days.
I congratulate all the state governments and the heads of the village for this.
You have used this opportunity to further strengthen the democracy for the development and prosperity of the village in a very basic and new way.
And that is why all of us will be able to get as much as possible as possible on the village yield.
Shermila called from Mumbai to Dharakur and spoke of her thoughts.
Prime Minister ji Namaskar
I'm talking to Sharmila Dharakur from Mumbai.
You have questions about my school and school education.
Like, there has been a need to amend the education sector for the past several years.
Today, if every family has a dream then it is the education of the child.
It's home and car.
This feeling for children's education in a country like India is a very powerful idea of teaching them.
I want to further enhance this idea of better education to the child and also bring more awareness about it.
Therefore, I would urge all parents and parents to discuss school programmes with children for a long time.
And if you feel something then go to school and talk to the teachers.
This surveillance will help in reducing a lot of education.
And it will definitely be possible in all partnerships.
Every government of our country has focused on education and has made efforts in their own ways.
And it is also true that for a long time, we have been focused on building academic institutions, expanding the education system, creating schools and colleges, appointing teachers, many children in school etc.
We have done a big job in promoting education.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
It should be our main goal of better education through the campaign of learning.
We needed a calculation of infrastructure.
Now it is necessary to assess the achievements of education.
Till now, how many teachers have come to school.
This mantra was enrolled all the time.
But now we have to focus on giving good and qualified education to the children who have come to school.
You have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to focus on good education.
It's okay, there's a lot to walk.
But if we decide 125 crore people then we can cross this path too.
Shermila ji is really keen to bring about a paradigm change in our thoughts.
You must have observed that this time in the budget some work has been done outside the traditional concept.
In the budget, ten government universities and ten unemployed Universities have been asked to get rid of government bonds and they need to know what is the challenge before them to be the best university.
The universities of India can compete with other universities in the world and also have to compete with them.
Along with this, education is as important as well as skills.
This is why technology will play a big role in education.
Technologies of far-reaching will make our education easier.
And I believe that we can understand the results in the future.
Honble Prime Minister, Namaskar
I'm telling Business Mina Karnwal.
Today, youngsters have an important role in sports along with writing.
They need to work together with the mindset, and the quality of good leadership so that their overall development can be achieved.
I want you to inspire a large number of youngsters and I want the government to encourage the NCC, NSS and India Scouts and Guide.
You have sent me so much proposals that before talking to you, I too look forward to talking to NCC, NSS, India Scouts and Guides.
I have organized a meeting with you for repeated requests and proposals in which the heads of NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guide, Red Cross, Nehru Youth Centres were present.
When I asked them when they met before this, they told me that after the independence of the country, they were present at this first meeting.
This time I've seen some of these things before them.
I told them why our youngsters will not take part in water harvesting.
Something like this has happened to them.
I see it as a brightening point in us.
You must have observed that the political situation in our country has reached such a stage that there have been a lot of talk about this in the last few elections.
Economists also spoke of reducing gas subsidies.
Some committees also proposed to reduce gas subsidies.
It's all experienced.
I said this thing but today I want to say that I am proud of my countrymen.
One crore families have voluntarily left the gas subsidies.
And this one crore family is not rich.
I see those who have left the subsidies, some of them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers - such a middle-class family.
However, it has been revealed that more than 80 percent of the families who have left the gas subsidies have left the gas subsidies in a written application from the distributor.
My dear countrymen, it's not a small thing.
If the government gives some leave to the tax, then the government will be appreciated in the weekly TV and newspapers.
In our country, the subsidies are considered to be the right to integrate.
But one crore families left subsidies.
First of all, I salute one crore families, congratulations and congratulations because they have forced political leaders to think in a new way.
The world's economists, whoever does this, have such financial implications, are also out of their concerns.
Sometimes I think that we declare that today there will be no ticket observer on this road.
We can test many such tests.
If you believe in the people of the country then you can get hopeful results.
Anyway, it's their own opinion.
It cannot be a government rule, but we can create such an environment.
And this environment is not being created by any political leader, one crore families of the country have created this environment.
All breaking news is bad.
Is there nothing good about us in this country of 125 crore population
Please change this situation.
He used to say this again and again.
A few days ago, I wrote a letter from the papers that on Monday, they will not print any desperate news.
And everyone wants the common man to get the right and good news.
It is true that if a well-known person thinks good words, selects good words, shows better effects than the impact of a well-known person.
Good news inspires us to work well.
It's okay, if you focus on good, the bad place will be reduced by you.
If the lamp burns, the darkness will be removed, it will be
Perhaps you know that this is why a website has been opened on behalf of the government - Transforming India is being published in this website.
This is not only the government but also the common man. You can send a good news to this portal.
You can also contribute to it.
Raviji, you gave good advice, but please don't worry about me.
We will all try to work together, try to talk about constructive things, try to reach the constructive goals.
The specialty of our country is Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela can be a center of attraction for tourists.
Very few people of the world know that for a long time, millions of people have come to the bank of the river.
This fair is completed in a peaceful environment.
In an institutional perspective, in the perspective of event management, it creates a very big pattern in the perspective of the common mans participation.
For the past few days, I have seen that some people are uploading pictures of the throne Kumbh.
I want the tourism departments of the Government of India and the State Government to organize a competition of these pictures.
And tell the guys to upload good photographs.
He said that we have focused on cleanliness and cleanliness should not only stop this campus but also from Kumbh Mela to bring the message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual fair but we can also create it as a social coordination.
I can also create a cultural field.
This can be an opportunity to reach the village in a true resolve and a true habit.
My dear countrymen, I will meet you once again on this auspicious day of Panchayat Raj and thank you all.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
For Mann Ki Baat, there is always a waiting for me and from your side.
I have seen this time too that a large number of letters, comments, phone calls have come in which many stories have been received, suggestions have been received and inspired.
I think you're testing me.
In spite of this, I want to share your words with you once again in the series of Mann Ki Baat.
You must remember that last time I had discussed a book of Premchand ji's stories and decided that if anybody read a book then some of the books will be shared with everyone through Narendra Modi App.
I have seen that a large number of people have shared information about various types of books.
I am happy to see that people have discussed books like science, technology, new innovation, history, culture, trade, self-interest.
Some people also advised me to talk about some more books.
But I have to acknowledge that now I don't have to read too much books.
But I think we should take this experience forward for the past one month.
I want this book's corners, readers and writers to be an active platform.
Friends, I feel that earlier I had touched this thing in Mann Ki Baat and water conservation, but today I feel that before I had said this thing was like touching the hearts of the common man.
I am feeling that recently this matter of water has given you the heart of the people of your country.
Several effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People are distributing information about traditional methods.
Media water conservation has started a lot of innovations.
This is not only preventing the destruction of land and crops but also bringing water to the fields.
You all will be happy to know that the beauty of the North-Eastern states of Meghalaya, the first state of the country, which has its own water policy or water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
There's a lot of fairs in this time.
We can use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all sections of the society come to this fair.
The news of water conservation is being organised here, dramatically dramatically and water conservation will be done along with the festival.
That is why today some children are keen to listen to you.
These are Nidhi Baiputu, Manish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Thanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tewari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aryanteesh Ganguli and Haritik Ala-Manda.
You will also be proud of what I will say about them and you will also be proud of it.
We all know that cancer is such a word that the whole world is scared.
It seems that death is standing in the corner.
But these ten children have not only destroyed fatal diseases like cancer in the war of life, but also have illuminated Indias name throughout the world with their achievements.
In the field of sports, we have often seen that a sportsperson was successful only after winning a medal or after winning a medal, but it is a rare experience where he has been contesting before taking part in the competition.
This month, World Children's Winners Games was organized in Moscow.
Sports like shooting, playing, swimming, race, football, table television are organised.
Our country has won medals in this 10th edition of awards.
Some of them won medals again.
My dear countrymen, I believe that you are also proud of Indias success in the remote space by reaching the sky.
Sanjay Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
Like Aurobindo Rao, many have written on Narendra Modi App and MyGov from different parts of the country and expressed interest in discussing Chandrayaan-2.
In fact, from the point of view of space research, the year 2019 is a good year for India.
Our scientists launched A-Sat in March and then this Chandrayaan-2.
It was not possible to discuss such a big and important news like A-Sat at the time of the election.
Within just 3 minutes, the A-Sat missile was capable of hitting a 300-kilometer long satellite.
India is the fourth country in the world, which has achieved success in this specific field.
Recently, on 22nd July, the entire country has seen how Chandrayaan-2 has been launched from Sriharikota to Chandrayaan-2.
The successful launch of Chandrayaan-2 has filled the country with pride, energy and happiness.
Chandrayaan-2 is a special kind of mission.
We should believe in our talent and ability.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is a complete Indian initiative.
It's an Indian in mind.
This is completely a Swadeshi Mission.
It is impossible to launch Chandrayaan-2 as our scientists have done all the technological problems in record time and day at night.
We also face such temporary setbacks in our lives.
But always keep in mind that we have the capability to cross this obstacle.
I am confident that this Chandrayaan-2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country towards science and innovation.
It is finally true that science is the path of development.
We are now waiting for the month of September when the moon land will descend two landers, Vikram and Rover.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell the students of my country about a charming competition and a competition for my young friends and invite the youngsters of the country to a quiz competition.
Asked about space and space, Indias space expedition, science and technology are the main subjects of this question: What to do if you launch the rocket, how to send a satellite to the room or what can we know from this satellite or satellite, A-Satki.
I would urge my young friends to participate in this quiz competition and make it more reminderable.
This will be a historic event in the lives of those artisans, but for this, you will have to take part in this uiz Competition and get the highest number.
My dear countrymen, you will be looking at one thing, our Mann Ki Baat has given momentum to the Swachhta Abhiyan.
The efforts that are being made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago has set up new standards of cleanliness in collaboration with everyone.
It is true that in the field of cleanliness, we have not yet achieved the ideal situation, but the way in which the Swachhta Abhiyan has been achieved in public places, it is the result of the will power of 130 crore people.
But we don't stop at all.
This movement has now stepped up from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching a news of Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who has come back to the country to serv the Mother of India, leaving the job of America.
A few days ago, he also took over the responsibility of making Delhi a clean and beautiful.
He started accompanied by his team from Lodi Garden's aesthetics.
Through Street Art, many areas of Delhi are being decorated with beautiful pictures.
From the walls of the Overbridge and the school, when he made the slums and slums beautiful, many people started moving forward and this way they started moving forward.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh Mela.
I came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team played a big role in this work.
There may be no words in color and lines, but the Ramadhanu that emerges with the help of them is more meaningful than thousands of words.
We are also observing this beauty among the Swachhta Abhiyans.
It is very important to create resources from waste to health in our lives.
I mean, we have to move from waste to make gold.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a fascinating statement at MyGov portal.
It was said that Mohammad, a resident of Sopian district of Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote, "Mann Ki Baat" is a pleasure to hear the programme.
I am happy to note that I have played an active role in organising the Community Mobilization Programme Back to Village in my State of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organised in June.
I think this event should be organised every three months.
With this, oneline monitoring of the event should be organized.
I think this was the first such event where people could talk directly to the government.
After reading the message that I have sent, I am interested in knowing about the Back to Village scheme so I learned about it in detail and then I felt that it should be told to the entire country.
This is a matter of fact that the people of Kashmir are interested in connecting with the roots of development of the country.
They also came to know whether the villagers are getting government services or not.
How can they increase their income
Some more things were added to make the program more attractive.
Children's Sports Competition was organised under Khelo India Scheme.
The event was distributed by Sports Equipment, Manrega Project Personnel Card, Tribal and Tribal Certificates.
Economy Academy Campaign was opened and stalls were set up by Government Departments such as agriculture, horticulture etc.
Thus, this event has become a development festival.
This was the festival of Jan Partnership and the festival of Jan Awareness.
The common man of Kashmir was embarrassed by opening his hearts on this development festival.
Any officer was so impressed by the warm welcome given to the villagers that they had stayed in the village during the next two days.
It is really a matter of great joy that the participation of a large number of people in the rural community in these areas and the participation of the schemes for their development.
This is a brilliant result of new ventures and new resolve.
Such programmes and partnerships of the people show that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir are interested in governance and the power of progress is always more than the power of the bombardment.
Those people who want to spread their hatred on the path of development and want to stop progress, they will never succeed in their humorous occasions or are obvious to the light of the day.
My dear countrymen, honored with the Gyanpeeth Awards, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandra, while describing the form of Shravanmas in his poem, said, "Hodiga, Agyedalgana, Aadrag Bhoomi Mangana, i. e.
Whenever it looks around us in this season, it seems as if the slums have drowned green silver.
This time, the festival of love of brothers and sisters is also celebrated by Rakhibandhan.
When you are talking about the month of Shravan, you will be happy to know that most of the pilgrims have participated in the last four years in this journey of Amarnath.
More than 3 lakh pilgrims have visited the sacred Amarnath cave from 1st July till now.
More than the pilgrimages who had participated in this 60-day journey in 2015, more than 28 pilgrims have joined this time.
For the success of the Amarnath Yatra, I would like to especially appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests.
Those who have come back after the journey have brought the warm memory of the people of the state with respect and hospitality.
All these things will help in improving tourism in the future.
I have been told that more than 8 lakh pilgrims have visited Kedarnath Dham in the last one and a half months since the day that four pilgrimages have started in Uttarakhand.
After the huge natural calamity in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there for the first time.
I urge you all to visit all those regions of the country where the beauty of this place is spectacular to be seen during the rainy season.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage.
I convey my best wishes to all of you that this magnificent and lively month of Shravan should communicate with you new energy, new hopes and new fervor.
On the other hand, it is a time when there is heavy rains in different parts of the country.
When we see TV, on one side floods all around the rain, water the same, traffic jam.
Another picture of rain where our farmers are enjoying birds, waterfalls are flowing, swimming in green silver, you will have to come out with your family.
The rain, freshness and happiness that is, the Freshness and Happiness come together and my best wishes that this rain will fill you all with everlasting happiness.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat, wherever I start, wherever I stay, it seems to be a very difficult task, but mostly a limit of time.
I'll be back after a month.
I convey my best wishes to Ester.
My young friends, all of you are busy testing.
Some guys may have been tested.
And some people are traversing because on the one hand tests, on the other T-20 cricket world cups.
Even today, you are waiting for a match between India and Australia.
Today, India will play with Australia and I convey my best wishes to the two teams.
But fortunately, in the last few decades, we have been continuously getting down.
Now, our place has fallen so low that we can't dare to talk about anything.
We can create a football-flower environment throughout this year.
In schools, colleges, in every corner of the country, our younger generation, our school boys sweat them.
There are very few people who go abroad, most of them go to their own state for 5 days or 7 days.
Some people go out of the state.
In the past, I told you to upload the photo from wherever you go.
We have to take this task forward.
Even now, you can do the same, but now write something with him - not just a phone.
And it is said that A Traveler without observation is a bird out wing.
If you're funny to see good things, you're gonna have to look at it.
And I'm lucky, I've got a lot of opportunity to travel.
When I was not the Chief Minister, I was not the Prime Minister, and I was a little older than you.
Well, there is no such district in India where I didn't have the opportunity to visit.
Tourism has an important role in creating life.
And now the youngsters of India are going to tourism with courage, they are going to communicate.
I think it's a very good example.
Our youth should be adventurous, wherever they have no feet, they should try to reach there.
I want to specially thank Coal India.
Then stay away.
When we look at the pictures of the people there, we think what is the benefit of going there.
And it's a matter of fact that the hands are black in the coal, that's why people get away from the mines.
But that coal mine will be a tourist center
And I am happy that till now more than 10,000 people have seen the eco-system mine tourism centers in the village of Sawan near Nagpur.
This place is giving you a chance to see new things.
I hope that if you go out on a holiday then you can do something about cleanliness.
Perhaps it's not very scientific, but it's happening.
Can't you even pay attention to the cleanliness of the tourism center as a tourist
I firmly believe that our young friends will definitely help in this regard.
Thus, there is a possibility of employment from tourism.
India is still behind tourism in comparison to other countries of the world.
But if we believe that if we have to strengthen our tourism then we can definitely attract the entire world.
We can take a large part of the world tourism to ourselves in this way.
And then it will be possible to provide employment to millions of youngsters of our country.
Whether it is the government or the organization or the society or the citizens, all these things must be done together.
Come on, we do something for that purpose.
My young friends, my holidays come and go. I don't like it.
You should also think about this.
Are you going to leave your holidays, important years of life and these important times
I'm talking about how many things you can think.
Can you take a pledge to add any more quality to your personality on this holiday
If you don't know swimming, you can pledge to learn to swim on holidays.
If you don't know the bicycle, learn to run a bike on holidays.
Do something to enhance your capabilities and skills to develop your personality during the holiday.
Not only the areas I talked about, but there is an opportunity to work out of it.
This will help you to see your personality, your confidence that will increase.
I'll talk about it among friends.
My Gov portal has received some suggestions for this time Mann Ki Baat.
Like, "My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
I am glad to do this thing and I am friendly with many birds.
I urge you to repeat this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to this child in the name of Abhi Chaturvedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
Abhi told me that he's doing this whole year and many birds have become his friends.
The great poet of Hindi Mahadevi Varma loved birds.
In his poem, he wrote, "Don't let you go away, get up and fill up, fill in the utensils, sweet water.
Come on, let us work on this thing of Mahadevi.
I convey my greetings and thanks to you. You have reminded me of a very important thing.
From Mysur, the artists have made a very sensitive issue for all of us.
He said that near our house, milk, news papers, postmans are coming.
Sometimes utensils, cloth sellers also go through that route.
Have we ever asked them to drink water in summer
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have heard a lot of digital India.
Some people feel that Digital India is the world of the youth of the city
If you download this app on a mobile phone then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weather.
There are many things like market conditions, pickery market conditions, how good crops are available during this period, which are suitable medicines, etc.
And if you put a question in front of them, they will answer them and understand you.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
This time is very important for the farmers before the beginning of agriculture.
Can't we find those old places once again, keep it clean so that more water can be stored
This time you might have seen that efforts have been made to make 5 lakh reservoirs and pools of agricultural land.
Under the Manrega scheme, the emphasis has been laid on creation of resources through water conservation.
You should make a plan to ensure that every drop of water is conserved in the villages and villages, every drop of the rains can be conserved.
You should join the various government schemes related to this, so that a mass movement can be created for the importance and conservation of water.
There are several villages in the country, there are many progressive farmers and many aware citizens who are doing this thing.
But we have to move forward.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to tell you another thing and a few days ago, the Government of India had organised a big agricultural fair.
I have seen how many modern technologies have come and how many changes have been brought about in agriculture.
But these technologies will now have to reach the farm of the farmers.
And now the farmers are also saying that the use of chemical fertilizers has to be reduced.
I convey my congratulations.
The excessive use of chemical fertilizers has made our earth sick.
But if good spices are given in more quantity, what do you like to eat
Whatever good fertilizers, the use of these fertilizers will be a cause of harm.
Every thing needs to be used.
It also reduces the cost, saves the money.
I am hopeful that I can complete this task with full care of the necessary tasks for water conservation.
The more the water will be saved, the more the farmers will benefit and the better life will be saved.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is World Health Day.
This year the theme of World Health Day is Beat Diabetes.
Diabetes is such a disease that brings out all other diseases.
Once someone has diabetes, many patients enter their homes and body.
According to statistics, in 2014, there were 6. 5 crore diabetes patients in our country.
Three percent deaths are diabetes.
Two types of diabetes - type 1 and type 2.
Type 1 is genetic, mother-father, there is a possibility of children.
And the reason for Type-II is madness, old age and excess weight.
The whole world is worried about diabetes, so on 7th, World Health Day theme is Diabetes.
We all know, the biggest reason for diabetes is our lifestyle.
The hard work is decreasing.
There's no name of sweat.
It's not walking.
We're playing online.
Nothing's happening in offline.
If you are interested in yoga, then practice yoga.
Otherwise, at least run away.
If every citizen of our country is healthy then our India will be healthy.
And now all the facilities are simplifying.
You must think about it.
On March 24, 2019, the TB Day was celebrated in the world.
When I was young, I was scared when I heard the name of TB.
But when Tuberculosis was the reason for death, we were afraid.
But now we don't care for TB.
The number of tuberculosis patients in our country is much higher than the world.
If tuberculosis has to be freed, we need proper treatment and all-round treatment.
If the treatment is left in the middle, there is a new problem.
Tuberculosis is such a disease that everybody knows, they can also advise to check up.
This means that it is a disease that needs a quick test.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this regard.
There are more than 13,500 microscopy centres and more than 4 lakh DOT providers.
Take proper treatment and continue to be treated until the disease is eradicated.
I will urge you, be it tuberculosis or diabetes.
India has to free from these diseases.
But this is not just the government, the doctors, the medicines - unless you come forward.
And that is why I urge the people of the country to come, curtail diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, there are many important days in the month of April, especially on 14th April, the birthday of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
His 125th Birth Anniversary is a part of the country.
His birthplace is Mahu of Panchtirth.
His studies in London, Diksha in Nagpur.
I am fortunate that this year will be the privilege of visiting the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
Babasaheb has given us a lot to be a responsible citizen of the country.
We can pay tributes to him as a responsible citizen of the country by following that path.
The festival is celebrated in different states and in different names.
Someone calls it 'new sympathy', some are 'Guri-Parba', some are 'Year Emperor' and some are 'Ugadi'.
You know, I had told you last time that my Mann Ki Baat programme will be heard on your mobile phones in about 20 languages.
You just have to call a missed call.
I am happy that about 35 lakh people have benefited from this facility.
You also write the number - 81908 81908.
I'm saying again, 81908 81908.
I'm glad to be associated with you.
I also want to be your friends about this.
I'm so worried about your children's test.
But if we change the process of thinking about the test, then perhaps we can be stressed.
I have said in my earlier Mann Ki Baat that you must send your experiences and advice to me through the Narendra Modi App.
In my Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to talk specially to parents, examiners and teachers.
I want to say something from what I have heard, what I read, what I have been told.
I know, the test is going to start in a few days.
How much do you get in the test
I want to say that you set some goals for yourself.
Don't take the pressure of someone else's expectation.
You must work hard, but try to touch this goal with a realistic and possible goal.
When I was playing cricket, I also had a lot of expectations.
Just as time has passed, people's hopes have increased.
It was very important for me to find a solution.
I thought that I would expect myself and determine my own goals.
And if I determine my own goals and achieve that goal then I can do something or the other good for the country.
And I have always tried to achieve this goal.
My goal was always on the point of view and that led to that goal itself slowly.
And I believe that God will give you good fruits.
Good luck
Don't fall under the pressure of hope.
You have to make your future.
You're gonna decide yourself.
Why don't I want to compete with others
Why don't I try to break all the records I have made
Friends, don't think the test is a number game.
Life should always be accomplished with a great objective - one should walk with a dream - one should be committed.
Whether we are walking on the right path or not, or we are moving properly, this test is his hiseb.
If there is some defect in fulfilling the hopes, you will not be despaired.
Build the mindset of RO-RO hard work and efforts.
Thousands of people wrote small things through a mobile phone in my app.
Shrey Gupta said that there is a healthy mind.
Girls and children, you should take care of your studies and also of your health, so that you can get your tests properly.
In the same way, our daily routine should be consistent with our dreams and resolves.
I am convinced of Shri Prabhakar Reddie, he specifically lying on time and asked him to take a revision in the morning.
Prabhakar Reddy ji said that he should reach the test centre with Admit Cards and other papers.
I couldn't say this because I'm sorry about sleeping.
And when I told you about sleep, don't think I'm talking about sleeping for tests.
Don't understand, I'm talking about sleeping to be stress free to give good tests at the time of examination.
Don't do that.
I don't believe you wouldn't do that.
It is very important to strengthen the foundations of discipline and success in life.
It is a strong foundation of life from the perspective of the system.
The stupid and disorder that works in the morning, the lunch work, it feels that the work was done.
That's why nothing is small.
Do it properly, do it.
Friends, I've seen sometimes two of the test takers.
One, those who have read, learned, and who have made a good deal, they consider it.
Secondly, there are other test takers who don't know any questions will come, what kind of questions will come, what can I solve.
I have seen these two types of tests in the way the question paper will not be difficult or easy.
There is a lot of synthesis of testing with the players.
When you're playing, you don't know what kind of rice you don't know.
If you are calm in work, eat properly, sleep enough, then you will see that your brain can remind the right answer to the right question.
Don't look very high, look at this as a challenge, can I think what I have learned for the entire year, can I answer these questions
So be calm, sleep well at night, not excessive self-reliance, but it doesn't even be negative.
I've seen, your test is better than your fears of testing.
So, be convinced and best wishes to you.
Vishwanathan Anand is really a very important thing.
His eyes don't rotate around.
We have heard that the incident of Arjun's life was just the eye of the bird.
In the same way, I have seen Viswanathan Anand, his entire attention is to the goal of playing and that is the reflection of his inner peace.
You don't talk to friends - you will be alone, you will be fond of yours, you will be fond of your books and you will never calm your mind.
That's why laughing and laughing with friends, smile and smile. See, your mind will be calm.
But if the water isn't calm, nothing can be seen.
I feel that no, if you take some rest, it would be better, so I have made a system myself.
Deep Breathing- Keep breathing deep.
Let's take a deep breath three times.
Sometimes it crosses 30, 40 or 50 seconds, but my mind becomes quiet that something is suitable to understand.
Maybe it's my experience, but it can help you.
Because most of the times we see, we're going to be tested, what's right - and what's wrong
If parents are educated at home, parents are teachers then they should write what I have written in the entire ditch.
We're stuck in it.
Friends, you don't do that.
Whatever happened at the time of testing is done.
Talk to the people of the family about the other things, remember the smile of the day you leave.
Remember that scene if you go somewhere with your mother and father.
Leaving the test, spend at least half an hour.
In the present context, he is trying to reach the world about the importance of 'Ramacharita Manas'.
The revered Murari Bapu gave some important suggestions to the teachers.
And acknowledge whatever the situation may be.
It is my experience that if we understand the situation then we can be mentally happy and happy.
Without any stress, it will certainly be successful if you are sitting in the joyful mind.
And if you don't succeed, it will not be sorry for failure.
We are grateful for the preachings of the worshipper Muraribapu for all of us.
Friends, I want to tell you another thing today.
My mobile app is Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, Shri Sushant Kumar, Shri K.
G.
But my friends, if I say that if you start yoga from tomorrow morning, then it will be done wrong to you.
But those who do yoga, do not do it today, do not do it.
If you are doing yoga, you must do it.
If you do not exercise yoga before the test, contact you with a person who can do yoga in two-five minutes.
Why don't you hurry for this
Prepare your entire day-long timings in such a way that if you get stuck in traffic jams, you can get a timely test.
Otherwise, such a situation creates anxiety among the minds.
And one thing, the kind of instruction that is in the question paper, it seems that the time will be lost when they read.
I have seen that sometimes after obtaining the question papers, it cannot be understood properly, but if the instructions are read properly, we can adjust ourselves to it and fix it.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Rao stressed on patience and gave him advice to all the examiners in a very short term.
That's what I say to my young friends.
Remember, we have a lot of opportunities in our country.
Whatever you need is a jealousy, self-sufficiency and absorption.
If you have all these qualities, you will be successful in all the tests and efforts.
This is the power of science and the power of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb, who has encouraged the children of the country, who have spoken of commitment, dedication and compassion, is self-consciousness, concentration and hard work.
Stay on, guys. Stay on.
If you're lying, you're afraid.
The bright future is waiting for you to do well.
My app is interesting diabetes shared their experiences of testing.
We all know about Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the electrical bulb, and we also read about him in our silvas.
But today, the light of that bulb is illuminating the lives of the people and that is why the seeds of success are found in failure.
He had no legitimate education in the mathematics, there was no special training.
Harry Potter is popular all over the world.
But it wasn't in the beginning.
How many problems he had to face - how many failures have come.
Today, the examination is not only the students but also the entire family, schools and teachers.
But without collaboration with parents and teachers, the situation of the students is not suitable.
A team of teachers, parents and senior students will be united and it will become easier for the tests to move forward with equitable thinking.
Shri Keshav Vaishnav wrote in my app, he complained, should not put more pressure on the students to get more numbers.
It's just to motivate to be ready.
They have to think that they're anxious.
Vijay Jindal wrote, don't put the burden of your hope on the children.
As much as possible, get their courage.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Friends, I am sure about one thing that especially my young friends want to say that our present lifestyle has changed a lot from our older generations.
We want to move forward with science at the same pace.
Friends, I am saying this because today's National Science Day.
Every year on February 8th, we celebrate as National Science Day.
In February 1928, Sir C.
Raman announced his discovery 'Raman Effect'.
He received the award for this discovery.
This is the reason why on February 8th, the National Science Day was celebrated.
The Gentleman of Science.
Scientific thinking, attraction towards science creates new ideas and on the other hand, it is not possible to create new ideas by removing science and technology.
I am C.
I bow down to Raman and urge you all to increase the interest of science.
Friends, Sometimes there is a lot of delay in achieving success and when success is achieved then the vision of seeing the world changes.
Perhaps because of being busy for the test, you might have not been able to get a lot of news, but I would like to remind the people of the country - you might have heard that there has been a very important discovery in the world in science.
Our scientists have been able to identify gravitational waves in their empowerment.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those scientists.
Our scientists will try to take this research forward in the future.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My countrymen, in the past, we have taken a significant decision.
There are only two places in the world.
India is the third.
I once again thank all the scientists and best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I am telling you that you will be able to hear my Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow by giving a mid-day call.
You will also be able to hear your mother tongue.
81908 81908, I am again saying - 81908 81908.
Friends, Your test is going on.
I'm gonna have to test tomorrow.
125 crore Indians will test me.
29 February - It's Lip Year.
But yes, you must have seen me and understand how healthy I am, how confident I am.
I will be tested tomorrow - Parashu will start with you.
If we all succeed, the whole country will succeed.
Thank you so much
This is my last Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
A few days ago, we took the Christmas, and now we are preparing to welcome the new year.
India is a diverse country.
There are various festivals here.
Sometimes it seems that India is such a country where the economy is associated with the festival.
Festivals are the means of employment for the poorest of the society.
I also convey my best wishes to all the nations of Christmas and convey my best wishes to the English New Year 2016.
2016, let me bring a lot of happiness for you all.
New joy, new hopes, new resolves will reach the heights of a new height.
Whether it is terrorism, global warming, natural calamities, humanity and other calamities, poverty should be free from everything.
You know that I use technology completely, I can know a lot of things.
Many go out to spend Christmas' holidays.
All other facilitations in the tourism sector have been taken care of but they have attracted a special attention to the tourist destinations where tourists visit and stay, we should have a special interest in keeping the tourist destinations clean.
As clean as our tourism centres are, India will be as shining in the world.
I welcome Mr. Saulesh Varkar's thinking and convey his message to the people of the country.
He has done a unique job that has been printed in the newspaper.
So I guess I'll get it to you.
Dilip Singh Malaviya, a resident of a small village, decided that if a village has added the necessary tools to build toilets, then he will make toilets free of cost.
He has worked hard till now in Bhojpura village and has constructed 100 toilets.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to Deep Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we can listen to desperate things about our country.
As a result of the collective efforts of all the people, our country is moving forward at a rapid pace.
125 crore people are moving together and taking the country forward.
We have been able to do all these things with improved education, new technologies and new biotechnological opportunities, bringing citizens under insurance protection, providing banking opportunities, a new reform in the era of global business and development of new businesses.
Credit services have been provided easierly through the Mudra Yojana for those who cannot reach the bank's dock.
When every Indian came to know that the entire world was attracted to Yoga exercise and when all the countries of the world were united through International Yoga Day, we believed that this is our country, the great India.
When such an emotion arises in our minds, there is a surprising picture in front of our eyes.
Cleanliness is listening to every household.
The participation of the people is also increasing.
But I believe that the media will reach all these villages and bring the hopes and aspirations of the people there to the entire country.
This is the biggest benefit that all the government workers associated with this scheme will be encouraged and happy to think that they have done something that will bring about a big change in the lives of the people of the village.
Is it not necessary to reach the farmers, the poor, the youth, the women and the people
No government has worked, no government has worked. There is no need to reach the news that they should not be distributed from what they can get.
They must be informed about their own rights.
We should be keen to bring the right and good messages to the people of the common man.
It's a kind of service.
I've made a little effort to do this like me.
I can't do everything alone, but I should do what I'm saying.
A common man can download the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone and contact me.
You can also join this effort like you.
I want to reach 125 crore people, it is not possible without your help.
Come, let us all come together and inspire the common man to reach the right to the right of the common man.
My dear youngsters, from the Red Fort on 15th August, I will start up to India, stand up.
Since then, in every department of the government, it has been revealed that India can become a Startup Capital.
There is a desire to have new ideas, new technologies, because the world cannot move forward without new innovation.
Every corner of India has talented youngsters, they need only opportunities.
We will urge all the State Governments to take forward this scheme.
On 16th January, I will meet you and discuss you in detail and wait for your advice.
Like me, there are millions of people in this country who are inspired by Swami Vivekananda.
The birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated as the National Youth Festival from 1945 to 12 January.
The festival is scheduled to be held from 12th January to 16th January at Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
Can you give me some advice about this youth festival
My special request to the youngsters is that through the Narendra Modi App you should send your advice directly.
I want to know and understand your mind.
This will be reflected in the National Youth Festival and I will give the right advice and information to my government.
Friends, I waited for you to believe in Youth Festival through the Narendra Modi App.
Ahmedabad, Gujarat's visually impaired teacher Dilip Chauhan has celebrated the Accessible India Day in his school.
I have received a very encouraging response from the students and inspired them to help physically disabled persons in the society.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dileepji, thank you very much.
You're working on this thing yourself.
You are well aware of these problems and you must have faced a lot of problems.
When there is a chance to meet such people in the society, I feel a lot of feelings.
As per our thinking, we share our vision towards their problems.
Some people are victims of anguish because of accidents.
Again, some people become victims of physical inequality in birth.
A lot of sounds are used for sensitization of these people and a lot of thoughts are being made about such words.
But it always feels that the use of such words is not right for these people, it is not respectable.
It's true that the word has a special significance.
This year, the Government of India has launched 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Since I was about to be present at that event, I was thinking about this thing.
During this time, I feel that God, who has given some incompleteness to the body or whose two organs do not work properly, we call him vulnerable, we know him as vulnerable.
But sometimes whenever I meet them, I can understand that there is some incompleteness in our eyes, but God has given him some extra power.
They are those people who have one or many organs that have divine power, which are not in the body of the common man like us.
I love this book.
My request to the people of the country, can we propagate the word 'Dibang' instead of the words disabled
On that day we started the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Physical and virtual - I will develop these two infrastructure and try to facilitate the persons with disabilities.
We need many things like schools, hospitals, government offices or bus terminus, railway stations or ramps, accessible parking and lifting systems, braille lips etc.
In our country, gas cylinders are provided.
The government has brought about some changes in this regard.
With the help of Jan Dhan Account, Aadhar Card etc, directly access to bank accounts of beneficiary beneficiary through the worlds largest Largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
I am proud to know that the largest Direct Benefit Scheme has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records to be successfully implemented.
This project, known as Pahal, has been successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore LPG connections have been benefitted through the Pahal scheme.
Today, through the MNREGA scheme, the employment of rural people has been ensured.
There was a lot of complaints about the funds of the scheme.
Now, in most of the places, this money is directly reaching the bank accounts of the workers.
There was a lot of problems for the students' scholarships. There was a lot of complaints.
This system has also been started for them and it will gradually move forward.
The bank accounts of the beneficiaries of various schemes have reached about Rs. 40,000 crore so far.
According to a general account, about 35 to 40 projects have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January Republic Day.
It is a matter of happiness that this year the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the form of the Constitution.
In order to discuss the Constitution in a special manner, the session of Parliament was decided for two days and it was a very good experience.
Equal emphasis has been laid on the duties of the Constitution.
There is a lot of duties when voting is done, but why don't you think of duties in everyday life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, on 26th January, what can we organise a competition of poems, debates and compositions on our primary duties in schools, colleges, villages, cities and social organizations
A new idea has come in my mind, before the 26th of January, you can write a poem in your mother tongue or in English or in Hindi.
I want to be aware of your thoughts.
I can send it to my portal.
I am very interested in learning about the responsibility of the youth of our country.
I want to make a small proposal.
On 26th January, when we are celebrating Republic Day, can we not make arrangements to clean and adorn the statues of the great men established in our cities by the citizens and school-college students
I'm not talking about the government system.
As a common citizen, we are so sad that we are enthusiastic and emotional about setting up the statues of these great men.
For society, can we not make it our normal habits for the country
On 26th January, let us all together look forward to the cleanliness of all these statues built in honor of the great men.
For this, the common man, the citizens have to come forward voluntarily.
My dear countrymen, once again I convey my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2016.
Thanks to all of you
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
With new zeal, business and employment will also start.
Preparations for Christmas have already begun.
Festival has a different significance in social life.
Sometimes the festival works to remove grief, sometimes it creates a new spirit.
But sometimes whenever there is a crisis in the festival then it becomes very painful.
The news of natural misery is coming from everywhere in the world.
There are reports of natural misery that have never heard or thought before.
I convey my condolences and condolences to all these families during these accidents.
The State Government is using all powers in the rescue and relief operations.
The central government also works on shoulders and shoulders.
At present, a team rescued by the Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I am confident that despite this danger, Tamil Nadu will continue to move forward at a rapid pace in the new yield and will play the role of the country to move forward.
When these dangers are happening around, the need to prevent them is also increasing.
Now his form has changed.
The Capacity Building has become very important in every sector.
The government, the educated society, the people and the smaller organisations have to work in a very scientific manner.
I am glad that this initiative was launched through a table-to-Exercise and Excellence Dialogue and Workshop in all the countries in Delhi.
You can understand the problems of the farmers as well as not only the biotechnology but also the problems of farmers.
It is our nature and generations to burn the roots of crops like this.
Initially, there was no idea of the losses that could be caused by it. Everyone is doing so.
Secondly, there was no training for any other methods.
When the impact of these dangers began to fall on the city, people started to move against it.
The sorrow that you have expressed is true.
First of all, we have to provide proper training to our farmer brothers and sisters and understand the truth.
The time will be saved by burning the roots of the crop, the hard work will be saved, the field will be prepared for the next crop but it is not correct.
The roots of crops are very valuable.
It's a bio-service itself.
We're burning the food and destroying it.
Not only this, if these roots are buried then it can also be animal husbandry.
The upper level of agriculture is burning to burn this root.
The surface of our land burns, which drives our fertilizer land to death.
And that's why we have to play an important role.
The roots of this crop should be mixed in the land and it will be alright.
If this biological fertilizer is used in that land, it is double profitable.
I once had the opportunity to talk to artists.
They spoke of a very good experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate bananas then they used to spend five thousand or ten thousand rupees per hectare to clean the roots of bananas.
If the tracker was not available to clean it, the roots would have fallen in the same way.
Some farmers used to burn these herbs into the land by pieces of six or eight inches.
Because there is so much water in the roots of the banana tree, where they are planted, if there is any tree, tree or crop, there is no need to separate water for three months.
The water that is in the roots of bananas keeps the crops alive.
The roots that used to spend their money beforehand, are now earning from them.
Our farmer brothers are not less than any scientist.
Dear countrymen, on 3rd December, the entire world will celebrate International Day of Conservation.
In the last Mann Ki Baat, I talked about organ donations.
I also talked about the helpline of NOTO for organ donations.
On 27th November, the National Angan Dan Divas was participated.
Various dignitaries from the society, including Chitravinetry Ravina Tandon, were present on the occasion.
Organ donation can save very valuable life.
It can bring immortality.
When a part of the body is transplanted from one body to another, it gets a new life and that person also gets a new life.
What's the greatest donation from this
A National Competition was organised through MyGov in Portal for setting up of Notor Logo, Donor Cards and Schlogans in this regard.
Physical and mental responsibilities have immense courage and ability.
But if we change our vision and change our mindset then they can become an inspiration for our life and work.
We're crying even if there's a small problem.
That is why they are the source of inspiration for us.
I appreciate the unprecedented efforts of the people to make their resolve, energy, the way they fight with their lives and their problems to become powerful.
I want to talk to Jabhad Ahmm today.
Some parts of kidneys, small intestines and intestines were explored in the terrorists.
There was a serious injury in the spine.
The ability to stand on his feet was finished like that of him, but the jealousy didn't mean.
The injury of the terrorists couldn't curtail him.
A innocent person was suffering from this kind of harm, suffering from a life-style crisis, while not expressing any anger or anguish, Jabhad Ahmed was compassionately confronting these dangers.
This is his greatest psychological determination and his life has served the society.
He has not always been empowered but has been employed for the last 20 years for the education of children.
He said that MA has been done in society and has been making a centuries of revolution as a messenger of complications as a social service and conscious citizen.
Can the people of every section of India not inspire the life of discrimination
I will recall his self-confidence on the life, penance and human service of Jabhad Ahmed on 3rd December.
I am talking about rationalism in time but I know that the lamp of inspiration that is burning in every corner of India shows life a new path.
On 3rd December, all such inspiring people will be remembered.
Our country is a big country.
There are many things in which people depend on the government.
The government and the government have a regulatory relationship with the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the Dalit, the afflicted, the disadvantaged, the disadvantaged.
Our country has a network of hope workers.
They do a lot of social work in India.
There's a lot of malaria.
A hope worker from this village, Yamuna Manising has decided that no one in his village will die in malaria.
Even if there is a small fever in the village then you can reach that house immediately.
He started treatment on the basis of the preliminary treatment he was taught.
Emphasised the use of pesticides in every house.
Just as you need to sleep and take care of your child, this hope worker has dedicated the entire village to save the entire village from mosquitoes and has prepared all the villages to prevent malaria.
How many Yamuna Monisings are like this.
There are millions of people around us.
We'll try to look at them with respect.
They can become a great power of the country.
We have always been a friend of happiness and sorrow.
I am honoured to all the aspirational workers through Yamuna Monising.
The first thing about Swachh Bharat, the second is the Adarsh Gram Parliament and the third is the health matter.
I urge you to see these e-books.
Not only yourself, but also others.
You might remember reading these things and adding something to this.
You must send me to the portal.
There are many such incidents that don't look at us but there is a real power for the society.
The right example is our greatest power.
I urge you to join us in the work of nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worried about climate change.
World warming, climate change is now the most vibrant and vibrant thing, which is being recognised as an indicator before doing every work.
The temperature of the world should not increase, it should be all concerned and responsible.
The first way to prevent temperature growth is energy conservation.
I once told you that the light of the road should be shut down in the full moon light for hours by shutting down the light of the road.
That moon's ray should be experienced.
Any friend sent me a link to such a scene and I had the opportunity to see him.
A woman named Nurjahana, Kanpur, who cannot be seen on TV that she has got a lot of opportunity to study, has done a thing that no one has thought about.
He is working to provide electricity to the poor by using solar energy from the sunlight.
He is fighting with darkness and brightening his name.
People take swords in the evening, go back to charge in the morning.
Approximately three to four rupees per day, but there is enough light in the house.
This nurjahan has been recharged by the solar power in the factory throughout the day.
Look, the world's big people are doing a lot for climate change, but it seems as if they can inspire all of them.
In such a way, the name of 'Jahan' is to illuminate the world.
This way he's spreading the light.
I would like to convey my best wishes to the Honble Prime Minister that he had started a scheme with Mudra Bank.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana is Fund the Unfunded.
The speed at which I want to move is yet to come.
Most of these helpers are trying to run a family with respect to those who have laboured themselves in their feet.
Abhima himself spoke of his enthusiasm.
I've got a lot of such news.
I'm just telling you, there's someone named Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He has received a loan of Rs 8. 5 lakh from the bank through Mudra Yojana.
And he started the carboard of physiotherapy.
I said during my Swachhta Abhiyan this campaign will create a new entrepreneur.
And the magicians have done this in the bullshit bullshit.
And there was a good business for his family.
But I want this scheme to be further promoted.
May all our banks be more sensitive and help small businesses.
In fact, the economy of the country is driven by them.
People employed in small work are the real power of the economy of the country.
We want to focus on it.
It's good, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I spoke of "Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat".
There are many such things that always create awareness in our society.
Internal Visilence in the Price of Liberty (Rashtrayam, Awareness, Expenditure) i. e.
In order to maintain the unity of the country, the river of internal security has to be flown.
I would like to make this 'Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat' a plan and I would like to agree with it at the portal.
I was told that there was a lot of suggestions.
I am told that those who take part in this will be given the certificate.
Large awards have also been announced.
I believe your advice will be very useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is starting.
This time it is a very good time for eating and dressing and vegetation.
But I'll say, exercise.
At least one hour, every family should work together and look at what kind of awareness will increase, and how fresh it will take all day.
Let's get a good habit in a good weather.
Jai Hind
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
This is the twelfth edition of Mann Ki Baat and a year has passed to see it.
I was fortunate to talk about Mann Ki Baat for the first time on 3rd October last year.
Democracy has an overwhelming dignity of manpower.
I have an original concern in my life and that is why I have an unprecedented faith in my manpower.
Whatever Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what I have understood, what I have experienced, I can say that the power of the people is much more than that.
Our ancestors say that they are part of God.
I can say that the feeling of Mann Ki Baat is that our ancestors have a strong power and a great truth because I have experienced it.
I have sought advice from everyone for Mann Ki Baat, but every time I have been able to see or understand two suggestions.
But lakhs of people are actively consulting me.
It's a funny power.
Similarly, Mann Ki Baat has become a medium of expressing its own thinking of the society.
I once talked about Selfi with Daughter.
And that's why the whole world was surprised.
But the pictures of Daughter have come from all over the world and the daughters have glorified it.
And when they had selfied Daughter, they have not only glorified their daughters but have also awakened a resolution within themselves.
And whenever the others are looking at these selfies, they feel that they also have to abandon the grief of the daughters.
People from every corner of India have sent such pictures in lakhs of numbers.
The tourism department of the State Government or the Central Government cannot even think that there are such invaluable resources in our country.
It's slightly like we're buying salt.
Today, I am very happy to note that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year.
And it wasn't for any government advertisement.
Crores of rupees have not been spent for this.
This was a belief of manpower, a feeling.
I requested the financially consistent people to extract the subsidy for gas cylinders.
In a TV channel, I had seen that a widow woman, she is standing on the lines of retiring teachers, gas cylinders.
The middle-class, lower-middle families of the society, who are very discomfortable, have also abandoned the convenience of discount.
Isn't it an unprecedented revolution
He will work as a good component for the welfare of the society as the government works with the people.
The people of my country are trying to consolidate themselves for the welfare of the country by focusing on every small thing.
On this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I thought of taking a new effort.
Be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup or Kanyakumarika from Kashmir, India has no place where people did not call.
It's my own comfort.
The people of all ages have called.
I heard some phones myself and I liked it.
My entire government will work as per your advice.
They gave full positive suggestions.
Look at the work, the common man of the country takes so much positive thinking and this is a huge resources for the country.
There was a serious complaint on one or two phones.
And one thing has come to us, specially capable persons, especially those who are visually visually impaired.
One of the reasons is that since they don't have the privilege of watching TV, they must listen to the radio.
From this, I understand how important the radio is for the blind persons.
I have got a new direction from these phones and these phones are very important for further sensitivity of the government.
Pawan Acharya gave me a suggestion from Alwar in Rajasthan.
I think everyone should listen to it and the people of the entire country should accept it.
Listen to what he wants to say, "My name is Pawan Acharya, I am in Alwar in Rajasthan.
Pawan, I believe that this suggestion will spread to the corner of India in the wind speed.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army.
I have spent time with the Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force and Navy personnel who are protected by water, land and airways.
What wasn't there - the entire history was alive.
The pride and valour of the war, the courage and sacrifices of our armed forces can be achieved through this exhibition because we didn't get any picture or videography at that time.
The battle of Haji Pir or the battle of the Northern Country, the sight of the Chamindar fight or the Haji Pir Pass win, whichever is seen, is a thrilling experience and our army is proud of the soldiers.
The exhibition will continue for a few more days.
My request is to see this exhibition with your family and not hurry like me.
Look at the strength of democracy, a younger son is instructing the Prime Minister, but that younger boy has forgotten to say his name soon.
Cleanliness should be natural and there should be appropriate arrangements for it.
I have to hear a lot of things that Modi ji had spoken a big deal about cleanliness, but what is happening till the end
On the other hand, on the one hand Parliament and on the other hand children of the country are talking about cleanliness and on the other hand what can happen to the country
This movement that has been created for cleanliness, the environment of hatred towards waste, the awareness of cleanliness will also force this government to work for a Swachh Bharat.
Local Autonomous Organisations - Panchayats, City Panchayats, Pur Nigams, Mahanagar Puri Nigams or States or Centre - each organisation will have to work on this matter.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will move on the right path to achieve the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Mahatma Gandhi once said that if I want to like one of these two, then I will first like cleanliness, after independence.
Gandhiji was more important than freedom.
Let us all follow Mahatma Gandhi and take some steps to fulfill his wishes.
He wanted to know about the birth centenary of Deendayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the philosophy of the great men is a source of inspiration.
At any time, the historical point of view is associated with the name of a great man.
In the coming days, we will remember all these great men, we will reach every household and try to teach something or the other.
I would especially like to mention the 2nd October that day, the birth anniversary of the revered Mahatma Gandhi, I had also said last year that you have different fashion clothes, different kinds of fabrics and other things, but Khadi should be a special place.
And that's why on this Diwali, we will certainly place in our house, we will wear dresses.
And see, the sale of dresses has doubled last time.
How poor people have benefited.
The work that the government cannot spend lakhs of rupees through advertising has been made possible with the small help of you.
This is the Jan Shakti and that is why I urge you to work again.
Dear countrymen, one thing has filled my heart with joy.
I wish you too to be a part of this joy.
I went to Kolkata in May and some of the family of Subhas Chandra Bose came to meet me.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose made all the arrangements.
The family members of Subhas Babu had a chance to spend some time in the excuse meal.
You can imagine how pleasant it is for me.
Perhaps they all came together to the Prime Minister's residence for the first time.
But the most happy thing for me is that the Prime Minister's residence never had the opportunity to host such a guest in the month of October.
More than 50 members of the family of Subhas Babu, who live in different countries, are all coming here.
He has sent a message to me in Vargavi Kandre, and I think he's going to be a leader, or a leader.
He said, "My name is Bharatvi Kande.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to make the youth aware of the registration of voters, which will increase the contribution of youth in the coming days and will contribute significantly to the formation and management of the government in the future.
Thank you, "Bhargavi has said that the name of the voter list is registered and voter donation.
The destiny of every voter in democracy is the fate of the country and this awareness is increasing slowly.
Even a few years ago, we have seen that the Election Commission was conducting the election process only but there has been a major change in the last few years.
Today, our Election Commission is not just an electorate, a supporter, a voter friendly and all their thoughts are the centre of all the schemes.
But only the Election Commission will work, it's not going to happen.
I hope that if the youngsters of the country do not register their names in the list of voters, they will be registered and will definitely vote.
On the day of the election, I say, "Voting in elections, then drinking water".
It's a sacred duty, everyone should do it.
Yesterday, I came to Kashi.
I have met many people, many events have been held, many have met, but I want to tell you about two boys.
But he's interested in psychology research at such a young age.
I think he learns a lot of studies, internet surfing, new uses of science.
He was talking about how to get rid of the railway accidents, how to reduce the cost of energy, how to experience the robot.
That's a small girl called Sonmpetel.
Sonam is nine years old.
I am surprising that the whole Gita is the girl's fame, but the most important thing is that when I asked her, she was praising her as a shloka, explaining the world, listening to Hindi as well.
I asked him to ask his father, the girl has been doing this thing since the age of five.
I asked him about his studies, did he just read Geetha or do anything else
The gentleman said, "No Sonam once ended in the evening, and if history is read, it's in the evening.
They're wonderful about the girl, that's just all that can be done in the family.
I'm really impressed.
Sometimes the children are happy to have a celebrity, there was nothing in Sonam.
I think God has given it a special power.
Sandeep ji, what else will you do with me
I have to make a lot of efforts to make this event once a month.
Sometimes our aeroplane friends have to wait for me for half an hour.
One year of Mann Ki Baat was completed.
You know how much was the use of Subhas Babu Radio
He started his radio broadcast from Germany, and through radio, he used to tell the people of India about the movement of freedom.
He launched Azad Hind Radio with a weekly news bulletin.
This radio was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Pusu, Persian etc.
Listening to you, think for you, think about your proposals, and it opens the directions of my thinking, which reaches you through Akashvani.
I say, but it's really your point, and I'm happy with it.
Once again, I have got the opportunity to visit Mann Ki Baat.
The people of Southern India are now celebrating Onam Festival and the whole country has celebrated the sacred Rakhibandhan Festival yesterday.
The Government of India has launched several new schemes including social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a short span of time many people have come under this scheme.
I had a small request that our sisters should be given such a Suraksha Yojana in the Raksha Bandhan festival.
I have got a lot of information from which I understand that since the beginning of the scheme, only 11 crore families have been associated with it.
I am also told that about half of the benefits of this have been received by the mothers and sisters.
Today, when I am talking to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken a year ago.
A lot of questions were raised, the work that didn't happen in sixty years, would it take such a short time
This has helped the youth of the country.
You will be happy to know that in this year, one lakh 31,000 Financial Literacy Campaigns have been opened to gather the banking sector, the economy and the lower classes.
This belief is that the poor people who can get money from the bank.
I once again thank all those associated with this, and all the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters who have opened the bank accounts, I urge them not to break this relationship with the bank.
This bank is yours, you won't leave it anymore.
I've brought it to you, now you have the responsibility to hold it.
We have to keep our accounts in the bank.
I have full faith, you're gonna keep it.
A few days ago, the violent incidents of Gujarat had destroyed the entire country.
And it is natural that if anything happens in the states of Gandhi and Sardar Patel then the whole country is sorry and sorry.
But in a short span of time, my brothers and sisters have taken care of the situation.
They have played an active role in the prevention of uncomfortable situations and the Gujarat has taken the path of peace again.
This path of peace, unity and brotherhood is the right path and we have to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to improve.
Prosperity is our solution to all our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet and listen to the students of Sufi streams.
I am really telling you that this experience of listening to them is like a music experience.
The words of those pundits and their words, that is, the tradition of peaceful generosity that is in Sufi stream, should have reached me like a musical fabric.
I'm very good.
Perhaps the truth of Islam is to reach the Tomato world right now.
I believe that this love and generosity of the Sufi tradition will reach far and wide so that the entire humanity and Islam will benefit.
I say to others, even though we are different communities, we need to understand the Sufi spirit.
In the coming days, I am going to have another opportunity and I am fortunate to get this invitation.
The scholars of Buddhist religions from many countries of the world are coming to Buddha Gaya in India, they will discuss various issues related to humanity all over the world.
I am glad that those students who have invited me there too.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Buddha Gaya.
This moment is going to be a joyful moment for me to meet all the world's eminent personalities.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to talk to you, especially to you.
I have also spoken about this in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
You have heard that in the Parliament, in the public meeting or in the Mann Ki Baat.
Every time I am telling you that the government's mind is open about the disputes that are going on in the land acquisition law.
I am persuaded to take any suggestion for the welfare of the farmers.
But today I want to tell the Kisan brothers and sisters that the proposal to amend the Land Acquisition Act has come from the side of the State.
But I saw that a lot of misconceptions have been spread about this, the farmers have been scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, our farmers will never think wrong and fear will never happen.
I don't want anybody to misunderstood the farmers.
I need every demand of the country, but the demand for farmers is most important among them.
I'm finished, let this term be expired.
That is, the position that was before the formation of my government came back.
But it was incomplete.
There were 13 such things that were about to be completed within a year and that is why we brought them to the Ordinance, but it was incomplete.
The mantra of our path to the welfare of the poor and the farmers of the villages.
So, on 15th August, I had said that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be created.
We're trying to transform this decision quickly.
My farmer brothers and sisters, there is no reason for corruption anymore.
If someone tries to scare you, you won't be afraid.
I have to say another thing.
Two days ago, the war of 1947 was completed fifty years.
Whenever there is talk of the war of 1947, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also very natural to remember Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.
It is very natural to remember the sacrifices of all those who have been martyred to maintain the pride and respect of the triangular National Flag of India.
I salute all those associated with the 65th India Vijay and bow down to the brave martyrs.
Such historical events inspire us everyday.
I am very happy that India is doing well in various fields of science.
Our scientists are really doing a good job.
I have seen a new dream in the eyes of young scientists who are talking with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
Last time, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I had said that our teachers should move forward towards science.
After this interaction with the scientists, I felt that there is a lot of opportunities in this field.
I feel good that in just 15 days, the government has started working on this thing in a short span of time.
Instructions are being issued and it will be expected to provide an interview system for small jobs.
In India, guests from many countries of the world have come here.
In order to reduce the maternal mortality, especially mother and child mortality, 24 countries of the world together agreed on the Call to Action Plan of India.
This is the first time in any other country outside America.
It is true that even today, every year about fifty thousand mothers and about lakhs of children die during delivery or after that.
It's too worrying and scared.
Although there has been a lot of improvement in this regard, India has started to appreciate it at the international level.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of death due to tetanus of mother and child.
The whole world has recognized it.
But we still have to save our mothers and infants.
Brothers and sisters, Dengue is getting a lot of news today.
It's right that Dengue is very dangerous, but it's easy to get rid of Dengue.
It has a direct connectivity with the Swachh Bharat I talk about.
We see advertising on the TV about dengue, advertising on the news papers, but we don't mind it.
There are rules to keep small things clean and keep water clean.
There is a wide range of public education, but we are not paying attention to it.
Sometimes it seems that we are in a very clean house, a very good arrangement, but I don't think that I invite Dengue to the water that is stored in my house.
I will urge everyone not to let death come so easily.
Life is very precious.
It's not okay that the apathy of the filthy storage water around will be the cause of death.
Dengue testing is being conducted at around 514 centres across the country.
It is very important to prevent death from being tested in time.
Your collaboration in this regard is very desired.
Cleanliness must be very important.
Now there will be many festivals across the country from Rakhibandhan to Deepavali.
You will see that this method of cleanliness will become your habit.
My dear countrymen, today I want to hear the news of happiness.
I often say that now we do not have the privilege of giving life to our country but it is fortunate to save the country.
Two youngsters of my country, two brothers of the Nasik of Maharashtra, Dr.
Headendra Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan has a strong desire to serve the tribals of the country.
These two brothers have glorified India.
There is a cycle race in America, Race Access America, which is very difficult.
I convey my best wishes and best wishes to these two brothers.
I am very happy that these two brothers have successfully achieved the objective of 'Team India Vision for Tribals' that is to work for the development of tribals.
See how everybody is trying to take the country forward at a personal level.
When I heard all this, the heart swells proudly.
Sometimes we have done injustice to the new generations by becoming an old consciousness.
The old generation thinks that the new generation doesn't know anything and this concept has been going on for centuries.
I have met a number of youngsters who have lost their lives on the Sunday on Cycle.
Some people say that I celebrate Cycle Day a week.
It is also very useful for my health and environment protection.
And the young man I love to think.
Cycling is being carried out in many cities of our country and there is a lot of people who are encouraging cycling.
It is a good endeavour to protect the environment and improve health.
Today, when the two youngsters of my country have laid the National Flag in the United States, I am delighted to mention the path of thinking and thinking of the youth of India.
I would like to specially congratulate the Maharashtra government today.
The work of constructing a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar in the land of Indu Mill in Mumbai has been stuck for a long time.
At the same time, we bought the house of 10 King Henry Road in London where Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar lived.
The Government of Maharashtra will construct a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This place will be an inspiration for Indians who travel around the world.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the two efforts of the Government of Maharashtra for honouring Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This year, it's good for the rainy season.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will be helpful in getting bad treatment done.
And I'm very happy to remember a happy news.
There is a huge shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
I want pulses for the poor, I want some oil for the food.
I am happy to note that the amount of pulses has increased by about 50 per cent and the oilseeds has increased by about 33 per cent.
My dear countrymen, on 26th July, the day of Kargil Vijay Diwas has been identified in our history.
The close relationship with the land of the farmers is the same to the soldiers of our country.
The war of Kargil was not only on the borders of the country but it was the synergy of every city of India, every village.
This war was also fought by those mothers and sisters who were fighting with the enemies of the young boys or brothers in Kargil.
Today, India has been able to talk to them in the world for their sacrifices.
I am committed to further enhance the direct participation of the people in the democracy, to take everybody to the development of the country. And today, after a year, I am happy that about two crore people have seen the MyGov portal.
Why aren't the conservation of the persons with disabilities while booking tickets for the train through the website of RCTC
Now this thing is very small, but it has never been thought of by the government or has not been discussed.
However, the government has considered this belief of Bhai Akhilesh Vajpayee with great importance and today this system has been implemented for our oppressed brothers and sisters.
Today, the logo that is being created, the tag line is being constructed, the policy is being formulated - MyGov portal has a positive view on all these things.
There is a feeling of a fresh air flow in the governance system.
It feels a new consciousness.
There is a lot of suggestions on what I should say on 15th August.
Suchitra Raghavchari has sent a lot of opinions from Chennai.
Mygov can be sent to the portal, write a letter to the Akashwani and write a letter to the Prime Minister's Office.
Look, I think it's a good thing that on 15th August, I have advisory from the masses for my speech.
I believe you must send good advice.
Just two days ago, I looked at an accident in Delhi and after the accident, a scooter driver has been jumping for 10 minutes.
He didn't get any help
And when you look at the statistics, the mind gets upset.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
For the accident, one death occurs every 4 minutes for the accident.
And the biggest thing is that one-third of these dead people is Naojavan, 15-25 years of age and one death can destroy the entire family.
They will do what the administration should do, but I will urge you to make a request for your mother-in-law, your child to-heeler or to-heeler, all efforts should be made by the family.
Sometimes I have seen, behind the autorickshaws, Papa should come home quickly.
And that is why I am saying that the government has taken several new initiatives in this regard - be it education for road safety or be it road safety technologies, administrative system or be it an emergency medical system for the injured persons after the accident, we have brought the road transport and safety bill.
In the coming days, I am thinking of taking some important steps to use the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
I have undertaken another project that will be expanded from Gurgaon, Jaipur and Badodara to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon, Mondia highways.
I am thinking of a cashless medical system for the first 50 hours after the accident. Whether the injured person has money or not, who will not pay, who will not pay.
I have arranged a toll-free number 1033 to provide news of the accidents across the country, ambulances.
Sometimes I say that employees are employed.
In the last few days, I want to tell you what I like.
Vijay Vishwal showed how his interest, his own entrepreneurship, his capabilities can be connected with his work.
In the coming days, there can be a series of discussions and discussions about Vijay Biswal's pictures.
I also remember another thing that the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has started a work in the entire district which touched my heart and I liked their work.
And they took charge that in the Rakhibandhan Festival, so that all the brothers give toilets to their sisters and no mother-sons of the entire district should go to the open space.
I knew this kind of news that I wanted to share with you.
There is a small village called Kesala in Rajnand village of Chhattisgarh.
The people of this village have been campaigning for construction of toilets for the last few months.
Now, no person in this village has to make toilets open.
After completion of toilets, the people of the entire village have celebrated a big festival on this occasion.
This is an excellent example of how the values of the society are changing, how the mental needs of the people are changing, how the citizens of the country are moving forward.
Deka has written to me about North-Eastern India, in the same way, the people of North-Eastern India are very active.
They write a lot of things - it's a good thing.
I am happy to tell them that there is a separate ministry for Northeast India.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was the Prime Minister, a separate ministry called Development of North-East Region (D-O-N-E-R) was formed.
After the formation of our government, our Donor Department has taken an important decision that the development of North-Eastern India is not possible in Delhi.
Everyone together decides that a team of officers of the Government of India will visit the North-Eastern states of India such as Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim and will be camping for seven days.
The effort to go away from Delhi to the east, which I am calling the Act East Policy, needs to be taken forward.
My dear countrymen, we are happy with the success of Merce Mission and we are proud.
In the last few days, Indias PSLV C28 successfully launched five satellites of the UK.
All these news come for a few moments, goes back.
We don't normally remember these things.
But sometimes think that today, when we talk to the younger generation and want to know what they want to happen in the future, one-and-a-half of the students who say that I want to be scientists.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) of the Government of India has launched a National Intellectual Research Campaign to look at new talents.
Now we have to go to another village even if we charge the mobile.
All the facilities available in the city should also be available in the villages.
That is why we started the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Programme.
But we have to work for the poor.
We'll complete it.
I have started this, I will finish it and today I want to talk about various issues.
On the one hand, the month of August-September is celebrated in our country.
Several festivals are also celebrated.
My best wishes to you all.
You must send your advice for August 15.
I'm gonna have a lot of work for you.
Thank you innumerable
When I told you, I didn't think it would be such a remarkable one.
Lakhs of people have posted photographs in Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
I saw a photo after one, how many varieties in India are architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas
I think that the Government of India has done that big thing that has not been able to think about tourism.
I liked some other pictures that I myself made a tweet again.
I think that if the photographs of the Belum Cave in Andhra Pradesh are not posted then we might not know the places that are hidden in our country.
But the scene that we saw on 21st June is very amazing and I think there was no such country where the sun has reached the world where the sun has not been welcomed by yoga exercise.
I can assert that the sun does not die in the world of Yoga.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian in the way the people of the world have respected and self-relianced Yoga.
I am also very happy.
The Sin River and the IFEL Tower are a symbol of pride for the people of France and they have chosen the place for Yoga and have given equal respect to Yoga.
People have practiced Yoga in Times Square in New York.
Opera House's picture looks up in front of the eyes when Australia speaks of Australia.
The Australian citizens have practiced Yoga at the Opera House, honoured Yoga as Opera House.
Whether it is North America or the Silicon Valley or the Duomo Cathedral of Milan, Yoga has made us proud.
I am delighted to note that when Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban-Ki-Mun, had done Yoga as the headquarters of the United Nations on 21st June.
Similarly, members of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force have performed very beautiful Yoga practices.
Our army has joined the white ice sheet in Siachen in India, and the Navy has participated in the programme of Yoga wherever there was a boat in the sea.
In Delhi, Yoga has been ranked in the Ginsbook of World Records.
It seemed to be a new question from everywhere in the world - a new joy - a new spirit - a new solidarity is emerging.
A few days ago, when I had a photo tweet for a younger family in Vietnam, the photo was so beautiful that he was praised all over the world.
Wives and children, villages and villages, developing countries have connected themselves with Yoga.
Yoga is truly binding the whole world in one corner.
I do not know how the disciples and disciples will see this thing, but I feel one thing, every Indian can be proud that the entire world is interested in knowing India.
Everyone's interest has increased to know India.
The world wants to know the values, traditions and heritage of India.
The responsibility of all of us is to keep this legacy in the forefront.
If we are proud of our heritage then we can do this.
Sometimes sometimes we know that we don't see any innovation among them, like our family values, we don't know our family values are important for the people of the world.
Why don't we introduce our family traditions and values to the world
I am surprising that the world will be surprised - I am surprising that there are many such best things that the ancestors have given us the right to the world.
The success of International Day of Yoga has brought a new responsibilities with happiness and happiness.
It is our responsibility to provide good Yoga teachers to the world.
I am sure you can create a database about where you can learn, wherever you can get Yoga teachers.
I have seen the events of the past in another vision, the government is working, the government is working very active and if the goal is stable then we have seen the results of it.
When the despair was snatching around us, like a year ago, we heard, nothing would happen, nothing would happen.
A section of the government is Ayush.
Nobody gave any importance to this
But on the day of Yoga Day, this small department has led and has organized such a big event across the world.
If the goal is fixed then the smaller department can do well.
A few days ago, the world has seen how our people protected people from Yemen.
In a few hours, Indians have moved to help Nepal.
If the government is active, the employees of all the banks come forward to open the Jan Dhan Account in the bank and in a few days millions of countrymen get connected to the bank.
On 15th August, I requested all the schools in the Red Fort to build toilets and said that we will have to complete this work by next 15th August.
It was a great bravery to fulfil the work that was not possible in sixty years.
That is, the government, the common man, the government employees, all want to work for the country.
Last month, I started three Jan Suraksha Yojanas from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been associated with the Jan Suraksha Yojana, even though we have to move forward.
The festival of Rakhibandhan is coming in the next month.
Can all of us together create a strong mass movement before this festival and cannot facilitate the welfare of our mothers and sisters
On the occasion of Rakhibandhan, it can be a great gift for the sisters on the side of the brother.
When I come to the Mann Ki Baat programme, many people should send me advice.
Many people have advised me to say something about the rains.
Yogesh Dandekar from Nagpur, Harsh Vardhan Mahasay from Mysore, Pravin Nadkarni Mahasay, Divyashu Gupta Mahasay - Everyone told me about the rainy season in Mann Ki Baat.
This season enjoys the heart.
The people of any age want to enjoy the first rain water.
You are definitely enjoying hot tea imports with hot potatoes, vegetables and potatoes this year.
As the sun rays give us energy, rain gives us energy.
Point drops of water is very valuable.
As a citizen, as a people of the society, we have to create a habit of saving water.
The water of the village should be in the villages, the water of the city should be in the city.
Rain water harvesting has not been a new thing for centuries.
Check dam, watershed development, small ponds, small ponds of the fields, whateverever, we have to keep our points of water alive.
This port is on the banks of the sea, so for sweet water, rain water was collected and kept in the house.
At that time, such efforts were made to conserve rain water.
We can do this too.
And I advise that is from my direct and successful experience.
It's a whole rural technology.
When you plant trees then put an old furnace of soil near the tree and fill it with water.
It's going to be filled once or twice a month.
Look, this tree will grow very quickly and become very strong.
I will also say to the farmers, you don't roam around your fields and plant trees.
And we also know that in the rainy season the disease spreads more through water.
Bacteria becomes active to increase moisture in the weather.
Therefore, cleanliness is very important at this time.
You should drink pure drinking water at this time.
It's okay, as far as we are careful, the disease will be far away.
We want water, we want rain, but we want to save from diseases.
My countrymen, we have recently launched three new projects, especially for the people of the city.
We have at least five hundred small towns in our country.
We have to take this effort forward.
And the house wants electricity, drinking water, toilets and nearby schools for children's education.
When India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022, we want to give our homes to every countrymen.
I'm connected with you all through social media.
Several new ideas, suggestions, suggestions and suggestions are being made by the government.
But when this government scheme becomes its own schemes of a person, society or village then how much its power increases.
In the last few days, a Panchayat chief of Bibipur village in Haryana, Smt. Sunil Jagalan Mahasay started a very funny effort.
And this creates an environment that every father used to possess his daughter with selfie and post on social media.
The number of balloons in Haryana is very less than the children.
There are about 100 districts in the country where there is such a situation, which is very worrying.
The worst situation in Haryana.
And that is why I urge you to participate in the Selfie with your daughters.
To further strengthen the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, write a tagline, write a beautiful tagline, it can be in any language, English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any other language.
The tag line that will be inspiring, I will bring your daughter to your selfie again.
All of us can give this scheme the form of Jan Andolan as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao.
Make our country healthy.
I am telling you from my experience, this effort should be taken forward.
Make this a part of your life.
And one thing - Incredible India - wherever you go, you must send the pictures there.
Our country is such a world that how many diversity is there in our country.
I guess the pictures you are sending are very little in handicraft.
You can also post the pictures of handicrafts in your area in Incredible India.
Several things are made in your city - the poor people also make things.
And we have a simple medium with which we can reach.
My dear countrymen, this is all today.
The next Mann Ki Baat will talk to you again.
Some people sometimes feel that in Mann Ki Baat, I declare a big scheme of the government but not that.
I'm working day and night.
It is my pleasure to talk to you in a light meeting through this programme.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You imagine what happened in the middle of this time.
When I talked about Mann Ki Baat, even though I used to say the words, the voices of my throat were myself, but the words were yours, the men were yours, the perambulations were yours.
But this Sunday has waited for me a lot.
Let's go, it's the last chance.
In a household environment, Mann Ki Baat, a small mind that can change the life of the society, its sustainability is a new inspiration and this sustainability should move forward by empowering the soul of New India.
My heartfelt interaction with you, I had a feeling of such a spiritual journey.
Several people asked me why I went to Kedarnath in that busy manner of voting.
You have the right and I can understand this skill.
I think I'm talking to you about the situation of that time.
But today I feel that if I talk about it, then it will change the form of Mann Ki Baat.
The sluggishness of the vote, the estimation of the defeat and the polling remains when I left.
Most of the people found political significance.
But for me it was an opportunity to meet myself.
I could say I went to meet me.
When can I say - I don't know, I'll definitely say, because you have the right to me.
I feel that the kind of emotional power that people have expressed their desire to know about the cedar is your efforts.
Sometimes some of your words drag my thoughts.
He also spoke of the challenges faced by the people like the country and the society.
I have noticed that there is no description of the problem in the letter, but it is also with him that there is some solution formula, some suggestions, some imaginations are given directly or indirectly.
If someone takes cleanliness, he expressed his obstacles about dirty waste and welcomed this effort towards cleanliness.
He said that whenever someone speaks of the environment, he feels afflicted with pollution, he also spoke of his own efforts.
He also mentioned the ways taken, and said that all the imaginations he has kept in mind are preventing environmental pollution.
That is, I am a glimpse of how to solve the problem with the entire society.
Mann Ki Baat is a pledge for the country and the society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of internal energy, capabilities and talent among the people of the country.
It is only necessary to drive that power and talent in the right way, give it opportunity and take it to work.
Mann Ki Baat also says that in the progress of the country, the strength and activity of 130 crore people will be connected.
I would certainly say that Mann Ki Baat has received a lot of letters, innumerable phones, many messages, but there is a lot of complaints.
You can imagine that nobody has written a letter to the Prime Minister of the country but hasn't you wanted anything for himself
This is an example of the high thinking of millions of people in the country.
Today, my heart is full of happiness.
And that is why I made an announcement in Mann Ki Baat that after a few months I will come back to you again.
Let us move forward the sustainability of Mann Ki Baat.
When the necessary situation was implemented in the country, the movement against him was not limited to political circles, political leaders and prisoners.
I don't feel hungry when we can eat at night.
In the same way, the significance of the rights of the people in the daily life is felt only when the rights are hiding.
And this is not because the Constitution of India has taken some such steps in which democracy has grown.
The Constitution and Laws are required to drive the society well.
And that is why the country dedicated to a whole election, not for itself but for protecting democracy.
Recently, the greatest and the largest election process of democracy was completed in our country, where wealthy to the poor, all of them were ready to decide the future of the country.
When something is very close to us, we cannot achieve its importance.
More than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India, Sixty One Crore
The number may be simple, but if I look at the whole world, I will say that without a china, more people have voted in India than any country in the world.
The number of people who have voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than double the total population in the US.
The total number of voters in India is more than the total population of Europe.
These are the guardians of the vastness and expansiveness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections are still the world's largest democratic election in history.
You can imagine what kind of massive organisations and human resources are needed to complete this process.
This election has been possible for the hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and workers.
In order to achieve this great man of democracy, about three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces have laid down their responsibilities, while 20 lakh police personnel of different states have laboured utmostly.
Their hard work resulted in more votes than last election this time.
About 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines have been arranged in this election process.
To ensure that no one is deprived of his voter rights.
Polling stations have been set up for only one female electorate in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the officers of the Election Commission have been traveling for two days to reach that place.
This is the real honor of democracy.
This is the highest polling station in the world.
The polling station is at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is another information that we can be proud of.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women have voted with zeal like men.
The number of men and women voters in this election is almost equal.
One more inspiring information is that now there are 78 women MPs in Parliament, which is a record.
I congratulate the Election Commission and everyone associated with the polling process and bow down to the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you will be listening to me several times: "No book, Book".
I wanted to supplicate the habitations if books can be replaced by flowers
Another story that deepens my heart is Eidgah.
The story is a child's condolences, a pure love for his sister.
When the four-five-year Hamid takes a pinch from the fair to his sister-in-law, it is really a feeling that the love, tolerance of human minds can be incomplete, what is incomplete.
The last line of this story is our thoughts and teachings of life is an unprecedented truth: "Shishu Hamid, played the role of elderly hamids, the old man, I am not, the girl was converted into me.
A very heartfelt story like Pus Ki Night.
In this story, pictures of a poor farmer's life are seen.
The farmers are happy even after their crops are destroyed because they don't have to sleep in the fields in winter.
Though these stories are almost centuries old, it still feels the relevance.
After reading the story, I feel another kind of experience.
When it's about reading the book, in a media, I read the letters of Kerala about the library.
You will be surprised to know that Library is located in a village in the depth of Idukki.
There's a primary school teacher P.
V Chinnathampi worked unusually for this library.
There was a time when the books were filled up and pressed on the back.
Today, this library is showing a new direction along with tribal children.
Gujarat's Wangche Gujarat campaign is a successful initiative.
Millions of people from all ages participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, at the time of Google Guru, I would urge you to take some time out and give some place to books in your daily routine.
You will really enjoy and write about the books you read in Narendra Modi App so that all the audience of Mann Ki Baat are aware of it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of my country are thinking about all those things which are not just present but also a big challenge for the future.
I was reading your comments on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I realised that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Belgavir Pawan Gaurai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahav Altaf and many others also spoke about water related problems.
Water has a huge impact on our culture.
It has been said about the water of Rish Veda Ap Sukktam that we are not very foolish but foolish, foolish and foolish.
Multiple parts of the country are getting damaged every year due to lack of water.
You will be surprised to know that in a year, only 8 percent of the water received from the rains are conserved in our country.
Only 8 per cent.
But now it's time to solve this problem.
I am confident that we will also find solutions to this crisis with the capability, collaboration and determination of 130 crore nations, with the strength of the people, through public participation, with the strength of the people.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country keeping in mind the importance of water.
This will facilitate setting up of water related issues.
A few days ago I tried to innovate something different.
I wrote a letter to all the village heads of the country.
I wrote to the heads of the village to save water, to save water, to save every drop of rain, to sit with the villagers by calling the village council meeting.
I am glad that they have given full zeal to the A-BISH and on 22nd of E-Mass, millions of people have laboured in thousands of panchayats.
People in the villages have committed to harvesting one drop of water.
Today, at the Mann Ki Baat, I want to listen to a village panchayat.
The Panchayat Head of Lupung village of Katkamshandi Block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand gave us the message. My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas, when the Prime Minister wrote our letter to save water, we did not believe that the Prime Minister wrote our letter.
The people there were ready to play their active role for water conservation once again.
On behalf of me, my best wishes to all the village heads, all the Panchayat chiefs and their activeness.
There are several Panchayat heads across the country who have been engaged in water conservation.
What I said is possible to achieve a big positive result in every effort.
But everyone's goal is to save water, water conservation.
The work of water drainage reforms in Punjab is underway.
This is helping to prevent water accumulation.
The construction of a reservoir in Thimaipalli of Telangana has changed the lives of the people of the village.
The construction of small ponds in the fields of poetry of Rajasthan has brought about a major change.
I was talking about a public effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women were present at one place to reserve Nagandi.
I was also studying about those women of Garhwal who are working very well to keep the rain water together.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat programme, I am making three requests to the people of India.
My first request: Let us initiate a mass movement for water conservation in the same way as the people of the country gave the form of a mass movement.
We all resolve to save every drop of water together, I believe that water is the form of prasad, water marble from Parmeshwar.
We have started a campaign of awareness to save one drop of water.
Be it the world of cinema, the world of sports, the media friends, the people associated with the social organisations, the people associated with the cultural organisations, the artists of conversations, everybody should lead this movement through their own methods.
Make the society awaken, join everyone and tied together.
You see, we can see changes in front of our eyes.
Let us create a list of water conservation methods and inspire people to conserve water.

My dear countrymen, I express my gratitude to you and all the people of the world for another thing.
Just as 21st June, once again on Yoga Day, three-four generations of one family full of zeal have celebrated Yoga Day together.
With the consciousness of the Holistic Health Care, the importance of Yoga Day is increasing.
If a Yoga lover welcomes the sun in every corner of the world, then his entire journey ends with sunset.
The President of the world, the Prime Minister, the eminent personality, the common man, who showed me on a tourist how they celebrated Yoga Day in their own country.
That day, the world looked like a large family full of happiness.
We all know that the need of a healthy society, a healthy and sensitivity is that of Yoga.
Therefore, the promotion and promotion of Yoga is an integral part of the service of society.
In 2019, the Prime Ministers Awards have been announced to contribute to the promotion and development of Yoga, which must be grateful to me.
The award has been given to those organisations of the world who have played an important role in the promotion and promotion of yoga.
Like Japan Yoga Niketan, it can be said, who have made Yoga very popular in Japan.
Several institutions and training courses are run by Japan Yoga Niketan.
And where the matter is related to yoga, can Indians remain behind
The Yoga School in Munger, Bihar has been honoured for the past few decades.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Munik has also been honored with the establishment of Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Recognizing the message of Yoga and the message of Yoga at home, these two things have added a different dimension to Yoga Day.
My dear countrymen, this journey of our country has begun to achieve new ideas, new feelings, new resolves and new energy.
It is important for me to connect yourself with your thoughts that Mann Ki Baat is just a definite thing.
Your blessings are with me.
You are my inspiration, my strength.
Let us all sit together and listen to the Mann Ki Baat Festival.
In the coming month, you will talk to Mann Ki Baat again.
Thanks to all of you, lucky.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
My heart is sorry to start Mann Ki Baat today.
Ten days ago, Mother India lost his brave children.
In order to address this challenge facing the country, we all have to forget about casteism, communalism, regionalism and all other similarities so that we can take stronger, stronger and fruitful measures than before.
Our Armed Forces are introducing unprecedented courage.
You have seen what kind of action has been taken within 100 hours of terrorism.
The army has taken a pledge to destroy the terrorists and their drunkards.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational message of their families came forward through the media, which awakens the inspiration of immense courage, enthusiasm and energy among the people of the country.
In Bhagalpur, Bihar, the father of Shahid Ratan Tagore, Ramniranjan ji, who gave a strong resolve to inspire all of us.
He said that his other sons will also be sent to fight against the enemies of the country and will be present in the field of fighting if necessary.
The entire nation is conveying tributes to the brave courage of the martyrdom of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He took a pledge to contribute to his only son to the CRPF.
When the dead body of Shahid Vijay Soren, who was covered by the National Flag, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his younger son said that he would join the armed forces.
With the enthusiasm of this innocent child, this determination, this feeling, today, shows the idea of the young children of India.
My dear countrymen, all of us have been waiting for the War Memorial for such a long time of independence.
It is very natural for the people to have a lot of questions and experiences in this regard.
He was happy to note that Shri Onkar Shetty ji, Karnataka has created a National War Memorial at Odupi, Narendra Modi App.
I was surprised and convinced that there was no National War Memorial in India.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Morarjibhai Descendants were born on 29th February.
You all know that the special day comes once in 4 years.
Morarjibhai was one of the most devoted leaders of this country.
Morarji Bhai Desai has been the record of presenting the budget in Parliament in this independent India.
During that difficult times, Morarji Desai gave the right leadership to India when the democracy of the country was in a difficult situation.
Morarjivai Descendants had put themselves in the movement against the needy situation to protect this democracy.
And for this, he had to pay a lot of money even after coming to the message.
The government arrested him and imprisoned him.
But when Janta Party won in 1977, he became our Prime Minister.
It was proposed to amend the 44th Constitution during his presidency.
This is important because the 42nd Amendment for Emergency was proposed, where the power of the Supreme Court was overwhelmed and there was some further proposals that would ruin our democratic values, and they were sent back without being effective.
As the 44th Amendment Proposal provides an opportunity to publish news of all the functions of the Parliament and the Legislative Assembly in the newspaper.
In addition, certain powers of the Supreme Court have been executed, the amendments proposed that the basic rights of the citizens should not be executed in any way due to the requirements of the Constitution, including Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution.
Once again I pay my tributes to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of curiosity in the minds of the people about the Padma Awards.
I want to tell you about some such people today.
He was surprised to revive the romantic art of Kutch.
He has done an excellent work to bring this rare industry to the new generations.
I gave a gift to former US President Barak Obama, the Tree of Life, built by Afghan Gafur.
Among the awardees, Marathwada's Sabbi is known as Gomata Sevak.
The way he delivered all his life to the service of Goddess, he is unique.
Madurai Chinna Pillai, a distinguished person who tried to strengthen and self-sufficiently damaged and exploited by the Kalanjiam movement in Tamil Nadu.
He has been training all the people around the world at the age of a hundred years and has so far created 1500 Yoga teachers.
Famously known as Lady Tarzan, Jharkhand has been adventurous to compete with trees, mafia and designers. He has not only saved 50 hectares of forests but also sent 10,000 women together to protect trees and wildlife.
As a result of this hard work of Yamuna ji, today the people of the village are 18 at the time of birth of every child and plant 10 trees at the time of every girl's marriage.
Being Divyang as well as Divyang women, he has dedicated himself to self-reliance of the visually impaired children by creating an Institution called 'Kashmhi Mahila Seva Kunj'.
The real thing is that he has done the work of technologies with agriculture and my dear countrymen, this is the first time that 12 of those who have been awarded the Padma Awards this year.
Normally, very few people associated with the agriculture sector and those who are directly associated with the farmers have come to the list of Padma Shris.
And this is the changing image of India.
My dear countrymen, today I have conveyed my heartfelt touch to all of you and myself for the past few days.
Today, I want to meet the beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, PM-JYA and PM Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken the opportunity of this scheme.
I understand how many changes have been made in the lives of the poor.
If you know a poor person, who cannot be treated with lack of money, he said about this scheme.
This scheme has been implemented for the benefit of the poor.
My dear brothers and sisters are going to start the school examination.
Various Educational Boards across the country will be prepared for examination of Parliament and 12th Category.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the test takers, their parents and teachers.
A few days ago, a massive event was held in the Town Hall Format in Delhi.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their teachers, parents, UTUs for recording this programme.
My dear countrymen, there will be no talk of India and there will be no talk of worship.
Perhaps there is no day in our country where there is no festival or festival with us or there is no special significance because we have a thousand years old heritage.
In a few days, the Mahashivaratri has come and this time Shivratri has fallen on Mondays and Shivratri together and our hearts are filled with special sacred feelings and devotion.
I am very impressed with the ability of this disabled person.
My dear countrymen, I have a unique experience to connect with you all through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I face millions of families every month through radio.
Sometimes, when you come to read your letters, talk to you or send your phones, listening to your suggestions, you have made me one of your family.
This is my feeling of great happiness.
Friends, Elections are the biggest festivals of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy with the elections.

As a result of the overall efforts, our country has achieved unprecedented success in the ranking of Ease of Doing Business.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by visiting the entire world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
Indias first waterway was launched in Varanasi.
This has brought about a rapid change in waterways.
The longest railroad Bogibil bridge of the country has been opened for the people of Sikkim and the first 100th airport of the country Pack Yong has been inaugurated.
India won 19 Cricket Crickets and Blind Crickets.
India has won a lot of medals in the Asian Games this time.
The results of Para-ASEAN are very good.
But if I talk about the success of every Indian and our overall efforts, then the Mann Ki Baat programme will be so long that it will start at the beginning of 2019.
All these are possible in the unprecedented efforts of 130 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, in December this month we have lost some excellent countrymen.
Dr. Jaya Chandran died in Chennai on 19th December.
Narasamma was a helper in the delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
In the beginning of this year, he was honored with Padma Shri.
Dr. Jaya Chandran and Sulagitti have many examples such as Narasamma, who have lived for the good of society.
When I talk about healthcare, I would like to mention the social efforts of doctors in the business of Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some of my party members tell me that some young doctors of the city are treating the poor free of cost by camping.
Now hundreds of poor people are benefiting from this camp every month.
The zeal of these doctors and friends who have been employed in service is really commendable.
Today, I can proudly say that Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign because of our collective efforts.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the Swachhta Abhiyan in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
In this magnificence of cleanliness, the municipal corporation, the voluntary organisations, the students of school-colleges, the people of Jabalpur participated with enthusiasm.
This is where I can know about Dr. Jaya Chandran.
Whenever it takes time, I try to know about this kind of innovative thing by going to the website of the Better India Dotcom.
I am happy that today there are several websites that introduce us to the life of inspirational people.
Through Sanskrit Bharati Dot In, you can easily learn the culture languages by sitting at home.
I believe that many people can know about this heroes, bringing about changes in society.
It is easier to spread the Negativity but around us, there is a lot of good work in our society and it is possible that 130 crore Indians are involved in this effort.
Every society has a different significance of sports.
Whenever there is a game, the audience also feels a joy and adventure.
I would like to talk about a girl from Kashmir, Hanya Nisar, who won a gold medal in Carrates in Korea.
The twelve-year-old Hanya remains in Kashmir's eternity.
I wish him a bright future on behalf of all the nations.
Many congratulations and blessings to Royal for Hannai.
Similarly, there is a lot of discussions in the media about another daughter, sixteen Rajni.
You must have read.
Rajni has won gold medals in Generation Boxing 1981.
He did that in honor of his father Jasmer Singh, who sold a luxury in a waterway shop.
Rajni told her that her father had to accept many sacrifices and sufferings to reach this place.
Jasmer Singh will leave the Rajni and his brothers and sisters before getting up every day.
When Rajni wants to teach boxing to his father, he tried to enhance his zeal and succeed his dreams.
Roseny boxing practices started with old glasses, because his family wasn't good.
Despite all the opposites, Rajni didn't lose courage and learned boxing.
He won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini and convey my heartfelt congratulations to his parents, Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani for staying with Rajni and encouraging him.
This month, the 20-year-old Bedangi Kulkarni Cycle of Pune has achieved the pride of being the fastest Asian in the world.
He drives around 300 kilometres of cycles every day for 159 days.
You imagine, 300 kilometres cycling every day
His indomitable zeal towards cycling is really commendable.
The adverseness never hampers.
When we heard of such other examples, we also get a new inspiration in every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, in the month of January many festivals like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magha Bihu, Maghi etc.
In all these festivals, the color of traditional dance will be seen somewhere in India, the joy of harvesting crops will be burnt in Lohri, somewhere in the sky, somewhere in the sky, somewhere there will be a joyous fair.
The festival of sports will be organised somewhere, and somewhere will be sweet and sweet to each other.
The name of all these festivals is different, but the objective of celebrating festivals is that these festivals are connected to agriculture and rural life.
This is the time when the sun rises and the sun enters the moonlight.
Since then, the day starts to grow gradually and the day of winter crops starts.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to our farmer brothers and sisters.
Ekta in Diversity, Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat, is a glorious festival of this spirit.
We can see how closely these festivals are associated with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not seen separately, there are people and groups here.
Another beautiful example of our closeness with nature is the festival-based calendar.
In these calendars, there are details of planets along with festivals throughout the year.
These traditional calendars understand how ancient our relationship with natural and scientific incidents.
As per the moon-surya calendar based on the speed of the moon and the sun, the date of festivals and festivals is decided.
It depends on who calendar follows.
In many places, we will be on the location of the planet, the day of the festival is fixed.
Gudi-Padwa, Cheti-Chand, Ugadi- all these festivals are celebrated according to the moon calendar as well as Tamil Puthandu and Vishnu, Vaishakha, Vaishakhi, Paila Vaishakha, Bihu etc.
Our aim is to protect rivers and water in the mountains.
Chhat Parvati is connected to the rivers and the reservoirs with sun worship.
Even in Makar Sankranti, lakhs of people bath in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals also teach social values.
On the one hand, as they have ancient significance, on the other hand, these festivals inspire each other to have brotherhood with each other in a very simple way in life.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for 2019.
Let us share the photographs on the occasion so that the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture can be seen.
My dear countrymen, there are many such things in our culture that we can be proud of and can showcase the world with the heads of the world and that is the Kumbh Mela.
You will hear a lot about the Kumbh.
In many cinemas, this fair has been depicted in different aspects of heritage and vastness and is true, as the Kumbh is large as it is a legacy, as it is important.
People from all over the world come to participate in the Kumbh.
In this Kumbh Mela, the belief and devotion of the people of this Kumbh.
Millions of people from all over the country are meeting together.
The tradition of Kumbh has been pure and devoted to our great cultural heritage.
Saints and saints have started reaching for the Kumbh Mela since now.
Last year, UNESCO has registered the Kumbh Mela in the list of Intensive Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, the Ambassador of many countries had prepared for Kumbh.
There was a national flag hoisting of several countries together.
The Kumbh Mela is expected to be held at Prayagraj.
It can be a big learning experiment for the youth, especially for the youth.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago, and I saw that the Kumbh's strong preparation was going on.
The people of Prayagraj are very enthusiastic about the Kumbh.
This time, there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in the Kumbh.
This Akshayavat, a symbol of human faith, was closed in the fort for thousands of years, so the pilgrims could not see it even if they wanted.
Now the door of Akshay Boat has been opened for everyone.
I urge you to share different features and pictures of Kumbh in social media so that more people are inspired to go to Kumbh.
This Kumbh of spirituality should be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
This Kumbh of faith should also be the Mahakumbh of nationalism and national integrity.
My dear countrymen, on the 26th of January, the celebrations of the Republic Day are very delighted to the people of the country and on that day we remember those great people who presented our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of worshipped Bapu.
Fortunately, the President of South Africa, Shri Siril Ramaphosa, is coming to India as the Chief Guest of the Republic Day.
There is an unprecedented bond of revered Bapu and South Africa.
South Africa is the place where Mohan became the Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started the first Satyagraha and stood in opposition to verbalism.
He established the Finics and Tolstoy Farm from where there was a sound of peace and prosperity all over the world.
He had the power and inspiration to spend so many years in prison.
Mandela said, "Mahatma is an integral part of our history because here he used himself first on the path of truth.
There is a wide range of discussions on how steps are needed to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
In this conference, I have announced to launch Sardar Patel Awards for National Unity, which will be given to those who have contributed to national unity.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the country.
He has worked throughout his life to keep Indias integrity intact.
He said that the unity of the country is in diversity.
I want to pay homage to Sardar Patel through this award of Unity.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh on 13th January.
Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patna.
Most of his life was the land of North India and he breathed his last in Nanded, Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and the last time of life in Nanded.
In a way, the entire India has received his blessings.
According to Guru Gobind Singh, it is the biggest service to overcome the grief of the people.
He was full of valour, valour, sacrifice and religion.
His extraordinary knowledge was in weapons and science.
He was a pilgrimage, a pilgrimage, a pilgrimage, a pilgrimage, a pilgrimage, architecture, architecture, architecture, architecture, architecture, Hindi, architecture etc.
Once again I bow down to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are some good events in the country which are not discussed in large numbers.
Various events are being organized across the country on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
It is eager to create safe and healthy food habits.
Swasth Bharat Yatra is being organised across the country as part of the Eat Right I India campaign.
The expedition will take place on 27th January.
India will be prosperous when India is clean and healthy.
For good health, nutritious diet is required first.
Whether it is individual life or national life or social life or inspiration is a source of progress.
Let us move ahead with new inspiration, innovation, innovation, innovation, innovative goals, innovative goals, innovative heights and change ourselves and change the country.
Mann Ki Baat November 2019
The 50th phase of this journey of Mann Ki Baat was completed today.
It is called Golden Jubilee Episode. Golden Episode.
This is the 50th edition of the letters and phones that have come here.
The Manika Jain of Delhi, Manika Jain of West Bengal, Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur have sent about one question in the same way from Bhagukumar, Kamalkumar, Patna to Vikas Yadav through MyGov App.
This question is very normal.
Why did Modi bring Radio back when people almost forgot the radio
Now the shopkeeper said, listen to this nin radio.
I heard in the radio, the bomb was being fired.
The shopkeeper told the Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, the historical significance of the bombing and the testing of nuclear bombs has been done in the radio on that day.
Looking at the joy of the shopkeeper gentlemen, I was thinking that the shopkeeper was listening to the radio throughout the day in the hilly areas, in the jungles.
I am thinking of Radio Communication Reach and its far-reaching effects.
After that, when I am the Prime Minister, I will take the help of the most powerful connectivity.
Since May 2014, when I started taking over the responsibility of the Chief Servant, I felt that the unity of our country, our glorious history, valour, diversity, cultural diversity, the work of mankind, his mankind, his emotions, sacrifices, penances should be spread to all the people of the country.
Every month, I have reached the 50th Episode to read a letter of lakhs, to listen to phone calls, to know about various apps and to meet them together.
The results of this survey are very encouraging.
The Survey shows that among the audience listening to Mann Ki Baat, seventy percent of them have heard every episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Most of the people have imagined that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced emotional thinking among all sections of the society.
Through the Mann Ki Baat, the mass movement has gained a lot.
There have been a lot of discussions on the issue of Hass Tag India Positive.
This is a good change in which people are moving forward for social service.
Modi will come and depart, but our country will remain immortal, our culture will remain immortal.
These small carpets of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
New motivation filled with enthusiasm and enthusiasm will bring the country to a higher height.
I read letters and feel such a feeling among them and work in mind.
I have achieved two things myself and share with them and share with you all.
But who knows when these things will reach home again.
Sometimes the government will have so much power that the schemes like Selfie with Daughter will start from a small village of Haryana, not only in the entire country, but in the entire world.
The people of every section of the society and the celebrity have also been associated with this thing and the thinking of the society has been demonstrated in a modern synthesis that brings the modern generation to light.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat has also been enjoyed, but I always feel that 130 crore people are living in my mind.
Their mind is my mind.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government thing, it is a matter of society.
There are many aspects of social life among which politics is only one aspect.
If politics becomes the original thing, it cannot be a reflection of a healthy society.
Sometimes political events or political people are so important that the other talent of the society or the other talents of the society are neglected.
It is our collective responsibility to take care of the talent of mankind and other things of the society for a bright future like India and to move forward in this direction of Mann Ki Baat.
I think the biggest achievement of Mann Ki Baat's 50th edition is that you are not asking the Prime Minister, you are asking a close partner, this is the democracy.
There's a toll free number - 17800, calling there and recording people's messages.
I am trying to read as much letters and comments as possible before Mann Ki Baat.
I heard a lot of phone calls.
This time, as soon as the Mann Ki Baater Episode is coming forward, I keep on reading the ideas and thoughts that you have been sent to different places during the visit.
That letter isn't just a piece of paper for me.
Besides, I have lived for about 40-45 years and have visited most of the districts of the country and have spent a long time in every district of the country.
And that is why when I read a letter, I can easily connect myself with that place and time.
After that, I will notify some of the information such as the village, the name of the person.
It is true that in Mann Ki Baat, I am the only one but for example, emotions and vitality, I want to thank all those who have contributed to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not been able to take the name of Mann Ki Baat till date, but they are not desperate to send their letters and their comments.
I am confident that your messages will come to me many times more than before and make Mann Ki Baat more psychological, effective and useful.
It is also tried that all the letters that are not included in the Mann Ki Baat programme should also be taken care of by the concerned departments regarding letters and advice.
I would like to thank all the media of Akashwani, Doordarshan, other TV channels, social media friends.
Their hard work is reaching Mann Ki Baat to the maximum number of people.
Thus, they have become Narendra Modi for thirty minutes.
I congratulate them for their talents and skills, thank them.
I urge you all to listen to this event in your regional language.
I also thank you all those friends of the media who are regularly publishing Mann Ki Baat in their channels.
No political person is disappointed with the media, imagined that he is covered very little, or negative coverage, but the media has made many things published in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Without your help, this journey of Mann Ki Baat was incomplete.
Nidhi ji, thank you for your phone call.
Normally I say I have no secrets.
What I'm doing is perhaps in every family.
In a simple language, I try to create myself like those youngsters, keep myself in that situation and try to match awave length with their views.
We have some old bags in our lives, if they are not brought forward then it becomes easier to tell anyone.
I don't understand any of the two, how one of them have confessed to the other by leaving their thoughts.
At present, the youngsters have a good quality, who don't believe in themselves, and whenever they believe in something, they leave everything behind him.
Often people discuss communication gaps among the elders and teenagers of the family.
But most of the families are discussing limited issues with teenagers.
Most of the times there is a message of reading or habit, lifestyle. Do not do this.
It is also a matter of concern that the talk is slowly decreasing in the households without any survival.
Any media is very important to replace the expectation and not discuss badly.
I have been interacting with the youth through various programmes and social media.
I always learn from the ideas of the youth.
Young people have different ideas.
Young people are entrepreneurs, innovations and innovations.
Somebody said that young students want to work together.
I say, what's wrong with this
They are transparent in multi-tasking, so they do this.
If we look around, we will see social initiatives, start-ups, sports, or any other sector, there is a big change in the society.
Those youngsters who have dared to question and dream.
If we can quit the ability to decide on the youth and if they can express their thoughts in the open, then they can bring about a positive change in the country and they are doing it.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to MyGov website, Vineeta ji wrote that this time Mann Ki Baat should say something about the Constituent Day of 26th November.
This is a special day because we are entering the seventeenth year of the Constitution of India.
Binita ji, thank you for this advice.
Yes, tomorrow's Constituency Day.
Those who have created our Constitution should remember those great personalities.
Our Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949.
It took two years 11 months to 17 days for the Constitution to complete this historic work of the Constitution.
Please imagine that within three years this great talented person has given us such a widespread and comprehensive constitution.
The extraordinary pace that they have constructed the Constitution is a unique example of Time Management and Productivity today.
Inspired by this, we are also eager to finish our responsibilities in record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a gathering of the great talented people of the country, so that everybody was responsible for giving such a Constitution to the country so that the people of India are empowered and the poorest person becomes empowered.
The basic features of our Constitution are that i. e. Rights and Duties are detailed here.
In the lives of the citizens of the country, the balance of these two things will take the country forward.
If we respect each other's right, you will also be protected by your rights and if we take our duty to the Constitution then the task of protecting our rights will also be fulfilled.
I remember that in the 60 years of India's democracy in 2010, in Gujarat, we had taken a pilgrimage by putting the Constitution on the back of the elephant.
It was a memorable effort to make the youth aware of the Constitution and to make them interested in various streams of the Constitution.
We are going to complete 70 years as a democratic country in 2020 and 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us all recognise the value of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress, prosperity, that is peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His Mahaparinirvana Diwas on 6th December.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I salute Babasaheb who has given the right to save millions of Indians with respect.
The Republic was under the contemplation of Babasaheb and he used to say that Indias democratic ideals are not external.
The definition of the Republic or the Parliamentary system was not new for India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he urged that we have achieved this freedom after a long time of struggle and that is why we have to protect it from the last point of our blood.
He further said that the Indians should always have the priorities of the welfare of the country, even as they grow in different environments.
Once again I pay tribute to Babasaheb.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev and will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019 next year.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev has always wished the welfare of humanity.
He has always shown the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony to society.
Our country will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev next year and will spread all over the world.
All States and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate this day with Dhumdham.
Thus, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
A train will also be run at all the sacred places associated with Shri Guru Nanak Dev.
Recently, when I was discussing this thing, I remember that Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara was talking about it.
This gurudwara was widely damaged during the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, but the way the state government revived the gurdwara with the local people.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build Kartarpur corridor so that the passengers of our country can easily visit the sacred land of Shri Guru Nanak Dev in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th phase, we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat and I believe that I had the idea of Mann Ki Baat.
Our journey will continue.
This journey will be deeper and satisfactory as much as I can with you.
Sometimes people feel that what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I would like to say that the feedback of Mann Ki Baat has touched my heart, most people have said that when they listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme, they feel that the family members are sharing their words with them.
I am very happy to know that when I have made you, one of you, one of you, one of you, one of you and you all made me big, I will meet you again and again as a member of your family through Mann Ki Baat.
You're sick, I'm sick.
Come on, let us take this journey forward.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
I wish you all must participate in this race of unity in large numbers.
About six and a half months before independence, the film of Sardar Patel was published on 27th January, 1947 in the renowned International Press Times.
He gave a map of India in his Lid Storey of Time Service.
There were more than 550 States.
Though the British were furious about India, they wanted to keep this country snatched.
The Time essay has written that the threats like separation, violence, food crisis, value addition and powerful politics have touched India, but if anyone has the power to bind the country in unity then he is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Gandhiji told Sardar Patel that the problems of the states are so horrible that only you can solve it.
Sardar Patel really solved the problems and showed the impossible task of uniting the entire country.
He connected all the countrys states to India, whether it is Junagadh, Hyderabad, Tribankur or Rajasthan, Sardar Patel was the only person who is intelligent and strategies to see the Intellectual India.
If we look at the mother of India, the nation that is tied to unity then it is natural to remember the sacred memories of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel is more important because on this day, we will hand over the Statue of Unity to the nation.
The statue, established on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, is double the Statue of Liberty of America.
This will be the world's highest Gaganchumbi architecture.
Every Indian can proudly say that the world's tallest statue is now in India.
I believe that this special architecture will be recognised as a favorite philosophy across the country.
This is the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army landed in Kashmir and protected the valley from the innovators.
This historic event is also related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I had an old meeting of the great soldier Sam Manekash of India.
In this meeting, Field Marshal Manekash spoke of the time when he was Colonel.
At that time, a military campaign started in Kashmir in 1947.
The Film Marshal Manekash said that at that time, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was obstacles in a meeting to delay sending troops to Kashmir and looked at Sardar Patel in his habit, he said that there will be no delay in the Army Abhiyan in Kashmir and it will be resolved as soon as possible.
Our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi, on 31st October, 2019.
Greetings to Indiraji.
My dear countrymen, are there people who don't like sports
Spirit, Stamina, Strength, Skill etc. are very important in the world of sports.
All these qualities are the maps of the success of a player.
On the other hand, these four qualities are important for nation building.
If the youth of any country have all these qualities then they will not only improve the economy, science and technology of the country, but also showcase the countrys victory in the field of sports.
Recently, I had two meetings, which are memorable.
First of all, I got the opportunity to meet Para Athletes who participated in the ASEAN Para Games 2018 in Jakarta.
India has achieved a new record of 72 medals in this game and has increased the honor of the country.
We have won 3 more medals in the Mix Event of 13 medals.
You are sure that this time the Asian Federation also showcased India.
Look, in the last few minutes, I have used the best, the best words so far.
At the age of eight, his father was born.
He spent the next eight years in anonymity.
After quitting his life, he was cleaning the DTC bus and washing the wheater on the edge of the road.
This Narayan has won a gold medal for India in International Event today.
Not only this, the field of sports in India is also expanding that the events like Judo, where India has not received any Olympic medals at the German or Sineer Level, where Tababi Devi has made a new history of winning a medal at Youth Olympics in Judo.
Sixteenth year old woman Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
Her father sold a day-to-day and mother fish.
Many times there was such a situation that they didn't even have the meaning of buying food.
This kind of situation has also given rise to Tababi Devi's inspiration.
He has created history for winning medals for the country.
There are many other women who are inspired by their lives.
Every young sportsperson, their enthusiasm is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, you all remember that we have successfully organised the FIFAUNDER 17 WORLD CUP in 2017.
It has also been praised among the world's most successful editions.
FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUPRECORD has broken the number of audience.
More than 12 lakh visitors have seen footballs in different stadiums of the country and have encouraged young sportspersons.
This time, India has achieved the privilege of World Cup Hockey Organization in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will be held from 28th November to 16th December.
Any Indian who loves the game, there is a different place for Hackathon.
India has a golden history in the hockey game.
In the past, India has won gold a few times and has won the world once.
India has also gifted a few world class players in the hockey games.
If there is anywhere in the world about Hockey, then it remains incomplete if the name of India is removed.
Haqqi's magician Major Dhyanchand is known all over the world.
Besides, Balavindar Singh Synergy, Lessley Cludius, Mohammad Saheed, Dhanraj Pillai from Udham Singh has illuminated Indias name in the world.
Even today, the hockey sportspersons of Team India are showcasing success to the new generations in labour and dedication.
It gives a unique experience to sportspersons sitting in the stadium.
While visiting Bhubaneswar, we will encourage not only Indian teams but all nations.
There is a heritage of prosperity and cultural excellence and the people of Orissa have to keep in mind the spirit of inspiration.
Orissa is also a good opportunity for sports lovers.
I also convey my best wishes to the rest of the world.
My dear countrymen, many people are moving forward in the work of social service, valentiering and inspiring the people of the country.
A young man has also made a pledge to learn a wheelchair basketball to play a basketball in Wheelchair.
This is the mentality, this is the self-employment. This is the mission mode activity.
There will be no Indian who will not be proud of this.
This spirit will inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I saw your proposals about Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to see a thrilling statement from Mr. Manish Mahapatra of Puducherry.
He said in MyGov, Please tell us about the best examples of how the people of India and its traditions and traditions are united with nature.
We need to learn something from the stakeholders of our lives.
I express my gratitude to you for keeping this thing in front of the audience of Mann Ki Baat.
It is such a thing that I inspire us to look back to our glorious past and culture, today the world is discussing environmental conservation, and is looking for a new way for balanced lifestyle.
Today, our India is not far from this problem, but we have to review it for its solution.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship plants and flowers as Goddesses.
The Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship trees like Butt, Arjuna with respect.
In a desert like Rajasthan, Vishnoi has shown us the way for environment conservation.
They are also ready to leave their lives for tree conservation, but they are not ready to acknowledge the loss of a tree.
Mishmirara of Arunachal recognises his relationship with the tiger.
They mean to call him their brothers and sisters.
The tiger is also seen as the protector of the forest in Nagaland.
The people of the Worli community of Maharashtra are the guests of the tigers and are the symbols of prosperity for them.
The Kola community of Madhya Pradesh means that their fate is connected to the tigers and if the tiger is not eaten then the villagers will also have to stay intact.
The Gond Tribals of Madhya India stop fishing at some places of the Kyan river at the Breeding Season.
These places are the refugees of the fish, and they are very fresh fishing.
Tribal communities build their homes from natural materials, which are strong and eco-friendly.
In southern India, there is a small jewellery community in the remote areas of Nilgiri Mountain, Tora, who have traditionally built their habitations from the local level.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is true that tribal communities believe in being very peaceful and together, but whenever someone harms their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that among our first freedom fighters, the tribal community was also there.
Who can forget Lord Veerasa Munda, who fought hard against British rule to protect his forests.
There are many examples of tribal communities who teach us how to save us with nature and for the forest resources that are surrounding us, our country is borrowed with tribal communities.
Come on, we respect them.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those people and their problems who are doing something extraordinary for the society.
The works that seem to be normal but in fact it has a far-reaching impact on the change of our mindset and the goal of the society.
A few days ago, I was studying about the Gurubachan Singh ji of Panjab.
A common and hard worker farmer was married to Gurubachan Singh ji's son.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan Singh-ji Kaner had told her mother-in-law that she would do this marriage in October.
Then he suddenly said, he has a bed.
Nowadays, if we talk about marriage, it seems usually that he's going to talk about a big snake, ask for something that will make Kannar's family difficult.
But you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurubachan Singh was a simple white-hearted farmer, he told Kaneer father that the promise that is talking about is the real power of the society.
Gurubachan Singh ji said, You should talk to me, from now on, do not wear the remains of the crop after cutting the crops in the field of agriculture.
You can imagine how big social power is hidden.
Guru Bachan Singh ji seems to be extraordinary but his personality, and we have seen that there are many such families in our society who have transformed personal matters into the good work of society.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh Ji has set an example like this.
I read about another village in Punjab, Kallar Majra, which is near the Navar.
Kallar Majra was in 1947 because the people there did not burn the rice skin and mix it with the soil, so that the technologies needed themselves.
My best wishes to my brother Gurubachan Singh Ji.
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and those places who are making their best efforts to free the environment.
You all are taking the right path of healthy lifestyle available in the Indian heritage framework.
The way the sea is generated with drop-drop water, such small awareness and positive work is always very helpful in creating a positive environment.
India has a special significance for the 21st November this year, as the first World War ended on November 21 a hundred years ago.
That is, the last hundred years of the destruction and democracies.
The first war for India is an important event.
In fact, we didn't have any connection with this great war.
In spite of this, the soldiers of our country fought with Bahaduri in this war, played a very big role and sacrificed the highest number.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not behind anybody in the battlefield.
Our soldiers have shown their valour in the remote areas.
It was one of the objectives of restoration of peace.
In the first World War, the whole world looked at destruction.
It is estimated that about one crore soldiers and more civilians lost their lives.
After this terrible war, the whole world was aware of the importance of peace.
In the last hundred years, the language of peace has changed.
My dear countrymen, there is a special feature in the north-east of this country.
The natural beauty here is unique and the people here are very talented.
Our North-East is now known for the best and great work.
This is a place where organic farming has improved a lot.
A few days ago, the Honble Future Policy Gold Award has won Sikkim for encouraging long-term food systems.
The award was given by the FAO Earth Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations.
You will be happy to know that the awards given to the best policy in this specific field are equal to Oscar.
Not only this, our Sikkim has won this award by losing one of the fifteen countries.
I thank the people of Sikkim for this.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is going to end.
