Mann Ki Baat October 2019
My dear countrymen, you are namaskars.
Today is the holy day of Diwali.
Today, Diwali is being celebrated in many countries of the world.
The speciality of this festival is that not only the Indian community but also the governments of different countries, the citizens there, and the social organisations there, are celebrated with happiness and joy.
There is a micro world in India.
Friends, Tourist Festival Tourism has its own attraction in the world.
In our country, all the regions have their own diversity festivals and the people of other countries have special interest in them.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something different for this Diwali in the last Mann Ki Baat.
I said, Come together, let us all celebrate Diwali this time, the women's strength and achievements of India, that is, we can respect Laxmi of India.
Immediately, there were innumerable stories inspired by the social media.
Written on the Namo App, the corpse of Warangal, my mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took responsibility for five children.
Today, we have five brothers engaged in good work.
My prayers to your mother.
Geetika Swami, who is acting in the field, says that she is the daughter of the bus conductor, Major Kushbu Kanwar Bharat Lakshmi, led by the people-viman section of the Assam Rifles.
Their daughter Bharatlakshmi is their own strength for poet Tiwari.
They are very proud of his daughter being a best painter.
The girl got a good rank in the CAT exam.
At the same time, Megha Jain writes about a 92-year-old old man who has distributed free drinking water to Gwalior Railway Station for years.
Meghazi is inspiring by the wisdom and compassion of this Bharat Laxmi.
Many stories like this have been shared by people.
You must read, inspire, share your things...
The emotions of that poet, and the words of it are now written in the fifteenth century.
How great words, how great emotions, how good thoughts are in this poem of Kannada language
Painida Permegondan, the glacier of Pinnyda Bhrigu, the priest of Pinnyda, Jasulidanu, the hill king Himavaan, because of his daughter Parvati, Bhrigumuni, because of his daughter Lakshmi, the king of Janakraja was famous because of his daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride.
The greatness of these daughters is a strong personality for our society and a bright future.
Dear countrymen, on 12th November, 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
I have never forgotten my visit to the Gurudwaras of Vankur and Tehran.
I have a lot of things related to Shri Guru Nanak Dev, who can share with you, but it will take several applications of Mann Ki Baat.
He stood firm on many evils like touch.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji brought his message far away from the world.
He was the most traveller at that time.
Everybody's heart was fainted by his lust, humility and behaviour like the common man.
The great religious journey of Guru Nanak Dev ji is said to be Udayasi.
With the message of harmony and equality, he went to the north, south, east, west, and saw people, saints and sages directly everywhere.
The well-known saint Shankardev of Assam is also believed to be inspired by him.
Rajgir, Gaya, associated with Buddhism, went to pilgrimages.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has gone to Sri Lanka in South India.
During the journey to Beedar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water there.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Beedar which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji.
During a journey like this, Guru Nanakji traveled in Kashmir and environment in north India.
This has established a strong relationship between the Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also visited Tibet and the people of that place considered him a Guru.
He is also a priest in Uzbekistan, who has gone.
He has also visited Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He has touched the minds of millions of people, according to his suggestions, he still follows.
A few days ago, diplomatic delegates from around 85 countries went to Amritsar via Delhi.
They visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which marked the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
The Democratic Delegates visited the Golden Temple and also got the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions and culture.
After that, many ambsdars shared the pictures there in the social media and wrote about good experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember 31st October.
That day, on the lines of unity of this country, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the steel man of India.
Sardar Patel was surprising to unite the people, as well as to the emotional dictators.
Sardar Patel was watching and learning every small thing deeply.
He was a personality of analysis in the true sense.
In addition to this, he was also excellent in the organizational capacity.
He was skilled in formulating projects and improving war strategies.
While reading and listening to Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, he will understand how deep his preparation was.
In 1921, thousands of people from all over the country came to participate in the congress conference in Ahmedabad.
Patel was responsible for making all arrangements related to the Mahasambhiyan.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
Nobody has a problem with water.
He was associated with farmers and asked to build Khadi Bags.
The farmers made a bag and sold to the delegates.
Representatives needed the fear of shoes to be stolen due to shoes and shoes being kept in these bags.
On the other hand, there was a lot of increase in Khadi sales.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constituent Assembly.
He spoke of the importance of ensuring fundamental rights, thereby noting the possibility of any kind of difference in caste-religion.
Friends, We know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done the right to unite our nations.
It was Sardar Vallabhbhai's specialty to note everything.
After the partition of India in 1947, the eyes of our neighbours fell on Lakshadweep, and they shipped there with the flag of that country.
Sardar Patel, after paying attention to this, started a tough action immediately without a short time.
He directed the brothers of Arkot Ramaswamy and Arkot Lakshmanaswamy and others to bring them from Thiruvananthapuram to Lakshadweep and raise the three-fold flag in Lakshadweep.
Soon, there was a triangular flag and the land was widespread watching the dream of Lakshadweep's neighbourhood.
After this incident, Sardar Patel and other brothers were instructed to ensure that all the assistance required for the development of Lakshadweep is available.
Today Lakshadweep is playing an important role in the development of India.
This is an attractive tourist destination.
I hope you and these beautiful islands and seashores will be visiting.
Friends, I dedicated to the Statue of Unity and the world on 31st October, 2018 in memory of Sardar Patel.
It's the world's highest statue.
The Statue of Liberty in America has doubled.
The world's highest statue is proud of all Indians.
The heads of every Indian are proud.
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh visitors coming to the Statue of Unity within a year.
I am sure the people there are now farming of dragon fruits, which will change the main source of livelihood of the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unit can be a study.
We have witnessed how a place is developing as a world-renowned tourist destination within a year.
There are people from all over the country and abroad.
Several arrangements are being developed in one another after the other, such as travel facilities, habitations, guides, environment friendly arrangements etc.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, The last day Time Magazine is an Indian who is not proud of giving a great place to the Statue of Unity in a group of 100 major tourist destinations in the world.
I hope you're going to see the Statue of Unity by changing some time from your valuable time.
But all the Indians who have found time for the journey should go to at least 15 tourist destinations with their families and my request to stay at night.
Friends, As you know, from 2014 to 31st October every year, we celebrate the political unity day.
On this day, we have a message to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country.
The World For Unit is being organised every time on 31st October.
People from all sections of the society will participate in this.
It is a symbol of this country that the For Unity goes to the same direction and wants to achieve the same goal.
Likewise, there is a special interest and zeal among these people about Marthon.
The telephone unit is also a beautiful opportunity.
Running is beneficial for mind, mind and body.
That is why not only the body but also the unity of the mind and the unity of the cultural India, it will bring India to new heights.
So if you live in any city, you can see where the For Unit is going next.
I hope you all will run your own fitness for the unity of India on 31st October.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has blamed the unity of the country.
Dear countrymen, our society was always very active and vigilant to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the nation.
If we look at ourselves, we can see many examples of continuous efforts to enhance mutual harmony.
However, sometimes the problems of the society and its contributions are regular to break faster than the memory.
A lot of people in different ways went to the field.
All kinds of opponents were playing games to achieve their own way from the environment.
What kind of language has been spoken to make the environment warm
Efforts have been made to communicate with different voices.
We recall what some architects and some architects have spoken to themselves to make it important.
Recognizing the court's excellence with great pride, no one allowed to create an environment that warms and stresses the society anywhere.
We have to remember these things everyday, which gives us a lot of strength.
Those days, those moments give us a sense of duty.
This is an example of how much power is given to the nation, the voice of unity.
It was a big blow to the country.
I pay homage to that gentleman today.
Friends, If you hear a story from home today, if you can hear a story from every village, from the north to the south, from the east to the west and from every corner of India then it is about cleanliness.
Every individual, every family and every village has been inspired to share their experience of sanitation because this effort for sanitation is an effort of 125 crore Indians.
Its rights are 125 crore Indians.
But it's also a pleasant and attractive magnificence.
I'm listening to you.
The world's largest battlefield, the temperature is 50-60 degree mines.
The air has only the name of oxygen.
It is a great adventurous thing to live amidst such challenges in such a opposite environment.
In such a completely opposite environment, our brave men are not only looking at our borders from the chest, but also a programme called Clean Siachen.
We know the ice slopes of Siachen are the source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, it means that the people living in the valleys should ensure clean water and they use water in rivers like Nubra, Shayok.
Festival is an opportunity to awaken the spirit of all of us.
If you are lamps, especially buy something new, bring something from the market, it is going on at least in the family.
I once told you to try to buy local goods.
If the things we need are available in our village, then there is no need to go to Taluk.
If you get to Taluk, you don't have to go to the district.
As much as we can try to buy local goods, Gandhi will become a great opportunity for himself.
We have to buy anything that our khadi gates have been brought to the hands of our gentlemen.
I urge you to buy local goods with the greetings of Deepavali.
Look, we can also play an important role in realizing the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
But sometimes due to carelessness there is burning.
There can be bursts.
I urge you to regulate yourself, celebrate the festival with enthusiasm.
My best wishes.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
There will be no Indian who doesn't feel proud of our armed forces, our soldiers.
Every Indian is always enthusiastic to showcase his happiness and support to our soldiers, whether in any region or in any caste-sector or in any language.
Yesterday, 150 crore people of India were celebrated with pride as the day of the Paradise of our armed forces.
We recalled the Surgical Strike in 2016, when our soldiers responded to those who showed the impression of war against terrorism against our nation.
Our Armed Forces Exhibitions have been organised in different parts of the country with a view to know the greater citizens of the country, especially the younger generation.
We are so capable of knowing how our soldiers pay their lives and protect the people.
The day like Parakram Parva reminds the youth of our Armed Forces of the pride of tradition.
It inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also attended a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of heroes.
Our army is sure to respond to those who try to make peace free in our country.
India has always been committed to peace and commitment.
In the 20th century, over one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed great sacrifices for peace in two world wars.
And that's what we didn't have to do with that war.
It was in the culmination of our soldiers for peace.
Even today, India is one of the most armed countries of the United Nations peacekeeping forces.
Our brave soldiers have played an important role in establishing peace in the world by wearing blue helmet for decades.
My dear countrymen, things in the sky are different.
We celebrate Air Force Day on 8th October.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the air warriors and their families who have served for the country.
When the invaders from Pakistan started a sudden attack in 1947, the Air Force ensured that the Indian soldiers and war equipment reach the battlefield to protect Sri Nagar from the invaders.
The Air Force responded to the enemy in 1965.
Nobody knows the 1971 freedom struggle.
In 1999, the Air Force has continuated its role in evacuating Kargil from cross-borders.
At Tiger Hill, the Air Force attacked the enemy's camps in the night and ruined them.
I am grateful to the Air Force for the work done by our Air Force personnel in a commendable manner, whether it is a rescue mission to prevent accidents or accidents.
India is proud to say that not only men's strength in the armed forces but also women's strength.
Tommy was distressed by the country.
You know Abhilash Tommy is a very brave hero.
He is the first Indian to world with a small innovation without the help of a modern technology alone.
For the last 80 days, he continued his journey to the ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the Southern Hind Sea, but the horrific ocean cyclone caused him a danger.
However, the bravery of the Indian Navy has been fighting for many days in the sea.
He was in the midst of the sea without eating and drinking anything.
I didn't agree to defeat life.
I spoke on telephone when I saved Abhilash from the ocean.
The strength of his courage, compassion, determination and victory will definitely inspire the younger generation of our country.
Friends, Everyone knows what is the significance of October 2 for our nation.
This year, on 2nd October, there is a great significance.
For two years from now on, we are going to conduct various programmes across the world on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have inspired the entire world.
Later in 1945, when the freedom struggle was strengthened, he revised the ideas and prepared a new edition.
His thoughts have been placed before the people about the rights of the priests, farmers, villages and workers and several issues such as cleanliness, education and dissemination.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
The supreme father was a mass organiser.
It was Baba's specialty to join people and join them, which was his habit.
It has been experienced by everyone as the most important feature of his personality.
He conveyed to every person that the person is the most important and always required for the country.
His most important contribution to the freedom struggle is that he made it a massive remembrance.
As per the call of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle, people from all sections of the society have been dedicated to themselves.
In that, Gandhiji says, I'm giving you a mantra.
You'll feel that your sensitivity is filthy, and you'll feel that it's filthy.
My dear countrymen, this mantra of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, we have to think about the rising middle class of the country, their increasing economic strength and growing efficiency.
Can we remember the supreme father for a minute when we go to buy something
Can you remember the mantra of the priest father
Can you imagine what citizens of the country have achieved due to what I buy
Whose face will enjoy
Who do you have direct or indirect benefits by buying it
I'll be happy if the poorest of the poor get the benefits.
This is Gandhiji's mantra, this is Gandhiji's message and I am sure you will make a big change in the lives of the poorest and weakest person.
My dear people, Gandhiji said that if you clean the premises then he might not even know how it was.
But it happened, India got freedom.
Similarly, in the economic growth of my country by minimal activity, we feel that how we have a greater contribution in the economic empowerment of our country in fighting poverty.
But I believe that if you do that then it will be the real patriotic devotion of today's age.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Scientific Khadi's old and dressed clothes were also kept in mind because somebody's dress was lost.
He added that all these khadi clothes are made very modern and should be used for each of these nails.
This feeling of tea and affection for the people of the country was full of every corner of the small and long great man.
After two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Scientists along with Pujaya Baba.
As soon as the name of Scientific Ji comes, the Indians will brighten the great respect in our minds.
His harmonious personality is always proud for the people.
Besides, he was very humble but he had a strong personality like a mountain inside him, the speciality of Lal Bahadur Scientist Ji.
His imagination of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan shows his brilliant personality.
He gave the mantra of reaching the summit of victory to the soldiers and farmers of the country during the narrow regime of about one and a half years.
People from all levels of the country are associated with the fifteenth day of Thiti.
If you didn't call on this topic after the construction of toilets then people associated with cleanliness didn't even have such a heart touching thing.
I want to thank you specially for the phone.
The concluding ceremony of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October, 2018 with the launch of the 100th birth anniversary celebrations of Baba.
Dear people, there is a saying in culture that is Swarajya Syath.
In the Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the basic rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was constituted on 12th October, 1993.
Over a few days, the Commission has completed its 25 years.
The Human Rights Commission has not only waited for human rights but also enhanced human dignity.
Our favourite leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has clearly stated that humanity is not an imagination for us.
During this 25-year visit, this institute has created an ideal and reliable environment among the people.
I think this is a very vibrant event for a healthy society and the best democratic values.
Today, Human Rights Commissions have been set up in 26 States along with national human rights activity.
As a society, we need to understand the human rights and bring it into action, this is the basis of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas, Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas.
Dear countrymen, if the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan is coming in the month of October, you cannot remember that the birth centenary of Rajmata Vijayraj Sindhya starts.
These great personalities are very inspired by us and we are praising them.
On 31st October, Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, the next Manki Baat speaks detailedly, but for a few years, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, on 31st October, the Run for Unity is being held in all small towns, villages and streets in India.
This year, we have to organise a Forum Unit in our villages, streets, cities and cities.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the nation throughout his life.
On October 31, we should focus on our efforts to combine all sections of the society and all the components of the country on the lines of unity.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today, the country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
My best wishes to all the people on this holy day.
Raksha Bandhan is considered a symbol of mutual love and faith of brothers and sisters.
This festival is an important example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, there are many stories that have enshrined the people of two different countries or religions on the lines of faith.
Now in a few days, Janmashtami is being celebrated.
Congratulations to all the people of Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
Friends, Besides Raksha Bandhan, on the occasion of Shravana Purnima, Sanskrit Day is celebrated.
I compliment all those who are engaged in the development of this great heritage and reaching the common man.
We are very proud that Tamil is the oldest language in the world, but from Vedic times to today, culture has played a very important role in the campaign of knowledge.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Matur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are still talking to each other in culture.
Therefore, in any microbe micro emotions or subjects can also be explained properly.
It is easier to understand that it is associated with our soil and our traditions.
For example, the importance of the Guru in life is to be acquainted with the importance of the Guru - the Ekmapi Lecture Guru, the disciple, the Pragatiyetvam Nasti Tadvam, the Yad-Datwahyanarani Bhavet.
The name of Sarva Vallabh is Radhakrishnan.
His birth anniversary is celebrated all over the country as Teachers Day.
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the occasion of Teachers Day.
At the same time, I appreciate your dedication to science, education and students.
Friends, Our farmers who work hard for years come with new hopes.
Rainfall provides relief to trees, trees and dry waterfalls in the horrific summer.
But sometimes the floods of terrible and destructive floods come along.
Nature is at some places where there is more rain than drying.
We have already seen that the terrible floods in Kerala have affected the lives of people in a very serious way.
Today, the entire country is with Kerala in this distress.
We have condolences to those who lost their own.
Though the loss of life cannot be solved, I would like to assure the sorrowful families that 250 crore Indians are attached to your shoulders during this sad moment.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity will be healthy at the earliest.
I am confident that due to the enthusiasm and unprecedented courage of the people, Kerala will be able to grow.
The damage to the accidents is unfortunate.
But we can see how many views of humanity at the moment of danger.
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something in their own form to revive the lives of people from Kerala or any other state of Hindustan or district or region.
Every age and every workforce has their own role.
Everyone is making their contribution to the hardship of the people of Kerala to reduce and share their sorrows.
We know that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are leading the rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried to save people in floods.
Friends, This time Mann Ki Baat's suggestions were tested.
The subject of more people from all over the country was Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the beloved one of us.
Kirti from Gaziaabad, Swati from Sonipat, Pravin from Kerala, Dr. Dream Bannerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, asked him to say about various steps in the life of Atal ji.
On August 16, the country and the world are sorry to hear the death of Atal ji.
14 years ago, the Prime Minister was the leader of the nation.
In a way, he had been away from active politics for the last 10 years.
The news didn't take place, it wasn't appeared in public life.
The gap of 10 years is very big, but after August 16, the country and the world have seen that the period of ten years in the mind of the common man of India has not been made a minute interval.
The kind of love and respect for Atal ji, the sorrow that spreads all over the country, shows his vast personality.
India will be associated with Atal ji in the name of the 1990 First Constitution Amendment of 2003.
This change has made two major changes in Indian politics.
First, the size of the Cabinet in the States has been fixed at 15 of the total number of seats.
Secondly, the limit determined by the Prevention of Criminals Act has been changed to one-third and two.
In addition to this, clear guidelines have been decided to disqualify those who change the party.
For years, the political culture of building a large cabinet in India has been formed and the formation of big cabinets was not divided by departments but also to enjoy political leaders.
Atal ji changed it.
His step was waiting for money and resources.
And more efficient.
This transformation is the vision of a person like Atal ji, and our political culture and healthy habits have grown.
Atal ji was a native devotee.
The time of presenting the budget was changed during his tenure.
Earlier, after following the tradition of the British, the budget was presented at 5 o'clock in the evening because it was the time to start the Parliament in England.
In 2001, when Atal ji presented the budget, it was 5 in the evening to 11 in the morning.
One more freedom - the Indian Flag Code was created during Atal ji's regime and gave it authority in 2002.
Departments have also joined the National Flag at public places.
It is a good thing and good wishes for democracy.
It will be a good tribute to Atal ji for a healthy democracy, a good democracy, a good habit, a constant effort to strengthen democracy, advancing discussions with an open mind.
Reiterating his commitment to fulfil his dream of a developing and prosperous India, I pay tributes to Atal ji for all.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament ended a few days ago.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha (Productivity) is 118 percent of the Rajya Sabha is 74 percent.
The Lok Sabha has passed 21 Bills and 14 Bills of Rajya Sabha as a result of the efforts of all members to make the Monsoon Session efficient than party interest.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be recalled as a conclave of social justice and youth.
In this session, important bills for the benefit of youth and backward communities were passed.
For decades, the need to set up the OBC Commission like Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes Commission was increasing.
In order to ensure the rights of Backward Classes, the country has successfully decided to form the OBC Commission this time and has given its constitutional authority.
This step will become one of the leading objectives of social justice.
The Amendment Bill for the Rights of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes was passed in this session.
This law will provide more protection to the good of Scheduled Tribes.
It will also prevent the criminals from injuring them, and the force will fill their confidence in the memorials.
There is no injustice and cultural society against women's power in the country.
The country is not ready to tolerate the guilty.
Therefore, by passing the Parliament Penal Code Amendment Bill, the Department of Penalties has ensured strict punishment.
You might have read in the paper a few days ago that the person who was not adulterated by adulterating a child in a two-month trial for the death of a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh completed the trial in five days and sentenced the culprits.
The court of Rajasthan has taken such a quick decision.
This law will play an excellent role in preventing crimes against women and girls.
Besides social change, economic progress is incomplete.
But I would like to assure the Muslim women that the entire country is full of strength to bring justice to them.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Parliamentarians of the country on this occasion.
Dear countrymen, the attention of millions of people is now focused on Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every day in the morning, people are looking for a medal in the newspapers, televisions, news and social media.
Asian games are still running.
Congratulations to all the medal winners for the country.
Our daughters are very popular among those who have received medals for the country, this is a very positive sign.
The young sportspersons of the medal are 15-16 years old.
It is also a good sign that most of the medal winners are living in small streets and villages and they have achieved this success through hard work.
I once again congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and wish the rest of the sportspersons well.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
Namaskar Bhavnaji, I respect the idea of the child.
We have seen building houses and buildings with stones, but can you imagine the construction of a mountain that was a single rock about 1200 years ago that was a magnificent, wide and wonderful temple
However, the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where this unbelievable combination of architecture and engineering can be seen.
The Westerners, known as Rani Ki Vav, built in the eleventh century in Paan in Gujarat, will be surprised.
The land of India was an engineering laboratory.
He is the Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
He is a priest in that part of the country and the rest of the country remembers him with great respect and affection.
In his memory, September 15 is celebrated as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, our engineers have shown their unique personality all over the world.
Now, when we are celebrating Engineers Day, we also have to think about the future.
We have to workshops there.
Disaster management has become a big thing now.
The world is facing natural evils.
What kind of structural engineering should be in this situation
How can we determine the preference to manufacturing without waste
We have to think about many such things when we celebrate the engineering day.
See you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
Because of India's geography and diversity, sometimes rains are showing love.
But why do we blame the rain
V.
In Thailand, the 12 children of football players took their coaches to the cave when they were driven away.
It takes a few hours to go inside and get out of the cave.
Because they didn't find any other way, they searched for a piece on a small rock inside the cave - that's not one or two days, but ten days.
If you see the death in front of the children, you can see how the moments will be when you have to keep it straight every moment.
On the one hand, they were straightening the accident, on the other hand, human values were emerging together with humans in the world.
People from all over the world were praying to get these children safely.
But finally, when a good news came, it was peaceful for the world.
But I feel like seeing this incident in another way.
Everyone participated in this mission as a team.
I think it is important to learn and understand the behaviour of everyone.
In this endeavour, a young man from Thailand's Navy had to sacrifice his life.
It is surprising that the world is surprised that they have not hoped so bravely and sorrowfully in a dark cave full of water despite such a difficult situation.
It shows that marvellous things happen when humanity joins together.
It was a special feature of the poems of Neeraj ji that showcased hope, faith, determination and confidence.
Everything we say to the Indians is very powerful and inspiring.
It's dark.
I pay homage to Shri Neeraj Ji.
Namaste Prime Minister, my name is true.
This year I have been administered as the first year student in Delhi University.
Our school board talked about the tension and education of your exams at the time of examination, what is your message to students like me
The months of July and August are very important for farmers and for the youth.
Because it's called the Peak Season of Colleges.
This is the time when lakhs of youngsters from school to college like truth.
February and March are the time for the exam papers and answers to play the holidays of April May, and wait for a resolute resolution, to decide the direction in life and choose a career.
Children come from the shadow of their parents to the shadow of professionals.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy from the beginning of their life.
For the first time, he went out of the house, went out of the village and got out of a safe environment and had to be controlled.
So many youngsters have left their homes for the first time to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students must have joined their colleges and some will be ready to join.
I want to tell you to be calm, enjoy life, know the joy of intuitiveness in life.
There is no way out of books, it should be learning, but there is a habit of finding new things.
The value of old friends is very big.
The childhood friends are narrow, but it is a matter of sensitivity that they are looking for and maintaining new friends.
Learn something new, get new skills, learn new languages.
Now, while talking about the season of the season, a student from a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh was showing the news about how Ashram Chaudhari had won and won the difficulties in life.
There are so many students who have done inspiring things that are inspired by ourselves and dedication from the poorest of the poor.
Father DDC driver Prince Kumar of Delhi and Abhay Gupta, who was studying under the Street Light in Phudpath, Kolkata, and daughter of Auto Rickshaw driver Ahmedabad, Afrien Shaikh and congratulated the daughters of the school bus driver Nagpur, Khushi and father's guardian, Kartik of Haryana, who worked in his father's lovers.
If we look around, we can see many examples like this.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives strength to my mind and inspires me.
I was interacting with the Indian youth at Sanjos, a technological hub in America.
I told them how they can use their capabilities for India, and do something in time.
I asked brain stiffness to convert brain drive into brain gene.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Vajpayee have made a different effort by adopting this challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together prepared a Smart Gaw App using their professional skills.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village to the world but also makes them know any information and knowledge on their own mobile phones.
The villagers, village heads, district magistrates and CDOs of Taudhakpur village in Rai Bareli inspired the people to use this app.
The App is a way of bringing a digital revolution in the village and it is easier to record, track and monitor all the development works in the village.
The App also includes the phone directory, News section, Ents List, Health Centre and Information Centre in the village.
The App is very beneficial for the farmers and the farmers of the App is beneficial as a market for their produce in a way.
If you look at this incident then the young man is living in America, his lifestyle and thoughts, India will leave several years ago, but he knows the entire corner of his village, understands the challenges, feels emotional relations with the village.
But sometimes due to lack of time, sometimes because of the distance, sometimes due to the environment, the thin layer of the mood gets covered, but if a small drain touches it then all things appear again and takes it to the past.
Santosh ji, thank you for your phone call.
Of course, Parpurwari is a wonderful pilgrimage.
Friends, Asha Ekadashi is celebrated this time in July 23.
Parpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Approximately 15-20 days before the Asha Akadeshi, the pilgrims i.e. the pilgrimage goes on foot with the teeth.
Millions of news are participating in this journey called Vari.
Pilgrims reach there for a visit to Vithoba and Vithoba, called Vithoba and Panduranga.
Bhagwan Vithal is the best of the poor, the deprived and the victims.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense respect and devotion.
It is a different experience of going to the Vedoba temple in Pampur and its glory, beauty and spiritual joy.
If I get the opportunity to tell the listeners of Manki Baat, I must definitely participate in Parpur Vari once.
Innumerable pilgrimages like Gyaneshwar, Namadev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram are still informing the common man of Maharashtra.
It is powerful to fight against blind respect, and in every corner of Hindustan, this saint tradition is inspiring.
The message of harmony, love and brotherhood is obtained from all the perceptions related to it.
There is a mantra of fighting society with respect to blind respect.
The worldman was a brave and self-confidence person.
He had the power and understanding of the British rulers to show their fault.
The British feared him that he would try to combat the traitor three times within twenty years.
It's not a small thing.
I would like to present a joyous event related to the world-class Tilak and one of his statues in Ahmedabad.
When he reached Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people came here to welcome him about a hundred years ago, during this journey, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to talk to him.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was very impressed by the worldman Tilak.
Naturally, the British were uncomfortable and the Collector continued to permit it.
However, Sardar Saheb was Sardar Saheb and he was firm and firmly determined that if he had to leave his position, he would have to establish the statue of the world class.
Finally, the statue was built and not on 28th February, 1929, it was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi.
The Ganesh Festival has been started as a result of the efforts of the World Head.
Besides celebrating the Ganesh Festival with traditional respect and festive festiveness, social awareness has become a strong medium for enhancement of harmony and equality among the people.
It was a time to fight against the British in the country.
It shows that even today our younger generation is interested in our ancient heritage and our heroes of history.
Today, you can see Ganesh Mandaps in many cities and streets.
This is a good opportunity for our youth to learn about leadership, organisational understanding and develop their capabilities.
This time, from the idol of Ganesh, all the decorations should be environmentally friendly and there should be a competition of environmentally friendly Ganesha festivals in all cities.
I'll surely get all this to the people.
The world-class people believe in the people, become a milestone, self-reliance is our birth rights, it will be achieved.
Even today, it is time to say that Swaraj is our birth rights.
All Indians should have good results of governance and development.
This is the creation of a new India.
The same day, 50 years after the birth of Tilak, i.e. on July 23, the second son of Bharatamba was born.
He sacrificed his life assuming that we should breathe the wind of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrasekhar Azad.
Any young man who has not been inspired to hear these curtains will be in India and many youngsters like Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna Ab Hamare Dil Me Haidekhana Hai Jor Kitana, Baju-e-Kat Mae Hai, Ashfaq Unah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad have been inspired.
The courage of Chandrashekhar Azad and his enthusiasm for freedom inspired many youngsters.
Azad had lost his life, but he never bowed his head to foreign rule.
Just a few days ago, the Junior Under 20 World Athletic Championship in Finland has created history by winning the Golden Medal of Indias brave lady and farmer daughter Hima Das.
Our second daughter, in response to me to fear unity, I e-Mailed the preparations for the Asian Games from Indonesia.
In the e-mail, I am proud that the most important moment in the life of an athlete is the triangular flag, which I have achieved.
Ekta, we all are proud of it.
The name of the unity land has been bright.
World Para Athletic Grand Principles in Tunisia received Gold and Bronze medals in 2018.
My best wishes to Ekta fear, Yogeshi Kuthi and Sundarsingh for your courage.
My best wishes to all of you, on the occasion of August this month, which marks a number of festivals that have been held for centuries.
Once again, we can join Mann Ki Baat again.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, a cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You can clearly understand that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
The two teams showcased good performance in this game.
Bowler Rashid Khan from Afghanistan showcased a good exhibition in IPL this year.
I remember, President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani tagged me and said, "The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to my Indian friends for preparing a platform to showcase their talent for our sportspersons.
Rashid Khan is representing the big sportspersons in Afghanistan.
The Indian team has done something that is a model for the entire world.
When the Indian team bought Trophy, it was the first to call the Afghan team to participate in the International Competition.
My best wishes to the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I am sure we will still participate in sports with each other's sportsman spirit.
Dear countrymen, on 21st June, the fourth Yoga Day was presented with a unique sight.
Looks like the whole world is united.
At the high snowy peak of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China conducted Yoga exercises together.
Yoga is working to unite people by breaking all the borders.
Thousands of enthusiasts from more than 100 countries have made this festival a big festival without caste, religion, region, color and women.
It is natural that people from all over the world have participated in Yoga Day programmes so excitingly that it has double enthusiasm in India.
It is a matter of pride that the country is proud that 250 crore people have practiced Yoga in the security forces of our country and in the skies of water and water.
Some brave soldiers performed yoga in the inter-water and some of them practiced yoga in the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force have practiced Yoga at a height of 10,000 feet from the earth in the midst of the sky.
They have done yoga on a swimming foot in the sky, not on the plane.
Yoga was conducted in schools, colleges, offices, gardens, high buildings and sports.
Yoga has joined the people across the world across castes, religions and regions and have believed that for centuries, we have been the family of Vasudhaiva.
Our sages, sages and other pilgrimages have been shown in the form of Yoga.
More and more people will make this part of their lives.
My dear countrymen, I have written in MyGov and Narendra Modi App to tell you about the Doctors Day coming to one July in Mann Ki Baat this year.
It's okay.
Remember the doctor only if we get a problem.
But this is a day for the achievements of our doctors and this is the opportunity to thank them for their service and dedication to the society.
The role of the doctor is not confined to treat the disease.
Today, the doctor has medical expertise, and has a great experience about how it affects our lives.
With their talent and skill, Indian doctors have educated their personal marks all over the world.
Heads of the medical sector are well known for hard work as well as redressal of problems related to diagnostic treatment.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I convey my best wishes to all our doctors and friends on the occasion of Dr.
Dear countrymen, we are fortunate to be born in this land of India.
India has a prosperous history like a month or day without any historical event.
"Thank you very much for your phone call.
It's okay I'm coming to Magahar on 20th.
Do you know why he went to Magahar
There was a belief that those who died in Magahar wouldn't have heaven.
Those who die in Kashi will be heavenly pleased.
Magahar was considered absurd, but saint Kabir didn't believe it.
They are the same inspiring sources in today's era.
That is, the real holy saint knows and understands the pain of others.
The man who doesn't know the pain of the others is stupid.
At that time, the world was driven by adoration and conflict and he gave a message of peace and harmony.
Together with the world mind, he worked to overcome the ideas.
His words are true even after centuries.
Similarly, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev is a Guru.
He showed guidance to millions of people and has been a source of inspiration for centuries.
He taught Guru Nanak Dev to eradicate caste differences in the society and to alter humanity as a whole.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, 'Serving the poor and the poor is God's service.
In 2019, Guru Nanak Dev's 55th Prakash Parv will be celebrated.
I want all of us to be partners with enthusiasm and zeal.
I urge you all to think about how to celebrate Guru Nanak Dev's 55th Prakash Parva in the society and how to celebrate the world, about new ideas, new ideas, new ideas and concepts.
There is a history related to Punjab.
The terrible event that took place in Jallianwalabagh was a hundred years in 2019.
Dear people, Shriman Raman Kumar, from Rohini in Delhi, has written on the Mobile App on 6th July.
Shyamprasad is the birth anniversary of Mukherjee.
He has written to the people about Shyamprasad Mukherjee.
Thank you very much for the first time, Ramanji.
Dr.
In 1937, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation of the University of Kolkata in Bengali language.
It was for the first time that somebody in the Calcutta University was speaking in Bengali language in Convocation during the British rule.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
In a way, he laid the foundation stone for India and industrial development and built a strong platform.
In the first industrial policy of India announced in 1948, his ideas and visions have been sealed.
It was his dream that India should be skilled and prosperous to achieve industrial sustainability in all fields.
He wanted SMEs to pay attention to handicrafts, textiles and textiles.
The All India Handy Crafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi-Village Industries Board have been set up between 1948 and 1950 to provide financial assistance and institutional mechanism for proper development of slaughter and small industries.
The Minister said that Indias defence production is also required to be indigenously transformed.
The most important thing for Shyam Prasad Mukherjee was the integrity of India, for which he had to sacrifice his life at the age of only 25.
Come on.
People talked about their imaginations, happiness and their achievements.
In remote villages, girls are providing services from pension to passports to the elderly of the village through public service centres.
A sister in Chhattisgarh is doing ice cream industry with silk rice.
Like unknown light in Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters of the country are providing medicines at affordable prices to nearby villages.
A young man from West Bengal was looking for jobs two-three years ago and today a industry itself is successful.
Not only that, it also provides jobs to ten and fifty.
Scholars from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on key topics such as waste processing in the school at their young age.
There are some in the society, they don't talk of disappointments, don't talk of failures, don't try to convince, don't find any ways to unite.
In such an environment, when the common man comes with ideas and new enthusiasm and events in his life, it is not the best of the government.
The incident of a small child in a small village can also be inspired by 1. 5 billion people.
With the help of technology, when I spent time with the beneficiaries through video bridge, it was very comfortable and inspiring to do something.
A new joy, new zeal is a new inspiration to provide life to the poor in the poor.
I am very grateful to the people.
40-50 lakh people connected with this video bridge and gave me a new strength.
We can also feel the fragrance of goodness.
Last day, one thing came to me, it was a very different experience.
He worked successfully to increase the income of the farmers by making schemes related to farmers.
In a way, farmers have a big role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing, as well as ensuring double profits to the farmers.
That's why the seed bank has been built.
Women are looking at the things of this seedbank, and women are associated with it.
I knew everything, I didn't know anything, some knew it, some knew it, some knew it not, but millions of people are continuously doing some good things and greetings to everyone.
Friends, Dear countrymen, it is going to be a year in the middle of GST.
One Nation One Tax was the dream of people, and today it is really realized.
People from different political ideologies are sitting there, people from different states and people from different priorities, but the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken unanimously.
Before GST, there were several types of taxes in the country and there was only one kind of tax across the country.
GST is a success of honesty and is a festival of honesty.
Earlier, the complaint related to taxes in the country was raised by Inspector Raj.
IT, Information Technology and Information Technology have been replaced by the Inspector in GST.
From Return to Refund, everything is going on online through Information Technology.
GST was perhaps the worlds largest tax reform programme.
In India, such a huge tax reform has been initiated by the people of the country and by the people of the country, the success of GST has been ensured through the peoples power.
Generally, it was believed that such a big reform would take 5-7 years to achieve the full success of such a large population in such a large country.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar.
Navika Sagar Parikrama - Yes, I want to say something about them.
These six daughters of India, their team, have returned to India on May 21, after roaming around the world on the INSV shore over two and a half days in the sea.
Welcome to them all over the country.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to see these daughters and listen to their journeys.
Once again, I congratulate the world for enhancing the bravery of those daughters and the capabilities of the Navy, especially the Indian daughters are not bad.
Nobody wants adventure.
If we take care of the development of humanity then we will see that progress has been created from the womb of adventure.
Development is in the lap of adventure.
On May 16, 5 tribal children from a Ashram School in Maharashtra Chandrapur, Manisha Dhruve, Pramesh Ale, Ummanta Madavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam reached the world's highest peak.
These children of the Ashram School have been trained on August 2017 and have been trained in Vardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were selected under Machine Shaurya.
They won Everest as a name and made the country proud.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to those associated with Chandrapur School.
The next time, Sivangi Pathak, 16, was the youngest Indian girl to win Everest from Nepal.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those brave brave people, especially the daughters.
It tags each other and challenges them.
Everyone is involved in this Fit India Movement.
In the field of cinema, sports, ordinary people of the country, the soldiers of the army and the school teachers participated in this, listening to their comfort from all sides.
If we fit, India and Fit...
The captain of the Indian Cricket team, Vrida Kohli, has also challenged me, and I have adopted his challenge, it is a good thing.
Such challenges will fit us and encourage others to be fit.
My dear countrymen, you have heard about sports and sports at Mann Ki Baat several times.
Last time, the heroes of the Commonwealth Games spoke to us through this programme, Sir Namaskaram.
"Thank you very much for calling on the phone.
It is true that the games that were part of the life of all children were playing on every street in the past.
These games were particularly part of the summer.
Sometimes lunch, sometimes at night, after dinner, children were playing for hours very quietly.
Outdoor, Indore.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can be seen in these games.
The same game is known as different names in different places.
I'm from Gujarat.
A game in Gujarat is known as Chamel-Isto.
It plays 8:8 square square square bords with swords, or pigs or cloth.
This game was usually played in all the states.
In Karnataka, it was called Chaukabara in Madhya Pradesh and Pachikali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Thamizh in Tamil Nadu and Changpo in Rajasthan.
But when you play, you will understand that people of every country don't know the language, yes, yes.
It'll be said we can play this game too.
Anyone who doesn't play a child and a corpse in childhood.
Children and colony are playing in villages and cities.
Various names were called in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it was called Godibila or Karra Bila.
In Odisha, it is called Gulibadi, which is called Vitidalu in Maharashtra.
Some games have their own climate, season.
It's like the season to fly the sword.
When everybody flys the sword, everybody plays, the different qualities of us can be shown without any filth.
The big ones will be serious, but when they play, the child hidden in them comes out.
Traditional sports enhance physical capabilities and enhance our comprehensive thinking capabilities, concentration, awareness and energeticism.
At the same time, we also know our culture and tradition.
Many sports make us aware of the society and the environment.
Calling people, we can create a big history collection of our traditional games.
This time the fire is to defeat plastic waste - beat plastic pollution.
I urge you all to understand the vision of this theme, not using polythene and low quality plastics, we can try to reduce the impact of plastic waste on the nature, on wildlife and on our health.
Look, know, try to implement the website of World Environment Day in a very attractive manner in the Wed-India 2018.
When it is extremely hot, when the rain doesn't end, when there is unbearable cold, everyone will start saying globalwaming, climate chaining as specialists.
But what's the matter with just saying
All these are basically climate change, its result.
Our culture, our traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We have to live with nature, we have to live with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had promised this for every step in his life.
Today, India is talking about climate justice, India has played a key role in the CoP21 Paris Agreement and we have joined the world through the International Solar Alliance.
How to move forward in this matter
What can you do with a new one
It's rainy season.
It has been reported that preparations are being made to celebrate International Yoga Day on 21st June all over the world.
The world has been recognising the Yoga for Unity for unity for the past few years.
By doing yoga, we always have the courage to look like our father.
If all these qualities are friends, Yogi succeeds in all kinds of fear.
I once again urge all the people to build a healthy, prosperous and good nation to promote our heritage of Yoga.
Dear countrymen, today is 27th May and the first Prime Minister of India is the memory of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
Prayers to Panditji...
The memories of this month are associated with another person.
In May 1957, Indians gave their strength to the British.
In 1857, Veerasavarkar wrote without fear that it was not luxury, but the first fight for freedom.
Savarkar's life was full of specialties.
Besides, he was a great poet and a social reformer who always gave importance to harmony and unity.
An excellent description of Savarkar ji has been made by our dear Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Savarkar took poetry and revolution together.
He was a compassionate poet and adventurous revolutionary.
If there is a feeling of doing something then it is determined that it can be achieved in all the constraints.
This is not just the matter, but you can see it in every corner of Hindustan.
If you look around, you can see how people fail to resist.
Even now, when we go to a tea shore, when we enjoy tea there, some of the nearby discussions and discussions have been noticed.
These discussions can be related to politics, socially, films, sportspersons, sportspersons, the problems of the country.
You will be surprised to know that he is being a light of education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He opened a school called Asha Ashwasan for the children living in the streets and slums, for which this poor teaman spends fifty percent of his income.
He also arranges for education, health and food for all the children who have come to school.
I'm D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao's teaching, dedication and a new direction to the lives of poor children.
He left the darkness of his life.
There will be a lot of things like this in your neighborhood.
There will be innumerable events.
Come on, let's encourage goodness.
The moon will wait for a few days.
Everybody feels that they will be celebrated with joy, and on this occasion, specially children will get good gifts.
I hope Eid strengthens the harmony and friendship in our society.
My best wishes to all.
My dear countrymen, thank you all.
We'll be together in the next month's Manki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018
The Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th to 15th April.
71 countries including India participated in it.
In such a big event, when thousands of sportspersons from all over the world participate, imagine what would be the environment there.
Who can avoid this in an environment where enthusiasm, zeal, ideas and hopes and determination to achieve success.
The exhibition of India's record in shooting, gusti, weightlifting, table tennis and badminton has been shown.
India won 66 medals including 26 gold, 20 silver and 20 brass.
This victory will be proud of all Indians.
Everything's drowned in the same emotion.
The words will be sorry directly to make that emotion clear.
But I would like to hear you from the players.
It was my dream to be a sportsperson of India and Manipur.
Do you know that all the restlers who went to India this time have won medals
Manika Batra won medals in all those who participated.
She is the first Indian woman who has won the gold medal for India in personal table tennis.
India has received the highest medal shooting.
The fifteen-year-old shooter Anish Bhanwala Commonwealth Games is the youngest sportsperson who won the gold medal for India.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Para Power Lifter in the Commonwealth Games for India.
It is also special that the medal winners are more women this time.
Whether Squash or Boxing or Weight Lifting or shooting, women are surprised.
In the last battle in Badminton, two Indian sportspersons Saina Nehru and P.
Sindhu was amongst us.
Everyone was eager to get both medals in India even though it was a competition.
The sportspersons from different parts of the country from small towns.
They have the role of their strong friends in every environment.
Last month, in Mann Ki Baat, I had called upon the people, especially the youth, to fit India.
Come along with Fit India, I urge you to lead Fit India.
I am glad that people are coming here with great enthusiasm.
Shashikanth is sharing his own picture in the swimming pond of Bhosle, My Weapon Is Mi Body, My Element Is Water, My World Iss Swimming...
Fit India is a journey and trekking for me.
It was a pleasure to see some of the well-known people inspire our youth for Fit India in a very attractive manner.
A video shower has been made by the Sanima Kalakaran Akshay Kumar.
You must see all of you, in this he's doing business with Wooden Beed.
He says that this exercise is very good for external and stomach muscles.
Another video is in propaganda.
He's playing volleyball with people.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences related to Fit India efforts.
I think such initiatives are very beneficial for all of us and for the entire country.
One more thing is definitely to say that Yoga is the name of the Fit India Movement.
Yoga has a special significance in the Fit India programme and you must have started preparing.
The importance of International Day of Yoga on June 21 has now been accepted throughout the world.
You're ready now.
Not alone, your city, your village, your colony, your school, your school, your school, all of you, everybody, every age, everybody, everybody, everybody, the man or the woman, should try to connect with Yoga.
Today, it is not necessary to say in India or the world that how Yoga is beneficial for the entire development of the body, for the psychological development and mental balance.
You might have seen my animated video is very popular.
They're very minute to show a teacher and show them through animation.
You will also get the benefit of that.
I want to tell you something by inviting you for a new job.
Many youngsters spend their time to learn something new.
Or integration provides a new experience in its own way.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to get the experience of living in a new way by escaping from the sea, penny and computer.
My young friends, I invite you to a special innovation.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, the Ministry of Sports, Human Resource Development and the Ministry of Drinking Water has jointly launched a Swachh Bharat Summer Intensive 2018.
If the students of the college, the NCC youth, NSS, Nehru Yuva Kendra Volunteers want to do something for the country, if they want to learn something for the society and the country, if they want to join the change of the society then they can join it.
This will provide support and strength to sanitation and enjoyment that on 2nd October, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will be able to do something before that.
The awards will be given to the best members, who have done good work in the college and those who have done good work in the university.
Not only this, the UGC will provide two credit letters to those who are very well completed.
Students, students and youngsters are once again inviting them to innovate and benefit them.
You can go to MyGov and register Swachh Bharat Summer Intensity.
I hope our youth will come forward in this movement for cleanliness.
I want to know about your efforts.
Know what you know, know about the events, send the pictures, send the video.
Use this holiday for a new experience.
I would like to urge people to see that how many people are doing good things in all the corners of our country, all the good things are being done.
I have seen the stories of youngsters who are engaged in selflessness for the education of poor children.
In addition to these youth, a big programme has been started for the education of the street children and children living in the huts of the Delhi.
The conditions of children who are hijacking or working on the road were caught by them, so that they descended to activity.
The youngsters and teachers associated with this programme have been trying to make social transformation two hours away from their busy life.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the mountainous region of Uttarakhand are inspiring for the farmers across the country.
They have not only changed their own efforts but also the destiny of the region.
Raghi, Chaulai, jaggery or barley are being cultivated mainly in Bageshwar in Uttarakhand.
The farmers did not get the price of their dedication due to being a hilly area.
This biscuit with iron content is very beneficial for pregnant women.
The farmers have set up a cooperative body in Munnar village and started a biscuit factory there.
After seeing the courage of the farmers, the administration connected it with the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit is now reaching not only in Bageshwar district but also in about 50 Anganwadi centres, Almora and Kaisani.
With the leadership of the farmers, the annual sale of the group has not only reached Rs 10-15 lakhs but has also reduced the employment of more than 900 families from the district to the outskirts.
Do you think water conservation should be a social responsibility
We need to think about how to protect every rain.
We know that water conservation is not a new issue in the minds of Indians.
The subject of the book is not the subject of language.
Our ancestors have lived this for centuries.
They gave priority to the glory of each drop of water.
They searched for new ways to keep every drop of water safe.
There are huge inscriptions in Manar Kovil, Chiranmahadevi, Kovilpatti and Navikotai, and even today many ponds are like tourist centres.
But do not forget that these huge conservations of water reservoirs are the living examples of the efforts of our ancestors.
The UNESCO World Heritage Centre is known as Rani Ki Bawadi in Adalaj and Patan in Gujarat, which is worth seeing.
These ponds are in a way water temples.
If you go to Rajasthan, you must go to Chandbawadi in Jodhpur.
This is one of the largest and beautiful Bavadi (Kulam) in India and is the most important thing that it is in the area of water conservation.
It is a good time to store rain water during April, May, June and July, and we will get the benefit as we are preparing for the past.
In the last three years, everybody has done something in their own way in water conservation and water management.
55 of total expenditure of Rs. 64,000 crore in 2017-18, i. e.
In the last three years, such water conservation and water management have achieved more than 150 lakh hectares of land.
Sasur and Khaderi rivers, which were dried with the help of people from around 40-45 villages, were revived.
Whether it is animals or birds or farmers or farming or village, how much blessed it is for them all
We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year, but no one knows the vision of living peacefully, beautifully, inclusively.
Please, people should discuss this issue in Mann Ki Baat programme to know about this.
Rabindranath was a talented personality and a multiple personality.
I was a habit of listening to it, but I didn't know the language, but it was my habit to hear the music in the radio in the morning.
You and Rabindra Sangeeta may have been very affected by his poems.
I salute Rabindranath Tagore on this occasion.
The whole world is celebrated with respect and respect for the month of Ramsan.
The social side of fasting is that when man himself is hungry, he knows the hungry of others.
When you feel thirsty, others feel thirsty.
Once a man asked the prophet, what is the best thing in Islam
The prophet replied, "Give some poor or hungry food and behave with everyone, you know or behave with compassion.
People donate to those who devote this holy month.
According to the prophet Mohammad, a person is a holy soul, not money and wealth.
We should be glad that India is the land of Lord Buddha by showing the strength of compassion, service and sacrifice and he has shown the path of lakhs of people all over the world.
Recalling this Buddhist fulfilment of Lord Buddha, he reminds us of our responsibilities that he can try to travel through the jungle path, determine and live accordingly.
Lord Buddha is the inspirational power of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Today, it is the world's most needed human value.
Buddha's inspiration is immense in the social vision of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Babasaheb lays the foundation - my social vision is reflected in three words - freedom, equality and brotherhood.
The roots of my philosophy are not in religion, not in political science.
I embarrassed them from my guru Buddha.
Babasaheb has empowered millions of people suffering, exploited, deprived and dissolved by the Constitution.
There is no greater example of Karuna.
This compassion of the people was one of the greatest benefits of Lord Buddha.
The suggestions of Lord Buddha are traditionally available in Asia.
I am happy to note that the Government of India is participating in renovation of several Buddhist temples, which includes the magnificent joy temples of Myanmar for centuries.
Today, there is a view of conflict and human pain all over the world and the advice of Lord Buddha shows the way to make hate free.
I convey my best wishes to all of the world who believe in the principles of Karuna, respected by Lord Buddha.
For the entire world, I pray for the blessings of Lord Buddha to maintain my responsibility for a peaceful and compassionate world building based on his advice.

The day was marked as an exhibition of military power in India.
Lord Buddha showcased the world that the power of the inner spirit is necessary for peace.
And when you get strength as a nation, you will be able to live peacefully.
It is not only because of May 1998 that the Nuclear test was conducted, but it is also important for the country and how it was done.
The land of India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India will be able to undermine new goals and heights all over the world.

Today, the country has moved from traditional methods in the health sector.
Everything related to health in the country was earlier the responsibility of the Health Ministry.
Today, all the departments and Ministries are working together for a healthy India - whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness or the Ministry of AYUSH or the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments - for affordable healthcare along with defence routes.
The disease resistance is the cheapest and easiest healthcare.
As much as we are aware of the disease resistance, it will benefit the individual, the family and the society.
If life is healthy then first it is cleanliness.

There are several programmes related to Yoga throughout the year in TV and electronic media.

Industry was a good medium for him to provide employment to the poor.
Today, when we successfully launched the Make in India movement in the country, Dr.
Today, with his vision, the Smart City Mission and Urban City Mission have been launched in the country and it is necessary to provide better roads, water facilities, health facilities, education, digital connectivity, etc.
Baba Saheb had great faith in self-reliance and self-reliance.
He wanted no person to be in poverty forever.
At the same time, he believed that his poverty cannot be overcome only because he gave something to the poor.
Today, initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Startup India and Standup India are giving birth to our young collectors.
He emphasized the importance of water consumption in the development of the country and various River Valley Authoritys, various commissions related to water, all are born in the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today, efforts are being made to reduce history for waterways and ports in the country.
He emphasized the importance of Federalism and Federal Systems to work together in the development of the country between the Centre and the States.
He showed us that it is not necessary to live in a large or rich family to reach the higher heights, but also those who are born in the poor families of India can dream and achieve their dreams.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar has played the game.
Accordingly, there will be special programmes across India on issues such as rural development, poverty welfare and social justice.
I urge all of you to participate in this programme with enthusiasm.

My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science and write some things.
We see the colour of the ocean blue, but we understand from our experience that there is no color of water.
Have we ever thought why the water of the river or the sea is filled
This question came to the mind of a young man in 1920s.
This is the question that a scientist was born in modern India.
Now, when we talk about science, the best is Bharat Ratna C.
One of his findings is famous by the name of Raman Effect.
It is said that on this day he found the truth of light skating and he received the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
India is proud of all scientists from Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose.
The name of the famous Boson Party has been named after Satyendranath Bose.
Next time, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai and was inaugurated by Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was very happy to know the magnificences in the field of science.
The Artificial Intelligence has helped in manufacturing robots, boots and other stipulated machines.
Now the machines are smartening their own intelligence through self-leaning.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor and the poor.
In this programme on Artificial Intelligence, I asked the Scientists how Artificial Intelligents can help ease the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters.
Can we be able to know better about natural illnesses through artificial intelligence
Can farmers help in the field of agricultural production
Can artificial intelligence help in making healthcare accessible to everybody more easier and treating modern diseases
Last day, the Prime Minister of Israel had the opportunity to participate in the inauguration of the ICRET programme in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There a young man said that a digital device has been developed.
I think a lot of such things can be used for artificial intelligence.
Scientific technologies are one that is called Value Newtrol.
Any machine will work for us.
But it depends on us what we want to do with the machine.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the lighting bulb, failed several times in his experiment.

I am fortunate to say that today I am in Aravalli, the land of Maharshi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British regime, fought against them and raised many questions to British India.
The idea of repeating questions is important to know the truth.
This is the real inspiration behind scientific inventions.
Why, don't sit peaceful until I get the answers to questions.
Greetings to scientists and scientists on this occasion of National Science Day.
Friends, I get a lot of messages on all issues such as safety, extremism, and people write something related to it.
Shri Rabindra Singh from Pune and Shri Narendra Modi Mobile App has been commanded on the safety of employment.
He wrote that there is no security norms where the construction work is underway in our country.
The Prime Minister said that next March 4 is the National Security Day of India, so that people should talk about security at the Mann Ki Baat Programme to be aware of security.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important, taking forward and preparing.
One is needed at the time of accident - Safety During Disaster - the other is needed in daily life - Safety in Everified Life .
If we are not aware of security in our daily life, if there is no such awareness, it is difficult to be in danger.
Sometimes we have written on the boards that are on the way - if not aware, the accident will certainly be harmful, the joy and the laughter.
I would like to say that the Fair Brigades in cities of Fair Brigade have to go to school once a week or once a month in front of the children.
So, there will be two benefits, there will be a habit of sitting carefully in the fire brigade, and the new generation will be able to know about it.
Talking about the dangers, India is a land of geographical and climate diversity.
This country has witnessed many disasters such as natural hazards, chemical accidents and industrial accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is at the forefront of facing accidents in the country.
NDMA is rapidly reaching out to rescue operations in various accidents such as earthquake, floods, storms and landslides.
Twenty-three years ago, the heatwave was because thousands of people lost their lives throughout the year.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat decreased to about 220.
It can be understood from this that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people who have done this kind of work in the society, there are social organisations, there are aware citizens and I congratulate all those who have reached the rescue routes within minutes if there is any accident.
The number of heroes who are not known like this is not less.
Our Fair and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces etc. have reached the accidents and helped the brave people without their lives.
We have to make a society awakened of the accident.
We are waiting for values in our culture, we are often talking about security values, but we have to understand the values of security.
We have to make it a part of our life.
In our normal life, we are traveling on a plane for hundreds of times, and we are seeing the air hostess in the airspace warnings about safety at the beginning.
We must have heard it a hundred times, but if you ask us where every thing is, how should you use the life jacket
So there is a habit of listening to our ears on the plane, but we don't think that these warnings are also me.
This is what happens in every field of life.
We shouldn't think that security is for anyone else.
If all of us are aware of our security, then the spirit of security of the society will also be included in it.
Dear countrymen, this time in the budget, with the objective of Swachh Bharat, the villages had given importance to the subject of West to Wealth and West to Energy of Biogyas.
The objective of this Gobar Dhan Yojana is to clean the villages, to replace the ruins of the animals, the ruins of the farming fields, composta and biogyasa, to produce funds and energy.
India has the largest number of fodders in the world, where approximately 300 million fodder and their production of fodder is about 3 million tonnes per day.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen scheme, we are also moving forward in this regard.
The Gobardhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in keeping the village clean.
I invite you to participate in this mass movement called Clean Energy and Green Job, to make the wastes of your village rich and to change the lunch to silver.
My dear countrymen, so far we have heard of many festivals like the Festival, Food Festival, Film Festival.
However, as a unique initiative in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the first festival of the state was held.
The aim of the Raipur Festival was to create awareness about the sanitation and awareness of the strange methods of utilization of wastes in the city and reuse of silver.
During this festival, various programmes were organised in which the abundant people participated.
Several festivals were organised in other districts with inspiration from the programme in Raipur.
Everyone has done a lot in their own way and shared new ideas on sanitation, discussions and poetry.
The significance of waste processing and cleanliness was presented in a very new way in this festival, which conveys greetings to the people of Raipur, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the rulers of Chhattisgarh.
Every year on March 8, the International Womens Day is celebrated.
Several events are being organised in our country and across the world.
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country is honoured by those who worked in different fields.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development beyond women's development.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's words.
He said that the idea of complete womenhood is a complete freedom, and this idea of Swamiji ahead of twenty-five years ago shows the concept of womens strength in the Indian culture.
Today, it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure equal participation of women in all the areas of social and economic life.
We are part of the tradition of recognition of men in the name of women. The children were known as Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Putan.
Today our women's strength shows self-confidence and confidence through their works.
They moved themselves and brought the country and the society forward and brought it to a new goal.
Our vision of a New India is ultimately a partner in the overall development of a woman-powered, powerful and nation.
There can be many examples of what the women's power can do, and if you look at the environment, you can see such stories that inspire life.
I knew something from Jharkhand.
Under Swachh Bharat Yojana, 15 lakh women in Jharkhand have to say that this number is not very low - 15 lakh women have been organised and Swachhta has been organised for a month.
These women of Jharkhand have shown that the Swachhta movement in normal life can be converted into the nature of the common man.
Brothers and sisters, Two days ago, in three villages of Elephanta Islands, it was seen in the news that after 70 years of independence, the people of Elephanta Islands were happy.
You know that Eliphanta island is 10 kilometres away from Mumbai.
This is a very attractive center for tourism.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am happy that the villages and caves of Elephanta will see the light of electricity.
This is not only electricity but also a new beginning of development.
May the life of the people be brighter, pleasure in life... the moment that is more pleasant and joyful than this is the other time.
Dear countrymen, we celebrated the Shiva night the last day.
Now, in March, it is the time to call rich agricultural land, wheat, gold and other crops, all the bright potatoes of the mind, this is the specialty of this month.
This month is a month of love for everyone because of Holi celebrations.
On March 2, everybody will celebrate Holi with Harsholas.
Friends, Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat 2018
First of all, the rulers of 10 countries participated in this festival.
He recalled the commemoration of Kalpana Chaula, which was launched on a spacecraft on 1st February.
They have been inspired by millions of youngsters around the world, even though the compassion has separated us in the accident of the Colombia Space Port.
We lose Kalpana Chaula at such a young age. It is a matter of sadness for all of us.
It is heartening to see that in India, these women are fast roaming in every field and enhancing the pride of the nation.
In ancient times, women of our country have got their respect, their place in the society and their contributions are all surprised all over the world.
There is a long tradition of Indian students.
Let us tell you about Be Bachao, Bee Padhao.
In ancient times, Rachikpa says in Skandapuran: Dasputra, Samakya, Dasputra Kardhaya, the results are available to Martyya, the accomplishment of Kanyakaya.
That is, a daughter is equal to ten sons, and the ten sons will get the holy one in a daughter.
This shows the importance of women in our society.
That is why women have been given the status of strength in our society.
This woman power quotes the entire country, the entire society and the entire family on the lines of unity.
Whether the scholars of Vedic times, Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitrei, the knowledge and devotion of Akamahadevi and Meerabai, the power of Ahlyabai Holkar, the courage of Rani Laxmibai, the strength of women is inspired by us.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has said that the country's dignity is increasing.
Prakash Tripura is giving several examples.
Our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman warplane is inspiring to fly on Sukhoi 30.
Under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, he has written about women members of the Indian Navy visiting the world in INSV Tarini.
He pointed out that the three brave women, Bhavna Kanth, Mohana Singh, who were the pilots of the Chaturvedi Airlines and trained in Sukhoi 30.
The women under the leadership of Skilled Vajpayee are proud to visit San Francisco in America and Delhi in Air India's boating jet.
Everyone should remember women...
These women who have taken NAM - the first woman merchant Navy captain, the first woman train driver in the journey train, the first woman firefighter, the first woman bus driver in Antarcai, the first woman in Everest, the first woman in Everest, the first woman in all these areas, the first woman who had come here in such a way - the first woman who had brought us in all these areas - the extraordinary eyes by improving the reality of our women's power society.
They waited for all the obstacles and all the obstacles in the strength of hard work, mindless action and determination.
Not only their contemporary people, but also the next generation is a path of inspiration.
They will fill a new zeal and motivation.
A book has been prepared about these women who have received NAM, so that the country and not the country should know about the strength of women and inspire you and their work in their life.
This is available for e-books in the Narendra Modi web site.
Women's power has an important role in the efficient changes in this country and society.
When we talk about women empowerment, I would like to talk about a railway station.
You must have thought of what the relationship between railway station and women empowerment.
The Maunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India for all workers.
Empowerment is a form of self-sufficiency.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh is a Maoist affected area.
The Maoists have made a terrible atmosphere full of violence, attacks, bombs, guns and pistols.
In such a terrible area, tribal women are sufficiently able to drive e-o-rickshaws.
Within a short span of time, many women are associated with this.
Along with this, it also provides strength to environmental protection.
Appreciate the district weightforward, the district administration has played an important role in the success of these women, from providing grants and executing them.
For centuries, there has been constant efforts in our society individually and socially against social evils and evils.
Just a few days ago, this kind of beginning took place in Bihar.
In order to root out the social evils in the state, the world's largest humanity is about 100,000 kilometres.
Through this catastrophe, we have awakened the social mindset against the evils of child marriage and women's system.
The State has resolved to fight against evils like women's money and child marriage.
All the youngsters, mothers and sisters, who are full of zeal and enthusiasm, have participated in this fight themselves.
The human resource like the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna has been formed without the border of the state.
It is necessary that the society should be free from the evils to achieve the leadership of development in the right manner for everyone in the society.
Come, let us together pledge to free the society from evils, create a new India, a strong and efficient India.
He did not know about the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
When you started buying the desert, the cost of the desert decreased by 75 percent.
In the last few days, many people have been writing about it, they have been saying.
The objective of this scheme is to provide healthcare to everyone and to increase livelihood.
Breeds available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are sold here, more than 50 percent to 90 percent of Brandai are worthless.
That's why good trees are available at affordable prices.
More than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
There is not only a small price but also a new job opportunities for those who want to find jobs individually.
Priceless breeds are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendras and Amrit stores in hospitals.
The only goal of this is to provide affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor and to create a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh, who is in Maharashtra, has shared a fo in the Narendra Modi App.
I have come to know that the citizens of Akola have organised the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to clean the Morana river.
Twelve months before the Morna river flows, Elli flows only during the rainy season.
It is a painful view that the river is completely filled with skulls and sparks.
A lot of wastes are dragged on the river and its banks.
A work plan was set up and one day before the Makar Sankranti, as the first step of Mission Clean Morna on 13th January, the two sides of Mournadi were cleaned at 14 places in 4 km area.
In this scheme of Mission Clean Morna, more than 4,000 people from Akola, more than 100 governmental institutions, school students, girls, elderly, mothers and sisters have participated in this.
Till 20th January, 2018, the Swachhta Jan, 2018, the Morana River was completely filthy, he said that the program would continue every Saturday morning.
If someone wants to do something, it's not impossible.
Big changes can be brought through the mass movement.
I compliment the people of Akola, the district administration and the administration of the district, and all the participants who have been involved in making this work a people-to-people and this effort will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about Padma Puraskars.
There will be reports about this in newspapers and TVs.
Each year, it is a simple thing to give Padma Awards, but for the last three years, the system has been lost.
Let's name any citizen.
It has a transparent V because all the processes are through online.
In a way, the election process for these awards has completely changed.
In general, Padma Awards are given to those who are not present in cities, newspapers, TVs and conferences.
Shri Arvind Gupta has been awarded the award.
You will also be happy to know that IIT is a student of Kapur, who has dedicated life to these arvindan kisses for making sports.
He has been making sports with things for four decades to leave the scientific importance to grow.
He also tried to inspire them to do scientific experiments with the objects that have not been used.
For this, the film made in 18 languages in more than 3,000 schools across the country will inspire Kai Ku.
It is surprising to create life, to create wonders.
This is the story of Sithava Jodhti in Karnataka.
Don't just tell the goddess of women empowerment.
They have contributed significantly to the transformation of the lives of innumerable women in Balgao over the last three decades.
When they were seven years old, they dedicated themselves to Devdasi and offered life only for the good of Peet Devdasis.
Not only this, the team has done the work of women's well-being.
This is because of this interest, not the whole world is respected.
The exhibition of his pictures is being performed in countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
He gave Padma Shri the talent of Kirtieku Maju Shyam to India abroad.
If the story of the tribal lady Laxmiku of Kerala comes then you will be surprised to bath.
Laxmiku lives at Kalar A place and lives in a drained hut in tribal areas at Imdukka.
In the strength of your memories, there are more than five hundred green leather trees.
It is specially impossible to make serpentine serpent.
Laxmi ji is serving the society through his own knowledge about sandalwood.
The country has been honored by Padma Shri for recognizing this personality and contributing to the society.
During the age of 23, his husband died without treatment and this incident was inspired to build a hospital for the poor.
Building through their hard work, thousands of poor people are provided free treatment at the hospital.
Sometimes they should invite them to schools and colleges and listen to their experiences.
Besides the awards, some of the efforts of the society should be made.
Dear countrymen, every year on 9th January, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
On 9th January, Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in South Africa.
This day, we celebrate the unprecedented relationship with Indians living in India and all over the world.
This year, we have organized a programme on Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas to invite Parliamentarians and Mayors from all over the world.
Members of Parliament and Mayors from India, including Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, BRIN, Suriname, South Africa, America, participated in the event.
I am glad that the European Union has sent me a calendar this time with the people of different countries living in different countries and serving those countries.
Our Indian diaspora lives in different countries of Europe, some work as a link to cyber security, some are dedicated to Ayurveda, some people are poetry through their music and poetry to the society.
On January 30, we all have a new way to remember the revered father of Kai.
We shall pay tributes to the great martyrs who have sacrificed their lives for the security of our country at 11 o'clock.
They're not just the principles.
My dear countrymen, I conclude my words by conveying my best wishes to all of you, 2018.
Mann Ki Baat, 2017
This is the last day of Mann Ki Baat this year, which is the last day of 2017.
This year I shared a lot of things with you.
Years will change after a few hours, but our share of these ideas will continue again.
Remembering the great lessons we all gave Jesus Christ on the occasion of Christ, Jesus Christ gave great importance to the spirit of service.
We see the essence of service.
Gurudev Ramakrishna Paramahansar used to say, "Life-Service with Shiva".
The life of Guru Gobind Singh ji's courage and sacrifice is an inspiration for all of us.
In this effort, he personally had to lose many things.
It was a very fortunate opportunity for me to participate in the Prakash Festival organized by Guru Gobind Singh at the beginning of this year on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
Let us decide that Guru Gobind Singh will learn from the great lessons and inspiring life and try to create life.
January 1, 2018, i.e. tomorrow...
Tomorrow is a special day for me.
But when I say it's special, I say it's really special.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of New India in the 21st century.
The whole of India is encouraging to welcome you as the voters of the 21st century.
You might be proud of being a voter of the 21st century.
Your vote will be based on New India.
The power of the vote is the greatest power in democracy.
Voting is one of the most capable of bringing a positive change in the lives of millions of people.
You don't just have the right to vote.
You can also be the creators of the twentieth century by thinking about how India should be in the twentieth century and what your dream should be about India in the twentieth century.
Youth of New India is a matter of enthusiasm, freshness and energy.
The dream of New India is accomplished by our energetic, skilled and powerful youth.
When we talk about New India, it is about India free from casteism, casteism, terrorism and poison of corruption.
India is free from waste and poverty.
Everyone gets equal opportunity, the New India is fulfilling the aspirations of everyone.
New India is the strength of peace, unity and harmony that leads us.
My new India youth should come forward and imagine how to create a New India.
How can we realise our concepts before 2022
How can we create a dream of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi had made the freedom struggle a mass movement.
My young friends, we have to organize a mass movement to create a magnificent and divine India of the twentieth century.
The creation of development, the creation of progress, the creation of a powerful India.
Today, many opportunities have been opened for the youth.
Our youth are coming forward and succeeding in innovations and entrepreneurship from skill development.
I would like to think how the youngsters of this New India can get information about such opportunities and when they are 18 years old, they will be able to know about this world and all these schemes and create a system that can be achieved.
Nothing is impossible for a person full of positive thinking and enthusiasm.
In English, there is an essay, Passimism Leeds to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
The reports and reactions were really encouraging.
It was a very pleasant experience.
Some of them shared the positive and positive impact of their minds.
Some shared their personal achievements.
My name is Fish Bhartia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket 1, Phase 1, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I'm talking from the place called Bodel.
According to my husband's suggestion, a monthly amount of insurance was received.
He died in the accident.
So we know what our situation is.
My name is Anand Jadhav.
The National Highway has been going through our different villages since 2017.
My name is Satish Bewani.
There was a shortage of water in our area and for the last 40 years we have been dependent on the pipeline of the soldiers.
Now we have a special pipeline.
It was our biggest achievement in 2017.
There are many people doing such things on their own in the process of positive changes in the lives of people.
In fact, this is the New India that we are building together.
Next time, I have come to know about the inspirational story of Amju and Bashir Khan Khattak, who was in the forefront of the Administrative Service from Kashmir.
He was at the forefront of the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination, free from the torture of terrorism and hate.
You will be surprised to know that the terrorists had burnt their heritage in 1990.
Their family had to leave their heritage land and pledge. There was a lot of terrorism and violence.
He chose a different way for himself and the way he served the people.
Rescue from the opposite environment and created the story of victory itself.
Today, he is not only in Jammu and Kashmir but also inspired to the youth of the entire country.
Ange has proved that the environment is very bad, but the positive step is to make it clear that it cannot make the despairs of disappointment.
Last week, I had the opportunity to see some girls in Jammu and Kashmir.
It was excitement, zeal, energy, dream and determination.
As long as I spent with those children, I got inspired.
This is the strength of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, not only of my country but also of the world's famous religious places, it is natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala.
Every year millions of devotees reach this world famous temple to get the blessings of Lord Ayyapaswamy.
How big can it be a challenge to protect so many devotees who come to such a great place without waste
If you are mountains and jungles then do you specially say
A police officer named Vijayan, started a programme called Punya Punya Pungavan, which has started a self-reliance of awareness about waste management.
There is a habit that no devotee has come to the forefront of sanitation, without doing any physical work.
There's no bigger in this movement, no smaller.
Every devotee is considered a part of the worship of Lord and keeps away for some time for cleanliness, works and works to remove waste.
It is surprising that every morning the vision of waste waste waste waste waste waste waste and all the pilgrimages participate in it.
Whether it is a big celebrity or a big financial officer, everyone is participating in the programme of purifying like ordinary devotees, we will move forward only after cleaning.
There are many such examples in front of us.
Punya Puja is a part of the pilgrimage of all devotees in such a sanitation settlement in Sabarimala.
The vision of hygiene along with intense humidity is also moving together.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, we have taken a pledge to fulfill the incomplete mission of Bapu ji, Swachh Bharat and Swachh Bharat.
Bapuji tried to work for this thing throughout his life.
In rural and urban areas, there has been a widespread change in the collaboration of the people.
The world's largest survey, Swachh Survekshan, 2018 will be conducted on 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to assess the achievements made on the quality of sanitation in urban areas.
This survey will be conducted between nearly 40 crore people in more than 4,500 cities.
He'll talk to the citizens and know their response.
We will also review the use of Swachhta App and innovation of various services centres.
It will be tested whether cleanliness in the city has been created in the city to become the nature of the people and to become the nature of the city.
Don't be the government's sanitation.
Organisations of all citizens and citizens have great responsibility.
I urge all the people to participate in the Swachhta Survey in the coming days.
Try not to be behind your city, your streets and villages.
According to this survey, if your city is more than one lakh people, then in the rankings of the country, if there is less than one lakh population then it is your dream that you will have to achieve the highest position in the local rankings.
Come, with this determination, once again reminding Bapu Ji, we can use the best initiatives with the determination of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, some things may seem very small, but as a society, it has a far-reaching impact on our personality.
Today, I would like to share such a thing with you in this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
For decades, Muslim women were injustice, but no one talked about it.
There are no such laws in many Islamic countries.
But Muslim women in India had no right to go to Haj without men.
I have directed the Ministry of Minority Affairs to ensure that all the women who apply to go alone will be allowed to go to Hajj.
Normally, I would like to give a special opportunity to the women who are appealing to go alone, to avoid this hate.
The development journey of India has moved on the basis of their talent, with the strength of our womens strength.
I am confident that our women and men should get equal rights and equal opportunities and we should continue to work together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic celebration for us.
However, it will be remembered on 26th January, 2018.
This year, the leaders from 10 ASEAN countries will be the Chief Guests of India on the Republic Day celebrations.
It's not one this time on Republic Day, it's ten chief guests.
This has never happened in the history of India.
2017 was special for ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years and completed 25 years of ASEAN Indias Alliance with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us to join with these great leaders from 10 countries in the world on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals and in a way our country is the country of festivals.
It doesn't happen even a day that didn't connect with the festival.
We have celebrated Christmas now, the new year is going to come here.
May the next year bring happiness, happiness and prosperity to you all.
We can move forward with new freshness, new zeal, happiness and new determination.
The month of January is the time when the sun moves to Uttarayan, the Makar Sankranti is celebrated this month.
This is a festival related to nature.
Sankrant in Rajasthan, all festivals like Magha-Bihu in Assam, Pongal in Tamil Nadu are special in its own way and they have their own importance.
All these festivals are celebrated between January 13 and January 17.
The names of all these festivals are different, but the basic elements are the same.
Many congratulations to the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, dear people.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
At the age, they are very older than us, they are witnesses to each step of the country and every step of the country.
I had the privilege of talking to Didi on the phone before I left for a foreign trip.
It was a lovely conversation, as it was talking to Anujan Chechi.
I don't usually talk about personal conversations like this.
Modiji-Latadidi, Pramama.
I'm talking to Narendra Modi.
My best wishes and best wishes to Modiji-Didi on his birth anniversary.
May the health of Didi be better, let us all be blessed with Didi.
Before going to America, the phone was calling for admiration for Didi.
I was very happy to hear that Lataji-Modiji's phone will come.
Will you go back to me
Everybody at home...
Lataji, I think it is with the blessings of my parents and the blessings of the devotees.
You don't know what you are.
I know the pictures of India are changing as soon as you come.
Modiji, yeah.
Mother is very happy with this love of Modi ji and Didi.
I am very grateful to Modi ji - Didi forever remembering me.
Once again I convey my birthday greetings.
This time when Modi ji came to Mumbai, it was good to see him.
Modi ji, but I'll be soon.
Modi ji should come home and eat some Gujarati food from Didi's hand.
Lataji, of course.
I'm lucky to think that.
Modi ji - Pramam Didi.
Lata ji Pramama.
My best wishes to Modiji-Didi, Lataji-Namaste Namaste.
Modiji-Namaste.
My dear countrymen, with the new night, the period of festivals has once again come up with new enthusiasm, new energy, new zeal and new determinations.
It will be the beauty of festivals throughout the country for weeks.
Everyone from the family will join together in the festivals.
This is the darkness in the back of the blanket.
Perhaps, this word is not just a word, it is an order for all of us, a vision, an inspiration.
On the one hand, when some houses are lightened, on the other hand, look at the darkness is covered in a few vessels near them.
When this darkness is over, it is slightly lighted, it is really joyful of these festivals.
They are searching for the needy by collecting clothes, sweet cuisines and food from the people's houses and bringing them to them.
This time, can you try to darken the bottom of the call with the awakening and determination in this season of festivals
Your face will double your joy in the festivals, your face will be more shiny, your lamp will be more shiny, your lamp will be more bright.
Can we welcome Lakshmi in a new way this time
In our culture, daughters are considered to be Lakshmis because daughters bring good fortune and prosperity.
We will have many daughters who are brightening the name of the family and the society and the nation with their hard work, dedication, intellectuality.
Can you organise a programme to honour these Laxmis in India on this occasion of Diwali
There will be many daughters and daughters who do extraordinary things near us.
Our society should recognize such daughters, respect them, be proud for them.
We all together have made a great mass movement of 'Selfie with Daughter' as it is spread all over the world.
Similarly, this time we will organize the birth anniversary of Bharat ki Laxmi.
To encourage Laxmi of India, it is to strengthen the path of prosperity of the country and the people of the country.
Friends, I have already told you that through the Mann Ki Baat programme, I get the opportunity to interact directly and indirectly with many people who do not know and know.
The last day, a student from Arunachal, Alina Thyang, gave me a very funny burn.
My country is Roeing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my exam results came, people asked me whether I had read the book Exam Warriors.
After that, my experience was very good.
I thought I was very good if I had read that book before the exam.
And this little friend has given me a job.
But I have a request that you can help me.
I'm sure it's all done.
I'll surely try to write things in my words and in my own way.
I once again express my gratitude to this young friend of Arunachal and student Alina Tayang.
Look.
This time, as we discussed the success in the Egyptian Open, the speech of the Egyptian App Daniel Medvedaw was also discussed and there was a good propaganda in the social media.
I also took the speech and showed the game.
In the 23-year-old Dan, Madvedev's glory and his talent attracted everyone.
Of course it attracted me too.
Shortly before this speech, he defeated Grand Slam Jetha 19 times and Rafael Nathal, a historic jubilee of Tennis.
On this occasion, someone else would have become sad and disappointed.
His words were welcomed by the audience.
He also praised Champya Nadal in Dan and said how Nadal has inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis and how difficult it was to play with him.
The spirit of a person who failed in the same game was to see the glory of victory.
If you don't hear the words of Medvedev in Dan, you must see all of you, especially to the youth.
It has a lot to learn from all classes and age groups, and it is a great moment beyond the Jayaprajas.
Jaiprajas aren't big.
Life is a victory.
It has been very beautiful in the sciences of our country.
The thinking of our ancestors is surely congratulating.
It is said in the scriptures: Vidya Vinaya Upta Haritna Chethansi poet Manujasyamani Kanchana combined with the world-wide Lochanananda that if a person gets talent and compassion then he cannot succeed.
In fact, this young sportsperson won the hearts of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, especially young friends, I am going to tell you again for your goodness.
All the debates will take place, but the opposition will have a great advantage to prevent some of the things even before they grow up.
It's very difficult to stop some things when it's very big.
But in the beginning, if we stop it very carefully then it can be safeguarded.
Tobacco is a habit that cannot be avoided because of nicotine.
Eating this in childhood affects the growth of the brain.
But today I want to tell you about a new subject.
You might know that e-cigarettes have been banned in India recently.
E-cigarette is a kind of electronic device different from normal cigarettes.
A kind of chemical smoke is formed when nicotine substances are heated in e-cigarette.
Like other cigarettes, it consists of aromatic chemicals.
He has seen that even if his father is a child smoker at home, he is trying to stop others from smoking at home and wants children not to have cigarettes and beeds.
He wants not to drink cigarettes at home.
He knows that the body is suffering from smoking and tobacco.
But the e-cigarette is very different.
People don't know so much about e-cigarette.
Its accident is very ignorant, so sometimes e-cigarette gets entry home as it is simple.
You know that if someone smokes us, we can know it with smell.
If he packs cigarettes in his pocket, it can be known by the smell.
But this is not the case of e-cigarette, so many children and youngsters are very proud of their books, offices, pockets, sometimes roaming around in their hands, they are becoming victims of it.
Youth generation is the future of the country.
This new method of intoxication is prohibited in the e-cigarette country to not destroy our youth, not to destroy the dreams of the families, to destroy the lives of the children, to prevent this disease from spreading the roots in the society.
I urge everyone to quit tobacco habits and not misunderstanding about e-cigarettes.
You remember Fit India
Fit India is not meant to go to Gym for two hours in the morning and evening.
Fit India must keep away from it.
Our Bharatamba, our country is a multi-dimensional Vasundhra.
Several human beings are roaming on this earth.
The year of India was the birthplace of extraordinary people like that, and the land of karma.
They are themselves dedicated to others, not for themselves.
Such a great personality is being honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
This is a matter of pride for all Indians and Pope France will declare Maryam Thresia as sacred on October 13.
Sister Maryam Thresia is an example of the work done for the betterment of humanity in his narrow lifetime of 50 years.
My dear countrymen, now when we celebrate Gandhi 150, India is not only proud of the fact that India has taken a pledge to get rid of the eco-plastics used by only 130 crore people.
India looks forward to the world in terms of environmental conservation, so the entire world looks at India now.
I am confident that all of you will be part of the mass movement to avoid single use plastic on 2nd October.
In each place, people play their role in their own way.
But a young man in our country has done a very different movement.
When I turned my attention to his work, I tried to call him and know and understand his new method.
He said that it may be a matter of benefit to the nation and the people.
Mr.
First of all, when I heard the word Plogging, it was a new word.
Perhaps this word may be used in foreign countries.
But in India, Riputman Dalvi has made a big propaganda.
Come on, let's talk to him.
130 crore people will take one step in this regard, and we will take 130 crore steps towards elimination of Unityog Plastics.
Riputman ji, once again thank you very much.
Many congratulations to you and your team and this new concept.
I want to remind you of one thing.
But it was time for some people to start training and plan some programmes.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I told you that you will travel to 15 places in India by 2022.
Make a plan to stay at least 15 places at least one night or two nights.
You see India, understand, experience.
Friends, Once again, I convey my best wishes to all of you on various occasions of India full of diversity.
Yeah.
On the occasion of Deepavali, it should also be kept in mind that there is no accident in the people.
We need precautions.
With enthusiasm, we can celebrate festivals with new dreams and new determinations.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Namaskar to my dear countrymen.
Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to interact with the children from Karnataka.
He urged the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of India in a programme on the occasion of Bal Diwas on the occasion of Vijay Karnataka of Times Group.
Then they published the selected letters.
I was very happy to read those letters.
These little children also know the problems of the country.
They also know about the discussions in the country.
Congratulating Kirti Hegde from Uttaranchal and Smart City schemes, the child says that our education system has to be changed and the children of today don't like classroom reading, they like to know about nature.
If we give children information about nature, it may be beneficial to protect the environment in the future.
Reida Nadaf, a child from Laxmeshwar, writes that she is proud of being a soldier's daughter.
Any Indian who is not proud of our soldiers
And it's natural to be proud if the military's daughter is too much.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi writes that the school is 5 kilometres away from the house, so it has to leave home early and return home late and late night.
So she says she cannot spend time with friends and she says she needs to be a school next.
But, I loved that the newspapers did to bring those letters to me, so I could read those letters.
I'm a good experience.
Friends, today is 2611.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
This is the same day in 1949 that the Constituent Assembly accepted the Constitution of India.
The Constitution came into existence on 26th January, 1950, so we celebrate the same day as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember members of the Constitution.
They worked for about three years to build the Constitution of India.
It is a matter of pride that those who read about this discussion were the thoughts of those dedicated to the nation.
Can we imagine how hard they worked to build the Constitution of our country with diversity
When the country gets rid of the slavery of slavery, how long they have expressed their distinction and vision.
It's not an area of untouchable life, it's not a matter of nature.
Equality and sympathy for all is the face of our Constitution.
It is our duty to follow the Constitution in writing.
Be it a citizen or a ruler, we must move forward with the spirit of the Constitution.
The message of our Constitution is that no one should suffer any kind of damage.
Seventeen separate committees were constituted on the basis of key issues in this Constitution.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the drafting committee of the Constitution.
He was an important role to play.
On December 6, we remember and remember him regularly on his Mahanirvana Day.
Baba Saheb's contribution in making the country prosperous and strong is unforgettable.
On December 15, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel is a holy day.
Sardar Patel became a steel man of the country from the farmer's son and he made an extraordinary right to coordinate on a trail of the country.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the welfare of basic rights, fundamental rights, minorities and tribals.
The brave civilians, the police, the security officers remember and salute all others who lost their lives.
This country will never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism is taking a very terrible form today in all parts of the world, in a way every day.
We have been suffering from terrorism in India for the last 40 years.
Our thousands of innocent people lost their lives.
Terrorism is challenging humanism.
This is the land that has given the message of non-violence and affection to the world through Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi.
Terrorism and extremism are making ruthless efforts to weaken our social relations.
Therefore, it is the need of the hour to be more aware of human powers.
My dear countrymen, on December, we will celebrate Navy Day and Navy Day.
You all know that our culture grows on the banks of the rivers.
This country has a unique relationship with our land and oceans.
When we looked at history, the Chhola naval forces were considered the most powerful naval forces in a period of 800-900 years ago.
Their naval forces played a major role in the development of the Chholasam country in making them the economic power of that time.
Several examples of the movements and search journeys of the Chhola Navy can be seen in collaboration.
Most of the world's naval forces have long been allowed to leave women in war navigators.
However, many women had played an important role in the Chhola Navy, 800-900 years ago.
The women also participated in the war.
The Chola administrators were well aware of the shipbuilding.
When we talk about the Navy, no one can forget the capabilities shown by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his naval forces.
The Konkan coast was in the country of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud Jamjira, Golden Durg, associated with Shivaji Maharaj, were either on the seashore or surrounded by sea.
The Maratha Navy was waiting for the safety of these forts.
There were large ships and small boats in the Maratha Navy.
Their Navy was very capable of attacking any enemy and protecting the country from enemies.
How can we remember Kanhoji Angre when we talk about the Maratha Navy
He brought the Maratha Navy to a new level and built the Maratha Navy's camps at various places.
After independence, our Indian Navy showed its procedure even though it was in the war of Pakistan in 1971, during various visits, Goa's departure campaign.
When we talk about the Navy, the war is in the eyes, but the Indian Navy has come forward with the same enthusiasm in humanitarian affairs.
The ship Sumitra soon helped save the people and handed over the fisheries to Bangladesh safely from the sea.
In May-June this year, when there was a huge flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our Navy arrived there soon and helped the government and the people there.
On November 21, when a trade ship was looted in the West Galf, INS Trikund came to help.
Our naval forces have been proud to provide healthcare services to Fuji, to provide immediate relief and to provide humanitarian assistance to the neighboring country during the accident, and we are always proud of our security forces.
Whether it is the army or the Navy or the Air Force... all Indians salute them in the name of the courage, valour, valour and sacrifices of our soldiers.
They sacrifice their youth for the country to live comfortably and peacefully for the 150 crore people.
Each year, on 7th December, the Army is celebrating the flag hoisting day.
This is a day of pride and respect for the soldiers of the country.
I am happy to note that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to organise a programme from 1st to 7th December and it is a programme to make people aware of the Armed Forces coming to the citizens of the country.
Children and elders should wear flags throughout the week.
There must be a movement of respect for the army in the country.
They can get information about the army by calling the soldiers in schools and colleges.
Our new generation can make it a better opportunity to learn about the army.
This opportunity is to share money for the betterment of all the soldiers of our Armed Forces.
This fund is used as the Military Welfare Board for the rehabilitation of the families of the soldiers who have been martyred in the war, for the help of the injured soldiers.
We can also contribute to their goodness.
I want to say something to our farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is a great part of the earth.
Everything we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the food chain is connected to the soil.
Imagine what happens if you don't have soil in this world.
I'm afraid when I'm thinking.
We have already thought about this in our culture, so we have been aware of the importance of the soil since ancient times.
In our culture, there is a natural endeavour to enhance agriculture, land, devotion and gratitude, on the other hand, scientific projects were part of life to keep nutrition from the soil.
Two things were important in the lives of the farmers of this country - devotion to the earth and to maintain the soil in a scientific manner.
We are confident that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and interests in modern science, try and take appropriate decisions.
I heard about the farmers of Tehu village in Bhorad Block in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The production of soil has gradually decreased and the production of soil has decreased.
Some farmers in the village understood the seriousness of this situation and advised how many chemicals, other cultivations, micro neutrients and biodiversity they used to absorb their soil at the right time.
You will be surprised to know what has happened due to the suggestion of the information received from the soil health test.
And the qualities of the earth also increased.
If you want to think about crops then the farmers have started feeling that if you want to think about the motherland and if you want to wait for the motherland then the motherland will protect us.
Our farmers have created more than 10 crore soil health cards across the country to know the soil well and to harvest the soil.
We are devoted to the Mother Earth, but do you think how much harm is caused to the health of the Mother Earth with chemicals like urea
It has proved in all types of scientific methods that the consumption of urea has caused serious damage to the mother of the earth.
Can our farmers decide whether the children of our soil can take a decision that we can use half of the urea used in agriculture in 2022 after 75 years of independence
We have started feeling global heat and climate change.
It was a time to start cold before Diwali.
Now the beginning of December, the cold has been moving slowly.
The 8-year-old child, who was not able to speak, made Visil his weapon.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, we got to the houses of the village, waking up the people and not urinating the toilets in the open space.
The Kumhari village was free from open defecation due to this child who went to 30-40 houses every day and taught about sanitation.
The younger child Tushar worked inspiring to promote cleanliness.
Our divine brothers and sisters are determined, are capable and brave.
We've got something to learn.
Today they work well in every field.
Be it in the field of sports or in any competition or in any social step, our disabilities are not behind anybody.
Our Divyang sportspersons showcased 4 medals in Rio Olympics and remembered all of you that the blind T-20 cricket is world cup and champion.
Various competitions are being held across the country.
Last day, the 16th National Para Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated and showcased their skills.
One of them is Giger Thakkar from Gujarat, and 80 of his body has no muscles.
As a result of his skill, he was selected by the Sports Authority of India 2020 Paralimbics.
He is one of the 32 Para swimmers who have been trained at Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar.
My salute to Giger Thakkar... and my best wishes to him.
Today, Divyangjans can reach any area and take special care of opportunities.
Our effort is to make everybody capable of the country and to create a society inclusive of all.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
On this day, Prophet Hasrat Muhammad Saheb was born.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen.
This suggestion is very good, but I think it is possible to incorporate and change this suggestion.
The elders of our village will always say.
Forget your sorrows, don't let you forget the happiness.
You can't even make your role in this
Let us share the best wishes in the Narendra Modi App, in the MiGOV or in the social media in Positive India (Hashtag Positive India).
Remember the events inspired by others.
Remembering good things, there will be a feeling of doing good.
It will be the energy to do good things.
We can share the strength and consequences of this united unity.
There will be a chance to say many things.
Prime Minister on 29 October 2017
In Chhath Puja, the sun and water are important, but the utensils and utensils made of bamboo and soil are essential for its worship.
The message of worshiping sunrise and sunset in this festival of faith is full of unique culture.
The world will respect and worship them.
But Chhath Puja gives us the message of worship of those who are sure.
The importance of sanitation in our lives is also associated with this festival.
People are actively participating in the shores of rivers, lakes and ponds, priesthoods i. e.
The festival of Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja, Environmental Conservation, Disease Control and Acharya is celebrated.
It is natural to feel proud of this great tradition of India.
You might be happy to hear that there was so much business in a store of Khadi and handloom.
At the time of Diwali, the sale of Khadi Gift Cooperation has increased by about 680.
The total sale of Khadi and handicrafts has seen an increase of about 90 this year as compared to last year.
Today, it shows that the youth, women and the people of every age love Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine how much of the families of the poor, the families of the poor and the families of the handloom have benefited.
He says we should also remember our brave security forces.
We also think you're gonna get the sweets at home.
I am fortunate to celebrate Diwali once again with the brave security personnel deployed in the border.
This time, I am an unforgettable experience to celebrate Diwali with the security forces at the Gurez sector in Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces respect all the soldiers of our security forces for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice of the country, for the people of the country, for the sake of the country, for the sake of the hard and tortured situations on the border.
If we get the opportunity, listen to their prideful stories to know the experiences of our youth.
Many of us do not know that the soldiers of our security forces have not only played an important role in establishing peace in our borders but also in the world.
As the Peace Keeper of the United Nations, they are increasing the status of Hindustan all over the world.
Last day on October 24, the UN Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone remembers the efforts of the United Nations and their active role in establishing peace in the world.
We consider Vasudhaiva family, that is, the whole world is our family.
Due to this belief, India has been actively participating in various important steps of the United Nations since its inception.
India has given importance to women's equality and the declaration of human rights of the United Nations is a vibrant example of this.
It was initiated in the earliest feature that every man was born free and equal, as a result of the efforts of Indias delegate Hamsa Meta, it was recognised that the promise of all human beings is free and equitable.
Looks like it's not a simple change, but it's a healthy thinking.
The United Nations Peace Mission is Indias biggest contribution to the UN Prince Mission.
India has always participated in the peacekeeping missions of the United Nations.
Some of you will be the first to know about it.
More than 1600 Indian security personnel have served in the peace missions of the United Nations.
Now about 7,000 soldiers of India are associated with the peace processes of the United Nations, in which India is the third largest in the world.
By August 27, Indian soldiers have provided their services in nearly 50 missions in 71 peace festivals of the United Nations.
These missions were in various parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kongo, Cyprus, Liberia, Laban and Sudan.
In Kongo and South Sudan, more than 20,000 patients were treated and saved innumerable people in the Indian Army hospitals.
The security forces of India not only saved people from different countries but also won their minds through public welfare measures.
Indian women have also taken the lead in establishing peace.
Nobody knows that India is the first country to send women police teams to the United Nations Peace Mission in Libya.
This move of India has become a source of inspiration for nations across the world.
After that all the countries started sending their women police teams.
You will be surprised to hear that India's role is not only in peace but also in about 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers from this soil of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautama Buddha brought the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peace mission measures are not simple.
The soldiers of our security forces have to work through the inaccessible areas.
We have to live among different people.
We must know and understand different situations and different cultures.
The local requirements and ecosystems of the region must change themselves.
Remembering our brave United Nations Peacekeepers today, who can forget Captain Gurbachan Singh Salariya, who fought for peace in Kongo, Africa, and sacrificed his own self.
Remembering him, all Indians will be proud of their hearts.
In 1989, at the age of seventy-two, he was appointed the Operation Forces Commander in Namibia, who served the country's independence.
General Timaya, head of the Indian Army, led the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, and lauded all of her for peace.
As India is peaceful, the message of peace, unity and harmony has always been given all over the world.
It is our belief that everyone should live with peace and harmony and move towards creating a good and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our holy land was blessed with the great ones who have served humanity freely.
We were one of the extraordinary people, Sister Nivedita, who called Bhagini Nivedita.
Even though Margaret Elizabeth Nobel lived in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda named him Nivedita.
The word 'Nivedita' is completely dedicated.
Afterwards, they dedicated themselves to the name.
Yesterday, Sister Nivedita's 150th birth anniversary was.
They are ready to dedicate their lives to the poor by the influence of Swami Vivekananda and serve the poor.
Sister Nivedita's heart suffered from the injury in the British rule.
Not only did the British slave our country, but they tried to make us mentally slave.
They were constantly striving to create an absurdity amongst us by showing our culture shouting.
Bhagini reiterated the pride of Indian culture.
The revolutionary female of the renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati is known as women empowerment.
It is said that it is inspired by Bhagini.
Jagdish Chandrabosu, a great scientist of Bhagini Nived, worked in collaboration with him.
They helped in propagating Bose research through articles and conferences.
Indias unique beauty is spirituality and science in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Jagdish Chandrabose are its strong examples.
Hundreds of people died when a terrible plague spread in Kolkata in 1899.
Citizens have started sanitation work on ropes and roads without considering their health.
Sister Nivedita, a woman who came out to serve the poor even though she could live a comfortable life.
Inspired by this sacrifice, people came forward to cooperate in service matters.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all my best wishes to all the children on the occasion of the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the greatest heroes and heroes in the creation of a New India.
Your concern is true that the diseases arising out of old age and the diseases arising out of the evening of life are now being seen in children.
It is surprising to hear that children are also afflicted with diabetes.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are a lifestyle disorder.
The main reason for such diseases is the lack of physical activity in lifestyle i. e. physical activity and changes in food habits.
The society and the families have to pay attention to this.
If you think about this, you don't need to do anything special.
It is necessary to make small things fit and regularly habitat and make it their own habit.
Instead of climbing up and descending the children on the lift, make the habit of climbing and roaming up the stairs.
After dinner, try to walk with the entire family with children.
Yoga for Young India, Yoga for Youth India.
I'm telling you that a person of any age can make it easier.
It is simple because it is efficient to learn indifference and it is simple to say that it can be done anywhere.
It doesn't require any equipment or fields.
Several studies are being conducted on how much Yoga benefits in controlling diabetes.
We need to make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of our life without seeing it as a medium of treatment.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends and sportspersons, have made good news in the last few days.
Our sportspersons have played the country in different games.
In Hockey, India won the Asia Cup Hockey crown through a good game.
Our sportspersons played a good game so that India could become Asian Cup champions after ten years.
Earlier, India won Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
I convey my best wishes to the sports staff that helped the entire team.
After Hockey, India was also a good news in Batminton.
Batminton Star Kidambi Srikanth showcased the best sports and gave Denmark Open Crown to Indians proud.
After the Indonesia Open and the Australian Open, the Super Siris was the crown.
I convey my best wishes to our young friends for this achievement and the pride of India.
Friends, FIFA Under 17 World Cup competitions were held this month.
All teams from all over the world came to India and showcased their skills in the football fields.
I also got the opportunity to see a game.
The sportspersons and audience were very excited.
The World Cup competitions were successfully conducted and all the teams showcased their best games.
The young sportspersons of India have not been able to win the crown.
The whole world, including India, enjoyed the festival of this game, tournament was attractive and attractive to the football lovers.
The future of the football is bright.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons and those who worked with them.
Some people send pictures of the missions of children, some will be the story of the joint efforts of the youth.
At the same time, a team of Government organisations called the Eco-system Protective Organisation (Economic Rescue Organisation) came out to clean the fort of Chandrapur.
In this two-two-day work, people continued to work on the fort as a composition of a group without fatigue.
I am surprising to see the pictures that you will be disappointed and disappointed by seeing the sculptures around you will say that the dream of sanitation will be realised and you will see the youth of the Ecological Protocol Organisation, their sweat, their excitement and the active pictures of their determination.
Your disappointment will turn into faith.
This Bhagirathi effort for sanitation is a marvellous example of beauty, collaboration and harmony.
My dear countrymen, all of us will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on 4th November.
With the consumption of food together, the minds of the people have a sense of unity and equality.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages to a real life - to celebrate the name of God, to teach and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev had to say to him.
In the coming year, we are going to celebrate the 550th Uday Year of Guru Nanak Dev.
Come, let us try to move forward through his message and the path of teaching.
My dear countrymen, two days later on October 31, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he has laid the foundation stone for modern Akhand India.
If we travel through the extraordinary life of that great son of Bharatamba then we can learn a lot.
His expertise was to bring thoughts to work.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was tied to work on a trail of India.
He assured that millions of Indians should be brought under the bottom of a nation, a Constitution.
He had the power to overcome all obstacles in his ability to make a firm decision.
He set a goal and moved forward towards that goal.
He could have done this thing to unite the country.
Everyone was equal to a nation in his imagination.
I would like to say that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has said that we are always inspiring.
These words of Sardar Saab are inspiring and adventurous to our vision of New India even today.
That is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
I urge all of you to participate in this festival of mutual interest in the name of 'For Unity'.
My dear countrymen, after the holiday of Deepavali, with a new concept, with a new determination, you all will resume your daily life.
I extend my best wishes to all the people of the country to realize their dreams.
Three years have been completed after starting the Mann Ki Baat programme that you understand through the skyline.
Today is the thirty-sixth Apisod.
When I talk about Mann Ki Bati, I can talk about those who send their minds from all corners of the country, but I get a lot of treasure.
Most of them inspire me.
A few things are about bringing about reforms in government matters.
Sometimes there are personal grievances, sometimes attract attention to social problems.
Whenever I say Mann Ki Baat, I remind you of what Acharya Vinoba Bhave said.
Today, after three years, I am sure that social scientists, universities, researchers, media experts etc. will visualise this and bring in the light of all the issues.
I am sure that this discussion will be more useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future, it will get a new dimension and new energy.
He told Mann Ki Baat that we should take only as much as we need when we eat.
However, letters came from all corners of the country, social organisations and youth.
After that, many people have come forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Not only in India but also in the world, the Self-Wit-Doter programme has become a major initiative.
This is not just a matter of social media.
Every girl has become a new self-confidence and a new pride.
Every parents started feeling like taking selfie with their daughter.
Every girl feels that she has importance and importance.
Last day I was interacting with the Department of Tourism...
I told those who came out to tourism wherever they went, they wanted to send photographs by connecting me with India.
Millions of photographs and pictures of all corners of weight have become a big economy for those working in the tourism sector in a way.
I am aware of Mann Ki Bati how big a mass movement is being created.
It was three years ago that the events of the last three years were very synonymous.
The country is moving forward through the right path.
This is a big capital for any country, a big power.
I salute the people with my heart.
Once I talked about Mann Ki Baat Khadi, Khadi was not a dress, but an ideal.
Young people are looking forward to tele Khadiya's interest in the household puppet, jewelry, jewelry.
Khadi's sales have increased, so the poor's house is directly connected with employment.
From 2nd October, Khadiq is given a report, it is very valuable.
This will give strength to the poor in our country and we will do it.
Due to this interest in Khadi, the people working in the Khadi sector have increased the enthusiasm to think in a new way for those who are associated with Khadi in the Table and Government of India.
How can we bring new technologies, how to increase productivity, how can we bring solar cataract
The ancient heritage has been devastated for 20, 25, 30 years... to think about how to revive it.
We have added a variety of works.
Several people have created job opportunities.
The Khadi Village Entrepreneurship Division in Pampore, Kashmir revived its training department, which has a lot to contribute to the region.
The resumption of this Training Centre will help in creating new products for innovation, innovation and innovation for the new generation.
Ordinary people and others have been given Khadi products as gifts.
We can directly realise how a thing can be encouraged in a natural way.
My dear countrymen, we all have decided in Mann Ki Baat last month that we will celebrate the Swachhta Festival all over the country on the 15th day of Gandhi Jayanti.
Cleanliness will connect with peoples minds.
Our Honble President started this and the nation joined it.
Today, everybody has become a part of the SwachhtaDayatya, to be the elderly people, men, women, towns and villages.
I thank the Honble President.
People from all sections of the country are considered to be their subject and everyone is associated with it.
Be it sportspersons, people in the field of cinema, education, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, government employees, police, soldiers and services are associated with this.
There is a change in the public places that if the public places are polluted then the others will be stopped and the workers have started feeling slight pressure.
It is a pleasant thing that in the first four days of the Swachhta Hi Seva movement, more than 75 lakh people have joined the work related to more than 40,000 initiatives.
This time, we're cleaning up somewhere, others are not aware of it.
But if sanitation is a habit, it must be an emotional mode.
This time, fish also took place along with Swachhta Hi Seva.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the edition of Swachhta.
Thousands of children came in colorful pictures.
I don't forget to thank media persons when it comes to sanitation.
They purely moved this republic.
They joined in their own way and contributed to creating a positive environment.
A few days ago, somebody paid my attention to the work of 18-year-old Bilal Dar in Srinagar.
When you talk about Brandi Ambassador, you will think he will be a hero in the sports sector.
If you see plastics, polythenes, utilised bottles and other silver juices then Bilal takes it away and makes some income.
Bilal Corporate Ration gave a vehicle, uniform and he went to other areas and told people the lessons of sanitation, inspires and remains behind it until the results are seen.
Bilal Dar is a young child in age, but he is an inspiration for everyone interested in sanitation.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
Dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that the history of the future is being born in the pregnancy of the history and when I talk of history, it is natural to remember the great men.
This month of October, we remember a number of great men.
In the month of October, the people from Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, who have guided us, have shown us the way for the twenty-twenty-twenty-two centuries.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayaljiza.
What was the central point of all these great men
There was a common thing - to live for the country, to do something for the country.
Gandhiji, Jaiprakash ji and Deendayal ji were miles away from the boundaries of power, but they lived with life and worked for them.
Deendayal Upadhyay and Mahatma Gandhi were talking about the human beings standing at the last end of the society.
Sardar Sab joined the country.
We need to move forward to unity.
Have experienced the diversity of this India, touch it, experience its aroma.
You will see that these diversities of our country will work as a big school for the development of your personality.
The days of holidays, the days of Diwali... we have a habit of traveling somewhere in the country.
Tourist journey is natural .
But it is a matter of concern that we don't see our country, we don't know the diversity of the country, we don't understand, but it is a matter of concern that the impact of the colorfulness has started to like travel abroad.
The people of West India don't know what is in the eastern India.
How many diversity is our country
It should be noted that when Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalanji etc. were told, they had a new inspiration to see and understand India, live and die for them.
All these great men travelled in weight.
At the beginning of their work, they tried to know and understand India.
He tried to empower India.
As a student, can we try to assimilate our different states, different communities, communities, their lifestyles, their traditions to understand their practices and their food habits to learn their beliefs
The value addition of tourism is not just because we are looking at it, but as a student, we are trying to understand it and become part of it.
I would have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of the country if I had my own experience.
I might have got the opportunity to stay in more than 450 districts.
Today, when I describe this responsibility in India, I am very beneficial to the experiences of those journeys.
I facilitate understanding things.
I appeal to you that you have experienced the unity of the diversity of this vast India as a milestone, not as a milestone of our immense power.
It has a dream of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat'.
How many types of food habits are there
You will never have to repeat every day when you have to eat every kind of life.
This is the great strength of our tourism sector.
This holiday is not just going out of the house but it doesn't want to get down for a change, know, understand and get something.
India is inclusive and inclusive of the diversity of millions of people.
Your life will be more prosperous by these experiences.
The limits of your thoughts will be expanded.
Who is a greater guru than experience
Normally it is time for travels from October to March.
People are going to travel.
I am sure if you go this time, you will take this call forward.
Sharing your experiences wherever you go, share pictures.
Please send a photo on the subject of Hash Tag Incredible India.
Please send the pictures if you can read with the people in the moving place.
Not only buildings, but also natural beauty, but also pictures of the life of the people there.
Write a good article about the journey.
Send to MyGovi, send to Narendra Modi App.
I feel that the seven best tourist destinations of your state are being found to be, and I feel that every Indian knows about the seven places or the seven things that will be good for promoting tourism in India.
If you can go to those seven places.
Can you give some information about it
The Government will recognize the films about such places, make videos, encourage them to make publicity.
You can also be a source of inspiration to encourage tourism through the period from October to March.
I invite you for that.
It affects my mind deeply.
I'm a man like you too.
You must have seen a divine example of women's power and patriotism that took place last day.
Its extraordinaryity is that the husbands of Swati and Nidhi are sacrificed by serving Mother India.
Can we imagine what psychological emotions would be without life at this young age
But Balidani Colonel Anand Mahadik's wife, Swati Mahadik, made a straight view of this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He was trained for 11 months and changed his life to realise the dream of the husband.
His wife Nidhi took a firm decision and joined the army.
It is natural for all the people to feel respect for these valours.
I convey my best wishes to the two sisters.
They are making new inspiration and courage among millions of people of the country.
Many congratulations to those two sisters.
Dear countrymen, there is a great opportunity for our younger generation between Navratri festival and Diwali.
FIFA Under 17 World Cup is walking in our country.
I'm sure the football will finish all around.
Every generation will increase the interest of football.
My dear countrymen, this is Navaratri.
It's time to worship Durgambai.
The atmosphere is full of pure and holy smell.
There is an atmosphere of spirituality, festival and devotion all around.
It is believed that the festival of Shakti Sadhana is a festival.
In 2022, when 75 years of India's independence, we will move ahead with a five-year framework to realise the dreams of freedom lovers, the determination of 250 crore people, the immense effort and determination.
Thank you a lot.
English rendering of the text of Prime Ministers Speech by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on 27th August, 2017 at 11 a.m.
My beloved countrymen are respectfully greeted.
On the one hand, when the country drowns on the festivals, on the other hand, it is natural to have disorder in the country when the news of violence is heard from any part of Hindustan.
Our country is a country of Buddha and Gandhi and is a country of Sardar Patel, who lives for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have acknowledged the values of public life, ahimsa and mutual respect, that is part of our mind.
We have been saying Ahimsa Paramodharma since childhood.
I told the Red Fort that it would not allow violence in the name of faith, religion, political belief, traditions.
There are provisions for justice to all persons in the Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Those who take the law, who are in the way of violence, who are individuals or society, will never allow this country, no government will be allowed.
Everyone will have to head before the law.
The law will determine the responsibility and punish the culprits.
Our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not consistent in food, lifestyle or vegetarians.
We can see diversity at all levels of life.
Our festivals are also full of diversity.
Our cultural heritage of all the centuries is observed to see cultural traditions, social traditions, historical events, there will be no uncertain day in 365 days.
If we look at all our festivals, we will also see a festival connected with nature's timelessness.
Everything is directly connected to nature.
Many of our festivals are connected to farmers and are directly related to fisheries.
Today, when I talk about festivals, I would like to tell you "Michami Dukadam".
The celebration of 'Savatsari' was held in the Jain community yesterday.
Celebrations are held in the Jain community in the month of Bhadra.
The last day of the festival of 'Survival' is on the occasion of the festival.
This is a really surprising tradition.
The festival of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
It is said to be the 'Shamavaani' festival and on this day there is a tradition of congratulating each other with the name of 'Michami Dukadam'.
In our scientific scientific sciences, it is said to be a humiliation of a sorrowful person.
The sorry man becomes brave.
Mahatma Gandhi always used to say, 'It is the specialty of a strong person.'
Shakespeare highlighted the significance of forgiveness in his drama 'Murchant of Venice' and said, "Mercenary Ess Tiews Blasset, It Blassath Him Dat Gives Him Dat Taxes", which is a compassionate and forgivenessful one, gets blessings from God.
My dear countrymen, this is the time to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi in every corner of Hindustan.
Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated for ten days.
This festival is a symbol of unity, equality and sanitation.
My best wishes to all the people of the country for the Ganesh Festival.
It is now the time for the festival of Ona in Kerala.
Onam is one of the most beautiful festivals of India, Kerala is a major festival.
It is important for social and cultural.
Onam shows the rich cultural temperament of Kerala.
This festival reflects the message of love and beauty in the society and reflects a new spirit, new aspirations and new faith in the minds of the people.
Now this festival has become one of the encouraging joyous journeys.
In Gujarat, the Navaratri Festival and Durga Puja Festival in Bengal have become attractive in a way.
Our festivals are also an opportunity to attract such foreigners.
We need to think about what we can do in this regard.
Idul Suha will also be celebrated after a few days in this group.
Festivals are a symbol of devotion and faith and we have to make it a symbol of sanitation in a new India.
My dear countrymen, the descriptions of modernization are changing.
A variety of experiments are conducted in every family.
Look how big change is, how happy it is.
As I said, the whole country is full of intellectual awakening.
I'm very happy to know about somebody's new innovation.
Somebody said that an engineer collected some specific soil and mixed it and trained to build a bathing idol.
When you dedicate that mathema in the water of a small skin, it's swallowing up in the water.
He didn't stop so much.
Three years ago, the Swachhta Abhiyan will start and it will be 3 years on 2nd October.
Its results are being seen.
The toilets were 39 percent, now it has been 67 percent.
More than 2 lakh 30,000 villages have been declared to be freed from open defecation.
Many people lost their lives.
But after the flood, when the water drives out, the dirt spread everywhere.
We can create an environment of sanitation throughout the country.
After the construction of toilets, you can join the portal with your own name and the name of your family helped.
You can write in different languages, no age.
You can make short films on your own mobile.
A 2-3 minute long film inspired by sanitation can be produced.
In any language, it can be a quiet picture.
Work yourself as a partner in this.
You will see how bright it will be on 2nd October, Gandhi Jayanti.
After this 15-day waste-building programme, on 2nd October, when we celebrate the Gandhi Jayanti, we can feel the sacred joy of paying homage to the respected Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to make it clear about a special commitment to you.
I look forward to your message as much as you are waiting for Mann Ki Baa.
I'm eagerly waiting for every thing you say to me to learn something.
It's an opportunity to change the things I'm doing.
I benefit your little things to think about many things with a new vision.
"Prime Minister, I am talking about immortality from Pune.
I once went to the mall with her for shopping.
She spent Rs 2,000 for a sari, and spent Rs 450 for a pizza.
But the auto driver, who was captured to go to Mall, described about five rupees.
On the way back, the vegetables were bought and the price was reduced by 4-5 rupees.
I felt very bad.
At large places, we are paying money without questioning the price, but they deny the brothers and sisters who are dependent on us for a few rupees.
They don't believe them.
You must tell me about this in Mann Ki Baat.
Madam, I am grateful to have made a great message through this heartfelt phone call.
I am sure that if my people are habitually habitually treated by the poor, then it will definitely be abandoned.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the country is celebrating sports day.
This is the birthday of Major Dhyan Chand, a great hockey sportsperson in Hockey.
His contributions to Hockey continued.
This is because of the desire to connect our country with younger generation sports.
Sports must be part of our life.
If we think of our youth in the world, we should see our children in sports.
Sports is Physical Fitness, Government Allertness and Personality Enhancement.
What do you want more than this.
Sports are an important medicine for the unity of minds in a way.
Young friends, the Ministry of Sports has prepared a Sports Talent Research Portal to explore and enhance talent.
Any child in the country who has made some achievements in the field of sports, can also appload the video if he wants to introduce his own biodette.
The portal will be uploaded tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports selecting emerging sportspersons.
I am happy to note that the FIFA Under 17 World Cup is going to be held in India from 6th to 18th October.
24 teams around the world are going to make India their own home.
The enthusiasm and zeal of those 6 girls working in Navy inspires us all.
These six girls left the sea in a small boat called INS Tarini.
It has been named Navika Sagar Parikrama.
They will return to India after months throughout the world.
These six children will dare to travel in the sea and this is the first such journey in the world.
My best wishes and blessings to these girls.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating Teachers Day on September 5.
He was the President.
But he himself was a teacher.
He was a scholar, a diplomat, a President of India, but he was a enthusiastic teacher in every sense.
I salute him.
Excellency Scientist, Albert Einstein said that it is the Supreme Art of the Teacher to Awaken Oy in Creative Experience and Knowledge that is, the greatest quality of a teacher is to enjoy creativity and knowledge among his students.
This time when we celebrate Teacher's Day, don't we take a decision
Can you organise a movement like a mission
Teach to Transform, Education to Mpower, teaching, strengthening, learn to lead.
Can you take this mission forward with this determination
Anyone who takes a decision for five years, finds a way to achieve it and enjoy the happiness of achieving it in five years and succeeding in life.
To create an environment for this, our schools, our colleges, our teachers and our educational institutions.
When we talk of change in our country, we will remember the teacher in the society as if he remembers the mother in the family.
Teachers have an important role in making changes.
One thing that has been transformed into the lives of every teacher through a comprehensive effort should have happened in the lives of every teacher.
If we work together, we can play a big role in transforming the nation.
We can move with the mantra of teaching for change.
Please, Prime Minister.
My name is Dr. Ananya.
I live in Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of Harvard University.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in financial inclusion schemes and related social schemes.
I would like to ask you to say that after three years of this Jan Dhan Yojana, which started in 2014, can you say that India shows more economically safe and more powerful accounts and empowerment facilities are available to our women, farmers, labourers, villages and villages
This movement started on 28th August, 2014 with a dream in mind.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be released for three years tomorrow on 28th August.
Thirty crore new families have been linked to this bank accounts.
It is more than the total population of many countries in the world.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, our poor have invested about Rs.
Prime Minister Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana are giving birth to a new belief in the lives of those poor people.
When the poor was hit, some families got Rs. 2 lakhs in a few days due to the insurance of one rupee when the family chief lost their lives.
They will get inspired by it and hundreds of examples have come to me about how many changes are made in the life of a person, how new energy is filled and how new faith is filled.
They can inspire the new generation by interviewing such people.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to Michami Dukad.
Thank you very much.
The speciality of the human mind is that the rainy season attracts the mind very much.
As a result of changing climate and environment, there is a very negative situation.
Over the past few days, people have suffered calamities in some parts of India, especially in Assam, north-eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal.
The State Governments are also making efforts to help the flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and civilians working with service mindset are making immense efforts to help people in this environment.
From the Government of India, all the soldiers, Air Force, NDRF and Armed Forces are working with life money to assist the flood victims.
Due to floods, life becomes very depressed.
The NDRF team was employed.
Climate warnings are very well available due to the development of technologies and the development of environment and the development of environmental scientific development.
As per the climate climate guidance, the timeline of our work is determined to make it a habit, we can escape from great destructions.
When I am prepared for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country are preparing for it more than me this time.
I heard your address on the Chartered Accountants Day, which affected me very much.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Taxes (GST) was launched last month.
I am very happy to hear that things are inexpensive. In the north eastern regions, in the remote hilly areas, a person living in the jungles, I was very scared and now I feel simple.
It sees how much time is reduced from one place to another, and the buses in highways are very low.
Pollution is decreasing due to the speed of trucks.
It's going to goals faster.
This has simplified the speed of transformation, how fast it has been transformed from one way to another, new registrations have taken place, which has created a new belief throughout the country.
Once again, I am confident that economists, management experts and technologists will look into a model in the world about the implementation of GST in India.
A case study will be set up for all the universities in the world.
Because such a huge change in such a large quantity has brought us to the summit of victory because it has been successfully implemented in such a large country with the participation of millions of people.
The world will definitely learn about it.
All States have a role in implementing this GST and all States have the responsibility.
All decisions, states and central governments have taken together unity.
The dream of 'One Nation-One Tax' has been successful.
In the context of GST, I have seen how the officers from the village to the centre worked with dedication and how good avenues have been created between the government and the traders, the government and the consumers.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries, all the departments and officers of the Central and State Governments in this regard.
GST is an excellent example of the success of the socio-power of India.
It's a history.
In a way, it is a campaign for social reform.
I once again bow down to millions of people of the country for the success of such a huge effort.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
On August 15, 1947, the country became independent.
In the month of August, several events have been related to the freedom struggle.
This year we are going to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the India Chhodo Movement.
Our new generation must know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, people gathered together, tried and suffered.
We are inspired to create a magnificent India.
India's mindset united against the British rule.
According to the call of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians were dedicated to fight for life with the mantra of 'Work or Death'.
Millions of youngsters of the country started their studies and observed books.
They got off after listening to the fate of freedom.
On August 9, Mahatma Gandhi issued a call to India Chhodo, but all the big leaders of the country were in jail for the second generation, Dr.
Mahapurushans like Lohya and Jaiprakash Narayan are the leading leaders.
Everything behind this success was the population, the capabilities of the people, the determination of the people, the struggle of the people.
This endeavour from 1857 to 1942 brought this war into its power in 1942.
In five years, in 1947, the British had to leave India through 'India Chhodo'.
I want to connect you with the mathematics.
In 1947, we got freedom.
It's 2017.
About 70 years.
The governments came.
There were successes.
The hopes were awakened.
From 1942 to 1947, it was as decisive years to achieve the determination.
From 2017 to 2022, we have come to our forefront for five years and we can celebrate the 15th of August, 2017 as a visionary occasion.
Let's have millions of decisions.
We can try to fulfill millions of decisions.
We have to take a pledge in that way.
2017 must be our dream year.
It must be part of the vision of the month of August.
Today, it is not necessary to work or die but to join the dream of a New India, to work with the mind and body to achieve success, to live with this dream, to try.
Any decision that can be witnessed within the next five years.
Social discussions can be organised for youth organisations, students and government-organisations.
Let's bring new ideas forward.
Where do we go as a nation
What can be my contribution as a person
Come forward with video, post, blog, articles and new ideas through technology.
Make this goal a mass movement.
uit India uiz is being set up for the youth in the Narendra Modi App.
This is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and introduce freedom fighters.
You must give it a comprehensive propaganda and bring it to the people.
This time, I invite you to know your suggestions on the MyGov App or the Narendra Modi App.
I will read it myself and try to talk about them in time as long as I get it on August 15.
I think it's about 40-45-50 minutes.
Dear countrymen, I want to say something else today.
There is a social ethos in Indias economic system.
We don't ever see it cheaper.
Our festivals and festivals are not only a chance to enjoy.
Our festivals and festivals are the efforts of social reform.
It connects individuals and society.
Thousands of jobs are linked to this festival, such as raakhis, sellers, sweets and sellers.
This is why the families of our dear brothers and sisters live.
We burn the lamps to Diwali, not just the celebration of a light, it is not just the festival or the decoration of houses.
It is directly connected to the poor families of the soil.
But today, when I talk about the festivals and the economics of the poor associated with them, I would like to talk about the environment.
I think when I see something that the people of this country are awakening and more active than me.
For the last one month, the citizens have written letters to me about the environment.
They urged Ganesh Chaturthi to give priority to the environment friendly Ganesha. People should now have the opportunity to plan to love the soil of the soil.
I'm attached to the citizens of this kind of vigilance.
This time I'm talking about it.
I'm sure you'll be with me.
This will help the artisans and the poor artists and they will get jobs by creating statues.
The belly of the poor.
Come, let us connect our festivals with the poor, connect the poor with the financial conditions, let us try to make the joy of our festival the economic celebrations of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country on various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly watching the country's education sector, the economic sector, the social sector or the sports sector.
We, the people of this country are proud of our daughters.
Last day our girls showcased the best performance of women cricket in the World Cup.
The pressure on their faces, the tension was emerging.
I looked at things in another way in that conversation.
I said, Look, there is a lot of hope in this period of media.
Even if you win the game, you won the hearts of 150 crore people.
The younger generation of the country, especially our girls, are actually working very much to increase the talent of our country.
I once again congratulate the younger generation of the country, especially our daughters, and convey my best wishes.
Dear countrymen, I recall the August Revolution, recall the 9th August and recall the 15th August.
2022 recalls the 75th anniversary of independence.
All the people of the country should take a pledge and make plans for five years for dreams.
We have to reach new heights of the country, reach and reach.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
We will move forward with the belief that the future of the country will be bright.
The weather is changing.
The weather is comfortable due to heavy rains in different parts of the country.
Cold wind after rains has been relieved from heat during the last few days.
Whatever there is a lot of busyness in life, however tension in life or public life, it changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great respect and happiness in all parts of the country.
Now in various parts of the world, Lord Jagannath's Rathotsav is being celebrated.
Those who learnt about Baba Saheb Ambedkar may have known that he praised the temples of Lord Jagannath and the traditions there because they include social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
In English, the word 'Jagernat' may be very few people know that it means that no one can stop.
Looking at the meaning of this Jagarnat's neighbour, this word is turned out to be from the chariot of Lord Jagannath.
We can understand how the world has made this chariot of Jagannath in its own way.
Everyone celebrated the holy month of Ramsan with worship and sacredness.
It's here now.
My best wishes to everyone on this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
Ramsan is the month of holy donation and is a month of happiness sharing.
In this holy month of Ramsan, I noticed an inspirational incident that took place in Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
The families of our Muslim brothers and sisters coming in about 3500 years live in that small village and in a way the sisters of the Muslim family are more than the population there.
During this Ramsan, the villagers decided to build toilets together.
17 lakhs for the other needs of the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for making this holy occasion of Ramsan as an opportunity for the betterment of the society.
Every work of them is very inspiring.
The most important thing is that they have freed Mubarakpur from open defecation.
Three states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free States.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana were also announced.
I express my gratitude to the five states, the administration, the officers and the common man.
Then the habit of body and mind will change.
Cleanliness is the same.
Some bad habits are part of our nature.
Last day, a very good thing came to me and I would like to tell you that.
The event is in the Vijaynagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
What was the goal
Construction of 10,000 toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats over 100 hours.
My dear countrymen will be happy to know that the work of construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours has been completed successfully by the common man and the Governance.
71 villages have been free of open defecation.
In and through utensils and vessels.
Recalling the era of Tripura, Shri Prakash Tripura reminded of the eternal period in the history of democracy on June 25.
This awakening for democracy is commendable.
Democracy is not a system but also a culture.
The price of freedom is the continuous awareness of the Entrepreneurs Is the Price of Liberty.
Continuous awakening is required for democracy, so things that affect democracy should also be remembered.
And then we must move forward in the direction of good democracies.
On June 25, 1975, it was an unforgettable night of democracy.
In a way, the Governance was turning the country into a caravan.
He suppressed the voices of the opposition.
Jaiprakash Narayan, along with the dignitaries of the country, were put in jail.
The just system couldn't escape from the terrible shadow of the situation.
Press presses were completely neglected.
Today, students in the field of newspapers and people associated with democracy are constantly trying to increase the awareness of the people of democracy and remind that period of darkness.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
Atal ji had written a poem after announcing the slavery of the slave, which was described in that poem as the contemporary mindset.
My dear countrymen, all Hindustanis are proud of their heads all over the world today.
The 21st June, 2017 was held in the world.
From the sea to the mountains, people have welcomed the sun rays in the morning.
There is no Hindustani who doesn't feel proud.
Yoga was not in the forefront, but when Yoga was linked to the practice of Yoga, Yoga became a glimpse of the world.
Most of the countries of the world have made Yoga Day an opportunity.
People participated in Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level in Peru, the world heritage site Machu Pichu.
People participated in the shadow of Eafle Tower in France.
The programme was organised at 70 places in a small country like Singapore and a week long programme was organized.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and the United Nations.
The Yoga Session with Yoga Masters was organized at the UN Headquarters.
The officers of the United Nations and all the strategists from all over the world participated in this event.
This time Yoga has once again created the world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 50,000 people have made a new world record by doing yoga together.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga Programme in Lucknow.
Our Armed Forces including BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CISF are all part of the work of Yoga with their duty.
Some TV channels have also propagated it.
The Honble Prime Minister said that in the recent past, he said that instead of giving bouquet to different places, he should give a gift to memories of good books.
This was started in Gujarat during your regime, but in the recent times, the use of bouquet is more visible.
Can't you do anything
Can't you do anything to implement the book instead of bouquet all over the country
It was said that Khadi's hands should be encouraged to encourage Khadi.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this programme was going on, but after leaving there, he left the habit.
But in this programme of Kerala, I was again aware of it.
Now it's going to give down a report on it.
We can gradually turn it into a habit.
The boy's age is too low.
I'm gonna leave you after buying your hands.
Welcome to Khadi's calendar and welcome to the poor families.
The cost will be less and it will be utilized properly.
It has been so many years, but the queen of Elizabeth has kept the calendar given by Mahatma Gandhi.
There are many types of letters, many people are burning.
Last day, when you read a letter, I'm sure to tell you about it.
In the southern part of Tamil Nadu, a family from Madurai, Arulmozhi Shravanan gave me a burn.
You know what was that knife.
In view of the study of the children, he was thinking of some of the financial matters and thought that the family would have some financial assistance.
I took loans from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started the work of buying some goods from the market.
It means that the government departments will look into the registration of e-jam.
It's very interesting to write them to me.
They said, "I got money under the Mudra Yojana, started business and I got the order from the Prime Minister's office and from the PMO.
'I was also a new news.
They pointed out what they bought in the PMO - two thermos were received at Rs. 1600.
This is empowerment.
This is the opportunity to promote the commencement of industry.
It has transparency, empowerment, and it has industrial efficiency.
Government-e-Market Place-Jam.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga, on the other hand, we can also be proud of our capabilities in space science.
Today, India is not only on earth but also on the environment.
Two days ago, 30 NANO satellites were launched along with satellites of ISRO-Cartozat-2 Series.
The satellites consisted of 15 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
This NANO satellite launch of India will facilitate great help in agriculture, agriculture, agriculture and natural resources.
We will remember that a few days ago, the ISRO gizat successfully launched 19.
It was the largest satellite of Indias satellites so far.
The newspapers in our country compared it to the weight of the elephant.
Our scientists can understand what they have done in the field of environment.
On June 19, 1000 days of the Mangalyaan Mission were completed.
When we successfully discovered the Mangalyaan Mission, this mission was aimed at a total of six months.
Recently, India's Badminton sportsperson Kidambi Srikanth won the Indonesia Open and enhanced the pride of the nation.
T.
We have got the opportunity to connect with the inauguration of the Synthetic Track of Usha's Usha School of Athletics.
As much as we are associated with sports, the Sportsman Spirit is increasing.
Sports play an important role in personality development.
Sports has a great significance in overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
In our family, children should encourage them if they are interested in sports.
We all have to dream for the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season and the continuous excitement of all this time is a new experience.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you and tell you something else in the next Mann Ki Baat.
English rendering of the text of Prime Ministers Speech by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on 28th May, 2017 at 11 a.m.
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramsan has started.
On the auspicious occasion of Ramsan, I convey my heartfelt greetings to the people of India and the world, especially to the Muslim community.
In Ramsan, prayers, spirituality and donation are very important.
We are a nation that believes in God, despises God, idolaters and opposes idols.
The art of all the ideals, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, which we live together.
The message of religions, castes, ideals and traditions to us is of the harmony of peace and unity.
This holy month of Ramsan will help us move forward the path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I convey my best wishes.
I am very happy to know that many people have experienced me.
I've been enthusiastic to tell me what you're talking about.
We can't read everything, we can't listen to the messages of all.
But I looked together... some tried to learn music, some tried to learn new words, some tried to learn some new things in the UTBL, trying to learn new languages.
I'm very happy, I want a phone call to hear you.
I'm talking to Diksha Kathyal.
I had a reading habit.
But in this holiday, I decided to read something.
When we began to read about the freedom struggle, we realized how many struggles were to be taken to achieve independence and how many sacrifices were taken and how many freedom fighters were in jail for years.
I inspire Bhagat Singh, who has suffered a lot of sacrifice at a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to send a message to the new generation on this subject.
I am happy that the new generation seeks to know our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men sacrificed their youth in jails.
During the freedom struggle, the last great men have done a lot of work in the jails.
Their tales have strengthened the freedom struggle of India.
Years ago, I went to Andaman Nicobar once.
The cellular jail went to see.
It's the birth anniversary of Veer Savark.
Heroes wrote a book Mashi Janmathe in jail.
The poems were written on the wall of the prison.
He was locked in a small cell.
A Light and Soundo Show that is going on there is very inspiring.
Those from all the states of Hindustan, who spoke all languages, had sacrificed their lives in this cellular jail in Andaman.
My dear countrymen, this is the first Monday of June 5.
What is the connection with nature
Connecting with nature is to maintain a good land.
It's better than Mahatma Gandhi's words.
Mahatma Gandhi had often said, "We should think of the unknowing world" - "Woman Mast Care Abode A World One Won Ton C", that is, we need to think about the world that we cannot see.
Nature has a power.
You might have experienced that when you get tired, if you burn a glass of water on your face then how much energy will be
If you open the windows of the house when you get tired, open the doors and breathe in the wind passing through, you will feel a new chaitanya.
When we are in touch with these five elements that are formed by the body, our body itself has a new chaitanya, a new energy.
We've experienced all this, but we don't care about it, it doesn't make it a corner.
Now, when you come to contact with nature, you must surely note that there is no new significance inside you.
Therefore, the global initiative to connect with the nature of June 5 should be the initiative of each one of us.
We have the advantage of waiting for our eastern environment.
If we wait for the environment, it will benefit the future generations.
Thiruvananthapuram is the greatest guidance of the environment and it is important to know that thousands of years ago it was created.
Mother Earth is called Prithviya.
In the Vedas, it is said that the nakedness of ours is due to our land.
The earth is our mother, we're children.
Several festivals in our country and many worshipping practices are related to the environment.
Whether the academic, the citizens, the villagers, the tribal community, the worship of nature, the love for nature, is a part of social life.
We have to describe it with new words and detail new justices.
Some specific reports from the states are playing.
In most of the states, there is a big movement in terms of trees as soon as the rainy season starts.
Millions of trees are planted.
Scholars, social organisations, government organisations and governments are emerging.
This time, we have to encourage trees and contribute to them, dear countrymen.
June 21 is coming and June 21 is a special day all over the world.
This day is celebrated as World Yoga Day.
In a short span of time, the fame of June 21 Yoga Day has reached every corner of the world and connects people to each other.
On the one hand, there are many deformities in the world and India is contributing to the world.
Through Yoga, the world has been able to combine on a trail.
Today, as the body connects the mind, the mind and the soul, Yoga is connecting the world with each other.
Two days ago, I wrote a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world regarding Yoga.
Last year, I had announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some awards.
Some steps were taken in that matter.
I got some suggestions about this and I congratulate those who sent these suggestions.
It's very funny.
Father, mother, grandmother, grandmother, father, mother, mother, boys and daughters, together with three generations of Yoga and upload their pictures.
This combination of today and tomorrow will be an opportunity to give a new scale to Yoga.
Tomorrow, this picture will be a picture of tomorrow, and it will be a pleasant promise of tomorrow.
I invite you all.
There's still about three weeks left to be World Yoga Day.
This is a kind of healthcare scheme.
I invite everyone to be part of it.
When you took me the responsibility of the main servant, I got the opportunity to speak at the Red Fort in Delhi on 15th August and I talked about cleanliness.
Since then, I have been visiting different parts of Hindustan till now.
Some people are doing what Modi is, where is Modi going
I am grateful to him for this thing.
If you hear this phone call, you'll understand.
Prayer Modiji, I'm talking to Naina from Mumbai.
Modi ji, wherever you go, I see that people take special care of cleanliness in TV and Community newspapers.
In Mumbai or Surat, people have taken cleanliness as a mission in a collective manner.
Not only adults, but also children are also aware of cleanliness.
Children who blame the filthy people on the road are naked everywhere.
A few days ago, I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
It is a matter of greater happiness that cleanliness is also associated with my journey.
It is a habit of making all the rest of the preparations to welcome the Prime Minister, but now cleanliness will be a big thing.
It is a pleasure and inspiring one who wants cleanliness.
"When Modi ji decides his journey, ask the invitees, wherever he invites me, what level of cleanliness will be
How many tons of silver will dedicate you to me and I can decide whether to come or not.
The idea is very good, but I have to think.
It is an initiative to say that instead of giving gifts, it will be a gift to make such silky silks.
How many people can be saved from diseases.
What a great humanitarian affair
Look at the wealth, look at these shrubs as dirty as a resources.
Don't see it just dirty.
If we start seeing these swords in a rich manner then new methods of waste processing will come forward.
Young people associated with start-ups will also come up with new schemes and new tools.
With the help of State Governments, the Government of India has decided to set up a big initiative in terms of waste-building power with the help of people representatives in cities.
On 5th June, the World Environment Day is going to provide a comprehensive collection of waste and drainage in nearly 4,000 cities of the country.
There will be two types of buffaloes, one green and another blue.
Cooking wastes, green skins, food habits, eggs and leaves are liquid wastes, they should be kept in green plants.
All this is beneficial in the field of agriculture and it will be reminded of what is in greenery in the meanwhile.
The second elephant is required to polythene, broken dubbs, rubber goods, and all these are dry vegetables in a way.
Varsova Residents Volunteers are responsible for this.
Brothers and sisters, Today I want to tell you something very happy and I am told that the Reasi Block of Jammu Kashmir has been a free defecation free area related to the Swachh Bharat initiative.
I congratulate all the people of Riyasi Block and the rulers there.
I congratulate the mothers and sisters there.
My dear countrymen, in the last 15 days, in the newspapers, in TV channels, in social meditation, the government has been calculating everywhere.
Three years ago, you were responsible for me as a major server.
Several surveys have been conducted and a lot of polls have been held.
I see these things very healthy.
This three-year work has been changed in every way.
People from all sections of the society have analyzed this.
It's a very good way in democracy.
Governments should be responsible in democracy and the government should give people the account of their functioning.
I thank you all for the different and great ideas.
The creative analysis strengthens democracy.
This analysis is very important for a nation awakening awakening.
My dear countrymen, I am an ordinary citizen like you and the impact of a good and bad service as an ordinary citizen.
As I said, the impact of my mind as a normal citizen is important.
Two days ago, in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Honble Vice President, the Honble Vice President, the Honble Spirit Mahodya, etc. released a study book on Mann Ki Baat as a person.
He was grateful to the President, to the Vice President, to the President and to the President of India, Spitz Mahodya, for giving importance to Mann Ki Baat, who was so high in his rank.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat gave a new head.
Some friends discussed with me during the work of Manki Bath.
He said that he wanted to make a sketch about all the things he talked about in Mann Ki Baat, and he gave a art form to mann Ki Baat to show his affection without taking a reflection.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, the next time when Mann Ki Baat says, the rains will come all over the country, the climate will change, the results of the tests will come and the new teaching life will start... when the rain comes, a new dry, fragrance and fragrance will be spread.
We can move forward by expressing love for nature in this environment.
My best wishes to you all.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Malayalam Speech of Speech of Akashwani Speech to the people of India on 30th April, 2017.
Namaskar to my dear countrymen.
What is the knowledge of the children, the aspirations of the youth and the experience of the elderly
Normally it's the habit of people to advise others.
On the train, when someone goes to the bus, if someone coughs, the next person says, do it, do it.
Advice, suggestion is in our nature.
In the first time, when suggestions were received about Mann Ki Baat, the voice of advice was heard, something was found to be learned and the team felt that it would be a habit for many people.
But when we tried to analyze it, it was really funny.
They actually do something more than those who say these views and try to get to me.
They strive in accordance with their intellect, strength, capability and environment to do good.
When I came to the notice, I thought these suggestions were extraordinary.
I was sorry to note that last time I was washing food in Mann Ki Baat.
This is an example of how things are being done in collaboration with the society.
Today is the end of the month of April, the last day.
May 1 is the foundation day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Nature has changed all the rules of sports.
The warmth of May-June in our country had to be felt this time in March.
Some people have sent suggestions about what to do during the summer when they take inspirations from the people for Mann Ki Baat.
Everything is prevalent, not new, but it will be very beneficial to think of it at the right time.
Many friends from Kartik are worried about birds.
They said that water should be kept in the balcony and terrace.
Children in the family are very enthusiastic.
Once they take care of how to keep water, they're utensils, they're utensils, they're utensils, and they're gonna go for ten times a day.
Be careful whether the birds come.
We feel that this is a game, but in fact, it is a good experience to awaken the ghost in the minds of the children.
He lived up to 103 years.
On his 100th Birth Anniversary, the Bohra community launched a massive initiative to protect the pimples through the Burhani Foundation.
I got the opportunity to start it.
They distributed approximately two and a half thousand fireworks all over the world.
It was found in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes the journalists, the milkmen, the vegetables, the post-mans, etc. go home and forget to ask if we want summer and water.
Young friends, I want to tell you some things.
Many of our younger generations are happy to live in a very comfortable situation.
Parents are very safely enriching them.
But I want to tell you as a friend how your holidays will be.
New places, new experiences, new capabilities...
Sometimes see some things on TV, or read in the book, or listen to the experiencers... and feel the same thing yourself...
Experiments are solidarity, you have to get out of the cool breeze.
If we are from the middle family then we are from the satisfactory family.
You will never see the joy of playing in your life.
Do you think that when the children who lead such a life in the society get the opportunity to play with you then how much change will happen in their lives.
This experience will teach you a lot of things.
Go to the forests.
Sometimes summers will be organised, personality development tombs will take place.
It will be done in various development works.
Everyone will be busy in their world with the strength of technology.
Social life is a culture, it is a power.
Another thing I said is about skill, you don't want to learn something new.
Today is the time of competitions.
It will be hard to buy the highest market and some coaching classes will go in the holidays and the next exam will be in danger.
However, it should be kept in mind whether the inner humanity is inadequate, whether it is removed from human qualities.
Can we focus a bit more on skill development
Don't spend some time with yourself from technology.
Learn some musical instruments, learn 5-50 words of a new language, whether it is Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi.
Try to learn something you don't know, you'll have some benefits.
New places, new cities, new villages...
But wherever you go, look like a gynaecology, understand, talk to the people, ask them... it's a different joy to see.
Try and decide the place yourself.
Don't lose time for more travel.
I want to spend three-four days there.
Then go to another place and stay there for three-four days.
It can learn a lot of things.
Show me the pictures where you go.
Share your experiences through HashTag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has given you a good opportunity.
The new generation has almost been freed from the frameworks.
They don't need money.
They are starting to believe in digital transactions.
Do you think you can do this and wealth can be earned
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
Bheem App you've been downloaded.
Your account will be invested at Rs. 10 from the government.
One day, if you join 20 people, you can earn 200 rupees by the late time.
This will enable traders and students to earn.
The project is up to 14th October.
You have played a role in building Digital India.
You will be a guardian of New India.
Holidays and monetary opportunities for holidays.
Introduce digital and wealth.
Normally in our country there is an atmosphere of hate for VIP culture.
However, now I have realized that it is so deep that the government has decided not to rotate with a red light on the vehicle even though it is a big person in the country.
In a way, it became a symbol of VIP culture.
The experience shows that the red light was on the vehicle, but it is a people's mind, and that the VIP culture was intellectually created.
Now the red light has gone, so no one can claim that the red light has gone on the head.
I got a very funny phone call.
People are afraid of red lights.
The government wants to talk about the prohibition of the Red Beekon Light.
I read in the newspaper, every Indian is a VIP in the line.
I'm very proud.
Thank you for that.
Instead of VIP, EPI means Everi Person Is Emportant, everyone has the importance.
Let's work together.
My dear countrymen, I always want to remember our history, our culture and tradition again.
It will give us energy, get inspiration.
This year, we are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya.
We've been finished in other things so that we remember only the centuries.
The centenary may be very important for other countries in the world.
They turned away from themselves and behaviour to those who were not touched by the society.
Thousands of years ago, he tried to enter the temple and successfully reached the temple.
How lucky are we born in our society to make the evils of our society free of all ages
On the occasion of the 10th birth anniversary of Ramnujacharya, we will inspire to awaken the idea of strengthening social unity.
The Union Government will release a stamp on 1st May to recall the memory of Swami Ramanujacharya.
Swami Ramanujacharya is honoured and dedicated to him.
My dear countrymen, there is another significance on May 1 tomorrow.
A few people must know that we are blessed with Baba Saheb for the benefits and respect received by the workers today.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is memorable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb and Ramanujacharya, we remember the great Karnataka Sanyasi, social reformer Jagat Guru Basaveshwar of the 12th century.
Yesterday, I got the opportunity to attend a function.
I got the opportunity to release his descriptions.
In the twelfth century, he thought deeply about the teachings and teachings of Kannada.
In Kannada, he said, Kaya Kave Kailas.
This means that you can reach Lord Shiva's luxurious Kailas through teachings.
That means heaven can be achieved by working.
I'm often telling you to win.
I recall the importance of employment, the Dignity of Labera, the founder and thinker of the Indian Mussoorie group, Dattopant Thangdi ji.
Today, it is natural to remember Dattopant Tengdi when he talks about the workers.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddhism.
People from all over the world associated with Lord Buddha will celebrate it.
The life of Ashoka in India is an excellent example of the journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate to see that the United Nations Vesak Day is celebrated on this great festival of Buddha Purnima.
This time it's going on in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get the opportunity to pay homage to Buddha in Sri Lanka.
He will get an opportunity to renew his memories.
Dear countrymen, an attempt has been made to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' (Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas) in India.
Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas is not only in India but also in the global backdrop.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
India South Asia Satellite will be launched on May 5.
The capabilities of the satellite and its related facilities will help in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
It will help in creating a framework of natural resources, in terms of tele-medicines, in terms of education, in terms of connectivity of more deeper technologies, in terms of people and people-to-people connectivity.
This is an important step of India to enhance cooperation with the entire South Asia.
An invaluable gift.
This is a great example of our commitment to South Asia.
March 26 is Bangladesh's Independence Day.
A historic battle against injustice is a unique victory for the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh.
Today, on this great day, I convey my best wishes to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day.
Rabindranath Tagore - His memories are traditional for all of us.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore has also created the national song of Bangladesh.
The most interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913 but also the British gave him the status of Nighthood.
However, in 1919, when the British combined the Jallianwala Bagh, Rabindranath Tagore was a group of great men who were killed.
That was a 12-year-old child who had a deep impact on his mind.
The child, who was laughing at fields and sports in childhood, has made a new inspiration in the brutal massacre of Jallianwala Bagh.
The 12-year-old girl, who was in 1919, is Lord Shahid Bhagat Singh, the inspiration of all of us.
On March 23, the British weighed Bhagat Singh and his friend Sukhdev and Rajguru.
We know, even at the time of death, it was pleased to serve Bharatamba on the faces of Lord Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
All the dreams of life were dedicated to the freedom of India.
These three heroes are inspiring to all of us even today.
We cannot describe the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
As the British empire, this moon was also scared.
The British were in jail, the weightlifter was sure, but the British had the idea of what it was about them.
That's why they were killed on March 24 and killed on 23.
They did it unusually without anybody knowing.
Then they brought their body to today's Punjab and burnt the English without anybody knowing.
When I got the opportunity to go there for the first time a few years ago, I felt like a spectacular evolution on the earth.
I will definitely tell the youth of the country that if you get the opportunity then you must go to the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Badukeshwar Datt.
It was an era of freedom, its intensity, its propaganda.
On one hand, the heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth of the Armed Revolution.
In the freedom struggle of India, a direct form of Gandhijis thinking and his style was seen in Champaran.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and inspired the nation.
Today, we cannot assess the Satyagraha of Champaran based on the form of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
A man who came back to Hindustan in 1915... just two years...
It was just a beginning.
We can imagine how much he would have suffered at that time and how much he would have worked.
Champaran Satyagraha was an opportunity to recognise Mahatma Gandhis institutional capabilities and the capabilities of public interest in the country.
Mahatma Gandhi, through his behaviour, organised, inspired, inspired to fight the poor and illiterate people in front of the British Empire.
This magnificent power is that Champaran satyagraha shows us so that we can recognise the glory of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we talk about Mahatma Gandhi a hundred years ago then Champaran Satyagraha is a big study for any person who starts public life.
This is the foundation of a New India, which is an attempt to change the desire and desire of 150 crore people to change.
New India is not a government imagination, but a democracy party's performance.
New India is the call of 150 crore people.
This is the imagination of how 250 crore people together want to build a divine India.
There is an idea among the 150 crore people, there is a zeal, a imagination, an aspiration.
They're doing it like penance, like calm servants.
There are many people who go to hospitals and help patients.
As soon as he knows, there are many running for blood donations.
If someone is hungry, there are many who think about giving them food.
Let us say that our country is a multi-dimensional dynasty.
The vision of God is a public service is in our sins.
And if we look at it with social consciousness, then how much power will be formed if we look at it.
When we talk about New India, we should think about it, we should analyze it and look at it through a different vision corner.
If we determine that 250 crore people, if we determine the path with determination, then if we take one step after the other, then the dream of 150 crore people of New India will be fulfilled by us.
Through the budget, the government should not be able to get the money through the schemes.
If we decide that transportation laws will be pursued, if every citizen decides that my duties will be responsively responsive, then every citizen will ensure that there is no use of petrol or diesel in a week...
This is a small thing and you will see that this dream of a New India is realised in this country of 250 crore people.
This means that every citizen should follow his citizenship and follow his duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you.
Over the past few months, people in our country are participating in the Digital Revolution of Digital Payment.
The poorest of the poor are also trying to learn it, and gradually people are moving towards making transactions without currency.
The Digital Payment has taken several methods after the abrogation of notice.
It's just two and a half months since the beginning of the BHIM App, but so far, about one and a half crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
150 crore people, if they want, don't wait for one year.
It's just six months.
We can do this in the daily life.
It is a great service to the country that you cannot imagine and you will be the heroes of the fight against corruption and corruption.
Several Digidhan Melas have been held to teach the people and to make people aware.
100 programmes are being organized across the country.
80-85 programmes have been carried out.
There were present methods.
Approximately 12,000 people received gifts for consumers.
Seventy thousand people received gifts for traders.
Everyone is determined to move forward with this method.
On April 14, Dr.
The Digidhan Mela is going to end on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb on 14th April.
After 100 days of completion, a big event is being held.
There's an arrangement for mega hate.
In the remaining days of Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary, we can propagate Bhim App.
Please play our role in reducing the payments made by the notice.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to get different kinds of suggestions from the people of Mann Ki Baat every time, but the need for cleanliness is increasing every time.
My daughters from Dehradun to Gayatri, who learnt from the eleventh grade in the eleventh grade, reminded the message: "Good Prime Minister, Praise, I congratulate you for the first time on winning this election with a great majority.
I want to tell you my motherfucker.
I want people to know how important cleanliness is.
I'm going through a river every day, in which people put a lot of swords and polluted the river.
Brothers and sisters, Look at a child studying in the eleventh grade, how painful is the river pollution.
How angry the child gets to see the snakes on that river.
This is a good symptom.
Since the commencement of the Swachhta Abhiyan, a new awakening has been created in the country.
Hate is increasing.
Whether it is awakened, a vibrant partnership or a republic, it has its own importance.
I want to tell all those who listen to Gayatri in this Manki Baat today that the message of Gayatri should be a message to all of us.
Everything that is seen is filled on the plate, and can't eat the whole thing.
It's not a matter of telling anyone.
In our houses, when the mothers call the children, they say, take it all for you, son or daughter.
Second, if it benefits a little, it is financially profitable for the family.
It is a good thing to think for the society, but it benefits the family.
I am not compulsory in this, but I urge you to be more awakening.
I know the youngsters who are doing great things in this regard.
They've made a mobile app for this.
If there is such a sweet food somewhere, then people call and eat that food properly.
This is the youth of our country.
We can see people like this anywhere in all the states of Hindustan.
We might inspire them not to look after their life and food.
Please feed as much as you can.
Look, it's the way for change.
Those who are awakening about health always say - keep the stomach and a little claw, keep the plate a little bit of claws.
On 7th April, when we talk about health, it is the World Health Day.
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) has been set up by the United Nations by 2030.
This time, the United Nations is focusing on Depression on World Health Day on April 7.
We also know the word depression, but if the word means, some people call it depression.
According to an estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world are under depression.
The creation of a psychological environment begins to get rid of it.
The first mantra is to say it openly than to stop depression.
Tell friends, parents, brothers and teachers what your minds are.
Sometimes alone, especially children living in the hostel, will have more trouble.
It is the nature of our country that we live together and grow together and there is a large family, which reduces the chances of depression.
Otherwise, it's not when everyone goes out together, I don't come, I'll be alone.
Those who can speak to him openly have an opportunity to sit with him.
Smile and inspire him to talk to him, bring it out if you're in trouble.
It's a good way.
Depression causes physical and mental diseases .
Like diabetes accumulates all kinds of diseases, depression makes us free of all the capabilities to stop, fight, dare and decide.
If you don't want to open your minds in front of yourself, you can seek help from anybody who is serving around.
Help yourself, share your sorrows.
If you try to understand the grief of someone else, if you do it with a serving motivation, you will have a new confidence.
If you are associated with others, helping someone, serving with selflessness, you can reduce the weight of your mind.
Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in eliminating tensions, eliminating from mental stress, enjoying happiness.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
Last day, the Central Government had taken a big decision.
The number of women working in our country is going on every day and it should be welcomed that their role is increasing.
Responsibilities of the family are required to participate in the financial responsibilities of the household because of this, injustice has to be done to the newborn.
Therefore, the Central Government has taken a big decision.
India has taken such a big decision for our sisters.
Dear countrymen, the holy day of Ram Navami on 5th April is Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
May the life of these great men inspire us, let us pledge for a New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Representation, Year Representation, New Year are coming, and in this new year many congratulations to all of you.
This is the beginning of cultivation after spring and the time for farmers to get the results of their studies.
In different parts of our country, this New Year is celebrated in different ways.
The New Year is being celebrated in the names of Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Andhra and Karnataka as New Year, Chedi-Chand for Sindhis, Navreh in Kashmir, Sanvasarpuja in Awadh region, Jud-Seetal in Mithila in Bihar, Satwani in Magadh.
India is such a diverse country.
My best wishes to you in this New Year.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Malayalam Speech of the Special Broadcasting on the eve of February, 2017, at 11 a.m.
New leaves have started coming in the trees after the leaves of leaves.
Flowers bloom.
Gardens and gardens are greenery.
The fowl of the birds starts attracting the heart.
Not only flowers, but also sunlight bright fruits are seen in the branches of trees.
The fruits of the summer candy flowers begin to appear in the spring.
Amir Khusro skins have been very funny about the changing moments.
Amir Khusro writes: When Phul Rahi Sarasom Sakal Ban, Ambava Phute, Tesu Phulekoyal Bole, Dar-dar (blowing of the windows, singing of the skulls and the skulls) enjoy the nature of the skulls when the skulls are comfortable.
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri, Holi Festival etc. enhances happiness in human life.
Shosha Jalan wrote on the Narendra Modi App: Many people do not know about the achievements of ISRO.
So they say that the launch of 104 satellites and information about interceptor missiles.
Shasha ji recalled the prideful achievement of India.
The role of technology and science has been marked in fighting poverty or preventing diseases or connecting with the world.
February 15, 2017 is a day of pride for India.
Our scientists have created an opportunity to raise Indias heads in front of the world.
We all know that the ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in the past years.
The last day ISRO has established a world record in Shunyakash after the success of reaching Mangalyaan in Mangalya.
ISRO Megadayutya has successfully launched 104 satellites from different countries like America, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Egypt and India.
India is the first country in the world to create history by bringing 104 satellites together to the environment.
It is a matter of great happiness that PSLV will be successfully launched for the 38th time.
This is not only the ISRO but also the entire history of India.
ISROs affordable and efficient environmental mission is surprising all over the world.
The world has complimented the success of scientists of India with an open heart.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 villages is the most important.
We have some pictures as soon as our satellite arrives there.
It's starting its job.
It is a matter of great happiness that our young scientists have led the entire leadership of this mission.
The role of the youth and women is an important part of the success of the ISRO.
I convey my best wishes to the scientists of ISRO for the people of the country.
For the common man, they have always been aimed at bringing the environment for the service of the nation, and that everyday, new pillars are pushing on their crowns.
India has successfully tested the Balistic Interceptor Missile in the security sector.
You will be happy to know that the world's hardship has achieved this achievement for four or five countries.
Scientists of India showcased this.
Its accomplishment is that even if the missile aimed at India is from a distance of 2,000 kilometres, the Missile is destroying it in the interaction.
Looking at new technologies, we are happy to see new sciences.
Gijna has played a major role in human development journey.
Efforts are continuously going on to know the creation of the universe and the human minds.
New science and new technologies are born from it.
All the technologies and all the new forms of science are being born in a new era.
My dear youngsters, we are talking about the hard work of science and scientists and I have often said in Mann Ki Bati that our younger generation should increase the innovation of science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Today, scientists have become the reason for a new change in the life of future generations.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say, "No science was broken from the sky in a tight manner.
All sciences have been developed and built on experiences.
The brilliant Bapu also said, "I am filled with the enthusiasm, teaching and dedication that led them to the discovery of modern scientists who followed the truth.
Science seeks how to use those principles to aim at the needs of the common man, what should be the medium of technology, because it is considered to be the most important contribution to the common man.
Recognizing, showcasing, informing people, how to benefit the common man, how to produce more products, how to use commercial use.
Sometimes, it shows the importance of science to find peace.
All arrangements are being made in line with technologies.
In a way, technology is becoming an excellent one of our lives.
Digi-dhan Yojana was very important in the last few days.
Especially the younger generations are habitual to make digital payments through their mobile phones.
I see this as a good wish.
In the last few days in our country, the Lucky Grahak Yojana and the Digi Dhan Business Yojana have received a lot of support.
For nearly two months, a thousand rupees per day will be awarded to ten thousand people.
Through these two schemes, the country has got its approval for the launch of digital payments in India.
Under this scheme, more than one lakh consumers have received a prize of Rs.
More than 4,500 traders have been awarded 50,000 rupees.
Farmers, traders, small businessmen, others employed and all the households and students are enthusiastically participating in this.
Asked that only the youth or the adults come, the awardees have a 15-year-old youth and are 65-70-year-old.
Shri Anand ji of Mysore was happy to write on the Narendra Modi App and he received a thousand rupees prize under the Lucky Grahak Yojana.
So I felt that they were dedicated to me a thousand rupees, and I gave them a thousand rupees.
I am glad that Anandji, your name and your work gives us happiness.
You have done inspirational work for everyone.
In Maharashtra, a young friend, Puja Nemade Post Graduate is a student who shared his experience of how they are used in the Rupee Card e-Valta family and how much they are enjoyed using it.
On completion of 100 days, the Lucky Grahak Yojana is Rs. 14.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
On April 14, a huge award for crores of rupees is going to be held.
It's forty-five days left.
Remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar, don't you think about this
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary has passed away.
Recalling him, you should also teach at least 125 people to download BHIM App.
Teach how money is being circulated, especially small businesses nearby.
This time Babasaheb Ambedkar's Jayanti give special importance to Bhim App.
Go home and get the BHIM App to 125 crore hands with everyone.
In the last two-three months, this movement has achieved a lot of success in many townships and villages.
The farmers of our country have produced foodgrains to get rid of the records this year.
Our farmers are giving all the suggestions that the last time has been revised.
It seemed as if the crops of the farming are being celebrated today, it seems as if the poultry and the poultry are celebrated.
This year, more than two and a half lakh tonnes of foodgrains were produced in the country.
The farmers of my country listen to the sounds of the poor and about 290 lakh hectares of agricultural land have cultivated different peasants.
The government is constantly trying.
Last day, a programme of senior officers from 23 states was held in Telangana under the leadership of Secretary, Ministry of Cleanliness, Government of India.
We can see the wealth from waste.
This is a proven thing.
If a six-year-old family has a standard doubling toilet then it is filled in about six years.
After that, you can leave the dirt back to the second bag.
In six to twelve months, the waste of the pit is completely jerked.
It is very safe to handle such drunken waste and it is a very important piece of NPK as a curve.
The farmers are well aware of the NPK curtain.
Nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium are very nutritious, which is considered to be very good in the field of agriculture.
As the government has taken this step, others would have taken such measures.
Several departments are regularly conducting Swachhta Diwara at the Government level.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development is going to join the Ministry of Tribal Development and strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan in the first round of March.
The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MHRD) has taken the initiative in collaboration with the two Ministries of Waterways and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation.
We all know that if any citizen of our country does what is good, it will be honoured that the entire country will reach a new glory and confidence will increase.
I once again congratulate all the team players.
The country is proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends.
It is believed that the Divyang brothers and sisters are efficient and determined, brave and emotional.
As a result, we get to learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or environmental matters, women in our country are not behind anybody.
We are moving together and making the name of the country bright by taking the achievements.
Our women received silver medals in the Asian Ragbi Sevens Trophy in the last few days.
My best wishes to those players.
World Womens Day is being celebrated on March 8.
Today it's not just a government programme.
The thinking of the people has changed for years.
It feels joyful to hear the news that the girl was born to be celebrated.
In a way, the positive thinking of girls has become a cause of social recognition.
In the district of Gudalur in Tamil Nadu, it was learned that child marriages have been stopped due to a specific movement.
So far, about 175 child marriages have been stopped.
Under the Sukanya Samridhi Yojana, the district administration has opened bank accounts for more than 50,000 girls.
According to Convergence Model in Katwa district of Jammu Kashmir, all sections are engaged in Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme, along with organising the Gram Sabhas, the district administration is making several efforts to handle organised girls and ensuring their education.
Under the Housing Visit of Harghar Dastak in Madhya Pradesh, a mass movement is being organised for girls' education in every village and every household.
Rajasthan, our child, our school, Apana Bacha Apana Vidyalaya, has undertaken a scheme to inspire and inspire the girls who have been educated in the school again.
In fact, Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme has been taking various forms.
This is a good symptom.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
On the one hand, when our country enjoys rainy season, on the other hand, there are festivals and fairs in every corner of India.
It's like this till Diwali.
Perhaps, our ancestors have made the form of a cycle, economic and social life that should not be complicated in the society in any environment.
In the past, we have celebrated several festivals.
Everyone is able to find solutions to today's problems from the life of Shri Krishna.
Despite all these significances, take up the work of Sarathi in the battlefield.
Sometimes pick up the mountains, sometimes beat the leaves of eating.
I mean, there is a new feeling in all the things of Krishna.
So today, when I talk to you, I pay attention to the two fascinators.
One is Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohanan and the other is the charming one.
The Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohanan left the Yamuna coast and stayed on the sea shore in Gujarat in Dwarka city and Mohanan, born on the sea shore, reached Delhi on the banks of Yamuna at the end.
Whether it is the significance of selfless service or the significance of knowledge, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna, whether it is the significance of enjoying all the heights of life.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 100th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
A new pillar has been set up for human history.
The service, service perspective, the responsibility of service was always a part of his life, which was always associated with Mahatma Gandhi.
In his life, the example of service has been taken forward.
Mahatma Gandhi was individual, society, humanity and humanity.
He always emphasized the importance of social integration in the fields of Africa, whether in the Tolstoy Family, in the Sabarmati Ashram, in the old age or in everywhere.
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to visit several important places related to the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi had given importance to organisation with the spirit of service.
We have to bring the ideas of social service, social growth and social organisation into our practical life.
In the true sense, this is the tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the real functionality.
There will be a lot of opportunities like this, and we will be together.
What's Gandhi 150
What can you share in these efforts as an individual
Think of what value addition is yourself.
There's Ladies Club.
Let us continue to work in the Ladies Club of the modern times, but all the members of the Ladies Club should work together.
You can do a lot of things.
Formulate old books, distribute to the poor, provide knowledge.
130 crore people will have 130 crore concepts and 130 crore initiatives will be launched.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
During the freedom struggle, the salt satyagraha in Dandi was a great path.
I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
I urge you to travel to any place related to Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
Be it Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaran, the Ashram of War, the places related to Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
When you go to such a place, you must share your pictures in the social media and inspire others.
This time, exhibitions showcasing immense interest in the memories of Gandhiji at the Indian Paulian in Venice Binale.
In this, the Haripura canals were specially attractive.
You will be reminded of the fact that the congress conference was held in Haripura, Gujarat and the event that was chosen as the President of Subhash Chandra Bose was marked in history.
These art exhibitions have a very beautiful past.
Earlier in 1937-38, the then Principal Nandlal Bose was invited to Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the arts of the people of India through the lifestyle of the people.
With his artistic constitution, Nandlal Bose was also screwed.
Nandlal Bose visited villages near Haripura and finally some pictures showcasing the lives of rural India.
These valuable artificial artificial works were a big discussion in Venice.
Once again, on the occasion of the 100th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I urge all Indians to take a pledge.
For the country, for the society, for anybody else, something has to be done.
This is the best, real, real, real activity of Bapu.
Our dear children of Mother India, in the last few years, we have been organising a programme of cleanliness free service for nearly two weeks before October 2.
This time it will start on September 11.
This time, the plastic should be given special importance.
On 15th August, I recalled how zeal and zeal that 250 crore people had organised a mass movement for waste management from the Red Fort.
Likewise, we have to stop the use of single-use plastic together.
In this regard, people from all sections of the society are very excited.
My brothers and sisters in the field of trade have put a board in front of the shop and those who come to buy the goods should bring the bag.
This can also benefit the money and their role in protecting the environment.
This time, on October 2, when we celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of Baba, we will not only dedicate to him an Open Defecation Free India, but will also lay the foundation stone of a new mass against plastic all over the country.
Let's make the fuel.
What is greater inspiration than Gandhiji
Friends, Our culture-speaking languages are in a way knowledgeable.
We'll get what we want in our life.
I would like to say a big thing through a culture-speaking language.
It's been written centuries ago but it's very important even today.
It is a very good language - Prithviya Thrini Ratnani Jal Mannan, Subhastimamui, Pashana Khandeshu Ratnasanjya is the similitude of water, Annam and Subbhastima on earth.
The foolish people call stones as ratna.
Anna had great pride in our culture.
We have also made the knowledge of food science.
Awareness about the need for nutrition is being made public through modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting against malnutrition through new and attractive methods.
Accordingly, on the day of the catastrophe, the servants of Anganwadi share each grain from the people.
This grain is used for making hot food for children and women.
After this, the person becomes himself dedicated to this goal and becomes a fighter of the people.
All of us must have heard about the occasion of Annaprashan in all parts of India.
This is the first time to give rice meals to children.
Not a liquid, thick food.
People donate food at some places.
On the occasion of birth day or snakes or memories in the family, the people of the family take nutritious food, good tasty food and take it to anganwadi or school, which provides themselves to the children of the family.
They share their happiness and share others.
It is a good coordination of service and happiness.
Friends, There are many small things like this that can be successfully fighting against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of information about nutrition, the poor and the rich are suffering from malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as a nutritious month throughout the country.
You must be a part of this, add a new programme and share your role in this.
It means that if you can save someone from nutritional deficiency then we can save the country from nutritional deficiency.
Everything I went last week, wherever I saw people, Man vs.
However, I never thought that there would be an opportunity to touch the minds of the youth around the world.
What's happening
I went to Bhutan last week.
Since I have got the opportunity to visit anywhere since I have been the Prime Minister, since I have been celebrating International Yoga Day, somebody is asking me something about Yoga since then.
This is my experience all over the world, not a big leader who doesn't discuss Yoga with me.
The Discussionary Channel is scheduled to communicate in 165 countries in its language.
I am sure that this episod of Discovery Channel will help the world to introduce the message of India, the tradition of India, the natural sympathy in Indias cultural journey.
Today, people want to know about the steps taken for climate conservation and environment in our country.
Did you shoot again and again
I'm very keenly asking.
Look, there's no secret.
I'll open my secrets because there's a question in the minds of many.
Or isn't a secret.
It is true that technology has been efficiently used in interaction with Bir Grills.
Whatever I say, I was talking about it in English, and he was listening to it through a small instrument that was in the ears of the beer grills.
I mean, even though I was in Hindi, he was listening to English, so the conversation was easier, it was a marvellous technologies.
After this show, many talked to me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You and nature must go to wildlife.
I have already told it again and said that we should go to the north east of India.
You have to spend some time there.
Friends, The thinking of environment in India is naturally visible to protect the nature.
Last month, I got the opportunity to release Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
Just a few years ago, it was only half of it.
In the matter of tigers, a Tiger Summit and Tiger Summit was held in St. Peters Burg, Russia in 2010.
He expressed his concern over the decreasing number of tigers in the world and decided that time.
It was decided that the number of tigers in the world should be doubled by 2022.
But this is a New India and we are aiming at a fast pace.
We have doubled the number of tigers in 2019.
Not only the number of tigers in India, the number of protected sectors and community reserves has doubled.
The Gir forest has taken several measures one after another.
In 2007, it was decided to appoint women guards.
Increased infrastructure to promote tourism.
When we talk about nature and wildlife, we say about protection.
We have to think of sympathy beyond protection.
In our scientific sciences, there is a good advice in this regard.
Listen to what has been said in our sciences centuries ago, Nirvano Vadhyate Vyakhro, Nirvayagharam, Chhidthe forest, Save forest wilderness, jungle wilderness, i.e. if there is no forest, the tigers are forced to come to the middle of the humans.
Friends, Who should forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on 11th September, 1893.
The Indian Youth Sanyasi, who has captured the human race throughout the world, has established Indias bright personality in the world.
The words of Mahapurushan like Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893 were bound to change the vision of India.
Come, let us try to live with the real power of Swami Vivekananda, the form of India that Swami Vivekananda has seen.
But I'm not going to cross the details.
Wait till August 29.
To get rid of plastics, all of us will endeavour with full strength at home and outside.
I am confident that this movement will be filled with social media.
Come, with a new enthusiasm, with a new determination, we can move forward with a new strength.
We can move forward by expressing the joy inside with the spirit of service.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Malayalam Speech of Akashwani Speech to the people of India on 21st January, 2017.
My dear countrymen, all are namaskaras.
On January 26, our Republic Day, everyone celebrated with happiness and enthusiasm in all parts of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, this is a cultural festival that makes the future generation aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities, culture.
However, however, the more detailed and detailed discussions about the duties of the citizens and the rights of the citizens are not going on in our country.
Within two minutes, there is a social vision and determination and respect for the martyrs.
Everyone has a natural respect for the army and the security forces in our country.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been honored with various brave awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
Would you like to do something specially to me, especially to the youth, to interact with the social media very enthusiastically
On the one hand, when we are happy to hear the joyful and enthusiastic celebrations on 26th January, the warriors of our armed forces from the security of the country came to Kashmir.
I pay homage to all those brave men, I salute them.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I am making it clear regularly through the programme Mann Ki Baat.
Months of January, February, March and April are the period of exams in every family.
When I came to know about this matter, many teachers, parents, students messed upon me, asked questions, suggestions, pain and pain.
I would like to share my thoughts with you after seeing all this.
I received the telephone message of a child named Creation.
Listen, Creation says, Sir, I want to tell you that at the time of examination, there is a very terrible atmosphere in our home, neighborhood and society.
This is the reason why children are relieved instead of getting encouragement.
Those who enjoy the exam are very few.
It is an opportunity to stress that most of the people are exams.
That's what happens in ourselves, that's what comes out.
There is a feeling of strength on the occasion of the festival of the society.
The best thing is to be revealed.
At the time of exams, there should be an excitement between the entire family, friends and neighbors.
Pressure, you will see that it becomes a plaster, the pressure becomes happy.
The excitement will make the mind weightless.
Look, look, changes will come.
Exams from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup to Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh have been conducted in these three-four months.
You must understand that the power to invite memories is the most peaceful mind.
If you're in tension, all the doors are closed, the outside will not come in, the inside will not come out.
There is an obstacle to the thought process, which becomes a burden.
I am telling my experience that if there is mental stress, we forget, if there is peace, then we cannot imagine it will be very beneficial.
You don't know the problem, it's not that you didn't learn to study.
But, when there is mental stress, your knowledge, knowledge and learning are suppressed, your mental stress surprises all these things.
It seems that life is a problem.
I'll think you're going to write the exam is a year-long study test.
P.
J.
If he was disappointed because of this defeat, if he had failed his life, then he would have received such a great scientist, whether he had received such a great President or not.
Therefore, competition has grown and mental stress has also increased amongst the students.
Mark and Mark Sheet have a very limited use.
It's nothing in life.
Life goes ahead depends on how much knowledge you have received.
If you believe in these things, Mark Wall will be rotten after you, and you will never need to go after Mark.
You will benefit from knowledge, skill, self-confidence and determination in life.
Look at his experience, knowledge and success.
So the market's weight prevents us from going on the right path.
But if you pay attention to the market, you will slowly limit yourself to certain things, just to make it possible.
This is a very psychological battle.
In fact, the competition does not benefit to lead life and it is necessary to compete with itself to move forward in life.
How's the day to come better than the last day
How's the opportunity to come better than what happened
Sometimes you might have seen it in sports, and there will be a quick understanding of it, so I'll tell you the example here.
The characteristics of their lives are that they themselves compete for the most victorious sportsperson.
Earlier, there was no sleep due to the tension of the examination, is it sleeping now
Second, you're worse than him.
Third, equal.
Just keep in mind how to do better than what was done earlier.
Sundar has expressed his views on the role of the parents.
He said that the role of parents is very important in the field of examination.
Because mothers are more aware of the future of children at home, are neglected, they simplify many things.
If you learn to acknowledge, more problems will end there.
So I want to tell the parents that you sometimes do this to the children.
Do you think you want to examine the children for laughing
Look, the atmosphere will change.
A very funny phone call came.
Because I worked like that in my childhood, and I tried to complicate once in my childhood.
That's why I made a lot of preparations.
I tried to find the ways, so I lost a lot of time.
"It's right to say that.
Sometimes when you don't believe in your own ability, the mind will say that if you don't believe in your own ability, you can check whether I have written the right thing.
Perhaps it's right to write the name, and it's wrong to write the next person.
We're gonna write it wrong with us and you're gonna bury yourself.
I mean, it's not much good for the copper.
It's a liar, so you don't want it.
The copper makes you bad, so you don't have a copper.
What is the Prime Minister, asks the children to play on the occasion of the examination, I'm angry.
It is generally believed that students are careless about learning on sports.
This concept is wrong.
This is the basis of problems.
If you want a comprehensive development, there is a life outside books, it is very wide.
It's time to learn to live.
It's time to create life.
That's what it calls the maintenance.
My vision of exams is three things, the right rest, the second sleep for the body, the third intellectual activity and the body has a large part.
Therefore, the rest of the body needs an opportunity to work.
Have you ever thought of seeing the sky, seeing the plants and trees when you sit in front of me
Long breath sends a lot of stress.
There is no need to stand in the room to take a long breath.
Some people feel that they'll sit late in the night, learn more - that's not right.
You must have as much sleep for the body.
So you don't lose time to learn.
A patriot who came to see me about it asked me how many hours are you sleeping
I asked you back, brother, are you a doctor
He said that while addressing the election, your shutdown voice is related to sleep.
Your vocal code gets sufficient rest when you need to sleep.
He gave me a big medicine for not thinking about sleeping and vocal code and my voice.
It doesn't mean just sleeping.
So don't do that.
If possible, do it, don't...
Or this will be a weight, and I would like to advise your family parents not to be weighted.
Remembering your determinations, let us go to the test by relying on your own capabilities.
My best wishes.
Make exams a festival to win all the exams.
And the test will not be exams.
Please move with this witch.
Dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on February 1, 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the Coast Guard officers and the jawans for their service to the nation.
The Coast Guard has been ranked as the 4th largest coastal force in the world by crossing 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in our country.
The Coast Guard has been reinforced in the opposite environment to protect the countrys maritime territories and the sea shore environment by realising this ideal.
Last year, the Coast Guard jawans have taken a major goal of cleaning the coastal shore of our country with their responsibility.
Thousands of people participated in it.
It is surely commendable that they have thought of coastal security and sanitation.
Very few people must know that not only men in the Coast Guard of our country, but also women are successfully responsible for their shoulders.
Our female officer of the Coast Guard is not only pilots and Observers, but also controls the Hovercraft.
Ocean security is today a very important topic in the world, therefore, on the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard, I convey my best wishes to those who are engaged in the magnificent work of Indian coastal security.
On 1st February, there is a Vasant Panchami festival.
The spring is considered to be the best tower.
It is known as the king of springs.
In our country, Vasant Panchami is a festival of Saraswati Puja.
It is considered an opportunity to worship education.
Not only this, it is a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
Mera Rang De Banti Chola, this is the inspiration.
Greetings and best wishes to my countrymen on the auspicious occasion of this Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat Akashwani is giving new forms in their own way.
Since last month, my Mann Ki Baat has started listening to Mann Ki Baat in local languages.
I once again congratulate the Akashvani for their self-inspiredness and congratulations to the countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat is a great opportunity to connect with you.
My best wishes.
Today is an opportunity to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in life.
Jesus Christ said, "There is no means for the poor, we need our recognition."
St. Luck specifically points out that he has not only served the poor but also congratulated the poor. This is the real empowerment.
A story related to this is very famous.
Because the others gave a lot, but the widow gave them everything, today on 25th December.
Two days ago, I got the opportunity to launch several development works in Malaviyaji's Tapobhoomi Banaras.
I laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi.
The Cancer Care Centre, which is built there, will benefit not only in the eastern Uttar Pradesh but also from Jharkhand Bihar.
Today, our former Prime Minister Bharat Ratna is the birthday of Honourable Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country can never forget the contributions of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we have laid the quest for the power of the nation.
As a party leader, as a Lok Sabha member, as a minister and as a Prime Minister, Atal ji established a great ideal.
On the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I salute him and pray to God for his health.
As a worker, I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
Several memories are reflecting.
I have shared an old video when I was shot this morning and I can see how I had the privilege of meeting Atal ji's love year as a small worker.
Today, on the day of Christmas, the people of the country are going to get the benefit of two schemes as Christmas.
In a way, this project was launched on the second of November.
What is the cashlessness between the country, whether the village or the city or the academic or illiterate, how can cashless payments be done, how to buy goods without money is being created all around.
Everyone wants to learn and learn each other.
In order to promote this, to strengthen mobile banking, to become e-payment habit, the Government of India is introducing promotional schemes for consumers and small businesses.
This is not only for a day but also for 100 days.
Every day, 10,000 people get a thousand rupees per day.
For hundreds of days, lakhs of families are going to get a gift of crores of rupees, and you are able to use digital payment methods like mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI, UPSD.
Digi-Dhan Business Scheme is mainly aimed at traders.
This scheme is aimed at all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower section of the middle class.
Therefore, those who buy more than Rs. 50 and less than Rs. 3000 will get the presentation.
Those who buy goods for more than Rs. 3,000 will not get this gift.
Feature phones, ordinary phones, ordinary phones, ordinary commodities will be sold, money will be shut up, so that all of them can be the beneficiaries of this scheme.
These 30 crore people will soon be a part of the presentation programme.
I know that the next youngsters will know this thing and if you ask them, they will tell them everything and there will be children who are studying in your family and 10 or 12, they will tell them very well.
It's simple as you send the Watts App messages through a mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, how to use technology, how to make e-payment and how online payments are spreading in the country very fast.
In the last few days, cashless business has increased by 200-300 times.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
The business community is very well aware of how big this decision is.
When the digital payment businessman promotes online payment system instead of notice in his business, it also gives a boost to income tax.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Mr.
Somebody said that the Government of Assam has decided to give 10 percent rebate if the commodity tax and licens fees are locked in digital form.
If the branches of rural banks are being made at least two digital transactions between January and March, with their 75 of the shareholders, then the government will get 50,000 rupees from the government.
It has been announced that by 31st March, 2017, 100 of the villages of Digital Transformation will be given a prize of Rs 5 lakh as per the Government for Digital Transformation Scheme.
They also announced the digital agricultural shiromani scheme for the farmers and will give Rs. 5,000 to the first 10 farmers to buy seeds and yields.
Congratulating the Assam Government in this regard, I congratulate all the governments for their initiatives like this.
Various organisations have adopted successful methods to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in the village.
GNFC-Gujarat Narmadawali Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd, which mainly focused on cultivation, set up thousands of POS machines in the field of fertilizer sale of farmers and provided 5 lakh grams of fertilizers through digital payments within a few days.
The most interesting thing is that GNFC's cultivation has increased by 27 percent compared to last year.
A country like India must be the first in this area.
Our youth have made a lot of progress in startups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
With new ideas and new technologies, new projects, our youth should give great importance to this sector.
So, we can partner with the entire effort to liberate the country from black money and corruption.
Friends, I'm asking people at Manki Baat every month to share your views and tell you.
Thousands of opinions received this time in MyGov and Narendra Modi App, about 80-90 per cent of the fight against corruption and black money, and when I saw everything, I felt that the impressions would be sufficiently three times.
Some people are detailed about the problems and inconveniences faced by people.
The other companion wrote that it is so good for the betterment of the country that even if it is so sacred, however, however, however, however, however, however, however, however, there are new ways of belief.
I am grateful to the people for their help in writing so many letters.
The emotions like Gurumani Kewal are emerging in every corner of the country.
We all know it.
Who is the person who doesn't have any pain when people are suffering, suffering from difficulties
I'm sorry as you are.
I clearly know that if 250 crore people are standing together, nothing is impossible and people are the reflection of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people for taking part in this magnificent campaign against corruption and black money and salute the people.
The law is the same for everyone.
Whether it is a person or an organisation or a political party, everybody must follow the law and follow it.
Those who cannot directly support corruption and black money have been trying all the time to find the government's shortcomings.
This government is for the common man.
They are constantly trying to know the opinions of the people.
What is the problem of the people, what is the cause of the law, what can be solved.
As a government of ever sensitivity, how many laws are required to be changed and the aim is to reduce the suffering of the people.
On the other hand, I said this was an extraordinary battle, on the eighth day.
For 70 years, how many powers have been incorporated in black money dealings with belief and corruption.
How much their strength is
When they are determined to fight with such people, they are also adopting new methods every day to defeat the government.
When they follow new methods, the government has to adopt new methods to defeat those methods.
If you think I'll be ten, because it's decided that the corrupt, the thieves, the blacksmiths, the blacksmiths.
On the other hand, there were letters from many who gave information about what kind of thieves are going on and how new methods are being detected.
In this regard, I would like to convey my heartfelt congratulations to my dear countrymen.
More than the number of information in the government system, more than the number of information is available from the common man.
It is often a success, because the common man is awakened.
Can anyone imagine how many awakening people of my country are challenging the dangers to bring these drunken powers to light
The third companion who writes the letter is very different, they say, "Modiji, don't weaken, don't stop, how hard it can be, it's just to go a long way.
I specially want to thank those who wrote such letters because they have faith in their letters and blessings.
I took it out and made a strong 'Benamy Wealth Act'.
In the coming days, the law will start working.
Whatever it is to do for the nation's name, it is prioritized.
My dear countrymen, I have said in the Mann Ki Baat last year that our farmers have improved the record of agriculture.
It is a good wish for the agriculture sector.
Last day, India has been proud of the global economic schedule and is the result of the continuous learning of our people and the higher vision of India in global rankings through different indicators.
Indias rank has increased in World Banks Doing Business Report.
According to the Global Investment Report published by Dutch India, India has ranked third in the Top Prospective Host Economics for 2016-18.
India has jumped 32 ranks in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have moved 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and the Logistics Performance Index of the World Bank has increased 19 ranks in 2016.
While reviewing other reports, this is the same way that India is progressing at a rapid pace.
But I am happy to see that some good things are going on in this situation sometimes.
The government is committed to the people with disabilities.
I personally tried to speed up this movement.
My goal was to get the right to the people of Divyangjan and to get dignity.
Our divine brothers and sisters empowered our efforts and faith when they won four medals in Paralimbics.
They not only raised the pride of the country through that victory, but also surprised the people of their talent.
Our divine brothers and sisters are our valuable wealth and strength like all the citizens of the country.
I am very happy to note that after the passage of this law for the welfare of the people of Divyangjan, there will be an increase in employment opportunities for Divyangjan.
Government has increased the coverage of reservation in jobs to 4.
The Act provides for special departments in respect of education, other facilities and grievances of Divyangjan.
In the last two years, the government has organised four and a half and three hundred tombs and provided equipments to the five lakh and eighty thousand brothers and sisters of Divyangjan by spending Rs 352 crore.
The Government has passed a new law in accordance with the desire of the United Nations.
Earlier, Divyanagar was seven kinds of people.
My young friends, Talsemia, Parkinson, Synthesis have joined this gathering.
Over the past few weeks, the news from sports was proud of all of us.
It is natural for us to feel proud as Indians.
The Indian Cricket Team has won four priests against England.
The game of some young sportspersons was appreciated.
Test Captain Vrida Kohli gave a good leadership along with a good batting.
The Indian Cricket Team's offspinner Bowler R.
The Junior Hockey team snatched the World Cup.
Junior Hockey team is receiving the World Cup after 15 years.
Many congratulations to the younger sports for this achievement.
This achievement is a good wish for the Indian Hockey team.
Our women were surprised last month.
India's women hockey team also received Asian Champions Trophy, and now, a few days ago, India's Mahilahokee team has received a wing medal in 18 Asian ships.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the players of cricket and hockey teams.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
We were celebrating Diwali in the last month.
Some wrote poetry, some came to the picture, some came to the cartoon, some made video.
I mean, how many houses were turned into military posts.
I am surprising to see how emotional and visional when I still see these letters.
With all your partnership, the book is prepared by giving you the concepts of the country's army and your vision of security forces.
A young man wrote to me, Prime Minister ji, we will take all the festivals like Holi and Deepawali for the soldiers.
Every minute is immersed in the thinking of the security of the nation.
However, the festivals will remember the house.
But it didn't happen this time to tell the truth.
It's a festival, it's not a house.
It was a feeling that we also celebrated Diwali with 150 crore Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the soldiers, the strength of the army increases by 125 crore.
A few days ago all the priorities of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir were also seen.
They were the people of the Jammu-Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
There were about 40-50 villages from each of the villages in the Kashmir Valley.
I got the opportunity to talk to them for a while.
But when the conversation progressed, the situation in the valley, the law and the future of the children was absolutely natural.
I am very happy to note that the words that I had given to all the princes of the villages that came from the valley of Kashmir were completely followed.
They went to the village and made people far away aware.
A few days ago, when the Board exam was conducted, about 95 percent of the children of Kashmir participated in the exams.
In the Board exam, so many children participated that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are determined to grow new heights of development through education and education for a bright future.
Addressing the nation at 8 pm on 8th November, he said that an important step is being taken to bring about changes in the country.
The more important thing it should be implemented, the more important it should be, and I felt that there would be a lot of problems in our normal life.
I said that it will take 50 days to come out of the impact of this decision and it will be a big decision to return to the normal level only after 50 days.
A total of 500 and 1000 components, such a large country, so many currency, millions of components and decisions are being taken care of the world and all the financial experts are assessing and assessing it.
25 crore people of India are looking at the success of facing difficulties.
There can be a question mark in front of the world.
It is an honour to 250 crore people of India.
There is a firm belief that this decision will be achieved and our country will prove to be transformed like gold.
That's why you are citizens here, you are one of you and you are also the reason for this way of success.
All the elements of the Central Government, State Governments, Local Local Bodies, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of banking workers, more than one and a half lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are working in this regard.
In the midst of a variety of psychological conflicts, all of them are very calm and considered it as a national service and are working as an attempt to make a great change.
It's working without knowing when the night is over.
No matter how difficult the officers of the bank and the post office work.
If the matter of humanity comes, they see that they're two in front.
An accident occurred in Khandwa
Soon, the need for money came.
It was a pleasure to know that when he looked at an officer of the bank, he himself went to the house of the elderly and brought the money for treatment.
Innumerable stories like this are known every day by talking to TV, media, newspapers and others.
It is trying to save the black money by packing the poor and pouring money into their accounts or by doing something to them.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
He said, Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare.
From Tarli village in Tarli Taluk district of Madhya Pradesh and Harda district.
This will enhance the people, and the economy is very important for nation building.
I am with the country in this regard.
I am very happy to note that you've been following 500 and 1000 films.
I would like to thank you with my heart because nobody thought that he would take such a big step when he called Daddy Ayenge.
We learned good lessons to the blacksmith and the corrupt following the fifteenth and a half years of age.
Every Indian priest doesn't have a good day.
People from all over the world also learned to talk about tea-pay discussions.
But I didn't know that there would be a marriage in the Chai Pe Church.
On November 17, I found out that a marriage took place with the Chai Pe Church in Surat.
A girl in Suram in Gujarat gave only tea to those who came to her marriage.
Nothing was done, there was no food programmes because the money was slightly difficult.
In a problem, people find better ways.
People are finding their own ways.
You didn't see this change.
Those who think they don't want anybody to ask them, they don't pay them properly.
Every municipality has got 50 per cent of the money.
But this time, due to this decision on the eighth day, all of them ran to shut down their old books.
In 47 cities last year, 3,500 crore was sanctioned during this period.
It will be surprising and joyful when you hear this, and this week we got a deal of Rs.
There will be many examples of this direct impact.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers are the strongest ecosystem of the economy of this country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the financial system, every citizen is facing it in the midst of difficulties.
Under the Mudra Yojana, there is a significant progress in lending to them.
Under the Mudra Yojana, lakhs of crores of rupees have been given to smaller people like this because millions of people are doing these small businesses and are increasingly increasing the trade of crores of rupees.
But it was natural for them to suffer from this decision.
But now our small businessmen are using technology, through mobile apps, through mobile banking and through credit cards, they serve the consumers and trade on the basis of faith.
I want to tell these small businessmen that you are also an opportunity to enter the digital world.
You also download the bank's app on the mobile phone.
You also have POS machines to use Credit Card.
That's why I invite you.
I am confident that this technologies can be implemented in the entire business of your village.
You don't want to exploit anyone.
I know you, the youngsters of my country liked my decision.
I know you're supporting this decision.
I know that you are very contributing to this thing in a very beneficial manner.
Friends, you are my real soldier, my good friends.
It is a wonderful opportunity to serve Maternity India that is an opportunity to take the country to economic excellence.
My youth, can you help me
Your family might have no idea about the elders, parents, the father-in-law, the mother-in-law, the mother-in-law.
You know what the app is, online banking knows what, online ticket booking is.
As far as you are concerned, it's normal, you're using it.
But today the country wants to do a great thing as a society that is not observed.
It's true that a hundred percent of the society is not possible.
But can't we become a slightly useful society
Once you start a few-minute society, it will not be far away from unknowing society.
You know what is the opportunity for digital banking or mobile banking today.
All banks are providing online facilities.
All banks in India have mobile apps.
All banks have their own volunteers.
Valetta means e-parse.
Various cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, there are Rupee Cards with millions of poor families in India.
The use of Rupee Cards in a very small quantity has increased by 300 times since the eighth day.
Like the prepaid card on the mobile phone, the prepaid card is available to spend money from the bank.
Not only this, technology is simplifying as it doesn't need big smart phones.
I focused on making these arrangements more easier.
Every bank is trying to do it.
My young friends, it's all a big generation that doesn't know.
I know well that you're all working on this great thing.
I have seen the creative messages that you have given on the Watts App - maps, poems, small stories, cartoons, new concepts, sports joys.
But my dear young friends, I tell you again, I need your help in this.
The technology to spend online on your mobile phones will be available.
Not only this, every day half an hour, one hour, at least one hour, one hour and at least one hour, learn how to use this technology, how to download the bank's ups and how to spend the money in your account, how to provide the creditor.
The poor will bless you if you teach people how to use the Rupee Card.
If you teach the common man all this, they might get rid of all distresses.
I don't think that if all the youngsters of India are engaged in this matter, it will take more time.
Within a month, we can present a new India in front of the world.
You can do this through your mobile phone, you can go to 10 houses a day and connect 10 houses with it every day.
I invite you, come on, not just support, we can become a soldier of this change, we can rest by changing it.
We will take forward this war to liberate the country from corruption and black money.
That country made a revolution.
My dear youngsters, I once again urge you to take this initiative forward.
I urge all schools, colleges, universities, NCCs and NSS to do this together.
Let's take this forward.
We have got the opportunity to serve a good service for the country.
You shouldn't lose this opportunity.
You might have seen that the most renowned artist of this century, Amitabh Swachhta Abhiyan, is leading very heartfelt.
Cleanliness seems to be spread in his molecule, so he remembered the birth anniversary of his father and his sanitation.
He has written a verse of a poem of Harivansharai ji, "Man body, a joyful mind, a blessed life, that is me.
Cleanliness in the nerves of his son Shri Amitabh ji (Mitti Kai Man, Mastika Man, Skin husband life) is flowing like blood.
He has written to me through the poem of Harivansh Rai ji - Swachh Bharat, Swachh Bharat.
I respectfully bow down to Harivansharai ji.
Thank you very much for all.
Diwali is celebrated with enthusiasm and happiness in every corner of India.
India is a nation to celebrate any festival in any corner of the country on 365 days.
We have seen the courage to finish untimely festivals.
The changes in festivals are naturally adopted as per the requirement of time and society.
Do it through festivals.
All these things were linked to our ancestors in a scientific manner.
Today, the world is discussing the environment.
Whether trees or plants or rivers or animals or mountains or birds were festivals responsible for all.
That is, the tradition of celebrating holidays in our country was created by Brahmind and Science.
When we celebrate Diwali today, as I said, this festival also provides knowledge and understanding.
This Diwali gives the message of Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamaya to go from darkness to light.
All the parts of the house are cleaning the pillar.
This habit and tradition should be widespread and expanded.
Deepawali is no longer in the border of India.
In all the countries of the world, Deepavali is remembered and celebrated in another way.
Many governments in the world are participating in the festival of Diwali.
Whether it is the eastern countries or the west country or the developing country or the developing country or Africa or the Ireland, there will be a celebration of Diwali in America.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepawali has been painted in the film.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, in London, joined all the communities and organised a Celebration and participated.
What is that picture...
The Prime Minister of Australia has called upon the people of various cities of Australia to participate in the Diwali celebrations with the best wishes of the Indian community.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had visited the last day.
He said he had to return there soon to attend the Diwali celebrations.
It shows that this festival of light has become an inspiration for bringing the world from darkness to light.
Fathers and parents ask the parents to stay closer when the children break the slaughter, and the elders should be careful about nothing.
In our country, the festival of Deepawali will continue a bit.
Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern parts of India.
It is an opportunity to convey my heartfelt congratulations to all of you, even if I talk about Diwali or talk about Chhath Puja.
But it is also an opportunity to express gratitude and thank the people of the country.
Our soldiers are dedicated to our peace and peace due to the events in the past few months.
When we all celebrate Diwali, our soldiers are suffering from all kinds of problems, some are waiting for the airports in the desert, some at the peak of the Himalayas, some at the peak of the Himalayas.
How many responsibilities are responsible.
In words, birds, rings, colors, innumerable feelings...
I can imagine how proud the soldiers of my country are.
I am glad, I am glad that the truth is that because of my freedom and the gift of happiness, I sleep peacefully, because I sleep peacefully because you are the mountains, the jewellery of the mountains and the jewellery of India, like that I salute you and I salute you as I salute you.
My dear countrymen, the houses of my fathers and husbands and sister Shivani gave me a message on telephone.
Come on, let's hear what the military family says.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am talking to Shivani Mohan.
The launch of this Deepavali Message to Jawan programme provides a lot of encouragement to our soldiers.
I'm from a military family.
My husband is also an army officer.
My father and husband's father were officers in the army.
I mean, my family is full of soldiers.
It is a good message that the officers of the border get a lot of incentives and encourages everyone in the Army Circle.
Their families and their wives, along with the Army Officers and the Soulgiers, are making a lot of sacrifice.
In a way, there is a good message for the military community and I congratulate you on Diwali.
My dear countrymen, we will see that the soldiers are not only on the border but also in all areas of life.
Whether it is natural calamities, the dissolution of law and order, the enemies, the courage to bring back the wrong youth... our soldiers are working in every field of life with national discipline.
Earlier, Sikkim was now Himachal Pradesh and Kerala will happen on November 1.
The name of his village is Badhana.
He came here and was discussing the construction of toilets.
Some families have seen that toilets can be produced due to financial problems.
The Swachhta Abhiyan was empowered by providing a thousand rupees to 57 families.
This has enabled Himachal Pradesh to become Open Defence Free.
In the far-flung jungles of Kerala, there is no way of wolves, but a tribal village that can hardly reach the entire day.
People don't go there.
All the engineering students of the Cadet and National Service Scheme have decided to make their toilets there.
In all the states, things are going on at a fast pace.
It's just what I took.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the citizens of these States for their contribution to the participants in this great matter, to make the country's dirty blind.
My dear countrymen, the schemes of the government will be very important and if there is another such scheme then the first scheme will be left out.
But generally no one pays attention to these things.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has guided us all.
You decide on this criteria.
We now have to face the awakening expectations of the poor of the country, that is the need of the hour.
Now there are girls and toilets in schools and boys have toilets.
It is no longer possible to be 20th century and become blind in the village.
Therefore, the programme of providing electricity to free the village from the blindness is successfully progressing.
The efforts are being made to provide smoke free life to 5 crore families and are moving towards success.
Small merchants, small businessmen, vegetable businessmen, milk sellers and borrowers etc. were being caught by the robbers.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account etc. are successfully aimed at evacuating the robbers.
Direct deposits to Aadhar-Lute Bank and direct funds to those who are deserving
This is an opportunity for the common man to get rid of the middle class.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow 31st October, the Mahapurushan of this country has given life to the unity of India and the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb is the birth anniversary of the vibrant Mahapurushan of the unity of the nation.
I think he has succeeded in it and he joined everyone together.
On the same day, we can say that Indira Gandhi had been dedicated to the destiny of the country or the misfortune of the country.
On the birth anniversary of the great man who lived throughout his life for unity, on the birth anniversary of Sardar, the ruthlessness of Sardars is a pain to us in history.
Stay away from the thoughts of the roots and the actions of the roots, and wait for the country.
Sardar Saheb's lifestyle started in the fight for farmers.
The farmer's son was.
Sardar Saheb played an important role in bringing the freedom struggle to the farmers.
Nowadays, we're listening to the name of 'Amul'.
Even today, people from outside India are aware of all the products of it, but the co-operative milk producers think about the unit is a result of Sardar Saheb's divine vision.
He gave importance to this thinking in 1942.
We have seen how it was, in the form of an abundance of farmers' happiness and prosperity.
I salute Sardar Saheb with respect.
On this single day, on 31st October, we should remember Sardar Saheb and understand the vision of unity.
My dear countrymen, Kartika Purnima is a glimpse of this festival of Diwali.
The knowledge and advice given by Guru Nanak Dev is not only Hindustan but also the entire humanity.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev was service, honesty and good for all.
When there were disorders of touch, casteism and supreme ethos, Guru Nanak Dev Bhai Lalo became his colleague.
If we want to move with the mantra of Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, then we will have a better way than Guru Nanak Dev.
Guru Nanak Dev also prays on the occasion of this Prakash Festival.
My dear countrymen, once again in the name of the soldiers of the country, on the occasion of Diwali, many congratulations to you all.
Your dreams and concepts can be fulfilled in every sense.
May your life be happy and peaceful.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Malayalam Speech of the Speech of Speech by Akashwani to the people of India on the 25th September, 2016.
My dear countrymen, you all are greetings.
We lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri sector last days.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay tributes to them.
The loss was lost by the son, the brother lost and not the families of the husband lost.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our army.
There are many opportunities to talk to men and politicians.
All parents want that all schools and colleges should start simultaneously.
They want their crops, fruits and vegetables to all the markets across India.
I mean, the economic business also wants to do well.
Over the past few days, the business has started to run well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path of peace for our problems, the path of our progress and the path of development.
For our future generations, we have to give new heights of development.
I am sure that we will find peace together for all the problems and will prove to be the right way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the individuals of Kashmir is the responsibility of the Governance.
The Governance will have to take some measures to carry out laws.
I would like to tell the security forces that the use of our power and laws is for peace and peace for the common people of Kashmir, for their comfortable and peaceful life.
Sometimes those who think differently from thinking of us keep new ideas.
I have got the opportunity to know a lot of things from the social media for the next time.
In every corner of India, there is an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of all kinds of people, which promotes the strength of democracy.
Last day, a child named Harsh Vardhan, of class 11th, presented a different idea before me.
He wrote, I felt sorry after the terror attack in Uri, and I wanted to do something.
But I don't know what to do, like me, a little boy can do.
Yes, the child presented it with a creative vision.
But when the 1965 war took place, Lal Bahadur was a scientist who was leading us, then there was a zeal, anger and humiliation of patriotism.
Everybody wanted to walk something, thought of doing something.
Lal Bahadur Scientist Ji has tried to touch this emotional level of the country in a very good manner.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan and inspired the common man of the country to work for the nation.
Lal Bahadur Scientists were showing that there would be other ways to show patriotism among the sounds of bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi was fighting for freedom, when the struggle was very strong, he felt that a step was taken for the dedication, he was observing a very effective way to bring the power back to creative things in the society.
Whether we and the army are responsible for their responsibilities, do their duties, if we are able to play a creative role with the zeal of this patriotism, then the country will certainly win new heights.
Dear countrymen, Shri T.
He wrote to me on the Karthik Narendra Modi App and made history of the athletes to participate in Paralimbics, and his performance was the success of humanity and Human Spirit.
Not only you two, but also all of us in the country have taken an emotional relationship with our sportspersons who participated in Paralimbics.
Perhaps Para Olympics and the achievements of our sports have changed the vision of humanity and the vision of divine.
I won't forget the words of our victorious sister Deepa Malik.
When the medal was won, the sister said, through this medal, I failed the disability itself.
This word has great power.
This time in Para Olympics, 19 Lats participated with three women from our country.
In comparison to other sports, more than physical ability and talent in sports of the Divyangjans is the will and determination.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won 4 medals with the greatest achievement till now - two gold, one silver, one brass and the second gold medal in Paul Volt.
He was losing his hands due to electrification.
You think a man won the gold medal at the age of twenty-thirds and then at the age of thirty-thirds, if he gets the second gold medal then he'd have a great thing.
Maryappan got gold medals at Tangavelu Haizamb.
Tankavelu lost his right hand only in the fifth year.
Poverty is not obstructed by his determination.
He is not a man who lives in a big city, but a middle class family.
Though a life full of sufferings, a medal for the nation through determination, even though physical problems.
If it's Lut Deepamalik, it's rocked up with a variety of winners.
Varun C.
He won a bronze medal in the Bhati Haijamb.
It is also important that in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, we are inspired to look at the disabled brothers and sisters.
We need to awaken our sympathy and change our vision of Divyangra, and very few people know that the greater performance of this year's Paralimbics has been shown.
A few days ago, there were Olympics competitions in the same place.
Anyone can think that even the Recade of the Common Olympics has broken the Divyangs.
This time it happened.
In the coming days, India is trying to create an ease of doing so for Para Olympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a very wonderful experience in Navsari, Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
I told the people who were there and people were surprised.
I had the opportunity to release a book that contained success stories in the lives of some Divyangs.
It was very exciting events.
I believe that the establishment of world records on the soil of Bharat Navasari is a very important thing.
Within eight hours, six hundred divyang people have received machines that cannot be heard.
It was found in the Guinness Book of World Recades.
It means that the country has stepped up 1005 crore towards cleanliness.
It was sure that the result was going on in the right direction and what was going on through a little effort.
Therefore, every common man, administrators, administrators, administrators, administrators, administrators, administrators, administrators, administrators, administrators, administrators, administrators, administrators, administrators, administrators, everybody plays their role in cleanliness.
Friends from the media also played a creative role.
In order to maintain health, mankind, especially the mothers and sisters, the summit of pledge should be finished in an open place.
Hence, the Open Defence Free (ODF) has started the reproduction of an open space.
A healthy competition is being held in villages in the districts and states.
States like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will soon succeed in eliminating the habit of cleanliness.
Come on, we'll move forward with determination.
In particular, in the recent past, I would like to present a scheme in front of the young friends who are using technology in large numbers.
Everyone has the right to know what is peaceful in your city about cleanliness and that is why Indians have given a number- 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we were celebrating the birth centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019, we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
You will be able to understand the situation of construction of toilets and also apply for construction of toilets.
You can get rid of it.
Not only this, we have launched a Swachhta App to know about the complaints related to cleanliness and the resolution of those complaints.
You're very beneficial, especially the new generation.
Indians have requested the Corporate World to move forward.
Sponsor young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts with Swachh Bharat Fellows.
In today's era, health is associated with sanitation and cleanliness is also essential for a model.
It must be a part of the waste to the wealth.
Therefore, we must turn to the West to Compost with the Cleanliness Mission.
Fertilizer has told companies that they should be prepared to buy composts from waste.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors and Commissioners from all over the country are going to make serious discussions about cleanliness and sanitation.
What can be done by technology
How can it create jobs
There will be discussions on all such issues.
I see that new news comes in terms of cleanliness.
I was told in the newspaper this day that the students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started awakening the construction of toilets.
A team of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh in Ganga, from Devprayag to Gangasagar, spread the message of Swachhta.
Every department in India has prepared a time table for a year.
I urge the people to join the affairs of these departments without rotating them in their respective locations.
Cleanliness service is going on now.
Earlier, 73 cities were surveyed and the Swachhta pattern was presented to the people.
Now there are 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh.
And this time we are behind this, there will be a confidence in every city that we will do something better next time.
The coming October 2 is the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Scientist.
It's been two years since the Swachh Bharat Mission begins.
This will showcase the lamp of Diwali in the house of the poor and this time it is October 2 and Sunday.
You cannot participate in the evacuation of wastes in a naked fountain that day for 2 hours and 4 hours.
In the memory of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadursani, we will determine to do something for the nation.
Joe of Giving Week is going to be celebrated in several cities from 2nd to 8th October.
The requirement is a process of conserving food items, clothing etc.
Today is the centenary year of the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.
He is the contribution of Sarvajan Sukhya, Antyodaya Siddhantha.
Mahatma Gandhi was also talking about the welfare of the last person.
How can the poor get the benefits of development
Let us concentrate on how the poor can achieve the achievement of development of the society, the devotee and the attention of all.
It is a symbolic form of the year of poverty welfare and I respectfully salute Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji, who was rich in our ideological heritage.
My dear countrymen, I started Mann Ki Baat on the occasion of Vijay Dashmi two years ago.
I have tried myself to don't be a programme to slaughter what Mann Ki Baat has done.
This Mann Ki Baat shouldn't be a programme of political patronages and misconducts.
How the common man in this country inspires me.
That is, Mann Ki Baat is not a dialogue 15-20 minutes ago, but a new opportunity for social change has been added.
Anyone else would be more happy than this.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with the people of India, on the eve of August 20, 2016, on the eve of 11.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the birthday of Hockey Mantrikan Dhyan Chand on 29th August.
He played an important role in winning the gold medal in Hockey for India in the Olympic Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
All we love cricket, Bradman's name.
He spoke of Dhyan Chand that the High Scores Gols Lights (achieving rounds as he drives).
Dhyan Chand ji was a vibrant example of sportsperit and patriotism.
Once during a game in Kolkata, an opponent hit the head of Dhyan Chand with hockeystick.
Then there was 10 minutes left to end the game.
Shri Dhyan Chand said that within the ten minutes, three rounds were made and answered with rounds.
My dear countrymen, whenever the time of Mann Ki Baat comes, there are several suggestions in MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
The diversity is full.
But this time everyone wants to say something about Rio Olympics.
I am very hopeful to see the common citizens so close and sorry to the Olympics that the Prime Minister of the country should say something about it.
In the case of cricketless games, the citizens of India have so much love and so much wisdom and knowledge.
Our daughters have once again proved that they are not behind anybody.
It seems that all the girls from all over India are taking a mission to take India forward.
In MyGov, Shikhar Takur wrote that we could have done better in Olympics.
He wrote, "Congratulations to us for the first time on winning two medals in Adarnya Modisar and Rio.
But I would like to invite you that our performance is good.
Our parents are still focusing on studies and academic issues.
The society still considers sports as a loss of time.
It's necessary to change this thinking.
The enthusiasm of the society should be increased.
No one can do this better than you.
We can't deny that we can't do a show like we hope.
In some species, our sportspersons have shown a good performance in India, but the best performance here has not been expected.
In the medal list, we have only two medals.
But if you don't get medals, you can see that in many species our boys showcased a good show.
You see, our innovation in shooting reached the fourth place, and he lost his medal in a very small difference.
This is what happened in Tennys about Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopan.
We performed well in the athletics.
During 32 years after the heat, for the first time, Sila Babar Track and Field were qualified.
It is a pleasure to know that the women's hockey team reached Olympics after 36 years.
In the last 36 years, the first man reached the hockey to the outstanding stage.
Our team is very strong.
Various sportspersons like Adity Ashok, Datu Bhokanal and Anu Das were good.
But dear countrymen, we have to do a lot of things.
But if it's done again, we'll be disappointed again.
We will prepare a framework for how we can be better.
The project should be prepared with a far-reaching vision of 2020, 2024, 2028.
Let us think that the state governments should create such committees, what we can do in the field of sports and what we can do for each of our states.
States must choose one or two of their own sorts of power.
I also urge the Sports Associations to discuss them indiscriminately.
I urge every citizen of India to give me the opinion of Narendra Modi App.
We're completely prepared.
Dear countrymen, September 5 is a Teachers Day.
I have spent a long time with the students on Teachers Day for years and spent time like a student.
I learned a lot from small children.
For me, September 5 was a Teacher's Day.
But this time I have to attend the G-20 Summit, so I decided to express my feelings in Mann Kiba itself.
Teachers have the status as much as the mother has in life.
I have seen teachers who are distressed over their own business.
They give life for their teachers, for their students.
Now, after the Rio Olympics, there is a discussion about Phulela Gopichand all around.
On the occasion of Teachers Day, I salute Phulela Gopichand, his dedication to his tapasya, his dedication to sports and his way to be happy with the success of his students.
We always feel the contribution of teachers in all our lives.
The former President of India, Dr.
This is the birth anniversary of Sarve Vallu Radhakrishnan ji and the nation celebrates this day as a Teachers Day.
I remember many stories of my teachers because our teachers in our small village were our heroes.
Even today, he seems to teach me in the classroom.
Even today, he is giving me a Crosspondents Course.
It will be amazed that if he looks at this thirteenth year of age, he writes such beautiful letters in this age.
My writing is very bad because someone sees a good letter, I feel very respectful.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival is coming near.
Ganesha changes the illusions... let us not divide the lives of our country, our society, our family and all of us.
The Jan Ganesh Festival is a world-class Tilak, through which he has made this religious festival an opportunity to awaken the country.
Even today, not only in Maharashtra but also in all the corners of India, Ganesh Festival has begun.
Every youngster is making a lot of preparations for this festival and will be very enthusiastic.
Some are still trying to pursue the feelings of the world-class.
Discussions on public issues, editions, festivals of flowers are held.
The subjects that touch the society are presented in a very artistic manner in its views.
In a way, a mass movement of public education is being carried out through Ganesh Festival.
Inspired that the worldman Tilakan Swaraj is our birth rights.
But we live in a free India.
It is true that the festival is the strength of the society.
Festival gives a new life to the lives of the person and the society.
Life is impossible without festivals, but it has to be shaped in time.
This time, some of them wrote specially to me about the Ganesh Festival and Durga Puja.
Don't use Ganesh ji made of soil in the pond of the village.
The statues made of the Plaster of Paris are not suitable to the environment.
He and others have suffered a lot.
I also urge you to build statues of Ganesh and Durgadevi and return to our ancient tradition.
Ganeshan is a gentleman.
Therefore, we shouldn't make the separation of Ganesha.
I don't know how much you can accept, but it's not just me, but some say.
Several such institutions are very driven to create and propagate the mud mathematics.
Environment friendly Ganesha Festival is also a social service.
There is no harm to the environment due to the reservoir of the lake if it is made up of the lake.
My best wishes to all of you, Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna will declare Mother Teresa on 4th September.
Mother Teresa used the entire life to serve the poor of India.
It is natural for every Indian to be proud that Mother Teresa has served the poor throughout his life as a sacred place.
The Government of India is also visiting an official delegation under the leadership of our Foreign Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj for 125 crore people in this festival on September 4.
We get to learn something from the saints, sages, sages and sages and great men.
We're getting something, we're learning and doing something good.
My dear countrymen, how many changes are happening when development becomes a mass movement.
Democracy is considered to be another form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made successful efforts to connect the people to clean Ganga with the collaboration of five State Governments.
A meeting of Village Heads on the banks of Ganga was held in Allahabad this month.
I convey my best wishes to the concerned Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India for bringing forward this idea.
I express my gratitude to the Chief Ministers and the five States for the great Kalvayep in the cleaning of Ganga by consolidating Jan Shakti.
My dear countrymen, sometimes touch my mind, sometimes I have a special respect in my mind to those who have created the ideas.
On July 15, more than one and a half lakh students from about 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh wrote a letter to their parents together.
Some wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi, some wrote in Chhattisgarh.
They told their fathers in the letter that toilets were in their homes.
So they asked, some people wrote that they didn't celebrate their birthday this year, but it was sure to make toilets.
This is what we inspire.
He was a 16-year-old girl in Kopal district of Karnataka, who saluted her family.
The family was not financially capable.
The child stayed steady.
The Chief of the village, Mohammad Shafi, was organised at a cost of Rs. 10,000 and made toilets within a week.
The strength of the girl Malma and the head of the village like Mohammad Shafi is also complimented.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is a dream of all Indians.
Some Indians are determined.
Some Indians have aimed at this.
This information will be available in the web site.
The award will be given to the winners on Gandhi Jayanti Day on 2nd October in the competition of these short films.
I would like to tell the TV channels that you should also urge and compete for making films like this.
Createivity and waste generation will be strengthened, new milestones will be found, new methods will be learned, new inspiration will be found.
All this will be through the participation of people and ordinary artists, whether it is a big studio or a big camera to make films.
Everyone may think that the President should inaugurate a radio channel.
But this is not a normal radio channel, it's a big step.
Our neighbourhood is Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal still live with the same cultural tradition.
Here, Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Baitar will share their programmes and enjoy the programmes of Akashwani on both sides.
Akashwani's contribution to creating personal relations is very big.
This was inaugurated by the President.
I thank Bangladesh for their cooperation in this regard.
I convey my best wishes to the Akashwani for their participation in foreign countries.
My dear countrymen, you've given me the job of Prime Minister but I'm a man like you.
Sometimes some emotional events touch my heart more.
Such emotional events provide new energy, inspire and inspire the people of India to do something.
I bow down to millions of mothers in India who have always been able to help others with their own sufferings.
My dear countrymen, we suffered due to sadness last year, but this month of August has been suffering from continuous rains.
In some parts of the country there was a flood again.
State governments, central governments, local independents, social institutions and citizens have tried to do everything.
However, some other news about the floods have also been heard and it has to be remembered.
The power of unity will be reminded of the month of August this year, how big a transformation can be made if we move together.
The parties, which hold strong political humility in August 2016, have passed the GST Act together with nearly 90 parties across the country and all the parties in the Parliament.
Its credit is for all parties.
This is an example of how big things can be achieved if all parties go together to one direction.
Similarly, all the political parties of the country together talked about the events in Kashmir and the situation there.
I believe in the strength of twenty five crore people.
This morning, I had the opportunity to spend with some young people from Delhi.
I believe that in the coming days, all the youth of the country will drown in the colors of the zeal of Olympics.
The whole world will finish in the games.
In the coming days, we must do something to encourage our sportspersons anywhere.
I will definitely send messages to the sportspersons on the Narendra Modi App site.
Come, let us all together try to increase the dignity and spirituality of all our fellows and appreciate their efforts.
Speaking to you about Rio Olympics, I will send a poem to me, a student from Punjab Central University, who is interested in poetry.
There will be many other poets like this, they will have written such poems, someone will write it now, some may have done musical recognition of poets.
I want to share with you the poem that Suraj has given me.
Mr. Angit Karke reminded me of the birth anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam.
Therefore, it should be inspired by Mr. Angina to ask what steps your government has taken to realise the dreams of Abdul Kalam.
The next century will be guided by technology.
If anybody try to capture it, it will appear in a new vessel somewhere far away and if you want to add technology to it, we must be able to move ahead.
Therefore, we can also take research and innovations into the primarily element of technology.
Innovation, test monitoring, entrepreneurship, etc. , there is an increase in employment availability.
If we are organising the second generation of innovation, then our children will join it.
That is why the Indian government has started the Atal Tinkering Abs.
10 lakhs and Rs. 10 lakhs will be provided to schools which are part of the programme.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre is directly connected with innovation.
We can create a systematic mechanism for innovation and experiments to make it necessary for self-sufficient incubation centres.
Construction of new incubation centres and innovation of ancients is essential.
We have to face many problems in our daily life.
When the disease comes, the mind wants to recover quickly, so some antibiotics are eating.
You might get rid of it for a while, but you must stop taking antibiotics without consulting the doctors.
We don't have antibiotics as long as the doctor doesn't write.
We don't travel through such a few ways.
Years will go ahead with this war, to create new medicines, to carry out scientific research.
Until then, these diseases will continue to create new problems.
Therefore, it is necessary that we always be aware of this.
Brother, take this antibiotic.
Take 15 pills, the doctor will tell you to eat it in five days.
The course should be completed by taking pills on the same day as the doctor suggests.
It will be beneficial for the bacteria by taking more medicines than required.
That's why how long do the doctor suggests how many pills, it's a big thing to follow the same thing.
In medical language it is called antibiotic resistance.
Therefore, it is necessary to pursue the laws to use antibiotics as well.
Our government is committed to protecting antibiotic resistance.
You might have seen a red skin in the area that has been given the information of antibiotic medicines sold today.
I urge you to take care of it.
I want to add another thing to the subject of health.
I am worried about the lives of pregnant women in our country.
It is not possible to say that when there is deficiency of blood during pregnancy and thereafter, delivery related infections and high blood pressure then what kind of problems are destroying their lives.
In this regard, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission in the last few months i. e.
Under this scheme, free examination is available to all pregnant women on the 9th of every month at Government Health Centres.
I urge the Gynaecologists to make this service free for the poor mothers on one day in a month i. e.
I am sure you'll be part of it.
My dear dear brothers, today the world is spreading about climate change, global heat and environment.
Community discussions are going on in the country and the world.
India has been focusing on it for centuries.
The Kurukshetra is discussing the trees of Lord Krishna on the battlefield.
It is also said by the Shukracharya that there is no vegetation without medicinal medicinal herbs.
The tree donor gives a tree to the world, like his children.
Therefore, the parents who want their own good will have to drive a good tree and protect them like children.
Whatever the Shukracharya Mountain of Geeta or Shukracharya or the Shushasana Mountain of Mahabharata, there are some who live themselves in these ideals in the present generation.
A few days ago, I took care of a daughter in Pune, Sonal.
It touched my mind.
The administrators of Mahabharata say that the tree is fulfilling the responsibility of the children all over the world, Sonal has taken a mission not only to his parents but also to fulfill the desires of the society.
Kisan Ghandu Mahatra, a village named Narayanpur in Kenjunar Taluk in Pune, Maharashtra, was inspired by his daughter Sonal's marriage.
I saw the picture in the social media.
I didn't see the people in the wedding, but the plants were just sighted.
This sight that touches the mind was in that picture.
Sonal is a leading graduate, and this idea is her own.
You will see how important the nature love has been expressed by offering maternal grandsons to those who have come to marriage.
In another way, Sonal's marriage has become an integral story of natural love and I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Shriman Mahatrije for this innovative effort.
This can be transformed into a natural reproduction of the tree.
The Maharashtra government has decided to plant about one and a half crore trees across the state on 1st July this year and 3 crore trees next year.
It isn't an extraordinary thing to plant 25 lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the soil of Rajasthan know how hard it is.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its greenery by 50 by 2029.
Gujarat has a bright tradition of the Forest Festival.
This year, several names like Gujarat Mao forest, Ekta Forest and Martyr forest have been tried to plant crores of trees by offering them to the forest festival.
But for me, the journey of South Africa was only a pilgrimage.
It is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Neelson Mandela while talking about South Africa.
It is the face of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela when we hear the words of non-violence, love and sorrow in the world.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to the Phoeni settlement and the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I was fortunate to travel from Peter Maritburg station on a train travelled by Mahatma Gandhi and that was the incident that made a seed to make Mohandas Mahatma Gandhi.
I would like to say that this time I have got the opportunity to meet many great personalities who have come here for equality and equal opportunity in our entire society.
They lived in jails for 20-22 years after fighting with Neelson Mandela with their shoulders.
I was fortunate to see the next friend of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ahmed Kathara, Mr. Lalu Chiba, Mr. George Besoz and Rani Casirils.
Even after such a great penance, the feelings of observation, jealousy and compassion could not be seen anywhere.
Responsibilities - that is, the symptoms of the duties mentioned in Geeta - that is, I have seen the form of a person.
Any society and government have no mantra of equality and equality.
Their thinking is very natural.
They told me about an incident and talking about a sculpture from Bangalore.
I read in an article that a woman, Froda, was distributed in a cheet meal and slapped 11 lakh rupees and then reported that she committed suicide.
As a woman, I feel sorry to her family.
I want to know what you think about such a cheet-frode meal.
I realized that he had everything in a few minutes.
You might have been misunderstanding.
They'll be so funny. They'll be funny.
But I had a very pleasant experience in this neighborhood.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
Girls and girls were very excited.
They came with a big album and enjoyed their faces.
Artificial paintings were done at the station.
Not only this, the plastic bottles and oil utensils found in the village areas have been collected and the Vertical Garden has been constructed by plants filled with soil.
And on one side of the railway station, this Vertical Garden has been built in plastic bottles and has given it a new idea.
My dear countrymen have also come to our country for the period of festivals over the years.
Think about, do you give a gift to the sister to protect her life and not only will there be women who cook food in our houses.
There will be a woman cleaning in our house and she will be the daughter of a poor mother.
This is the true meaning of Rakshabandhan.
Many of us are born in the post-independent age.
I am the first Prime Minister born in the post-independence period.
May the entire country be filled with the zeal of freedom fighters and once again the jealousy of freedom.
We can all create this environment.
And then the Independence Day celebrations must become a programme of the people of the country without a government programme.
Like Diwali, we have to celebrate our own.
I would like you to do some good things related to this by inspiring patriotism and inspiration in patriotism.
Its pictures must be sent to the Narendra Modi App.
Create an environment in the country.
You might have wanted that things in your mind should be presented from the Red Fort.
As a representative of your thoughts, as your chief servant, if I feel like to say these things from the Red Fort, I invite you.
I do not want to be the Prime Minister's words from the Red Fort.
And nowadays, the platform of technology is easier for you to bring things to me.
I am grateful to the Akashwani by presenting Mann Ki Baat in local languages at 8 o'clock in the evening.
Many of these suggestions are helping my government work.
Perhaps the news is about a week to start the rainy season, so we are also worried.
In most of the regions of the country, the heat of summer is feeling extremely hot.
Climate change increases such problems.
The area of forests is low and trees have been cut.
In a way, humans destroy nature and destroy themselves.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
Discussions are going on throughout the world about the environment.
In the past, the jungles of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu Kashmir and Himalayan valleys have become a firefight.
I got the opportunity to interact with the Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha in the last few days.
I listened carefully to say to every country.
Normally, there was no such micro-deliberal discussion about how much of the Central Government has been sanctioned and how much was spent in it.
It was a matter of imagination to the officials of the Government of India that water conservation, environment, dry erosion, animal conservation, animal conservation and dry-fluencing, in a way, has done excellent work for the entire country.
I asked NITI Aayog to adopt good models and take steps to implement it in other states.
Some states, especially Andhra, Gujarat etc. have been fully benefitted.
I would like to take the successful experiments of the states to other areas through NITI Aayog.
Democracy is a major infrastructure for success in such problems.
Perhaps, if there is a comprehensive plan then by using appropriate technologies, there can be a substantial change in terms of time.
Irrigation is also important.
Their aim is to include two to three lakh hectares of land more in micro-integration every year.
Chhattisgarh has been implemented by Lok Suraj Jal Suraj Abhiyan.
Nearly 22,000 ponds have been included in the Balram Talab Yojana of Madhya Pradesh, which is not a small number.
They were aimed at water conservation and projects for water conservation of 10 to 20 kms have been constructed in some states.
It's a good experience.
I would like to say that even one drop of rain water received from June, July, August and September should not be lost.
We have to think about what should be the place for water conservation.
God has provided water to our needs and nature has fulfilled our needs.
We will be careless when we see a lot of water and when the rains are over, we will not get water, how long it can happen.
In the last few days, the media was talking about the problems of water availability.
I believe that the media should provide guidance for water conservation and expand its activities, and the media will also participate in the ways to resolve water reservoirs.
I'm inviting them for that.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a New India.
Make a transparent India.
Our schemes should be made available in all corners of India without equivalent to the equivalent.
We have to make small changes in our old mindset.
But today the situation has completely changed.
The world looks at the vision of a cashless society.
Electronic technology is possible to send and handle money from all over the world.
Together, we can imagine as a moneyless community.
You might have seen that RPA CARD has been given with Jan Dhan account.
The Credit Debit Card will be used in the coming days.
There is no need for money from the pocket, or oil or oil.
This is the Bank on Mobile: Universal Payment Interface Banking Transction (PI) which will transform sustainable systems.
Money Transction Money Money through your mobile phone will be very easier.
Perhaps if this is possible easily, then RPA CARDs don't always have to walk together.
Moreover, post offices have also been active for banking services.
Unlawful transactions will end forever.
The effect of black money will be very less.
So, my countrymen, I want to start this.
If you start once, we can move very easily.
Today, we might have thought about somebody 10 years ago that such a mobile will be in our hands.
So, let's turn into a society of money.
It would be better if it could happen without a knee.
My dear countrymen, sometimes when the Olympics competition or when the game begins, we will be behind the gold medal.
If you get the silver.
In order to encourage our sportspersons who are going to participate in the Rio Olympics, each one must increase their spirituality and enthusiasm.
Over the past week, all of us were distressed about the results of the election, especially the results in Assam.
To encourage the sportspersons, to encourage our sportspersons, these things give great self-confidence and strength to each other.
With the Sportsman Spirit, India must drive its own seal in front of the world without putting everyone on the rock of the jewellery.
Resolutions of students who have been examined in Classes 10 and 12 have been working hard throughout the year.
I want to tell those who have not been able to achieve success, there is a lot to do in life.
A Mr. Ganesha in Madhya Pradesh.
Gaurav Patel, he presented a big problem before me.
33 percent of the market was not satisfied.
Everybody told me that my 90 percent of the 4 markets were lost.
I didn't know what I felt like a weight in my mind.
I read your letter carefully.
I think, perhaps, this pain is not yours.
Like you, there are millions and millions of students, because this is an environment that is conscious.
By finding satisfaction in all things, we can lead the society to the direction of satisfaction and peace.
Your relatives, helpers and friends are 89.
I have written Anand Giri Goswami from Jodhpur and he is almost this thing.
He says people in my neighborhood don't accept our results.
If it was better - I don't remember the whole poetry, but long ago I had written a poet that I was painful in the canvas of life.
Some say it was yellow instead of blue.
Some said it would have been better if they were there instead of putting this line here.
It's better if one or two of them had a tears on seeing the picture of my pain.
Everybody was talking about Tutchup.
Like you, millions of students are like this.
You are capable of fulfilling the needs of the people.
I want to tell you so much that you don't lose your balance in such a situation.
Everybody shows the needs.
But keep yourself steadfast and try to fulfil a little more beautiful.
But if we are not satisfied with the availability, then the new goal can never be fulfilled.
It is the strong foundation of victory that is based on great success.
The unconsciousness that has come out of success is not the thread of success.
It happens everywhere in life.
You might have heard about Santoor's artificial device.
There was a time when Santoor was connected to folk music in the valley of Kashmir.
But a man named Pandit Shiv Kumar took it and made it the world's greatest architect.
Shehnai- Our music is in a very limited place all over the world.
Most of the kings were found at the doors of the kings.
But when Ustad Bismilkhan took place in Shehana, it became a world-wide mechanic.
It is true that the cost of not becoming a patient is very low, but if the disease comes then the cost of health is very high.
If anyone can help the poor, it's just for cleanliness.
June 21 is the International Day of Yoga.
There is a distinction with Yoga all over the world and respect and belief is on it.
Yoga provides the power to lead a balanced life to the world suffering from stress.
Every person should spend 20-25 minutes in his lifestyle or 30 minutes for Yoga.
For this, we are inspiring on June 21, Yoga Day.
Sometimes a social look is the reason for bringing about changes in the life of a person.
I hope you're anywhere on June 21, you're gonna take it forward.
In your surrounding areas, in your towns, in villages, in your school, institutions, reiterate that in office too.
Start a month from now, and look, you will be participating in it on June 21.
I'm going to attend this event in Chandigarh.
My dear countrymen, I have been continuously associated with you through this programme Mann Ki Baat.
A long time ago, I gave you a mobile number, in which you could listen to Mann Ki Baat by calling Missid.
But it has made it more easier.
You need only four times now to listen to Mann Ki Baat.
If you call this number in 1922, you can hear Mann Ki Baat anywhere or any language.
My dear countrymen, once again I salute you all.
Don't forget about the water I said.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
Mann Ki Baat is a time whenever I and you are waiting.
This time too many letters, commands, phone calls have been received, many stories, suggestions, inspirations.
People have been discussing books on various subjects such as science, technology, new innovations, history, culture, business, biography etc.
People urged me to discuss many other texts.
But I have to say that I can't take time to read a lot of books.
We have not started a permanent book corner at the Narendra Modi App and we can write and discuss it whenever we read a new book.
You can suggest a name for this book corner.
I would like this book corners to become an active platform for readers and writers.
Several experts have been engaged in good efforts in terms of water conservation.
People share information about traditional methods.
For example, the zeal of rural water conservation in the village of Ara Karam in Ormanji Block at a little distance from Ranchi in Jharkhand has become an example for everyone.
The beautiful state of north-eastern India has become the Meghalaya itself a water reservoir.
I congratulate the government there.
A very little water is required in Haryana, but it is being emphasized that farmers are not losing the farmers.
I specially congratulate the Government of Haryana for inspiring farmers to discuss and remove them from traditional farming and cultivate some water.
It's time for festivals now.
Festivals are also held during the festivals.
These fairs should not be used for water conservation.
People from all sections of the society come to the fair.
The message of water conservation can be given very well in these fairs, be it exhibitions, street players, along with the festivals, we can reach the message of water conservation very efficiently.
Friends, some things in life are encouraging us.
It gives us a new energy, especially the achievements of the children and their works.
So I want to talk about some children.
They are Nidhi Baipa, Monish Joshi, Devamshi Raoth, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Prati Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aarnayesh Ganguli, Hrithik Alamada.
I'm talking about them and fill your minds with pride and enthusiasm.
We all know that the word 'Cancer' is all scared of the world.
After winning the game, he won the medal and won the champion.
But it was a unique opportunity that they were champions before participating in the competition.
That's the champions of life.
The World Children's Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
It means that they have succeeded in fighting with cancer in their lives and competitions such as shooting, chess, swimming, drive, football.
All these champions of our country have won medals in tournaments.
Some of these sportspersons won medals in more than one species.
Friends, You must have been proud of the success of India in the eternal momentum beyond the sky.
Chandrayaan-2.
Shri Rajnath Singh, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Corporate Affairs, Shri Rajnath Singh, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Corporate Affairs, Shri Rajnath Singh, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Corporate Affairs, Smt.
2019 is a good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists launched A SAT in March.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this achievement.
On July 22, the country was proud to reach the atmosphere from Chandrayaan 2 Sriharikota.
The launch pictures of Chandrayaan 2 have filled the people with pride, enthusiasm and happiness.
The Chandrayaan 2 mission is special in different ways.
You will be happy to note that Chandrayaan 2 is completely Indian.
But it must always be remembered that in ourselves it is capable of living.
I hope that Chandrayaan 2 will inspire the youth of the country to turn to the world of science and innovation.
In fact, science is opening the path of development.
We are awaiting the immortality of September, when landing Lander Vikram and Rover Pragnan on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to inform the students of the country about a very attractive competition to the youth.
The youngsters of the country want to invite youngsters to a quiz competition, the vision related to space, the science mission of India and the science technologies will be an important topic of problems.
I urge young friends and students to participate in this matter and make it attractive and enjoyable and unforgettable through your partnership.
I specially urge schools, parents and enthusiastic principals and teachers to make their school a success.
Encourage all the schools to participate in this.
This will be a historic event in their lives for the students who are successful.
But we have to participate in this issue, get the most marked, be successful.
Inspire more and more friends.
Friends, you'll be careful about one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baat Swachhta Abhiyan has increased the pace from time to time.
When they performed their skills from the walls of Over Bridges and Schools to the huts, people along with them became a big movement.
You must have seen how Prayag Raj was decorated with street paintings on the occasion of the Kumbh.
Yogesh Saini and his friends played a big role in this regard.
It is our great need to develop a culture that creates wealth from waste to wealth.
In a way, we have to move forward to bring gold from waste.
Friends, Last day, I read a very attractive word in MyGov.
Bhai Mohammad Aslamy, a resident of Shopian in Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote: It is very happy to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I have actively participated in organizing the Back to Village for Community Mobility programme in my State of Jammu and Kashmir.
The program was organized in June.
I believe that the programmes like this should be done every three months.
Also, there should be arrangements for online monitoring of the programme.
This programme shows how incredible the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development.
First of all, big officers came to the villages and without seeing the villagers, the officers were in their homes to understand the obstacles in the development related matters and to address the problems that were faced by them for a week.
How to increase the income of the people
He explained how the service of the officers is affecting the lives of the common man and the rural and their problems were open.
Discussions were made on various issues such as literacy, women ratio, health, waste free, water conservation, electricity, water, education of girls and problems of elderly citizens.
Friends, this programme was not a function of the government as the worker was roaming around the village throughout the day, but this time the authorities had eaten two days and one night in the Panchayat, so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
He added a number of things to make this program more attractive.
Under the leadership of Khelo India, he played a sports competition for children.
He also distributed sports kits, job cards of National Employment Programme, Pattika caste and Scheduled Tribes Certificates.
This kind of programme and participation of the people in it is that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir want to rule, from which it is understood that the power of progress is above the strength of the bomb and gun.
It is obvious that those who want to break hate on the path of development, want to obstruct them, they cannot achieve their inadequate goals.
My dear countrymen, the Gyanpith Award winner, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, spoke of the glory of the month of Shravan in his poetry.
He said that Hodige Madige Agyedu Aadraga land is Magna, the relationship between rain and waterfalls is different, the earth is immersed in its beauty.
People from different cultures and languages throughout the year celebrate the month of Shravan in their own ways.
In this weather, when we look at the environment, it feels like the earth is covered with greenery.
We can see a new energy all around.
On the other hand, some of them are regularly fasting and hopefully waiting for excitements like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami.
During this period, the Raksha Bandhan Festival was a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
This time, more than 4 years devotees participated in the Amarnath Yatra.
From 1st July till now, more than 3 lakh pilgrims visited the pious Amarnath cave.
More than the participants participated in the journey that took place for 60 days in 2015 this time only in 28 days.
I especially congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their teachings for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
People coming back from the journey are changing the spirit of the people of the state and their own thinking.
All these are very helpful in the future of pilgrimage.
On the other hand, there is heavy rainfall in parts of the country.
Friends, It is very difficult to decide where to start Mann Ki Baat and where to stop.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
There is no shortage of festivals in our country.
Sometimes it feels that India is a country of economic concentration through festivals.
Festivals are becoming an opportunity for economic inequality to the poor of the society.
You know that I'm using technologies well, and I get a lot of information.
Ganesh V.
Savelesh Warker wrote to me that this season is a tourist season.
Many of the national and foreign tourists are coming to tourism.
People celebrate Christmas holidays.
Sometimes they are listening to disappointments from different corners of the country.
It is the strength of the country that millions of people do something in their own way, like the folk.
New opportunities are being created everyday for education and employment.
When the world is attracted by Yoga and celebrated International Yoga Day, we have believed and were proud of the strength of India.
We understand this vision of India's widespreadness.
The word 'Cleanliness' is being heard in the houses today.
The participation of the people is increasing.
That's a service route.
I have also made small efforts on my way.
I can't do everything alone.
My dear youngsters have started a first discussion on Start-up India and Stand-up India in Red Fort on August 15 last year.
This was followed by discussions in government departments.
Can India become a start-up capital
New Start-ups and new innovations, whether in the field of manufacturing, whether in services or in the field of agriculture, were discussed in order to provide a big opportunity to the youth among the states.
It's wrong if you think so.
Young people from any corner of India have to give them an opportunity to talent.
Start-up India and Stand-up India should not be in some cities.
It should be spread to every corner of India.
I urge the State Governments to expand this.
On January 16, I will discuss this with you.
I will welcome your suggestions.
My dear youth, January 12 is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Millions of people like me who are inspired by Swami Vivekanandan are here.
From 1995, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti is being celebrated as National Youth Festival on 12th January.
This year is celebrated from 12th to 16th January in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
A small India is going to be built there - a young India.
In a way, the dreams can be seen.
The power of decisions can be seen.
Can your suggestions share with me about this youth festival
I think this is the result of your initiatives.
Thank you a thousand.
Are you a person working in this field
That's why you can understand it, and you have to face a lot of problems
Sometimes the handicapped, sometimes the vulnerable, sometimes the vulnerable are so many words.
It's really important in every word.
This year, the Government of India started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
I hope you take this.
We started a Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan
This will bring them to ease by developing all kinds of infrastructure.
Whether it is a school or a hospital or a government office or a bus station or a railway station or a parking, a lift or a braille lippy, it is necessary to make them easier.
Technologies are required, system is required, sensitivity is required.
Its efforts have begun and people's participation is being achieved.
People love it.
Before that, the files shouldn't be executed.
In fact, all the schemes are for the common man and the forces.
In the past, the Government of India has been investigating how to benefit the right rights of the schemes.
Our country provides subsidy to gas cylinders.
It wasn't tested whether it's properly taking accounts or not.
Therefore, the government has made some changes.
The Mission is to provide subsidies to the beneficiaries directly through the worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme through Jandhan Account by integrating Aadhaar Cards.
I am very happy to note that the worlds largest director, Benefit Transfer Skim, has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
On the one hand, it continues to create a list of beneficiaries and connect them to the bank accounts through Aadhaar, opening of Jandhan Account on the other, and combining the Central State Governments.
At some places, the money is directly deposited in the workers' accounts.
There were complaints about students' scholarships and efforts have been made to solve them.
About 40 crore rupees have been directly accessed to beneficiaries accounts through various schemes.
Approximately 50 to 40 projects have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
My dear Indians, January 26 is the golden moment of the Republic of India.
The Parliament was replaced for a specific discussion on the Constitution for two days.
It was a good experience.
We are most aware of the obligations of the obligations, it is time for us to vote, through publications and wall writings.
Why don't we advise the obligations in our daily life as the election is time
On the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the country will not be able to hold discussions in schools, colleges, villages, towns and organisations on 26th January
If 125 crore people take one step after another and fulfill their duties then it will be an unprecedented history.
We'll start the discussions.
You've got the opportunity to go anywhere.
Festivals have their own importance in social life.
The news of natural calamities continues to come from every corner of the world.
We have never thought or imagined about these disasters.
We are now experienced that the impact of climate change is increasing at a rapid pace.
The central government and the shoulders are working with them.
However, there is a need for changes in the environment when such problems are seen.
That's a good start.
Today, I received a phone message from Jalandhar in Punjab, Lakhvinder Singh said, "I am talking from Jalandhar district of Punjab.
I am very happy to hear the question of Lakhvinder Singh.
The main reason for my happiness is that you are doing organic farming.
Not only that, along with organic farming, you understand the problems of the farmers.
But it is not right to think that this is happening only in Punjab and Haryana.
We are the nature of all Indians and we are following the traditional way of burning the ruins of crops.
One thing we didn't know about such losses.
Everyone does it, we do it.
Secondly, it wasn't even trained how to do it.
But your fear is right.
But these aren't real.
The ruins of the crops are worthless.
Secondly, the surface of the earth is driven by burning fire.
We can't live even if the heart is strong.
Likewise, if the ruins of the crop are burnt, it is not only the ruins of the earth but also the skin of the mother.
Animal food can also be used and it also saves our land.
Not only that, look at the twist from that land, it gives double profit.
Once I have got the opportunity to talk to the farmers who are cultivating cows.
They shared a good experience of them.
They had already cultivated potatoes and had to spend one thousand, ten thousand and ten thousand hectares to change the ruins of potato after harvesting.
The ruins of the sword will remain as long as those who don't change them bring the tracker.
However, some farmers have buried these ruins of mustard on earth by 6-8 inches.
Last time I talked about organ donations in Mann Ki Bati.
He also told the organ donation about the helpline of 'Chutch'.
Filmmaker Ravina Tandon and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.
You can save many lives worthy of organ donation.
In a way, organ donation provides immortality.
When an organ changes from one body to another, that organ gets a new life, that life gets a new life.
What else is greater than this
A National Registration of Organ Transplantation was launched on 27th November for patients waiting for replacement of organs.
I am sure that there will be widespread awakening in every field and in the true sense the needy will get the best support.
Everybody has to move forward for this.
As I suggested earlier, December 3 is on the occasion of International Diversity Day.
Physically and psychologically distinguished are the owners of unparalleled will and courage.
I'm sorry when they're harassed.
We start crying when there is little trouble.
When we think how they live, our pain seems to be slight.
How do they live
Their determination, their way of life, their zeal to make the problems efficient is commendable.
Today I want to talk about Javed Ahmed.
He's 40, 42 years old.
The terrorists shot him in Kashmir in 1996.
Even though he was hit by the guns of the terrorists, he marvellously escaped.
But one of his kidneys was destroyed and one part of the intestine was lost.
The spinal cord has been severely damaged.
I lost the ability to stand in my feet, but he didn't fail.
The wound of terrorism didn't lose him.
How to improve the relevant equipment for physically diversified persons, in public places and government offices.
What is Javed's life, isn't it possible to inspire every corner of India
I remember Javed Ahmed's life, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
Because of lack of time, I am just talking about Javed, but in every corner of India, the lamps of such motivations are echoing.
Our country is very big.
There are many things that depend on the government.
More than one experience changes our vision of government systems throughout life.
They are doing a lot of social work in India.
Millions of people may have been working around this way.
What else is the pleasure if you see the patients with lovers
Are they participating in the sad griefs of the society
I congratulate all the talented Indians in the name of 'Jamunami'.
Besides making 'E' books more discussions, some of the youth should tell the students of eight or nine or ten classes of nearby schools, what is happening here and what is happening there.
Not only this, you are actually becoming a good teacher of a society.
I warmly welcome you and others to nation building.
My dear countrymen, today the world is afraid of climate change.
My friend, who led me to sharing this unique experience, had sent me an ink to know and see it.
But if they talk about what they did, some others of such education wouldn't think about it.
They are engaged in the work of bringing light to the poor in their area by using solar energy.
They fought against the darkness and made their name foolish.
They built a plant of solar lighting through a collaboration of women.
Every month, they're paying only 100 rupees for the locals.
We know what the world's largest people are doing about climate change.
Thank you very much for Ee News.
But the beginning is very good.
Within a short span of time, 66 lakh people have been provided Rs. 40,000 crore (Rs. 42,000 crore).
It will benefit those who are employed in the labour sector, be it journalists, be it milkmakers and those who are employed in any job.
Abhishek shared his happiness.
There's a lot of things in front of me.
Another is Shailesh Bhosla from Mumbai.
8. 5 lakh (8.
I used to say that during our Swachh Bharat programme, it is a new entrepreneurship that will come forward.
But Shailesh Bhosle has succeeded in bringing this to work.
But nobody knows about this project.
How should the structure of the program be
How do you want Logo
But I'm expecting more suggestions.
A lot of basic projects are required.
They will also receive the Honble Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for active participants.
Not only this, many other gifts have been announced.
My dear brothers, the month of winter has begun.
Make a good environment in the family and make a festival together and join the exercise.
You can recognise through the Exercise Festival of Chaitanya.
The whole day will be more prosperous.
If it's a good weather, it's a good habit.
My dear friends, once again I wish you good.
Jai Hind.
I had the privilege of presenting Mann Ki Baat for the first time on October 3 last year.
One year through Mann Ki Ba.
Our ancestors used to say, 'Janat Janardhan' is the voice of the people.
My experiences in the Mann Ki Baat programme can be said that our ancestors have a great strength and truth in this thinking because I have received it.
Several issues started to reach the government from the bottom.
And, it is true that the information should come down from the top to the top of the directions is the basic element of governance.
Did anyone ever think that Mann Ki Baat would be a source of knowledge
But it happened.
We have made an opportunity to show the strength of the Mann Ki Baat community.
I was surprised all over the world by saying that I was selfie with Daughter.
It was a quiet revolution.
People from every corner of India have sent lakhs of pictures.
Perhaps the tourism departments of the Government of India and the State Government have not even thought that we have such a heritage.
Mann Ki Baat has become a platform and people have taken up work without spending one rupee for the government.
I am glad to note about Gandhiji in my first Mann Ki Baat programme in October last year.
On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I urged the people to celebrate the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2 and encourage the entire nation to produce Khadi.
There was a time for the nation to say Khadi.
Do you want to make it a fashion now according to the changes of time
I wanted people to buy Khadi, to do something.
I am happy to say that Khadi sales have almost doubled.
This wasn't done by government publicity.
This is not the achievement of millions and crores spent.
It's a manifestation of people's power, a success.
Once I said in Mann Ki Bathy, the poor smokes rotten in his house, the children cry.
Don't they have to get LPG cylinders
Today, I can say very happy that 30 lakh families of our country have left the subsidy of LPG.
I have seen that a Retired School Teacher in the Channel is standing in ui to call for a widow's subsidiary.
The middlemen and the lower layers are difficult to leave the subsidy.
But such people have left the subsidy.
Isn't it a quiet revolution
We can't see people's power in this.
The lessons should be included in the Governments framework that there is a large population-powered, energetic and determined society outside this framework.
What else do you want to be happy
I thought of a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat this time.
There is no place where people don't call phone calls.
It's a pleasant experience.
Every age has sent a message.
I wanted to hear some messages myself and I liked it.
My team is taking action in terms of the rest.
All the departments of the government will definitely consider your suggestions.
But I am surprised and enjoyed one thing.
Sometimes it feels that we're just negative.
But I've lost my experience.
These fifty thousand people told them their way.
We can understand how creative the common man of the country thinks and how big it is for the country
Perhaps, only one or two phone calls can be seen from the backdrop of serious complaints.
More than 90 per cent of the energy generating was a pleasure.
They must have heard the radio.
I sent a message from Alwar in Rajasthan.
My message to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi is that please urge the people of India to use the best monasteries for Diwali through this Mann Ki Baat programme.
This will be beneficial for the environment and create an opportunity to provide employment to thousands of soil-building brothers.
I believe that this feeling of you like Pavan Acharya will reach and spread across the corners of India.
I say to the people of the country that if we are implementing the words of Pavan Acharya in the coming festivals then the lamp will be evident in their homes, but the light will be spread in the houses of the poor.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I have got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army
With our armed forces protecting the ocean-course aircraft.
In 1965, the war with Pakistan completed 50 years.
An exhibition of 'Shauryaanjali' was organised at India Gate in Delhi.
What wasn't there
If you want to create history, it is necessary to know and understand the micro levels of history.
History connects us with our roots.
If the relationship with history is lost then the prospects of history are fulfilled.
Don't show up like me.
I'm back in two and a half hours.
That kid is right.
And I can hear the sorrows that have happened.
I don't think it's a bad thing and I don't think that even in the good Parliament I have seen it, discussions about India's sanitation are going on.
On the other hand, the Parliament on the other hand, on the other hand, a child and both of them talk about cleanliness, and one of the greatest fortunes is one country on the other
This revolution of ideas is creating an atmosphere of hatred towards cleanliness and awareness about cleanliness.
This will force the governments to work.
We have to move ahead with crimes and deficiencies, and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we have to take this job for the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi has said
If there is a need to select cleanliness and freedom, then I will first choose cleanliness, then freedom will be done.
Gandhiji had given the importance of cleanliness more than independence.
Gulshan Arora Mygov from Delhi.
I want to know about the birth centenary of Deen Dayal ji.
My dear brothers, the life of the great men always inspires us.
Our work is not to assess what great men were followers of thinking.
Every person who lives and dies for the country is inspired by us.
During these days, there are opportunities to remember many great men.
On 25th September, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October, Jaiprakash Narayan on 11th October, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
On October 2, I take forward a special admiration.
If you use it, you can give equal importance to handloom along with Khadi.
The gentle brothers are studying a lot.
The poor widow of Khadi will reach home.
That is why this Diwali will definitely be digged and placed in each of you and everybody's houses.
Look, last time the sale has almost doubled.
My dear countrymen, I am glad about one thing.
I share it with you.
When I went to Kolkata in May, the family of Subhash Chandra Bose came to see me.
Everything was his daughter-in-law.
I got the opportunity to spend with the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose for a long time.
"My name is Bhargavi Katra.
I want to make the younger generation aware of the Voters Registration, so that in the coming days, the participation of the younger generation will increase and in future the participation of the youth will increase in the elections and governance of the government.
Thank you, Bharagavi said that the name of the Voters List is a matter of voting.
I would like to especially congratulate the Election Commission of India for this thing.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Electoral Commission was working only as a regulator, but there has been a major change in the last few years.
It's a very good change, but it's nothing to do with the Election Commission.
Generally, I want to say that the first day of the election was to vote and water waste.
One, a seven-year-old, is studying at the 7th class in the Central School of Shitij Pandey, Banaras Hindu University.
I want to increase the scientific importance and interest in children of our country.
9 years old.
When she asked her father, she said that it's been saying since the age of 5.
I asked, where did you learn from
Then I thought to share with you.
We're doing a lot of things you see in TV and you don't know through newspapers.
What's the problem to do once a month
Friends from the sky, I have to wait for half an hour.
It's better for a month to launch.
Initiated from Germany, the citizens of Hindustan were addressing the freedom struggle through radio.
The beginning of the Azad Hind Radio was through the Response Information Built.
He was speaking in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urudu.
I have also completed a year by presenting Mann Ki Baat through Akashvani.
Next month we'll meet Mann Ki Bati.
May your suggestions continue to come.
The government is benefiting from your suggestions.
It starts a good change.
Your partnership is valuable, precious.
Once again I convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Malayalam Speech of the Sky Broadcasting with the people of India on 30th August, 2015 at 11.
I have got an opportunity to present things in the mind before you.
Far from far away, the South Indians celebrate Onam and on this occasion, I have celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan throughout our country.
The Government of India has undertaken new schemes for social security to the common man.
All the dignitaries have adopted these schemes in a short span of time.
I urged our sisters to implement security schemes at the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
I see this as a good sign.
On the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, all the mothers and sisters are felicitated.
Today, a year before I talked to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was provided to a large number of people.
The main road to the economy is the banking sector, which has been set up by the banking mission to reach the poor at the rate of Rs.
Today, more than one and a half lakh bank friends are working across the country.
This has provided employment to the youth.
You will surely be happy to hear that over a year, you have made one lakh and three thousand financial awareness camps to connect the banking sector with the financial system and the poor.
This is what I have done before you and it is your job to continue this relationship.
All our accounts must be efficient.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
Their voices, their communications, i.e. the generosity and harmony of the Sufi tradition, have the blossoms of music.
I am glad that they invited me to Bodhgaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodhgaya.
There will be an opportunity to go to Bodhgaya along with these scholars all over the world.
My dear peasant brothers and sisters, I want to talk about my mind again.
We have already talked about these issues.
You might have heard me in Parliament, you might have heard me in the public meetings. You might have heard Mann Ki Baat.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you don't have to be afraid.
I can't give anybody this time.
We were in the middle of an ordinance.
Tomorrow, the term of the Ordinance will be completed on 31st August.
I've decided that if the term is over.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan, I want to teach you this is not just a magic but also a mantra of ours.
I'm gonna tell you another thing.
Two days ago, 50 years of the 1965 war was completed.
Whenever I remember this war in 1965, it is a regular reminder of Lal Bahadur Scientist.
He will also remember his illustration of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
At the same time, it is absolutely natural to remember all the martyrs of India's triangular flag, its significance and sacrifice.
I salute all those associated with the 65th war victory.
We are also brave warriors.
Such magnificences of history are inspiring us.
As I had the opportunity to interact with the people of the Sufi tradition last week, I had the opportunity to interact with the leading scientists of the country for hours and listen to their suggestions.
I am glad that India is exhibiting excellent work in different fields of science and science.
In fact, our scientists are doing great things.
How to bring such research to the common man
How should you use these principles on a practical basis
I have told the last Mann Ki Baat about leading our students to the field of science.
I felt that there were many opportunities and possibilities after this discussion.
I want to say something special to my dear young friends.
In recent times, there have been a number of guests from all over the world in India.
Why don't we connect our festivals with sanitation
The beginning of the rain was good this year.
In our country, there is a lot of food grains, oilseeds and vegetables.
Food grains are required for the poor and oil is also required to cook vegetables.
However, this year, the crops are enjoying immense joy, and this year, about 50 of the food grains have increased by 33 of the oil seeds.
I specially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this reason.
My dear brothers, July 26 has been marked as a successful day in the history of our country.
The more the farmers of the country have relations with the land is the same as the relationship between the soldiers and the nation.
In the war in Kargil, each of our soldiers have killed hundreds of enemies.
As a result of all their collective sacrifices, India is able to speak to the world today.
I salute our brave soldiers today for the successful day of Kargil.
Smt. Suchitra Raghavachari, Chennai has sent several suggestions.
I believe all of you will send good instructions.
I want to make my vision clear in one thing.
While I don't want to give any suggestions to anyone, the state governments, the central governments, the local autonomous organisations don't find ways to get rid of their jurisdictions.
Two days ago, I noticed the vision of a vehicle accident that took place in Delhi and after 10 minutes of the accident, the scooters were stuck on the road.
He didn't get any help.
Likewise, many people write to me on the topics that you talk about road safety issues and make the common man aware.
May the Hoskot Niwas Akshay of Bangalore be the Prasannaka Kunje of Mudubidri in Karnataka - people are very much, I don't remember the names of all.
Every accident is happening every day in our country every minute.
One death occurs every four minutes in road accidents.
The most worrisome thing is that about one-third of the deaths are youngsters between 15 and 25 and every death holds the entire family.
This thing is reminded of me that a small group of government officials in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh have touched my heart with their work.
'Brother No. 1' is an excellent brother to give his brother a toilet on the day of Raksha Bandhan.
Encouraging all such brothers and sisters to build toilets so that all the districts and mothers and sisters do not have to urinate toilets in an open place.
Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh is a small village of workers.
The people of that village have started and completed the mission to build toilets for the past few months.
Now no one in that village has to urinate the open space.
I write Bhavesh Dheka from Guwahati about the problems of the North-Eastern states and T.
Thus, it was decided that a team of Central Government officials will conduct a seven-day camp in the states like Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim to go to North-Eastern states.
The results of this endeavour will be achieved in the coming days.
It's very exciting to lose the importance of science.
In a way, science and technology are the inspirations of development.
Our IAS officers have learned a lot of things and they should always be in touch with children in schools or colleges around two or four hours a week and their experiences are their strength.
We have started it and in the coming years our villages will get 24 hours of electricity.
Children of the village do not have any problem when they are studying in the days of examination.
If we want to start small and big industries in villages then we need electricity.
Today, if they want to charging a mobile, they should go to the next village.
The facilities available in the cities should be available to the villages.
This is why Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti programme was started.
I would like to talk about every Indian in today's Mann Ki Bati.
In the same way, the months of August and September are the time of celebrations.
We have a lot of festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
Sitting in the midst of the beneficiaries, there were many things of 130 crore people in a peaceful environment, he said so many things and heard.
Sometimes it becomes a motivation for those who want their jobs.
I just used my words, but I didn't think it wasn't me, it was you.
I felt a humor.
Anyway, it's the last chance.
In a household look, Mann Ki Baat, small and child things.
May this programme continue to communicate with the energy of a New India by giving birth to a new energy in the society and life.
A lot of messages came in the past months, and people said, "There is nothing to do with Mann Ki Baat".
Sometimes I feel that this is my journey from 'Swa' to 'Samashti'.
This is a journey from 'Nami'.
My interaction with you for me was a part of my spiritual journey in a way.
Many people asked questions about why I went to Kedarnath during the midst of elections.
It was an opportunity to meet me for me.
I went to see me in a way.
Sometimes, when my thoughts are inspired by the process, it is sometimes foolish.
When people face the challenges faced by the nation and the society, they also suggest solutions.
In the letters, people describe the problems, and say peace, some suggestions, some imagination, direct or indirect expressions.
That is, in a way, I can realise in your words a sign of how peace can be achieved with the society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a glass for the country and the society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of spirit, strength or access in the people.
We have to unite that power and access, give them an opportunity and implement them.
The Prime Minister said that 130 crore people want to actively join hands in the progress of the country.
You can imagine how much I feel happy and how much I get energy when I visualize these things.
This belief was the foundation of your faith.
With this feeling, we can continue Mann Ki Baat.
So it was not for the country but for the self-reliance of that election, it was an election for the protection of democracy.
Perhaps in any country of the world, the people of the world have not voted for democracy, but only for democracy, without taking into account their remaining rights, powers and needs.
The country saw such a election in 1977.
More than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India and we feel that this number is normal.
But if it looks at the world's population, it is seen that more than one country except China has voted in India.
The number of people voted in 2019 is more than the total population in the US and is almost double.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population in Europe.
It reveals the widespreadness and diversity of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election was the largest democratic election in the world.
You can imagine how much resources and human power have been required for such elections.
This election has been conducted by lakhs of teachers, officers and other officers.
Nearly 3 lakh members of the Armed Forces have been responsible for the successful conduct of this great mission of democracy, and 20 lakh police personnel from different states have committed their responsibility and worked hard.
As a result of their hard work, more people were forced to vote this time than before.
Nearly 10 lakh polling stations across the country, more than 40 lakh electronic voting machines and more than 17 lakh VVP machines were required to vote.
You can think of how much preparation.
Any voter can't use his vote, and that's what he did.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only a female voter has been set up for polling stations.
You will be surprised to hear that the electorate had to travel for two days to reach there.
This is the right respect for democracy.
India is also the highest polling station in the world.
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet at Lahole Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
In this election, the percentage of votes of women and men was almost equal.
Another exciting fact is that this time there are 78 women members in Parliament to reduce history.
I appreciate the Election Commission and every one associated with the turnout programme and salute the vigilant voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard me often saying, "Boke no book".
I said, "Use a book instead of flowers" to welcome people.
Since then, people have started giving books everywhere.
His stories include all the psychological ethos of India.
When he was reading the story of 'Nasha' (Lahari), my mind turned to the economic imbalance that is spread in the society.
I remembered the days of my youth.
How the discussions took place overnight on this subject came to mind.
If you don't care if the son of Jamindar is able to learn from this story of Jesus and Bir of the poor family then it doesn't understand when it gets hit by the effect of bad companions.
A compassionate child's love for his grandchildren, and his emotional emotions at a young age.
We can see that when we come to the forefront of the forefront of Hamid Festival of the age of 4-5, when we buy from the forefront of the forefront of the forefront of the forefront of the forefront of the forefront of the forefront.
After the loss of crops, the farmer is happy that he will not have to sleep in the field anymore in the cold.
These stories are about a hundred years ago, but we still feel the same.
K.
Mr. Murlidhar and P.
Today, this library has shown a way to everyone, including tribal children.
The gathering in Gujarat was a successful experiment in the name of Vanche Gujarat.
Millions of people from all ages participated in this initiative to read books.
In today's digital world, it is a little time to ask me and you in the times of Google Guru to give me some books among your daily things.
You will have a good experience and you must write about the book 'Narendramodi App' and let all the beneficiaries of Mann Ki Bati know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to note that the people of our country are thinking about challenges not only today but also in the future.
I was reading your suggestions in the Narendra Modi App and MyGov... and I saw a lot of people writing about the water problem.
Besides the powerful Gaurai of Balgavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, many others have written to me about water related challenges.
Water has great significance in our culture.
You bless yourself, and grace on us.
The deficiency of water affects parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water available throughout the year is conserved.
Just 8 percent.
It's time to find peace for this problem.
With the participation of people like other problems, we will find peace in this problem with the capabilities, collaboration and determination of one crore 30 million people with the strength of the people.
The Ministry of Jal Shakti has been formulated in the country with the highest importance of water.
This will enable all issues related to water to be resolved.
A few days ago, I decided to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the villagers all over the country.
I wrote that the meeting of the people of the village was called to wait for water, to save water, to save water and not lose every rain and to think with the villagers.
I am very happy to note that they have done it on the 22nd of this month and have laboured millions of people in thousands of panchayats.
The people of the villages resolved to share every water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat program, I would like to tell you the story of a Sarpanch.
Listen to what the village chief of Lupung Panchayat has given us all the messages in the Kadakmasandhi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand: "My name is Prince Kumar Ravidas, when the Prime Minister wrote a letter to us for water conservation, we did not believe that the Prime Minister had written such a letter to us.
The people there are ready to play their active role in water conservation once again.
I convey my best wishes to all rural leaders and all rural leaders for their enthusiasm.
The people of the village are now competing to build a temple for water in their villages.
As I said, we can make a big difference of benefits through social efforts.
In order to deal with the problem of water, no microbialism can be adopted throughout the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different ways in different parts.
But everyone's goal is the same - it is water conservation and water conservation.
Drinage lines are improving in Punjab.
This endeavour can help prevent the problem of water.
The lives of rural people have changed through tank construction in Thimai Thiruvananthapuram in Telangana.
Small ponds built in the agricultural land in Kabirdham in Rajasthan have been made a big change.
I read about a social initiative in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women gathered to revive the river Nag.
They also read about the women of Gwaal, who have worked well for rain water conservation.
I am sure that if we make strong efforts together, we can achieve the impossible.
People will wait for water when they are together.
I say that the water is touching, the touch of that touching water will create a new life.
One water conservation can be organised to protect every drop of water.
We can also talk about water related problems, as well as water conservation systems.
I exhort the distinguished personalities, especially in different areas, to conduct a separate campaign for water conservation.
Everyone in the field of films, sports, media or friends, people associated with social organisations, people associated with cultural organisations, singing stories and singing tales must lead this publication in their own way.
We can awaken society, unite society and join society.
Look, we can see changes in our eyes.
I urge all of you to share knowledge about the traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to Porbandar, the birthplace of the priest father, then there should be another house behind the father's house, where there is a 200-year-old pool of water, which still has white water.
There is an arrangement for stopping rain water.
I always say that all those who go to Kirti Mandir must see that water storage.
Several types of water reservoirs are available at different places.
And all of you should be given information about sharing you with an Shakti4al Shakti Hash tag.
Friends, I express my gratitude to you in a matter of fact and thank the people of the world.
Everyone, as the sun rises in every corner of the world, if the lovers of Yoga welcome the sun, then it is a journey till the sun sets.
The nations, Prime Ministers, the well-known people and the common man showed how they celebrated Yoga in their country.
That day the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that there is a need for healthy and sensitive persons to build a healthy society and that is what Yoga ensures.
Therefore, promoting yoga is an important thing related to social service.
Isn't that the service to be accepted and respected
It was a matter of great pleasure for me to announce the Prime Ministers Award for those who have played an important role in promoting and promoting Yoga in 2019.
You will not be able to imagine how important role they have played in promoting Yoga.
There are several institutes and training courses in Japan Yoga Niketan.
Miss in Italy.
We have very inspiring examples.
Is it a matter related to Yoga, can the Indians stand behind
The Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya in Munger was also honoured and they have been working with dedication to Yoga for the last decade.
Likewise, Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honoured and established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Yes, yes.
I'll wait for your instructions.
It's a great journey for me to join your thoughts.
Come on, let's be together, let's share thoughts.
I'm listening to your mind, keep it careful, understand it.
Sometimes we can try to live with your emotions.
You must have your blessings.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Come together and share the joy of Mann Ki Bati and take the responsibility of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
(Manas says: 53rd Language) Namaskar, dear countrymen.
These brave brave brave soldiers sacrificed their lives for the Indians.
Our brave sons waited for the night to sleep peacefully.
At the same time, the attackers answered their own language.
You must have seen how actions have been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The army is determined to root out terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of brave soldiers, the spirit of their families was seen through mediums, which enhances the enthusiasm of the entire country.
The emotions expressed by the father of Dirjawan Ratan Thakur, Bhagalpur in Bihar are inspiring for all of us.
The nation salutes the brave courage of the martyrdom of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
I promised to join the CRPF with the only one of my own sons.
This is the feeling that we see every house of our brave and brave martyrs.
I want to tell the youngsters that the feelings that these families show, their minds should know, try to understand.
This is an inspiration to the future of a bright India.
Friends, We are all waiting for the war memorial in this long period after independence.
It is natural for people to have joy and excitement in this regard.
Shri Omkar Shetty is happy to complete the National War Memorial in Karnataka at the Narendra Modi App.
I was surprising that a National War Memorial was not so long in India.
A war memorial was required to facilitate the bravery of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to have such a memorial.
I am happy to note that it decides to build a National War Memorial and complete it in such a short time.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, we will deliver this national military memorial to our forces.
The country will make a small effort to repay the debt.
This new memorial is built near the heart of Delhi, i.e. Bharat Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I am sure that our people are going to this national military memorial would be equivalent to visit a pilgrimage.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the nation for the great martyrs after independence.
The design of the memorial shows the immense courage of our immortal soldiers.
The National Military Memorial has been designed in three categories in which the journey from the birth of every soldier to the martyrdom of every soldier has been painted.
The jewellery of the Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the martyr.
The second chakra shows the courage and courage of the soldiers.
This cycle shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
The names of the most important martyrs for the country are recorded in golden letters.
Thereafter, the Raksha Chakra, showcasing security.
In this tree, there are dense trees.
In October last year, I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of the thinking that the country should be gratitude to the men and women police who are inevitable for our security.
I am sure you will come to see the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you come, the pictures taken from there must be shared in the social media, it should be inspired to others, this sacred place, they are eager to see these memorials.
Friends, My dear countrymen, I have received thousands of letters and suggestions for Mann Ki Ba.
On March 3, Janshedji Tata's birthday.
Both individuals from the family background, which have enriched the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
To pay homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata through Mann Ki Baat, in a way, it is like a glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great magnificences have not only increased Jharkhand but also the entire country.
People are grateful for their contribution to the entire nation.
Do you know why the British have adopted such a terrible way
Because even the British were afraid of him to build such a huge empire.
Birsa's regime was used by his traditional amb and wills to capture the British regime used by guns and cannons.
Birsa is not only fighting the British for national freedom but also for the social and economic freedom of the tribals.
He did this in his short lifetime.
He illuminated the sun in dark life of the deprived and exploited.
He died at a young age of 25 years.
The brave sons of Bharatamba like Birsa Munda have been born in all parts of the country.
There will not be any corner of those who have played their role in this freedom struggle for centuries.
Individuals like Birsa Munda are cautious of our existence, personalities like Jamshedji Tata have conferred big institutions to the country.
He knew that India needs scientific technologies and it should be an industrial hub.
Today, the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science called the Indian Institute of Science was a result of his long vision.
Not only this, he has established world-class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
The visit between Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekananda is on the ship during the visit to America.
It is said that this discussion has been possible to establish the Indian Institute of Science.
Dear countrymen, the birth of former Prime Minister of our country, Mr. Morarjibhai Desai was on 29th February.
As you all know, this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai was one of the top leaders of the country, the owner of the ladies and peaceful personality.
Morarjibha has got the privilege of presenting the budget for the maximum time in the Parliament of independent India.
In the name of this, he had to pay for old age.
The then government arrested him and put him in jail.
But in 1977, when he won the Janta Party election, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The 44th Amendment provides for publication of procedures in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies in newspapers.
The Amendment envisaged that some of the powers of the Supreme Court were re-established and the fundamental rights received by the Constitution by 20 and 21 could not be abrogated even during the period of emergency.
The Cabinet has written that the President can declare the situation as he asks, and the period of emergency cannot be extended once more than six months.
In 1975, Morarjiba ensured that the death of democracy was not repeated in the future.
The coming generation will recall his great contribution in maintaining the greatness of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay homage to the great leader.
Friends, People are enthusiastic about Padma Awards every year.
They are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways in the strength of their own learning.
It was a great deal of bringing a rare painting to a new generation.
I gave the gift to former US President Barack Saheb, the art work of Tri of Life built by Abdul Gafur.
Among those who received the Padma Awards, Shabbir Said Goma, Marathwada is known as the server of Mother Goddess.
You will be surprised to hear about Tao Porchon-ynch in America, and Linch is now a big institution for Yoga.
It is a special feature that they have tried to connect technology with agriculture and the beloved people, 12 of the Padma Awards this year are farmers.
Normally few people associated with the agriculture sector have come to the list of Padma Shris.
The present transformation is a living picture of India.
Friends, Today I am going to tell you something that is heartening, and I understand it for the past few days.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have got the benefit of this scheme.
I have seen how big change it brings in the lives of the poor.
If you don't know anybody who doesn't get treated because of lack of money, tell them about this scheme.
This scheme is only for the poor and the dear people, the school is going to start the examination time.
In the next few weeks, examinations of different education boards, 10th class and 12th class will be started across the country.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the students who are going to write the exams and their guardians.
A few days ago, a massive programme of exam paper discussion was held at Town Hall in Delhi.
I have been able to interact with millions of students, parents and teachers in the country and abroad with the help of technology in the programme in this town hall.
Through the radio, I talk to millions of families in a way every month.
I think you are part of my family when you talk to you sometimes when you read your letters and listen to the suggestions you send through the phone.
It gives me a very pleasant feeling.
Friends, Election is the biggest festival in democracy.
I've been telling you Mann Ki Baat for years.
Once again, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat January 2019
A very sad news was received by the nation on the 21st of this month.
Shri Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji of Siddhganga Math in Tumkur district of Karnataka became Divangat.
Shivkumaraswamy dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us - Kayakave Kailas - that is, hard work is equal to Lord Shiva's residence in Kailas.
Shivakumar Swamiji was a follower of this vision.
He worked for the social, educational and economic upliftment of thousands of people during his 111 years of life.
He was renowned as a philosopher in English, culture and Canada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He tried his entire life to provide food, home, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
His priority was the best for the farmers.
The Siddhaganga Math was regularly organising the Animal-Karshika Melas.
I am fortunate to have received the blessings of the Lord Swamiji.
Kalam Saheb had heard a poem about Pujaya Swami ji on this occasion.
Once again I pay homage to that great soul.
Dear countrymen, on January 26, 1950, the Constitution was formed in our country.
At that time our country is for the Republic.
Yesterday, we celebrated the Republic Day as a joy.
But I want to tell you something else.
January 25 was the founding day of the Election Commission and this day is celebrated as National Voters Day.
People from all over the world are surprised to see the huge election process in India.
It is natural for the citizens of our country to be proud of the Election Commission.
It must have been heard that in the Gir forest of Gujarat, Polling Building for only one voter.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commission for continuously striving to strengthen our democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commission, the Security Officers and other dignitaries of all the States, who are participating in the election process, who are independent and unilateral elections.
This year the Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country.
This will be the first time youngsters born in the twenty-fourth century to exercise their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have got the opportunity to combat the responsibility of the country.
They're going to determine the country's division.
It is time to connect our dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register a voter if it is the age of voting.
At the same time, we have to think that it is our own duty to vote.
If there is no vote in life due to any reason then it must be a painful one.
I'm sorry to see something wrong happening in the country.
Our country is a multinational Vasundhara.
One of the great ones was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On January 23, the entire country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different manner.
On the birth anniversary of Netaji, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes of Indias freedom.
Since independence in the Red Fort, some rooms and buildings were locked till date.
These locked rooms of the Red Fort have become a beautiful museum today, dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army.
Every stone of this museum is full of smell of our prideful history.
Everywhere in the museum, the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle reflect and inspire us to go to history.
At the same time, the English regime case was conducted against the brave sons of Bharatamba - Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gur Baksh Dhillan and Major General Shahnawas Khan.
I wanted to keep the hat in the museum itself, and the visitors should see the hat from which I would like to inspire the patriotism.
However, the bravery and patriotism of our leaders must be repeated to the new generation in different ways.
A month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
I raised the three-fold flag in a programme just 75 years ago when Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was flagged off.
Likewise, it would be astonishing for everyone to have a thrilling flag on the Red Fort in October 2018, as it is the routine to raise the flag on 15th August.
Now it was the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Azad Hind Government.
Dilli Chalo, Tum My Khun Do, Mym Tummy Azadi Dunga (Get to Delhi, give me blood, I will give you freedom).
In the last few years, the need for the people to see the files related to Netaji has increased.
I am glad that I could do that.
I remember the day that Netaji's family came together in the Prime Minister's residence.
We spoke about Netaji and paid tributes to Netaji Subhash Bose.
I am happy to note that I have tried to develop several places related to the great people of India in Delhi.
The 26 Alipur road connected to Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Sardar Patel Museum, or Kranti Mandir, will be happy.
If you come to Delhi, you must go to see these places.
Dear countrymen, today when we talk about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, that too in Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
He also chose the radio to interact with the people and started the Subhash Babu Azad Hind Radio in 1942.
I understand that this radio station was broadcast throughout the week in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
In this radio station, Gujarati M.
R.
Vyas played an important role.
The ordinary people liked the programmes launched at Azad Hind Radio.
These programmes were very encouraging to the warriors who were in the freedom struggle.
A visual art museum is also organized in this Kranti Mandir.
We have tried to explain the Indian art and culture in a very attractive way.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum where more than 450 paintings and other artefacts of three centuries old have been installed.
The museum showcases the excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai and Sailos Mukherji.
I specially urge you all to go there to see the writings of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You might think that when I talk about art, Gurudev Tagore's wonderful compositions should be seen.
You might have known Gurudev as a writer about Rabindranath Tagore and as a musician.
He has drawn pictures of animals and birds and has seen a lot of natural scenes and he has discovered human nature and art in Kanvas.
It is important to note that Gurudev did not name many of his writings.
He thought that those who saw his drawn pictures should understand the paintings that he had given in it should know through his own vision.
His pictures have been displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
This great man has given a message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through his thoughts and actions.
That was a great saint Ravidas.
February 19 is the birth anniversary of Ravidas.
The memorials of Sant Ravidas ji are very popular.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
He tried to convey the importance of learning and learning throughout his life through his messages.
Many young scientists of the country have contributed to our space programmes and space programmes.
We are proud that today our students have developed satellites and sounding rockets.
On January 24, the art of our students was launched.
New records have also been set up by students in Odisha, sounding rockets.
Space Missions have been launched in the last four years since independence to 2014.
We have set up a world record to launch 104 satellites through the same environmental mission.
We are soon going to ensure the presence of India in the moon through Chandrayaan-2.
Our country is using space technologies to protect the lives and lives of the people.
Whether it is climate change, railways, road safety, there is a lot of support for space technology in all.
Naval equipment has been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which is helpful in their safety as well as economic development.
We are using space technologies to bring government services to the public and to ensure its responsibility effectively.
Approximately 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been tagged under the Housing for All (Home) scheme.
At the same time, nearly three and a half crore earthquakes have been tagged under Manrega.
Our satellites are symbols of the growing power of the country today.
Through our Competitive Satellite Launch Service, India is launching satellites not only of developing countries but also of developing countries.
Sky and stars are always attractive for children.
Our space programmes provide an opportunity to imagine the children as big and to go beyond the limits that are still impossible.
This is also a vision of monitoring the stars for our children and inspiring to find new stars.
6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
This time in Khelo India, the sportspersons from all the states showcased their own performance.
The life of many medal winners is a strong inspiration.
I learned that the young sportsperson Akash Gorkha silver medal was awarded in Gusti, and I learned that Akash's father was working as a guard in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
In the same way, the captain of the 21 women's cubed team of Maharashtra, Sonali Helvi, is a person living in Satara.
They lost their father at a very young age, and brother and mother encouraged Sonali's ability.
Normally, girls are not encouraged to participate in games like Kabadi.
But Sonali chose the cubs and showed the best performance.
Abinav Shah, a 10-year-old Asansol, is a Gold medal at the youngest age in the Khelo India Youth Games.
The daughter of a farmer from Karnataka won a gold medal in Akshata Baswanikamati Varodwahan.
When we talk about the creation of India, the youth is a vision of a New India.
In this story of Khelo India, it should be remembered that the creation of New India is not only contributing to the people of big cities but also the youth from small towns, villages and villages, children and young sports skilled people.
Dear countrymen, you must have heard about the beauty of your name.
But have you heard of a beautiful competition for toilets
More than 50,000 toilets participated in this wonderful competition that has been held for nearly a month.
I urge all Sarpanches and rural leaders to lead this movement in their Panchayats.
Please share the picture of your clean beauty toilet in Milathar in the media.
Friends, On 2nd October 2014, we started a memorable journey to make the country waste-free and to prevent the defecation in the open.
My little friends, the days of the exam are coming closer.
Ansul Sharma MyGov, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written that I want to talk about the exams and exams.
Ansul Ji thanked him for taking care of this matter.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the examination season.
Today, Mann Ki Baat wanted to discuss this issue, but two days later on 29th January, at 11 a.m. onwards, students from all over the country will be interacting with parents and teachers.
This time, students from other countries are also participating in the event.
In this exam paper discussion, I will talk to young friends about all aspects related to the examination, especially the stress free exam.
Some of these suggestions and suggestions will definitely be placed in front of you in this programme in the Town Hall.
You must participate in this program.
You'll see it in the media or the Namo App leude.
Friends, January 30 is a remembrance of a supreme father.
The entire nation will pay homage to the martyrs on 11th.
We must pay homage to everybody for the two minute defendants.
Remember the revered father, his dreams are accomplished, a New India is building, accomplishing his duty as a citizen.
This journey of 2019 will be successfully taken forward.
Greetings to all of you. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018
Dear countrymen, Namaskar.
2018 is going to end.
We're entering the year 2019.
Naturally, we will also hear the discussions about the hopes of the coming year with the discussions of the last year.
Be it the life of a person or the life of a society or the life of a nation, everyone has to look back and try to look forward as much as possible.
This is the result of the achievements of experiences and the confidence to do something new.
Imagine what we can contribute to bringing about changes in our lives and bringing the country and the society forward.
My best wishes to all of you, 2019.
As a result of the vision of the people of the country, the values of sanitation are progressing 95 percent.
After independence, the Red Fort was first flagged off the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
The Champions of the Earth Award, the highest ecosystem of the United Nations.

Our country has achieved unprecedented excellence in the Ease of Doing Business ranking.
Our daughters have enhanced the pride of the nation by placing the world through navigation.
The first waterway of the country started in Varanasi.

India has shown a very good performance in Para Asian Games.
Our Mann Ki Baat, 2019 will continue to be the list of all the social efforts of India.
All this has been achieved by the unconscious efforts of 130 crore people.
I am confident that this journey of Indias progress and progress will continue in 2019 and our country will win new heights.
Friends, We have lost some of our distinguished relatives in this December.
Dr. Jaichandran was known as a person who provides cheapest treatment to the poor.
Similarly, on December 25, Sulagiti Narasama died in Karnataka.
Sulagiti Narasama was a helper of delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
They provided services to thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the areas of pilgrimage.
There are many inspirations like Jaichandra and Sulagiti Narasama.
They have dedicated their lives for the good of all in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, I would like to tell you about the work done by doctors in Bijnor, North India.
Some party workers told me the last day that some young doctors in the city were camping and treating the poor.
The Heart Lungs Critical Centre is conducting medical camps every month, where there are various diseases, free tests and treatment arrangements.
Today, hundreds of patients are using this camp every month.
The zeal of these doctors and friends who are neutrally serving must be appreciated.
Today, I can proudly say that the Swachh Bharat Mission has been a successful movement through social efforts.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people were involved in sanitation work in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
City Corporation, Services Institutions, School-College students and all the people of Jabalpur participated in this magnificence for cleanliness.
I'm thebetterindia.
Whenever I get the opportunity, I certainly went to the Betterindia.com and tried to know about such inspirations.
I am happy to note that many such websites introduce us many stories inspired by the people of specialties and life.
Com is trying to spread the positivity in the site society and make the society more sensitive.
Similarly, the story of the success of the industrial entrepreneurs and the youth innovators is telling us a lot.
Please join the positivity.
I am confident that more and more people know about our heroes who bring about changes in the society.
It's easier to spread the negativeity.
However, we have a lot of good things in our society, all this is possible by the collective efforts of 130 crore people.
Hana is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanna learned and compassionately, he learned about its various aspects and proved himself capable.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country for their bright future.
Greetings and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, there was a lot of discussions in the media about 16-year-old child and Rajni.
You must have read.
Rajni Junior Mahila won a gold medal in Gusti Championship.
As soon as the Rajni medal was won, the child went to the nearby milk shop and drank a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni medal was put in a cloth and put in a bag.
You wonder why Rajni drank a glass of milk.
The child did it, and the father was honouring Jasmersing, and he sold luxury in a snake stall.
Rajni said that his father suffered a lot of sacrifices and suffered a lot.
Jasmer Singh works every morning before Rajan and his brothers awake.
When he told his father the interest of learning Rajni Boxing, his father organised all possible things and encouraged her spirit.
Rajini's wrestling training took the old gloves because at that time the financial condition of the family was very bad.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni didn't have any excitement, had to learn the ghost.
He won a medal from Serbia.
This month, the 20-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni of Pune has become the fastest guy in the world's cycling.
The child traveled 300 kilometres a day in a cycle of 159 days.
The spirit of the child is surely congratulating him on the cycle.
We don't get inspired by listening to such capabilities.
My best wishes to our farmer brothers and sisters.
The fragrance of emotions like unity in diversity, Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is filled with our festivals.
In the Indian culture, the society and the nature are not separated, where the individual and prosperity are the same.
Calendar, Panchangam is a good example of our close relationship with nature based on festivals.
It will also provide information about the status of planets and stars as well as festivals throughout the year.
It is decided as to whom the calendar abstains.
Festivals and festivals are celebrated on the basis of planet nutritions in many areas.
Gudi Padwa, Chedichand and Ugadi are celebrated according to the lunar calendar, while Tamil Putandu, Vishu, Vaishakham, Baisakhi, Poila Baisak and Bihu are celebrated on the basis of the sun rays.
One can see the vision of protecting rivers and water in many of our festivals.
Chhath Festival is related to sunset in rivers and lakes.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, lakhs and millions of people drown in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals and festivals teach us the lessons of social values.
On the one hand, they have an ancient significance, on the other hand, all the festivals are inspired by the inspiration to live with each other's brotherhood.
I convey my best wishes to all of you, and wish you all to celebrate the coming festivals with a lot of heart.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
People from all over the country come and participate in the Kumbh.
The Kumbh is a land of faith and devotion.
Together, millions of people from across the country and abroad are gathering together.
The tradition of the Kumbh is spread over our great cultural traditions.
This time, from 15th January to 15th January, you will probably be waiting for the world famous Kumbh to celebrate Prayagraj.
For the Kumbh, saints and saints have already begun to reach Mahatkal.
It is a big evidence that the UNESCO is included in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity to manipulate the global significance.
A few days ago, the Ambassadors of several countries saw the preparations for the Kumbh.
There the national flags of many countries have been raised.
People from more than 150 countries will come to this Kumbh in Prayagraj.
This is a big study, especially for the youth.
I went to Prayag Raj a few days ago and saw the preparations for the Kumbh being done very excitingly.
This time, there is a lot of importance in sanitation.
It will be cleaned with devotion and it will reach a distance.
This time devotees can visit Akshayavad after pious bath at the confluence.
This Akshayavad, a symbol of the belief of the people, was locked in the fort for centuries, so the devotees could not see if they wanted.
This time everybody has been allowed to enter there.
You all must participate in the Kumbh, share the pictures of different heads in the social media, so that more and more people get inspiration to go to the Kumbh.
May the spiritual Kumbh be an important pillar of Indian philosophy.
May the Kumbh of faith be the pride of nationality.
May the Kumbh of artisticity be the greatest of creative powers.
Friends, It is also an excitement in the minds of the people about the Republic Day celebrations on 26th January that day we remember the great personalities that we have formed our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of the priest father.
The President of South Africa, Mr.
Siriel Ramaphosa is visiting India as the Chief Guest on Republic Day this year.
There was a distinct relationship between priest Bapu and South Africa.
Mohan, Mahatma was from this direction of Africa.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and remained firmly opposed to definition.
He established Phoenix and Tolstoy Fams from where the world over smells peace and justice.
He had the power and inspiration to live in jail for so many years.
He wrote about Mandela Bapu, "Mahatma is an integral part of our history because here he started testing tests.
This is where he showed his determination for justice, where he has developed the vision of Satyagraha and the battlefield.
He saw Bapu as a roll model.
Bapu and Mandela are not only a source of inspiration throughout the world, but their ideals always inspire us to create a love and compassionate society.
Friends, Just a few days ago, the DGP conference was held at Kevadiya along the banks of Narmada in Gujarat, where the world's highest statue is Statue of Unity.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the nation.
He always lived in maintaining the integrity of India.
Sardar Saheb thought that the power of India depends on the diversity here.
Recognizing Sardar Sabs vision, I pay tributes to him through this award for unity.
Dear countrymen, January 13 is the holy day of Guru Govind Singh's birth anniversary.
Guru Govind Singh ji was born in Patna.
His land of work was North India, and he shot his life in Namded in Maharashtra.
In the birthplace of Patna, the land of Karmabhoomi, North India, the last moment of life in Namdede.
In a way, he received his blessings throughout the year of India.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was the younger age of 9 years after Guru Tej Bahadur ji became a martyr.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice in the tradition of Sikh Gurus.
He was the owner of a peaceful and compassionate personality, but whenever he tried to shout the voices of the poor and the weak, Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice at noon when he acted injustice to them.
He was a divine piece of bravery, valour, sacrifice and religion.
He had unnatural weapons and science.
It was a warrior who knew many languages including Gurumukhi, Braj Language, Culture, Parsi, Hindi, Urdu.
I once again bow down to Guru Govind Singh.
Dear countrymen, there are many good events in the country but there is no detailed discussion about them.
Health tours are being organised across the country as part of the Right India Movement.
The programme will be held on 27th January.
It is a commendable thing that I am trying to provide awareness and knowledge among the people.
India should be clean and prosperous only when it is clean.
The most important thing for good health is nutritious food .
To start in this matter .
It is necessary to learn lessons about the importance of food in childhood.
Come, let us move to win new heights for new achievements with new inspiration, enthusiasm and determination, let us move forward, change our country.
In MyGov, Anshu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Delhi and Vikas Yadav from Patna have also asked about the same question as Monica Jain from Delhi, Prasenjit Sarkar from Bardwan in West Bengal, music scientists from Nagpur.
They say people are usually connected to you through modern technology, social media and mobile apps.
I want to tell you a story.
It took place in 1998.
I was working as an organizational worker of the Bharatiya Janta Party in Himachal.
It was a month of May.
It was a little dad.
I don't understand anything.
Seeing my reaction, he said, look, sir, listen to the radio.
Next time, Akashwani conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
Some of them are very funny.
Average 70 of the surveyors are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat has grown positive thinking in the society.
Many people have been encouraged by Mann Kiba.
There were widespread discussions about India Positive.
I am happy to see that the radio becomes more popular due to Mann Ki Baat.
If the leader gets a mike, millions and millions of people have to listen, what do you want
They found that there is no politics in this program.
When Mann Ki Baat started, it was decided that there was no politics in it, it would not be the benefits of the government and that Modi would not be there.
The most inspired in implementing my decision was from you.
Small stories of 130 crore people will persist.
This country will bring new inspiration and enthusiasm to new heights.
When you read the letter, a feeling like that is in my mind, then it can be reflected.
In two words, I share it with my experience to you.
The Selfie seed dotor programme is being launched in a small village in Haryana and when a government gets strength to spread abroad and not all over the country.
People from all sections of the society, who are known as celebritises, have joined with this and have made the thinking of the society awakened in the new language that is understood by the present generation.
Mann Kibat is not a matter of government, but a matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is a matter of India awaiting progress.
India's life is not political but power.
The life of India is social and social power.
There are thousands of heads in social life and one of them is political.
If everything is political, it is not a good arrangement for the society.
Sometimes, political events, political acts and other talents of the society are embarrassing their lives.
Thank you very much for the phone call.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is an easy task for me.
People's letters come before all Mann Ki Baats.
I try to see the highest letters before Mann Ki Baat and read the commands.
I hear a lot of phone calls.
I read very carefully the ideas and innovations that you have sent during the journey as soon as Mann Kibath's Episode arrives.
So whenever you read a letter, the ecosystem of a writer, his emotions and thoughts become part of my thoughts.
That letter isn't a piece of mustard for me.
For the last 40-45 years, I have led the life of a prince who has gone to most of the districts of the country and has spent a long time in remote districts of the country.
The suggestions of the letters not incorporated in the Mann Ki Baat are also being taken into consideration in the respective departments.
I would like to thank my friends in Akashwani, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV channels and media.
Because of their efforts, Mann Ki Baat can reach more and more people.
The team of Akashwani is preparing to broadcast all the episods in many languages.
Some people listen to Mann Ki Baat with the same spirit in the voice of Modi in the local language.
That's how they're becoming Modi for that 30 minutes.
Greetings and best wishes to them for their talent and talent.
I urge you all to hear this programme in local languages.
I would like to thank the friends of the media who have heard Mann Ki Baat every month in their channels.
Nobody in politics is happy with the media, they feel that they get a very little coverage, and if you get the coverage then it is a negative coverage.
This journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete if you didn't cooperate.
I'm gonna do it in every family.
It is easier to understand the things if we don't come in the middle of the old ladders of our own life.
Nobody knows that he left his thoughts and accepted the ideas of oppression.
The specialty of today's youth is that they don't do their own self-confidence, if they believe in one thing, they leave everything for it and follow it.
Sometimes people talk about ideological discourse with youngsters in families.
In fact, the limit for talking to most of the families and youth is very narrow.
It is said that do so about things that are learning for long, or habits, lifestyles, do not do so.
I have been trying to constantly interact with the youth through social media through various programmes.
I try to learn from them what they do, what they think.
They always have a store of ideas.
They are very energetic, innovative and focused.
Through Mann Kiba, I am trying to further connect the problems and their things of the youth.
Sometimes there is a complaint that youngsters have more questions.
I say it's good for the youth to ask questions.
We feel that todays youth are very important and think big things.
It is beneficial to see big dreams and to achieve greater achievements. In fact, this is a New India, New India.
Some say the youth want to do a lot of things at the same time.
I ask you what's wrong with this.
Many things are done at the same time, because they are capable of multi-tasking.
If we look around, it is social initiatives, start-ups, sports or other areas, the youth are bringing about a big change in the society.
Young people who have dared to ask questions and see new dreams.
If you bring the ideas of the youth to the ground, you give them an open environment to show it, you can bring about a positive change in the country and they are doing it.
My dear countrymen, Vineetaji MyGov of Gurugram has written that I should tell you about the Constitution Day in this Mann Ki Baat.
Vinita says that the day is important because we enter into the seventeenth year of our constitution.
Thank you very much for this opinion.
In order to fulfill this historic thing, the Constituent Assembly took two years and 11 months and 17 days.
Just imagine that within three years this great man has given us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
It is an example of todays time management and productivity that they have created the Constitution at such an extraordinary pace.
It inspires us to fulfill our responsibilities in the record time.
The Constituent Assembly was the confluence of the great talents of the country and all of them were committed to empowering India and empowering the poorest of the poor.
When 60 years of Indias Republic was completed in 2010, an elephant constituent was organised by an elephant constitution in Gujarat.
It was an opportunity to recall the youth to enhance the awakening of the Constitution and connect them with different aspects of the Constitution.
In 2020, we will complete 70 years as a Republic and 75 years of our independence will be completed in 2022.
Come, let us move forward our Constitutional values, ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
He said that Indians are different from the backdrop, but we must be nation-wide above all.
India First India is the first thing to be Dr.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have also proposed to celebrate this opportunity.
Similarly, it will be celebrated in all the countries of the world.
A train will also run through a road to the holy places related to Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Last day, I remembered the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Saheb when he was attending this meeting.
The Gurudwara suffered huge losses during the earthquake in 2001 in Gujarat.
Our journey will continue.
As much as you are connected, our journey will be deeper and will be happy to all.
Sometimes there are questions in the minds of some people - What did I get with Mann Ki Baat
Your great wishes are my great wishes...
Come on, let's go ahead with this journey.
October 31 is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Like every year, the youth of the country are ready to run for the unity of the country.
Now the weather is very comfortable.
I urge you all to enthusiastically participate in the Forum Unit.
Approximately six and a half months before the Independence Day, the world's most famous international publication The Time Magazine became the photograph of Sardar Patel in the cover page of Lakka on 27th January, 1947.
They gave a picture of India with the main article, which wasn't like we looked at today.
It was a painting of India that was scattered in different parts.
At that time there were more than 550 nations.
The interests of the British on India were immovable.
He said how he did rescue work during the floods in Ahmedabad in 1920s.
It is said how Bardoli has given direction to Satyagraha.
From farmers and workers to industrialists, everyone was able to believe in him and his faith and commitment to the nation.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be dedicated to the nation by paying a true tribute to Sardar Patel.
The height of this statue established on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is double of the Statue of Liberty in America.
This is the world's tallest, Gaganasparshi statue.
Every Indian can be proud of the world's tallest statue in Bharat Mann.
Sardar Patel, who is associated with the soil, will be decorated with the sky.
Dear brothers and sisters, we all celebrated Infantry Day yesterday.
I salute everyone who is part of the Indian Army.
I salute the families of the soldiers in the name of their courage.
But do you know why we are celebrating Infantry Day
It was the day when the Indian Army jawans were on the soil of Kashmir and waited for the mountaineers to swallow Kashmir.
This historic event has a direct relationship with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading a front of Sam Manek Shah, the great military officer of India.
At that moment, Feeld Marshal Manek Shah, who was a Feeld Marshal.
At that time, in October 1947, the military surge was started to Kashmir.
October 31 is the remembrance of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi.
Indiraj also paid homage to him.
My dear countrymen, sports, who doesn't like sports
Spirit, Strength, Skill and Stamina are important in the world of sports.
This is not the element of the success of any player.
Two meetings were held in the memory of the memorial next year.
This is the first time that the Asian Para Games 2018 in Jakarta met with our Para Athletes.
Similarly, the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 won in Argentina.
The Youth Olympics 2018 showcased the best performance of our youth so far.
We have won 13 medals and 3 medals in Mix Intent.
This is the story of Indian sports that touches new heights every day.
India is creating new records not only in sports but also in non-violent areas.
He lost his father when he was 8 years old.
He lived in the orphanage for the next 8 years.
After leaving the orphanage, the DTC buses were cleaned and worked as a vendor on the shores of Delhi.
Today, in the same Narayan International Institute, gold medals are being obtained for India.
Not only this, look at all the heights of excellence in Indias sports.
India has never won an Olympic Medal in Judo, Senior Lovely or Junior Lovely.
However, Tababi Devi won a silver medal in Judo in Youth Olympics.
The 16-year-old young sportsperson Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
The child's father is a labourer, and the mother is fishing.
Sometimes this child's family was in a position to buy anything for food.
Even in such a situation, the fort was not hid by Tababi Devi's enthusiasm.
That's why he won medals for the country and made history.
There are innumerable stories like this.
Every life is an inspiration.
The enthusiasm of all young sportspersons is on the bottom of New India.
Friends, We have successfully organised FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017.
He congratulated the entire world as a tournament organised in comparison to it.
This year, India has got the privilege of organizing the Men's Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will run from 28th November to 16th December.
In the minds of all Indians, playing any game, sometimes interested in any game, there will definitely be a chave with Hockey.
India has offered great hockey sportspersons.
The story of Hockey will be incomplete without these great sportspersons in India whenever the discussions about World Hockey are held.
Hockey magician Major Dhyan Chand will be known all over the world.
After that, the Hockey has been made from Balwinder Singh Senior, Lesli Cloudies, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj.
Even today, the team of India has inspired the new generation of Hockey through the achievements of their teachings and dedication.
Sports lovers have a good opportunity to see thrilling games.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only increase the enthusiasm of the Indian team but also encourage all teams.
But in the new era, in a new way, in a new generation, in a new spirit, in a new zeal, in a new spirit, we are moving forward with new dreams.
Some teach children, some teach adults, some are engaged in sanitation, some are helping farmers.
There is no desire behind all this, but it has dedication, determination and selflessness.
A young man learned to play a wheelchair basketball to help the wheelchair basketball team of Divyang.
This excitement is the work of this dedication in mission mode.
Doesn't any Indian feel proud of it
Brothers and sisters, This time when I looked at the suggestions related to Mann Ki Baat, I saw a very attractive note of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pondicherry.
He has written in MyGov, "Please tell Mann Ki Baat how the tribals of India, their lifestyles and traditions are the best examples of co-operation with nature.
They need to learn what we need to make traditions part of our lives for sustainable development.
Manish ji, I congratulate Mann Ki Baat for putting this topic before the listeners.
This is a matter of inspiring us to look at our prideful past and culture, and today the world and especially the Western countries are talking about environmental protection and seeking new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees, plants and flowers as goddesses.
The people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, especially in the Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, are worshipped with respect to the tree named almonds and Arjun.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us how to protect the environment.
They don't want to live their lives especially in protecting trees, but they don't agree to harm any tree.
Fishermen in Arunachal have a direct relationship with tigers.
They look like their brothers and sisters.
People from the Warli community of Maharashtra are watching the tigers as guests and for them the presence of tigers is prosperous.
The Gaud tribes of Madhya India hold fishing in some parts of the river Kethan during the period of fisheries.
They look at these areas as the shelter of fish and that is why they get good fishes.
The garden, a small swimming community in Nilgiri in southern India, is traditionally constructing their houses due to the available items in the region.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is true that the tribal community believes in living very peacefully and peacefully, but if anyone harms their natural resources, they will not be able to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that the tribal community was among our first freedom fighters.
Come on, let's showcase their respect.
Friends, Mann Ki Baat says about those who do extraordinary things for the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother Bhai Gurubachan Singh of Punjab.
An ordinary farmer was the marriage of Gurubachan Singh.
But if a common farmer like Bhai Gurubachan Singh told the father of the bride, you would be surprised to know that it is the real strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told them that I should promise that no wikol will burn in the field.
You can imagine how much social power it has.
It seems simple that Gurubachan Singh ji said, but how large his personality is, we say that there are many families in our society that make personal things a matter of social harmony.
Mr. Gurubachan Singhji's family has been an example in front of us.
I read another village in Punjab about Kalar Majra near Nabha.
The people of Kalar Majra are connecting the entire ground instead of burning the wickels and using technology for it.
Greetings to Bhai Gurubachan Singh.
Congratulations to the people of all other places who have made great efforts to keep the environment clean.
You are living as the real inheritors of the Indian tradition of a healthy lifestyle.
Om Dhaun Shanti , Shanti Prithvi Shanti , Apa Shanti vanspathya , Shanti , Vishwadeva , Shanti , Brahma , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , or all the three worlds , peace , peace , peace , peace , peace , peace , peace , peace , peace , peace in all the three worlds , peace in the earth , in the earth , in the air , in the air , in the air , in the air , in the air , in the air , in the air , in the air , in the air , in the air ,
In animals, in the heart, in you, in the particles of the world, there is peace everywhere.
For India, the First World War was a big event.
Obviously, we didn't have a direct relationship with that war.
Nevertheless, our soldiers fought bravely, played a very big role, made great martyrdom.
When Indian soldiers came to war, they showed the world that they were not behind anyone.
In the First World War, the world was seen as a trace of destruction.
It is believed that more than one crore soldiers have given life to the common man.
Through this, the whole world understands what is the importance of peace.
In the last hundred years, the definition of peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony is not just a war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development and social justice, it is necessary to work together with the collaboration of the world.
The development of the poor in the poor is a real symbol of peace.
Dear countrymen, our Northeast region is different.
The natural beauty there is unique and the people there are very talented.
Our north-eastern region is now familiar with a lot of compassions.
The North-Eastern region has improved the importance of organic farming, i. e.
A few days ago, Kirtiket Future Policy Gold Awards, 2018 was received to promote sustainable availability of Sikkim.
It means that the food and agricultural organisation is being provided.
The award for best policy formulation in this sector is equivalent to the Oscar in the region.
Not only this, our Sikkim State has been pursuing 51 policies in the name of 25 countries.
My best wishes to the people of Sikkim.
Dear countrymen, October is the end of the month.
There are many changes in the weather.
Festivals have also been held in a way, like Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhayaduj, Chhath, in a way, the month of November is the month of festivals.
As an opportunity to move forward in a mission mode in your life, your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
