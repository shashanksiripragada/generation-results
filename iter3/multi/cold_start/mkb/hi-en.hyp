My dear countrymen, Namaskar
My best wishes to all of you on Diwali
It has been said to us - Shubham Karoti Kalyan Health Dhanasampadam
It is said in this shloka that light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which shows goodwill by destroying the opposite intellect.
I bow down to such a divine light
To remember this Deepawali, what can be the better idea that we expand the light, spread the positivity and pray to destroy the spirit of hostility
Today Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world .
The special thing is that it includes only the Indian community, it is not so, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens there, the social organizations there celebrate Diwali with full joy.
In a way India stands there .
Friends, Festival Tourism has its own attraction in the world.
Our country, which is the Country of Festivals, has immense potential for tourism.
Our effort should be to spread festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and to include people from other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals.
There are so many festivals in every state and every region in ourselves. The people of other countries are very interested in them.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in increasing the festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last mind we had decided to separate something on this Deepawali.
I had said, let us all celebrate the women's strength and their achievements on this Diwali, that is, the honor of Laxmi of India.
And seeing that immediately afterwards, countless inspired stories were found on social media.
Kodipaka Ramesh of Karangal wrote on NamoApp that my mother is my power
My mother is God for me .
Everything is for me and it is the Laxmi of India in the right sense
Ramesh ji, my bow to your mother ji
Geetika Swamy, who is active on Twitter, says that for him Major Aroma Kanwar is Laxmi of India who is the daughter of Bus Conductor and he led the All-Commen group of Assam Riles.
For poetry Tiwari ji, India's Lakshmi is his daughter, who is also his strength.
They are proud that their daughter performs the best painting .
He has also achieved a very good rank in the ATF examination
Megha Jain has written that a 92-year-old woman of Ninety Two Year, gives free water to the passengers at Gwalior railway station for years.
Megha ji has been very inspired by the humility and compassion of this Laxmi of India.
Many such stories have been shared by people .
You must read, inspire and share the same with yourself and I respectfully bow down to all these Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the well-known poet Sachi Honamma of the 17th century, he wrote a poem in Kannada, that emotion, that word, every Laxmi of India, that we are talking about.
It seems as if his conduct was created in the 17th century itself.
How excellent words, how excellent feelings and how excellent ideas are in this poem of Kannada language
Pannida Parmegondanu Himavantanu, Pannida Bhrigu Parchidanupennida Jankarayanu Jasuvalidanu (Pennida Permegondanu Himavantanu.Pennida Brohu Perchidanu Perchidanu Perchidanu Perchidanu Perchidanu Perchidanu Perchidanu Perchidanu Perchidanu jasuvalandanu i. e. Parvataraja due to his daughter Parvati, Rishi Bhrigu has found her daughter due to her daughter Laxmi and King Janak got her daughter due to her daughter Sita
Our daughters are our pride and with the greatness of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, this is the day on November 12, 2019 that the 550th Light Festival of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
The effect of Guru Nanak Dev ji is not only in India but in the whole world .
Our Sikh brothers and sisters are settled in many countries of the world who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanakdev ji.
I can never forget my visits to Gurudwaras in Vancouver and Tehran
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanakdev ji that I can share with you, but for this there will be many episodes of mind.
He always kept the service paramount
Guru Nanakdev ji believed that there could be no choice of service work done by selflessness .
They stood firmly against social evils like touching
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji conveyed his message in the world, to far-flung
He was one of the most travellers in his time .
He went to many places and wherever he went, his simplicity, humility and simplicity won the hearts of everyone.
Guru Nanak Dev ji made several important religious visits which are called sadness
With the message of goodwill and equality, they visited the north, north or south, east or west, everywhere, they met the saints and saints.
It is believed that the well-known saint Shankardev of Assam was also inspired by him .
He visited the holy land of Haridwar
There is a holy place in Kashi, Gurubagh Gurudwara, it is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji had stayed there.
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism .
Guru Nanak Dev ji, visit to Sri Lanka in the south
During the visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the problem of water there.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bidar who reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev ji, it is dedicated to him.
During a sadness, Guru Nanak ji visited the north, Kashmir and its surrounding areas.
It established a very strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir .
Guru Nanak Dev ji also visited Tibet, where people, they considered him, Guru
They are also worshipped in Uzbekistan, where, they traveled.
During one of his sadness, he also visited large numbers of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, I.
Just a few days ago, the Ambassador of the High Live Countries of about 85 countries visited Amritsar from Delhi.
There he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this happened to the 550th Prakash Parva of Guru Nanak Dev ji .
All these Ambassadors visited the Golden Temple, they also got the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions and culture.
Subsequently, many Ambassadors shared pictures on social media and also wrote pridefully good experiences.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember the date of October 31.
Sardar Patel used to look at things very deeply, test it.
In fact, they were Man of Detail.
At the same time, he was also expert in organization skills.
He had great importance in formulating plans and formulating strategy .
When they read about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, they hear how tremendous their planning was
In 1921, thousands of delegates from across the country were scheduled to join the Congress session in Ahmedabad at Nineteen Twenty One.
The responsibility of all the arrangements of the session was on Sardar Patel
He also used this opportunity to improve the network of water supply in the city.
He contacted the farmers and urged them to make Khadi bags
Farmers made bags and sold to representatives
By putting shoes in these bags, keeping with them, the tension of shoes stolen from the mind of the delegates has ended.
On the other hand , the sale of khadi also increased considerably .
Our country, Sardar Patel will always be grateful to play a remarkable role in the Constituent Assembly.
He did an important task to ensure fundamental rights so that no discrimination on the basis of caste and sect can be avoided.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a very big Bhagirath and historical work to unite the states.
In fact, when we talk of Sardar Patel's efforts, his role is discussed in some special provinces in the integration of the country.
He also played an important role for a small place like Lakshadweep .
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947, our neighbor's eye was on Lakshadweep and he sent a ship with his flag
As soon as Sardar Patel got information about this, he lost time without delaying, immediately started harsh action.
Soon after their command , the tricolor was hoisted there , and loosed every neighbour of the neighbourhood to capture Lakshadweep .
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked Mudaliar Brothers to personally ensure that Lakshadweep gets every necessary help for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing to Indias progress.
This is also an attractive tourist destination .
I hope you all will visit its beautiful islands and seashores.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the day when the Statue of Unity was dedicated to the nation and the world in memory of Sardar Saheb
This is the world ' s highest statue .
The Statue of Diberty located in America is also double in height .
The world ' s tallest statue fills every Indian with pride .
Every Indian ' s head rises higher than pride .
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists, State of Unity in a year.
This means that on average, eight and a half thousand people visited the grandeur of the Statue of Unity every day.
He expressed his faith and faith in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and now he has been developing centres of such attractions like Actus Garden, Butterly Garden, Jungle Saari, Children Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery and such attractions are continuously developing and this is also encouraging the local economy and people are also getting new opportunities for employment.
And keeping in mind the convenience of the tourists coming, many villages, in their homes, are providing the facility of Women's Stay.
Professional training is also being given to people who provide women's status facilities.
The people there have now started farming of ragon ruit and I am sure it will soon become the main source of the livelihood of the people there .
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study.
We all are witnesses of how one place is developed within a year as a world famous tourism destination.
People from abroad come there .
Transports, lodging, guides, eco-friendly arrangements, one after another, a lot of arrangements are developing themselves.
Very big economy is developing and people are creating facilities as per the requirement of travellers.
The government is also playing its role
Friends, As you know, National Integration Day is celebrated on 31st October every year from 2014.
This day gives us the message of protecting us at every cost of unity, integrity and security of our country.
On 31st October, every time, the Run for Unity is being organised.
It will include every section of the society, every section of the society.
Run for Nity is a symbol of this thing, this country is one, it is moving in one direction and wants to achieve one goal.
One goal - One India, Shreshtha Bharat.
It has been seen for the last five years - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, in the Union Territories, in the capitals, in the district centres, even in smaller tier-to-tier 3 City, there is a large quantity of men, women, people of the city, people of the village, children, youth, elderly people, disabilities, all are joining a large quantity.
Anyway, nowadays, people are getting to see a hobby and junior about Marathon.
Run for Nity is also a unique provision.
Running is beneficial for mind and brain and body all .
There's a run here too.
Besides, we are also associated with this propose of an India-Shreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not just body, mind and rituals to bring India to new heights for the unity of India
And that is why you can know about the run for city around you wherever you live in.
In this portal, information has been given to places across the country where run for unity is to be organized.
I hope you all will surely run on October 31 - for the unity of India, for God's fitness too.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country into the formula of unity
This mantra of unity is like a ritual in our life and in a country full of diversity like India, we should keep on strengthening this mantra of unity at every level, at every turn, at every moment.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and vigilant to empower the unity and mutual goodwill of the country.
If we look around us, we will find many examples that have been working continuously to enhance mutual harmony, but many times it happens that the efforts of the society, its contribution, the memory panel becomes very soon.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court ruled on Ram Janmabhoomi
Interest groups were playing games to take advantage of that situation in their own way.
To create warmth in the environment, what kind of language was spoken
But all this was going on for five days, seven days, ten days, but, as soon as the decision came, a joyous, surprising change was felt by the country.
On one hand, everything happened for warmth for two weeks, but when the decision on Ram Janmabhoomi came, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all communities, saints and saints gave a very balanced and restraint statement.
Whenever I remember that day , I feel happy .
Honoured the dignity of the judiciary very gloriously and did not allow anywhere to become an atmosphere of warmth, stress
These things should always be remembered that they give us a lot of strength .
That day, that moment, that is a duty for all of us.
This is an example of the voice of unity, how much power gives to the country.
I also pay tribute to them today.
My dear countrymen, today, if a story of every household is heard away, one story of every village is heard from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from every corner of India, then it is the story of cleanliness.
But there is also a pleasant experience and interesting experience .
I heard, I think, I'll tell you too.
You imagine, the world's tallest battlefield, where the temperature goes to minus 50-60 degrees minus
Oygen in the air is also the only name .
In such a opposite situation, it is not less than any opposite to live in such challenges.
In such a situation, our brave youngsters are not only protecting the borders of the country but also running clean Siachen campaigns there.
I appreciate them from the countrymen for this wonderful commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude
There ' s so cold that it's difficult to decompose anything.
In such a situation, separating and managing garbage is a very important task in itself.
In such a situation, removing 130 tons of waste from the glacier and its surrounding area and how big is the service between the ragile eco-system here
We all know that Siachen is a glacier that is a source of rivers and clean water, so it means ensuring clean water for those who live in lower areas.
Also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shayok
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival that awakens a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially in Diwali, buying something or the other new, bringing something from the market happens in small quantities in every family.
I once said that we should try - buy local things
If we need something from our village then there is no need to go to Tehsil .
If you meet in Tehsil then there is no need to go to the district
As much as we try to buy our local things, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I have been urging that our weavers are made of hands, our khadis are made of hands, we should buy something or something.
Even in this Diwali, you must have bought a lot before Diwali but there are many people who think that if you go after Diwali then perhaps you will get a little cheaper
There will be a lot of people who will still be bought .
So along with the best wishes of Deepawali, I would urge you to come and make us urge you to buy local things.
See, how important can we play in realizing the dream of Mahatma Gandhi
I once again extend my best wishes to you on the auspicious festival of Deepawali.
We use similar firecrackers in Diwali .
But, sometimes there is a fire in unconsciousness.
Somewhere it becomes injury
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great fervor.
My best wishes
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Can He control his own life and luck from it
Pujya Bapu can remember that Jantar
Can we think while buying what I am buying will benefit the citizens of my country
Today the whole country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this holy festival
The festival of Rakshabandhan is considered to be a symbol of brother and sister ' s love and faith .
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many such stories in the history of the country, in which a defense formula had linked people associated with two different states or religions to the door of faith.
Just a few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is going to come.
The entire environment is going to elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanhaiyalal, govinda-Govinda's jewellery.
The joy of swinging in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Apart from Raksha Bandhan , Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on Shravan Purnima .
I congratulate all those who are engaged in tolerating, riding and reaching this great heritage to the common man.
Every language has its own importance, India is proud of the fact that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world and all of us are proud of the fact that from Vedas to present, Sanskrit language has also played a very big role in the propagation of knowledge.
Knowledge related to every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature .
Whether it is science or technologies, agriculture or health, estronomy or architecture, mathematics or management, economics or environment, says that the mantra of dealing with the challenges of global warming is detailed in our Vedas.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Mattoor village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for talks .
You will be surprised to know one thing that Sanskrit is a language in which it is possible to create infinite words
Sometimes they use lions and lions but those who are familiar with Sanskrit auspicious people know that such an accurate statement happens with Sanskrit auspicious words and otherwise it is very easy to understand because they are associated with our soil and our traditions.
As has been asked to explain the importance of Guru in life - sometimes Akshramastu, Guru : disciples Prabodhyat
Let us all celebrate the coming Teachers Day with this spirit
The whole country celebrates his birth anniversary as Teachers Day .
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the coming Teachers Day and also congratulate you for your dedication to science, education and students.
The scorching trees and plants relieve the dry reservoirs, but sometimes it also brings excessive and destructive floods.
There is such a situation of nature that in some places there was more rain than other places
Flood in Kerala has badly affected people's life
Today the whole country stands with Kerala in these difficult conditions
Our condolences are with those families who have lost their lives, the loss of life cannot be compensated, but I want to assure the sorrowful families that 1.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural calamity will go to health as soon as possible.
I am sure that Kerala will soon be resurrected with the strength of the people of the state and with the indomitable courage .
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something at their own level so that wherever there is objection, whether it is Kerala or other districts of India or areas, the life of the people can be normal again.
All age groups and people associated with every workforce are contributing to their contribution.
Everyone is engaged in ensuring that the troubles of the people of Kerala can be done at least, we share their sorrows.
We all know that the Armed Forces are the heroes of the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala
They did not leave any stone unturned to save people trapped in floods
I want to specifically mention the hard work of NCR junkies
In this moment of crisis he has done a very good job .
Efforts to accommodate the situation by making their commitment and quick decisions have become a center of new faith for every Indian.
Yesterday was the festival of Onam, we will pray that the festival of Onam gives strength to the country and especially to Kerala so that they can recover from this calamity at the earliest and the development journey of Kerala gets more momentum.
Once again, I would like to assure the people of Kerala on behalf of all the countrymen and in other parts of the country where disaster has occurred, that the entire country is with them in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions that came to mind .
Then the topic on which the people of the country wrote most is the topic of all of us, Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapna Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, how many people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and on MyGov and urged me to talk about various aspects of Atal ji's life.
As soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise on August 16, everyone was immersed in mourning
A nation leader who left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago
In a way , for the last 10 years , he had gone far away from active politics .
They were not seen anywhere in the news, they did not see publicly
For the past several days, the best aspects of Atal ji have come to the country.
People remember him as a best MP, sensitive writer, best speaker, popular Prime Minister and do it
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act 2 Thusand Three
This change made two important changes in India's politics
First of all, the size of the Cabinet in the states was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limit fixed under the anti-party law was increased from one-third to two-thirds.
Along with this, clear guidelines have also been set to disqualify the parties.
For many years, the political culture of setting up of a huge cabinet in India was made to please the politicians not only for the distributing of the big jambo cabinet work.
Atal ji changed it
This step saved money and resources
Along with this, efficiency also increased
It was a long vision like Atal ji, who changed the situation and had a healthy tradition in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot
During his tenure only the time of presenting the budget was changed .
Earlier, according to the tradition of the British, the budget was presented at 5 o'clock in the evening as it was time for Parliament to start in London at that time.
In the year 2001, Atal ji changed the time to present the budget from 5 pm to 11 am
Several rules have been made in this code, which made it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places.
Because of this, more and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their national flag
Thus they brought our beloved tricolor near to the masses .
Similarly, nowadays you are seeing that discussions about the elections of the Center and the States together in the country are moving forward.
People in both sides of this subject and opposition are talking about themselves.
This is a good thing and a good sign for democracy too
I must say that for healthy democracy, developing good traditions for better democracy, striving for strengthening democracy, pursuing discussions with open mind, it will also be an excellent tribute to Atal ji.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfill his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I pay homage to Atal ji on behalf of all of us.
The monsoon session of Parliament has ended just a few days ago
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 74.
Arising above the party, all MPs tried to make the monsoon session more useful and consequently the Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and Rajya Sabha passed 14 bills
This monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of youth
Several important bills that benefit youth and backward communities were passed in this session
You all know that for decades, the demand for BC commission was going on like the SST commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country fulfilled the resolve to form the BC Commission this time and gave it a constitutional right.
This step will prove to be taking forward the objective of social justice
The work of passing the Amendment Bill to safeguard the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was done in this session.
This law will further protect the interests of the SC and ST community
It will also prevent criminals from torture and believe in Dalit communities
No civil society can tolerate any kind of injustice against the women ' s power .
The culprits of rape are not ready to tolerate the country, so Parliament has made the provision of harsh punishment by passing the Criminal Law Amendment Bill.
The culprits of misbehavior will be punished for at least 10 years, they will be punished for raping children below 12 years of age.
A few days ago , you must have read in the newspapers in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh , a court has sentenced two convicts of rape to death after just two months of hearing .
Earlier, a court in Katni of Madhya Pradesh punished the culprits after just five days of hearing
Rajasthan has also made such quick decisions by the courts there .
This law will play an effective role in preventing crime cases against women and girls .
Economic progress is incomplete without social change
Though this session of the Rajya Sabha has not been possible , I assure Muslim women that the whole country stands firmly with them to get justice .
When we move forward in the country, the life of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived can be changed.
In the monsoon session this time everyone has presented an ideal together .
These days, the attention of millions of countrymen is on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every morning, people first look at the newspapers, television, news, social media and see which Indian player has won medals.
Asian Games are still running
I want to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
My best wishes to those sportspersons who are still there
Indias sportspersons, especially in Shooting and Restalling, are performing excellently but our sportspersons are also bringing medals in those games in which our first performance has not been so good as sports like Ushu and Rowing - these are not medals - proofs - Indian sports and sportspersons touching the heavens and dreams.
Our daughters are among the medal winners for the country and this is a very positive sign - even among the young sportspersons who win medals are 15-16 years old.
It is also a very good sign that most of the sportspersons who have won medals are living in small towns and villages and they have achieved this success with hard work.
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day, I convey my best wishes to all sports lovers and also pay my tributes to Hockey's magician great sportsperson Shri Dhyanchand ji.
I urge all the citizens of the country to play and take care of their personalities as a healthy India will create a prosperous and prosperous India.
Once again I congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and wish the rest of the players a good performance.
Greetings to all of them on National Sports Day
Namaste Bhavti Ji, I respect your spirit.
We all have seen houses and buildings from brick stones, but can you imagine that about twelve-seven years ago, a huge mountain which was just a single stone mountain, was given the form of an excellent, large and wonderful temple - perhaps it was difficult to imagine, but it happened and that temple is - Kailashnath Temple located in Ellora of Maharashtra
If someone tells you that about a thousand years ago a pillar of granite was built more than 60 meters and a rock of granite about 80 tons was placed on its summit - would you believe
However, the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this universal mail of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the queen of the queen of the 11th century in Patan of Gujarat .
India ' s Land Engineering Laboratory
There have been many engineers in India who made unimaginable imaginable and presented miracles in the world of engineering
We also got a gem in our legacy of great engineers whose work is still amazing people and it was Bharat Ratna Dr. M. Vishwaswarya.
He is worshipped in that part of the country, the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and spirituality.
Remembering them on September 15 is made as an engineers Day .
The engineers of our country have made their own identity all over the world , following their position marks .
When I talk about the miracles of the world of engineering, I remember an incident of the terrible earthquake that had occurred in Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
When I used to work as a voluntary then I got the opportunity to go to a village and there I got the opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years of age and she was laughing at me and she was saying, Look, this is my house - I will say that this house has seen 3-3 earthquakes.
But there was no harm to you anywhere .
This house was built by our ancestors according to the nature of this place, according to the environment of this place and it was saying so proudly, so I thought that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had constructed according to the local conditions, due to which the public was safe.
Now, when we celebrate engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Workshops should be done at location
In the changing age what new things we have to learn
The world is battling natural calamities
So what is the new form of structural engineering
What are his courses
What should be taught to students
How could this become our priority
We must think of many such things when engineers celebrate the day
There is an atmosphere of festivals and also the preparations for Diwali start .
We will continue to meet in the matter of mind, keep talking about mind and we will continue to gather ourselves to pursue the country.
With this spirit, my best wishes to all of you
Thank you.
Then they will meet .
These days there are news of good rainfall in many places .
Somewhere there is news of concern due to more rains and some places still people are waiting for rains
India's vastness, diversity, sometimes rain shows the form of preference, but what do we blame the rain, it is a man who has chosen the path of struggle with nature and the result of it is that sometimes Nature turns on us.
And that is why it becomes the responsibility of all of us to be a lover of nature, we become a protector of nature, we become a promoter of nature, then the balance of nature remains on its own.
In the past, the incident of a natural calamity attracted the attention of the whole world, shocked the human mind.
All of you must have seen on TV, a team of 12 teen football players in Thailand and their coaches went to the cave to roam.
It takes usually a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But on that Day , the luck was more lucky .
When he went inside the cave , heavily heavily , due to heavy rains , a lot of water was frozen near the gate of the cave .
You can imagine when death appears in front of adolescents and if you have to spend moments then how will they be
On one hand, he was battling the crisis, on the other hand, humanity was uniting all over the world and expressing human properties of God.
People around the world were praying to evacuate these children safely
Whether it is the government, the parents of these children, their families, the media, the citizens of the country, everybody showed a wonderful conduct of peace and patience.
Everyone was engaged in his mission by becoming a team.
In this entire operation, a Thailand navy jawan also lost his life.
The whole world is surprising that in a dark cave filled with water , he did not leave his hope with such bravery and patience .
It shows that when humanity comes together, there are wonderful things.
We just need to focus on our goals with a calm and stable mind, keep working for it.
In the past, the dear poet of our country, Neeraj ji left us.
Neeraj ji had a special feature - hope, trust, determination, faith in himself
However , the months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth .
because this is the time when the colleges have a pack season
Millions of youngsters like Satyam leave school and go to colleges
If February and March go to Cams, Papers, Answers, then along with fun in April and May holidays, results and further directions in life are consumed in this thing.
July is the month when the youngsters keep their feet in the new phase of their life when they go away from the occupations to the cut-of.
The attention of the students goes from home to hostel
Students come into the shadow of professionals from the shadow of Parents
I am sure my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of life.
For the first time go out of the house, go out of the village, go out of the village, get out of a projective environment and make yourself a partner.
So many youngsters come out to give a new direction to their lives except their homes for the first time.
Many students will have joined their colleges so far, some will join.
I would like to say this to you that be peace, enjoy life, enjoy the inner joy of life.
There is no fodder without books, it has to be done, but there should be a tendency to find new things.
Old friends have their own valuable
Childhood friends are valuable, but selecting, creating and maintaining new friends, it is a great understanding in itself.
Learn some new, such as new skills, learn new languages
Young people who have left their homes and have gone out to discover those places, know about them, languages, cultures and tourist destinations there.
My best wishes to all the youngsters are starting a new innings
His father takes care of his family by taking garbage.
I congratulate them for their success .
There are so many students who are from the poor family and have done something with their hard work and passion due to the opposite conditions that inspires us all.
Betia Afreen Sheikh of Ahmedabad, whose father runs Auto Rickshaw, the daughter of Nagpur is happy, whose father is also a driver in the school bus or Kartik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand whose father wages in brick kiln
Khud Ramesh also used to sell toys in the fair or the Divya daughter of Gurgaon, Anushka Panda, who is suffering from a hereditary disease called Spinal Muscular Trophy since birth, all of them have achieved such success by crossing every obstacle by crossing the world with their determination and courage.
If we look around us , we will find many such examples .
Neeraj ji has said that the song is to recite the sky to the earth. I have to invite every darkness to the light. I have to head the sword with the smell of flowers. I have to awaken the mountains of singing and songs.
The incident was that once the San Jose City of the United States, which is known as Technology Cub, I was discussing with Indian youth.
I had appealed to them how they can use their talent for India, think and do something by taking time out.
I had appealed to convert brain-rain into brain-Gain
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have together prepared a SmartGaon App using their professional skills.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village to the whole world but now they can get any information and information on their own mobile itself .
The residents of Taudhakpur village of Rae Bareli, Village Prime Minister, District Magistrate, all people made aware of the people for the use of this app.
If you look at this incident closely then one thing will be noticed that the youth of the United States, the life of the country, the thinking and thinking of that place has left India several years ago but still knows the nuances of your village, understands the challenges and is connected to the village.
For this reason, he could probably make something according to what the village needs.
This connectivity with your village, its roots and the feeling of doing something for the vatan is naturally within every Indian .
But sometimes due to time, sometimes due to distances, sometimes due to ecological conditions, there is a light ashes on it, but if a small spark is touched then all the things come up once again and they bring towards their past days.
We should also check if this has not happened even in our cases, conditions, situations and distances have not separated us anywhere.
Thank you very much for your phone all
In fact Pandharpur Wari is a wonderful journey in itself .
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadshi, who was on 23rd July this time, is also celebrated as a grand culmination of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a holy city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15 - 20 days before Ashadhi Ekadshi i . . pilgrimage goes on foot with the parlors to visit Pandharpur .
This journey, which is called Warrie, includes millions of warriors.
Sants like Gyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram go towards Pandharpur by placing in the palanquin, singing, playing, playing pedestrians.
Pilgrimage travellers reach there for their philosophy of Lord Vithal who is also called Vithova or Pandurang .
God protects the interests of the poor, the deprived, the victims.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have immense faith and devotion.
Going to Vithova temple in Pandharpur and its glory, beauty and spiritual joy have a different experience .
I urge the audience of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandharpur Wari once I get the opportunity.
Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram - countless saints are still educating people in Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against blindness and this saint has been inspiring in every corner of India .
We get an important message of goodwill, love and brotherhood.
It is a mantra of society to fight against blindness .
These were those people who prevented the society from time to time, showed tokens and mirror and ensured that old evils should end from our society and compassionate compassion, equality and purity among the people.
Our Indo-Bhoomi Multiratna Vasundhara is such a great tradition of saints in our country, in the same way, the great men dedicated to Maa-Bharati have brought this land to their lives, dedicated to it.
One such great man is Lokmanya Tilak who has left a deep impression in the minds of many Indians .
We remember the birth anniversary of Tilak ji on July 23 and his death anniversary on August 01.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence
They had the power and wisdom of showing the mirror of their mistakes to the British rulers .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he tried to impose sedition three times in 20 years, and this is not a small thing.
I, Lokmanya Tilak and an interesting event associated with a statue of him in Ahmedabad today.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October, 1916, more than 40,000 people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad about a hundred years ago and during the visit, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with him and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was extremely impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on 1st August, 1920, he had decided that he would make his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and immediately he chose Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak and this Victoria Garden was named after the ueen of Britain.
Finally, the statue was prepared and Sardar Saheb inaugurated it not from anyone but on February 28, 1929 - it was a matter of great joy and in that inauguration ceremony, in that inauguration ceremony, worshipped Bapu said that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipality has not only got one person but also got the courage that has led to the construction of Tilak ji's statue.
And my dear countrymen, the specialty of this statue is that it is a rare idol of Tilak in which he is sitting on a chair, it is written right below Tilak. Swaraj is our birth right and I am listening to this period of the British.
The tradition of public Ganesh Festival started with the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji .
Public Ganesh Festival became an effective medium for traditional reverence and festivals as well as social awareness, collectivity, harmony and equality among the people.
At the same time it was a period when the country was united to fight against the British, these festivals broke the barriers of caste and community and worked to unite everyone.
Popularity of these events increased over time
This shows that our ancient legacy and history are still crawled in our younger generations.
Today in many cities it happens that you get to see Ganesh - Pandal in almost every street .
It is also an excellent opportunity for our youth, where they can learn qualities like leadership and organisation, they can develop within themselves.
I had requested the last time too and when I am remembering Lokmanya Tilak ji, I would once again urge you to celebrate the Ganesh festival this time too, celebrate it with joy and joy but urge you to celebrate the eco friendly Ganesh festival.
From the idol of Ganesh ji to the idol of Sajjjaya, everything is eco friendly and I would like to see that there are different competitions of the eco friendly Ganesh festival in every city, they should be rewarded and I would like to see that on the MyGov and on the Narendra Modi App, the things of eco friendly Ganesh Utsav should be kept for wide publicity.
I ' ll surely bring your word to the people .
Lokmanya Tilak awakened confidence in the countrymen , he gave a slogan Swaraj is our birth rights and we will continue to take it .
Today it is time to say that Swaraj is our birth rights and we will continue to take it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and good results of development
I ' m talking about Chandrashekhar Azad
Who will be such a young man in India who will not be inspired by listening to these lines, Sarfaroshi's desire is now in our hearts, see how strong it is, how many lines have inspired many youngsters like Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad
Chandrasekhar Azad's bravery and his passion for freedom, it inspired many youths
Azad put his life on claim, but he never bowed in front of foreign rule
It was my privilege that I had the privilege of going to Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh .
Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad also got the opportunity to pay homage and pay homage and Chandrashekhar Azad ji was the brave men who did not want to die with the bullets of foreigners - if they live, fight and die, even then they will die freely.
Once again I bow down to two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji
Just a few days ago, a 400-meter race in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Inland, India's brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das has made history by winning the Gold Medal.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhaiyan, in response to my letter, has emailed me from Indonesia and is now preparing for ASEAN Games there.
The unity in Mail writes that the most important moment in the life of any athlete is that when he catchs the tricolor and I am proud that I have done that.
Unity we all are proud of you
You have illuminated the name of the country
Unity in World Para Athletics Grand Pri 2018 wins Gold and Brone Medal in Tunisia
His achievement is special because he made his challenge the medium of his success .
In 2003, due to road accident, half of the lower part of his body failed, but this daughter did not lose courage and made it strong.
Another Divya Yogesh Kathunia ji, he has won the Gold Medal in Discus Throu in Para Athletics Grand Pri in Berlin and along with him, Sunder Singh Gurjar has also won the Gold Medal in Javelin.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is full of several events of history, festivals, but due to weather sometimes the disease also enters the house.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for the inspiration of patriotism, for the month of August and for several centuries of festivals.
Then surely they shall meet for the matter of mind .
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, once again I have got the opportunity to be with you all in this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
Just a few days ago a historic cricket match took place in Bengaluru
You must have understood that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan
It was Afghanistan's first international match and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India
In this match, both the teams performed the best and another baller of Afghanistan Rashid Khan this year.
I remember that Afghan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani had tagged me on his twitter and the people of Afghanistan were very proud of his hero Rashid Khan
I am also grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan .
He is the essence of the world of cricket and at the same time he didn't even write it in a joyful manner. We are not going to give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable for all of us
Well this was the first match so it ' s very natural to remember but I ' ll remember this match for a particular reason
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world
What can a winner team do while taking the trophy
- While taking the trophy, the team of Afghanistan, which was playing the international match for the first time, invited the team of Afghanistan and the two teams took photographs together
What happens to sportsman spirit, what happens to sportsmanship - we can experience from this one incident
Sports is an exemplary way to unite society and find the talent of our youth.
My dear countrymen, this 21st June was a different view on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world looked united
Be it the European Parliament in Brussels, the headquarter of the United Nations in New York, the Japanese Navy fighter ships, people from all over the world have seen Yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic programme of Yoga and I am told that many asanas were demonstrated by women.
On the high snowy peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China exercise together
Yoga works to break, connect all the boundaries
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries went beyond caste, religion, region, color or sex and made this opportunity a very big festival.
If people from all over the world were participating in Yoga Day programmes so excited then why would it not be multiplied in India
Our warriors of the Air Force have embarrassed everyone by doing yoga at a height of 15 thousand feet from the earth in the middle of the sky.
The sight to see was that they swimming in the air, not sitting in the air
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or fields of sports, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
Yoga has worked to unite the people of the world by going beyond caste, creed and geography. The feelings of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have lived for centuries
Our Rishi, Muni, Sant, who always emphasizes, Yoga has shown it in the right sense.
Maximum people will make it a part of their life .
Many people on MyGov and Narendra ModiApp have written to me that I should talk about the Cocktors Day coming on July 1 in this matter of mind - the right thing is
We are those people who naturally worship the mother as God, believe that God is equal to God because mother gives us life, mother gives us birth, many times the doctor gives us the birth.
The role of the doctor is not limited to treating diseases only .
Today, the doctor has a medical expertise as well as has a deep experience about the general lifestyle trends and what it affects our health.
Indian doctors have identified their capabilities and skills all over the world
In the medical process, along with hardworking, our doctors are known for solving the entire medical problems.
We are fortunate people who have been born in this land of India
India has a prosperous history, when there is no such month, there is no such day in which no historical event has occurred.
See then everywhere in India has its own heritage
There is a saint associated with it, a great man, a famous person, everybody has his own contribution, his greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that I am coming to Magahar on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, you know that Kabirvad of Gujarat is very well.
When I used to work there, I also made a big national session of the people associated with the tradition of a saint Kabir.
You know why Kabirdas ji had gone to Magahar
At that time there was a perception that who died in Magahar does not go to heaven
On the contrary, the body that sacrifices in Kashi goes to heaven
Magahar was considered absurd but saint Kabirdas did not believe in it .
He did the work of breaking the same evils and superstitions of his time and hence they went forgotten and they took the tomb .
Sant Kabirdas ji laid emphasis on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his credibility and dilemma
These were their ideals
In his compositions we get to see this ideal and even in today ' s age they are as inspiring .
Meaning the true Pir Sant is the one who knows and understands the pain of others, who do not know the sorrow of others, they are intimate.
Kabirdas ji gave special emphasis on social harmony .
They thought a lot ahead of their time .
Please put it on you, please all Koy
In another double, Kabir writes - where there is mercy and religion, where greed and sin
He said: - Do not ask caste, seek knowledge
This is the glory of Guru and such a Guru, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev
Those who showed glory to the Koti-Koti people, kept inspiring for centuries
Guru Nanak Dev used to say the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God .
Wherever they went , they took several initiatives for the good of the society .
The system of kitchen free from social discrimination where a person from every caste, creed, religion or community could eat food and eat only Guru Nanak Dev started this anchor system.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji to be celebrated in 2019
I want all of us associated with enthusiasm and zeal .
I urge you people to think about the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji, how to celebrate it in the entire society and in the entire world, what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas are there, we should think about it and prepare it with great pride and make it a festival of inspiration.
My dear countrymen
Indias freedom struggle is very long, is very wide, is very deep and is full of countless royalties.
There is another history associated with Punjab
In 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh, which embarrassed the entire humanity.
How can we remember the 100 years of this incident, how can we all think about it, but remember the immortal message that this incident has given, this violence and cruelty can never be solved by any problem
Victory is always of peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice
Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that on July 6, it is the birthday of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and he wants to talk to the countrymen about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this program.
Raman ji first thank you very much
Looking at your interest in the history of India, it was very good
You know, yesterday was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23
Very few people would know that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation at the University of Kolkata in Bengali language
This was the first time that the British ruled and somebody at the University of Kolkata addressed the convocation in Bengali language.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industrial Minister of India and in a sense he had laid the foundation stone for Indias industrial development, prepared a strong base and prepared a strong platform.
Dr. Mukherjee's dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every field.
He wanted India to develop big industries as well as pay full attention to MSMEs, handlooms, textiles and cottage industries.
He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal
Their understanding, discretion and activism is the result of a part of Bengal being saved and it is still a part of India
For Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India - and for this, he lost his life at the age of 52.
We always remember the message of unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, along with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood, keep in mind for the progress of India.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video call.
Going beyond the files, they got the opportunity to know about the changes in the livelihood of the people.
People told about their resolve, their happiness and grief, their achievements
I believe that it was not just a government programme for me but it was a different kind of learning experience and what could be the moment of great satisfaction from the happiness that was seen on the faces of people during this period
When he listened to the stories of a common man (human) his nice words of his experience, what he was saying, touched the heart.
Betia Common Service Centre in remote villages is providing services from pension to passports of the elderly of the villages.
When a sister of Chhattisgarh collects Sitafal and makes a business by making her face-cream
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of young people of the country are running medicine centers as well as providing cheap medicines in nearby villages.
At the same time, a young man from West Bengal is looking for a job two to three years ago and now he is only doing his successful business.
Not only that, ten to fifteen people are also giving more jobs
Students from the school of Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management at the school's Tinkering Lab at their young age.
Do not know how many stories were there in the country there will be no corner of the country where people do not have to talk about their success
In such an environment, when the common man (Human) comes with new hope, new zeal and incidents in his life, he is not credited with the government.
The incident of a small girl from a remote village also becomes an inspiration for 1.25 crore countrymen.
With the help of technology for me, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very pleasant and very inspiring and it gives satisfaction to work but also gets the enthusiasm to do more.
Another new joy of living for the poorest of the poor, another new zeal, another new inspiration.
I am very grateful to the countrymen
40-40, 50-50 lakh people are associated with this video bridge programme and you have worked to give me a new strength.
I want to thank you all once again
I always feel that if we look around us, something is good somewhere else.
There are people who do good
We can also experience the aroma of goodness
In the past one thing came to me and this is a very unique combination .
On the one hand, where professionals and engineers are there, on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters associated with farming are working in the field.
They have formed a simple prosperity trust in collaboration with the T engineers and they have activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
He joined the farmers, made schemes and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers.
Farmers who produce grains are also associated with it .
On the one hand, farmers have a key role in the entire chain from crop product to marketing and on the other hand, efforts are made to ensure farmers participation in profits.
Several Seed-Banks have been set up for crops, good breed seeds for them.
Women see the work of this sea-bank, women have also been added.
I congratulate these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, technology, engineering have taken the way out of their scope to join the farmers, join the village, join the fields and treasures.
Once again, the younger generation of my country, their innovative experiments, perhaps what I have to visit, something I have to go, some people will know, nothing will be known but the people of Koti-Koti are doing something or the other.
GST is going to complete one year. The dream of the people of the country was one nation, one tax. It has changed into reality today.
For this, if I have to give credit to anyone, I will give credit to the states.
GST is an excellent example of cooperative federalism where all the states together decided in the country and then such a big tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of GST Council have been held and we can all proud that people from different political ideology sit there, people from different states are sitting there, states with different priority but despite this, whatever decisions have been taken in GST Council have been made so far, they have been made unanimously all over the world.
Prior to GST, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is applicable to the entire country.
GST is the victory of honesty and is also a festival of honesty
In the first country, there were complaints of Inspector Raj in case of taxation.
Everything from Return to Frend is through online information technology
The coming of GST has ended the check post and the movement of goods has accelerated, which not only saves the time but also benefits the logistics sector.
GST will probably be the world's largest tax reform
Such a big tax reform in India has been successful because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST can be ensured only through the manpower.
Normally it is believed that such a large reform, such a large country, such a large population takes 5 to 7 years to be completely stable but the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the festival of honesty is a result of the participation of the people of the country that within a year, this new tax system has created its place, has achieved stability and it also improves through its inbuilt system as per the requirement.
Once again you have got the opportunity to be the best of the mindset .
You will be well remembered by 6 women commanders of the navy, these teams have been on a journey to the sea for the past several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama - i want to talk about them
These six daughters of India, their team, more than 2ndread and City of our Days, through sea for more than 250 days.
NS Tarini has returned to India on 21st May and the whole country welcomed him very warmly
He travelled in various oceans and many oceans and set a distance of about twenty thousand natural miles.
It was one of the first incidents in the world itself .
On Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters and listen to their experiences.
I once again congratulate these daughters for enhancing their adventure, Navy's prestige, to increase India's respect and respect, especially the world that India's daughters are not less.
Who does not know the sense of adventure
If we see the development journey of humankind then progress has arisen in the womb of some new adventure.
Development takes birth only in the lap of adventure
I can do something, I can do something, I can do something, these feelings are less, but for ages, Koti-Koti people continue to get inspiration.
On May 16, 5 tribal children from an ashram-school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra tribal students Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam, a group of our tribal children climbed the world's highest peak
These students of Ashram-School started training in August 2017, Vardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh, Ladakh - they were trained.
These youngsters were selected under Mission Shaurya and they have glorified the entire country by finishing the best in line with the name.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Chandrapur School, these young friends.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to win Verest from Nepal
Best congratulations to daughter Shivangi
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Dia became the pair of the first Indian father-son to climb Verest
It is not that only the youth are climbing Verest.
Sangeeta Bahal climbed Verest on 19th May and Sangeeta Bahal is more than 50 years old .
This work is not only commendable but also reflects his commitment to cleanliness, towards the environment.
For years, people have been climbing Verest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these brave heroes and daughters of Khaskar.
A large number of people from every region will come forward in its support.
Whenever I talk about it in India, I believe that the country will play as much as we will play.
On social media, people are sharing the video of the Utness Challenge, taging each other and challenging them.
Many times you have heard some things about the games and the players and some things about me and last time our heroes of the Commonwealth Games, our mindsets were telling us through this programme - Namaskar Sir
Image Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that the games that were sometimes a part of the lives of every child are decreasing today
These games were particularly part of the summer holidays .
Yes, it may be that in different places they were known by different names, as now Pittu is known by many names.
Nobody knows how many names are Lagori, Satolia, Seven stones, Dicori, Satodia
There are two types of games in traditional games .
There are also outdoor, indoor too.
The unity hidden behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games .
The same game is known as different places, different names
I am from Gujarat I know that there is a game in Gujarat, which is called Chomal-Isto
It is played with codes or imli seeds or dice and with the Sure Board of 88 .
This game was played in almost every state
We used to do this game too
Who will be among us, who has not played a balloon in childhood
Gilli-Danda is a game played from village to cities
In different parts of the country it is known by different names .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla .
In Orissa it is called Gulibari and in Maharashtra it is called fiscal .
Some games have their own season
You must have seen many children, who are embarrassed, but they become very stunned while playing.
From children to grandmother, grandmother, grandmother and grandmother when they play all these things, they say no generation gap, they are also touched.
At the same time we also know our culture and traditions.
Many sports also make us aware of society, environment etc.
We can make a very big architecture of our traditional sports by crowd sourcing
Videos of these sports can be created which can be shown about the rules of sports, the way of playing.
On June 5, our country will officially host India on World Environment Day
It is a very important achievement for India and it is a significance of Indias growing leadership in the world to reduce climate change.
This time theme is Bet Plastic Pollution
Recognizing the importance of this theme, I appeal to all of you, let us ensure that we do not use polythene, low grades plastic and try to reduce a negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on wild life and on our health.
Go to the website wed-India 2018 of World Environment Day and there all suggestions have been given very interestingly - see, learn and try to bring them into their daily life.
In the last few weeks, we all saw that dust in different areas of the country, there was heavy rainfall along with strong winds, which is unseasonal.
There was also loss of life, loss of goods
We have to live in harmony with nature, live with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated every step throughout his life.
When India played a key role in the OP21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the entire world through the International Solar Alliance, then all of them had a sense of fulfilling that dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this Environment Day, let us all think about what can we do to make our plan clean and green
How can you move forward in this direction
Can you innovate
My dear countrymen and my young friends, especially
You remember the 21st of June now, not only you, but the whole world remembers 21st June.
21st June is celebrated as International Yoga Day for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparations months ago.
These days, there is a lot of preparations for celebrating International Yoga Day on June 21 all over the world.
Several centuries ago, it means that by doing regular yoga practice some good qualities are like friends and friends.
Yoga creates courage which always protects us like a father .
The feeling of forgiveness arises as the mother is for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend .
Bharatrihari has said that by doing regular yoga the truth becomes our child, mercy our sister, self-confidence our brother, the earth itself becomes our bed and knowledge eradicating our hunger.
When so many qualities become a companion of someone , the Yogi wins all kinds of fear .
Once again I appeal to all the countrymen to pursue their legacy of Yoga and create a healthy, prosperous and harmonious nation.
Today is 27th May the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji
I salute Pandit ji
The memory of this month of May is also related to another thing and that is Veer Savarkar
This was the month of May in 1857 when Indians showed their strength to the British
In many parts of the country, our youth and farmers stood up in protest against injustice while showing their bravery.
It is sad that for a long time we have been calling the incidents of 1857 only rebellion or soldier rebellion
In fact , that incident was not only reduced , but it was also an attempt to push our pride .
It is also a wonderful coincidence that in the month when the first freedom struggle began, Veer Savarkar ji was born in the same month.
Savarkar ji ' s personality was full of features .
A wonderful description about Savarkar ji has been done by our dear respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji .
How exactly did Atal ji depict
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together
Being a sensitive poet, he was also adventurous revolutionary
I was watching a story on T.V. of our poor daughters of the raw settlements of Sikar in Rajasthan.
Our daughters, who were ever forced to buy garbage and ask for households - today they are learning the work of sewing and clothing to cover the poor.
The daughters here, today, apart from the clothes of their family, are silly from normal to good clothes.
They are also courses of skill development along with this.
Our daughters are self-reliant today, living their life with respect and have become a power for their families.
I extend my best wishes to our daughters full of hope and confidence for their bright future.
He has shown that if you are responsible for doing something and you are committed to it then success can be achieved among all the difficulties and this is not just a matter of Siker and in every corner of India you will get to see all this .
If you look at yourself, you will be careful about how people lose problems.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy tea there, there is also discussion and discussion with some people.
These discussions are also political, social, cinema, sports and sportspersons, the problems of the country and the problems of the country should be solved. But often these things are limited to discussions but there are some people who move forward to bring about changes from their work, their hard work and passion.
A similar story of the dreams of others who have made their own dreams and to fulfil them, D. Prakash Rao, who lives in the slums of Cuttack city of Orissa
Yesterday I got the privilege of meeting D. Prakash Rao
Shriman D. Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades
They arrange education, health and food for all children coming to school.
I convey my best wishes to D. Prakash Rao for his hard work, his passion and a new direction to the life of those poor children.
They have destroyed the darkness of their life .
His life is a motivation for all of us, for society and for the entire country.
Let us move forward positiveness
There is so much heat in the month of June that people wait for rain and in this hope they look at the clouds in the sky .
A few days later, people will also wait for the moon
Moon showing means that Eid can be celebrated .
After a month of fasting during Ramadan the festival of Eid is a symbol of the beginning of the celebration .
I am sure that all the people will celebrate Eid with full zeal, the children will get specially a good edition.
I hope the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bond of goodwill in our society
Greetings to everyone
My dear countrymen, Thank you very much.
Once again next month you will meet in mind
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
V.
I am glad that people are connecting with it with great zeal have written to me by showing their support for this, letters have been sent to me, your personal mantra on social media is also shared by a glorious Shri Shashikant Bhosle, while sharing a picture of the swimming pool.
Ruma Devnath writes that from morning walk I feel happy and healthy and she further says - for my personalities come with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy.
Make these holidays an opportunity for a new experience, my dear countrymen.
When we hear that in the future there are wars about water in the world , everybody speaks this , but is there any responsibility for us
Do we not think that water conservation should be this social responsibility
That is, the responsibility of the person who has knowledge is that I do not know the Bengali language with the curiosity, but when I was small, I had a habit of getting up very soon - from childhood and in eastern India Radio starts soon, if west India starts from late then in the morning I guess it is thick and big.
Rabindra Music started at 30 o'clock in the morning, and I did not know the habit of Rabindra Music on the radio early in the morning and when I got the opportunity to listen to these poems, when I got the opportunity to listen to these poems, I would have been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.

Once again I convey my best wishes to you all
My dear countrymen, like every time, I have received all the letters, emails, phone calls and comments from all of you in large quantities.
Soft Thakkar ji on MyGov - I read what you wrote about starting on-line courses of Sanskrit
Besides being a professional, it was very good to see your love for Sanskrit.
I have asked the concerned department to provide you information about the efforts being made on this side .
The audience of Mann Ki Baat, who works about Sanskrit, will also request them to consider how to move forward the suggestion of Komal ji.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Barakar, District Nalanda, Bihar - Your Comments on Narendra Modi App read
The concern that you have expressed on the decreasing water level in the land is definitely very important.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals and birds in summers .
Shakal ji, I have delivered your feelings to all the audience.
Mr. Yogesh Bhadresha ji, he says that this time I talk to the youth about his health.
They feel that if we compare the ASEAN Countries then our youth are physically welcomed.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time I should talk to everyone about health in detail - it is.
Shri Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of that journey were about to touch the mind and were about to create an impact.
And, he had urged them to propagate all photographs, all video, social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had shared those photographs on the same day on social media and Narendra Modi App.
Angah, Jayesh, I want to tell you all the children that these letters give me the fatigue of my day.
So many letters, so many phone calls, comments, whatever I have read, whatever I have heard and there are many things that have touched my mind - even if I talk about them then I will have to say something continuously for months.
This time most of the letters belong to children who wrote about Jeam
Your plans of holidays, shared
Worried about the water of animals and birds in summer
There have been letters of farmers brothers and sisters about the activities being undertaken across the country for farmers and farming.
Some active citizens of water conservation have sent suggestions
Our festivals, our culture and our traditions come in the festival season.
That is, things of mind change with weather and perhaps it is also true that things of our mind change the weather in someone's life.
And why not change
It has the power to change the weather of the whole country .
13 years ago, due to lack of treatment on time, the sister of Saidul Laskar of Kolkata died - she decided to build a hospital so that no poor person dies due to lack of treatment
Sadul sold house ornaments in his mission, collected money through donation
In this way, after 12 years of collection of money, the Bhagirathi efforts made by Sadul Laskar brought the color and today due to his hard work, his resolve is ready to become a hospital with a capacity of approximately 30 beds in Punri village near Kolkata.
Many such inspirations introduce my country .
Today, in every section of the country, in the youth, in women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, every section of the society has awakened the confidence that yes.
We can move forward, our country can move forward
There is a positive atmosphere of confidence full of hopes and hopes.
This self-confidence, this positivity will realise our resolve of New India and will prove our dream.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devilal ji - everyone considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and common life of the country.
What kind of love Mahatma Gandhi had with soil, fields and farmers, this feeling reflects in his line when he had said that if we forget to dig to the forget house, then it is like forgetting ourselves.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri used to often emphasize the need for trees, plants and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of mass awareness to ensure better income, better irrigation facilities and ensuring food and milk production for our farmers.
This State with less area has done a big job .
Our farmers of Meghalaya have record yielded over the last five years during 2015-16.
He has shown that when the goal is fixed, the courage is strong and if there is a resolve in the mind then it can be proved and shown by it.
In the letters I had received, I was seeing that a lot of farmers had written about MSP and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to provide proper prices to the farmers.
It has been decided that MSP for notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times of their cost.
Efforts are being made to connect the local markets of the village, the Holissale Market and then the global market.
Farmers do not have to go too far to sell their produce - for this, 22 thousand rural haats of the country will be integrated with APM and e-NAM platform while upgrading with infrastructure.
That is, in a way, connectivity with any market of the country is being created from the field.
My dear countrymen, this year the festival of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will start.
How can the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is our resolve, apart from this, how can one and a half million countrymen pay the best tribute to Gandhiji
I urge you all to share your views on this through MyGov.
What is the logo of Gandhi 150
What is the slogan or mantra or ghost-wise
Give your suggestions about this
Together, we all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and inspire him to bring our country to new heights.
Tell us something about how institutions are mobilising. Thanks. Thanks, you have said the right thing and I believe that both Swachh Bharat and Healthy India are complementary to each other.
Today the country has moved ahead of the conventional approach in the field of health.
Every work related to the health sector in the country was already responsible for the health ministry, now all the departments and ministries, whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Health and Certilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs or Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments are working together and emphasis is being laid on the healthcare as well as on the healthcare.
Preventive healthcare is also the cheapest and the easiest.
And as much as we are aware of the preventive healthcare, the family and the society will also benefit.
The first requirement for life to be healthy is cleanliness .
Yoga has recognised its identity worldwide as a preventive healthcare.
Yoga guarantees both fitness and wellness.
This is the result of all of us's commitment that Yoga has become a mass movement today and has reached home.
This time International Day of Yoga is 21st June - between it there are less than 100 days left .
On the last three International Yoga Days, everywhere in the country and the world, people took part in it with great enthusiasm.
This time also we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends, all for Yoga from now on.
My dear countrymen, I am not Yoga Teacher
I will share this video with you all so that we can practice asanas, pranayamas along with us.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level for healthcare accessible and affordable , cheap and accessible to the common man .
Today more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are being provided at a low cost.
More new centers are being opened
I appeal to the audience of Mann Ki Baat to provide information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras - their expense of many medicines will be reduced .
They will have a very big service
The cost of heart stent for heart diseases has been reduced to 85.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts
The country has set a target to make TB free by 2025
It ' s a big job
You need help in awakening to the people.
To get rid of TB, we all have to make collective efforts.
My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
The industry was an effective medium for them in which employment could be made available to the poorest of the poor.
Today, India has emerged as a broad spot in the global economy and today the world's largest Foreign Direct Infrastructure.
The entire world sees India as a BC for investment innovation and development
This was the idea that the development of industries would be possible in cities, due to which Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar relied on the urbanization and urbanization of India.
The Smart Cities Mission and Urban Mission was launched in the country today to provide all kinds of facilities in the big cities and small towns of the country - be it good roads, water facilities, health facilities, education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had a firm faith in self-reliance, self-reliance
They did not want a person to live his life in poverty .
At the same time, he also believed that by giving only some shares to the poor, their poverty could not be overcome.
India, Stand up India initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators, young entrepreneurs.
During the 1930s and 1940s, when there was talk of roads and railways only in India, Babasaheb Ambedkar talked about ports and waterways.
This was Dr. Baba Saheb who saw the water power as a nation-power.
Today, historical efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on different sea shores of India and infrastructure is being strengthened on old ports.
During the 40 decades, most of the discussions were about 2nd World War, Emerging Old-Ar and Division - Dr. Ambedkar in a way.
The foundation of India's spirit was laid.
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism and stressed on working together with the Centre and States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism in every aspect of governance and the most important thing is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people like me associated with backward classes.
He has shown us that in order to move forward, it is not necessary that the elderly or any rich family is born, but the people born in poor families in India can see their dreams, try to fulfill those dreams and also achieve success.
Yes, it happened when many people joked Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar
India which belongs to Ambedkar, belongs to the poor, is from the backward.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organized from 14th April to 5th May on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar
Under this, there will be various programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across India.
My, I urge you all to take part in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, many festivals will come in the next few days, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi
The day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance .
The life of Lord Mahavir ji, the messenger of non-violence, will inspire us all.
Greetings to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti
As soon as the discussion of the Easter comes, the inspirational teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ are remembered who have always given humanity the message of peace, goodwill, justice, mercy and compassion.
In April, the festival of Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India, in the same days, there will be joy and joy of Poila Vaisakh in West Bengal.
All these festivals are connected to our fields and fields and foodgrains in some form, through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts received as a producer.
Once again greet all of you on the occasion of all the festivals
Initially starts talking about mind from a phone call.
We have seen that the color of the sea is blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water .
Have we ever thought that the river, the sea, the water becomes colorful
This question came in the mind of a young man in the 1920s .
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India
When we talk of science, the name of India-Ratna Sir CV Raman comes in front of us.
One of his foods is famous by the name of Raman Effect .
We celebrate National Science Day every year on 28th February as it is said that on this day he had done the job of light scattering for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science .
On one hand there has been a tradition of great mathematician Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta and on the other hand Sushruta and Charak are our pride in the field of medicine .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are the pride of India.
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, the name of Jamus Particle Boson was also named
It was interesting to know about the miracles that are happening in the field of science.
Nowadays machines are made more smart by self-learning.
Can anyone help farmers with crop yields
In the past, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had the opportunity to visit Gujarat, Ahmedabad for the inauguration of the IDF Reate.
Science and Technology are value neutrals
These values are not yourself.
Any machine will work as we want
But, it depends on us what we want to do with the machine
Thomas Alva Dison, who invented the High Bulb, failed many times in his experiments
Once he was asked about this, he replied, I have discovered ten thousand ways of not making a High Bulb, i.e. Dison also made his failures his power.
It is fortunate that today I am in the karmabhoomi of Maharishi Arabindo Auroville
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
Find the answer and show the path of humanity
The feeling of repeatedly asking questions to know the truth is important
This is the real inspiration behind the scientific dose .
You should not sit calmly until you get answers to questions like why, what and how
I congratulate all our scientists and scientists on the occasion of National Science Day.
Friends, During the Crisis, on all these issues, I have a lot of messages and people keep writing something or the other.
From Pune, Mr. Ravindra Singh has spoken on Cooperational Safety at his conference on Narendra Modi Mobile App
He has written that safety standards on factories and constructions sites are not so good in our country.
On the next 4th of March, India has a National Safety Day, the Prime Minister should talk about safety in his Mann Ki Baat program so that awareness about safety among the people is increased.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, we are unable to achieve it then it becomes difficult to get it during the disaster.
We all read the bords written on the roads many times, it says that the vigilance has come down, one forgets the loss, sneezing happiness and smile - do not leave the world so soon, do not add the relationship with security - no fun, no fun, no fun, no life will be affordable.
If we are cautious, follow the necessary rules, we can protect our lives, but we can save the society from very big accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that a lot of formulas have been written about the safety on the work place but whenever we see it, it does not see anywhere.
As far as disasters are concerned, Disasters are concerned, India is a country full of diversity in terms of geographical and climate.
This country has suffered many proactive and human-made disasters such as chemical and industrial accidents.
Initiative of Disaster Mitra has also been taken for training of volunteers in the affected districts of flood, cyclone.
Training and awareness have a very important role
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year from Loo Heat Wave
After this, NMA organised workshops for the management of Heatwave, launched a campaign to create awareness among the people.
A good result came out with everyone's participation
In 2017, the number of deaths due to Lu decreased unexpectedly to around 220.
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can get security
I would like to appreciate all those who work in such a way in the society, be social organisations, be aware citizens, who are engaged in relief and rescue operations anywhere.
And the number of such anonymity heroes is no less
We have to become a risk conscience society
In our culture, we often talk about the safety of values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of values of security.
We have to make it a part of our life
I mean , what was the arrangement for giving information
Why
Because we are not conscientious with nature and therefore our ears are listening after the airplanes are sitting but this information is for me.
We have the same experience in every field of life
We do not think that safety is for anyone else, if we all become aware of our safety then the feeling of safety of the society is also implicated.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, emphasis was laid on making waste to health and waste to energy for villages under Swachh Bharat through biogas.
Initiative for this was initiated and named as GBAR-Han-Galvaniing Arganic Bio-Agro Resources
The objective of this GBAR-HAN scheme is to make villages clean and convert solid waste layers of cattle and fields into MPST and BI-GAS, to generate money and energy.
Some European countries and China use dung and other organic wastes of animals to produce energy but its full capacity was not being used in India
We are now moving forward in this direction under Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen
The goal of using cattle dung, waste from agriculture, waste from kitchen, all of them to make biogas based energy has been set.
Under Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to look at dung and waste not just as waste but as a source of income.
Gobar Dhan Yojana will help rural areas to get many benefits to keep the village clean
Animal Husbandry will be better and productivity will increase
Biogas will increase self-reliance in the matter of energy for cooking and lifting
Farmers and Animal Husbandry will help in increasing income
New jobs will get opportunities for West Collection, Transportation, Biogas sales etc.
An online trading platform will also be created for smooth system of Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect farmers with buyers so that farmers get the right price of dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially my sisters living in rural India to take full advantage of this opportunity by creating self help groups and cooperative societies.
I invite you to become a partner of this movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs to transform the waste into health and take initiatives to make cow dung from cow dung.
My dear countrymen, till date we have been listening to music festivals, food festivals, film festivals.
But the first waste festival of the state was organised while making a unique effort in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
The objective behind this festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about the creativity of the city's waste and create awareness about various ways of re-use of the carbage.
During this festival, there was a variety of activity in which everybody from students to elders participated.
Different art works were made using waste .
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of the East Management
Inspired by Raipur, different types of garbage festivals were also held in other districts.
Everyone innovative ideas, shares, discussions, poems were read about sanitation while taking initiatives from their respective sides.
A festive atmosphere was created about cleanliness
Especially the way schoolchildren participated, it was wonderful.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which the importance of East Management and Sanitation was displayed in this festival.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on 8th March.
There are many programmes in the country and the world
On this day women are also encouraged by the Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country who have done exemplary work in different fields in the past .
I remember Swami Vivekanandas promise on this occasion .
He said that this idea of Swamiji, 25 years ago, expresses the contemplation of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life that is our responsibility.
We are part of the tradition where men were identified by women, Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Putra, this was the identity of a son.
They have not only carried forward Allah but also carried forward the country and society and carried it to a new position .
In the past , I had a very good suggestion by a great man .
He had suggested that on March 8, there are programmes like celebrating Women's Day in every village, who have completed 100 years
Can a programme of respect for such mothers and sisters be organised  And can there be talk of a long life
Under this campaign, which started on 26th January, 2018, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
It includes about 1 lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat Representatives, 29 thousand Jal Sahia, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women Raj Mistry
You can imagine how big events are
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will be able to transform the cleanliness drive in normal life into the nature of the masses effectively.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was looking at the news that electricity has reached the three villages of Elephanta Islands after 70 years of independence and how much joy and enthusiasm the people there are about it.
You all know well, Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from the sea from Mumbai.
I was surprised to know that despite being near Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism, there was no electricity in Elephanta for so many years of independence.
For 70 years, three villages of Elephanta Island Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sentbandar, the dark shadow in the lives of the people there, are now dark and sixth and their lives have been illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there .
I am happy that the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lightened by electricity .
This is not just a power, but a new beginning of development.
What can be the moment of satisfaction and happiness in the lives of the countrymen
My dear brothers and sisters, We have just celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now the month of March is the beauty of the fields decorated with flaming crops, the golden winds of wheat, and the beauty of the mango that blossoms the mind - this is the specialty of this month .
But this month is very dear to all of us for the festivals of Holi .
On March 2, the whole country will celebrate Holi festival with joy
The importance of colors in Holi is as important as Holika is also of combustion because this day is the day of burning evils in fire and destroying them .
Holi is a good opportunity to sit together and become a part of each others pleasure and gives a message of love unity and brotherhood.
My best wishes and best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Holi.
This festival is filled with colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen - this is the best wishes
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
My dear countrymen, today, Mr. Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter on the Narendra Modi App and has urged me to touch the subjects written in his letter.
He has written, Kalpana Chawla, who is going to the space on February 1, is a virtuous date.
He left us in the Colombia Interview accident but inspired millions of youth around the world .
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji that he has started his long letter from the farewell of Kalpana Chawla .
It is a matter of sadness for everyone that we lost Kalpana Chawla ji at such a young age but he gave a message to thousands of girls from all over the world, especially to women and women.
There is nothing impossible if there is a desire and determination to do something.
It is very happy to see that in India today women are moving forward fast in every field and enhancing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect of women in our country, their place in society and their contribution has been surprised to the whole world.
Indian magicians have a long tradition
Vedas have contributed to many of Indias magicians in fabricating the wheels of Vedas
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreya do not know how many names are
It shows the importance of women in our society .
And then, in our society, women have been given the status of power.
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family and the formula of unity.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi has given many further examples
He has written that our brave Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's fighter aircraft Sukhoi will fly in 30, inspire them.
Three brave women have become emotional Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi Higher Pilots and are training in Sukhoi-30
All Women Rue, headed by Capacity Vajpayee, from Delhi to San Rancisco of America and back to Delhi to Air India
Flying in India Boeing Jet - and all women
In the past, Honble President takes a new initiative
President meets a group of extraordinary women who have done something first in their respective fields
These women achievers of the country, First Women Marchant Navy Aptein, First Lady Train Train of Passenger Train, First Lady Fire Differ, First Lady Bus River Antarctica, the first woman to reach Antarctica, in this way first woman to reach Everest - our women-powers have achieved extraordinary availability by breaking the rootism of the society.
He showed that a new path can be created by crossing all obstacles and obstacles on the strength of hard work, perseverance and determination.
A book on these women achievers, First Ladies has also been prepared so that the entire country can take inspiration from these women powers, their lives and their works.
It is also available as e-book on Narendra Modi website
Today, the country's women-power has an important role in the positive changes in the country and society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment, you might have been thinking about what connectivity is in the meantime
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India where all women are employees .
Woman state in all departments - be it commercial department, railway police, ticket hacking, announcing, point personality, more than 40 women have a status.
This time many people wrote on Twitter and on the other social media after seeing the Republic Day parade that the parade was one of the main points, BS Biker Continent in which all women were participating.
He was using adventurous experiments and these scenes were surprised to the guests coming from abroad too.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance
Today our women-power is leading
Being self-reliant
When the mention of tribal women comes, a certain picture emerges in the minds of everyone in which there is forest, footprints, women carrying the burden of wood on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women-power has made a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is Maoist-affected area
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols - Maoists have created a terrible environment of this.
Tribal women, Rickshaw are becoming self-reliant in such dangerous areas
In a very short period many women have joined it .
I also appreciate the district administration, from providing grants to training, the district administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
Leaving the time and external, accepting the improvement of what is necessary
Any life-style is identified by its Self-orrecting Mechanism
For centuries against social evils and evils , our country has been striving individual and socially .
Just a few days ago Bihar took an interesting initiative
In order to eradicate social evils in the state, the world's longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometres has been created.
Through this campaign, people were made aware of the evils like child marriage and dowry practices.
The entire state resolved to fight with evils like dowry and child marriage
Children, elderly, zeal and zealous youth, mothers and sisters, everyone had joined themselves in this war.
The human chain started from Patna's historic Gandhi Maidan went untouched to the borders of the state.
It is necessary for all the people of the society to get the benefit of development in the right sense that our society is free from these evils .
Let us all take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and a New India.
Create India, a strong and capable India
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of Bihar, the administration there and every person involved in the human chain that they have taken such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of MyGov, MyGov, Karnataka has written on MyGov that the cost of medicines was Rs.
He did not know about the first Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana
But now when they got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they bought medicines from there then their cost of medicines decreased by 75 percent .
He has expressed his desire that I should talk about it in the programme so that more and more people get information and they can take advantage of it .
For the past few years, many people used to write me about this, keep telling me.
One gets a deep satisfaction
And I also felt very good that there was a thought in the minds of Shriman Darshan ji that those whom he had received, they also met others.
The objective of this scheme is to make healthcare affordable and encourage ease of living
Pharmaceuticals available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50 to 90 of branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps the common man, especially the senior citizens who take medicines everyday, very much savings.
Generic medicines to be bought in it are according to the fixed standards of World Health Organization .
This is the reason why good quality medicines are found at affordable prices .
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This not only provides affordable medicines but also provides new employment opportunities for Industrial Entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at the nectar stores of the Prime Minister, Indian Jan Aushadhi Kendras and Hospitals
The only objective behind all these is to provide quality and affordable health services to the poorest of the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be created.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Mangesh from Maharashtra has made a photo, share on the Narendra Modi Mobile App
That photo was such that my attention was drawn towards that photo.
The photo was in which a granddaughter was taking part in the cleaning campaign with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morana river under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morana river flows for the first twelve months but now it has become sizonal .
The second pain is that the river was completely filled with wild grass, Jalkumbh.
A lot of waste was being thrown on the river and its edge .
A action plan was prepared and one day before the Makar Sankranti, the first phase of Mission Lean Morna was cleaned on 13th January, at four kilometres area, both the edges of the river Morana were cleaned up at fourteen places.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, colleges, students, children, elderly and mothers and sisters participated in this good work of Mission Lean Morna.
The Swachhta Abhiyan was continued in the same way on 20th January, 2018 and I am told that till the Morana river is completely cleaned, this campaign will run on every Saturday morning.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then there is nothing impossible .
Large changes can be brought through mass movement
I congratulate the people of Akola, the administration of the district and the city and the administration of the city and the people of Akola for making this work a mass movement.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot of discussions about Padma Awards these days.
It also attracts attention to T.
Every year there has been a tradition of awarding Padmas but the entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can nominate anybody
Transparency has come when the entire process is online
In a way, the selection process of these awards has been fully transformed.
Padma Awards have been given to such people who are usually not seen in big cities, in newspapers, in TV, in the function.
Now the significance of his work is not identification of the person to give the award.
You must have heard that Mr. Arvind Gupta ji will be happy to know you.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent his entire life in making toys for children
They have been making toys from garbage for four decades so that children can increase the curiosity of science
They are trying to inspire children from useless things to scientific experiments, they are inspiring children by visiting three thousand schools across the country and showing films made in 18 languages.
How wonderful life, how wonderful dedication
One such story is Sitava Jodditi (SCI) of Karnataka
They have not been called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades , he has contributed greatly to changing the lives of countless women in Belagavi ( BAGAI ) .
He had dedicated himself as a devadasi at the age of seven but then put his entire life for the welfare of the devadasis .
Not only that, they have also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard the name about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family, tribal family.
They used to do normal jobs for their lives but they were fond of making traditional tribal paintings.
Today, due to this hobby, they have respect not only in India but all over the world.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who illuminated the name of India abroad, was identified and he was awarded the Padma Shri award .
You will be surprised to hear the story of Kerala's tribal woman Lakshmikutti
Laxmikutti is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in the tribal area between dense forests.
He has created five hundred herbal medicines on the basis of his memory.
They have great importance in making medicines used after snake cutting .
Lakshmiji is continuously serving society with his knowledge of herbal medicines .
He was awarded Padma Shri for his contribution to society by identifying this anonymous person .
I also want to mention another name today, 75-year-old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal has also been selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils, vegetables in other houses to make hospitals
When he was 23 years old, his husband died due to no treatment and this incident inspired him to make a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in their hard worked hospital.
I am convinced that there are many such male and female slaves in our multiple slaves, there are many women and women who have no knowledge of them, no one recognizes them.
The Padma Award is a medium but I will also tell the countrymen that there are hundreds of people who live for the society, who live for the society, who live for the society, who live for the society, who live for some specialty, who work for the entire life.
They do not work for honor but because of their work we get inspiration .
Sometimes in schools, colleges, such people should listen to their experiences by calling them.
Beyond the award, there should be some efforts in the society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas
This is 9th January, when the revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from ST ARIA
On this day, we celebrate the untouchable bond between Indians living in India and the world.
This year we had organized a programme on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas where all MPs of Indian origin living worldwide and invited Mayors (MARS)
You will be happy to know that in that programme, from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tania, Kenya, Canada, Britan, Suriname, South Africa and America, and from many other countries where our mayor is originally original Indian, where MPs are original Indians, all of them participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are serving those countries as well as maintaining their strong relations with India this time the European Union, the European Union has sent me a calendar in which they have shown their contributions in different fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Someone is dedicated to Ayurveda, somebody brings the mind of the society with his music, somebody from his poems.
Somebody is researching the climate change and someone is working on Indian texts and someone has set up a gurudwara by running a truck and someone has built a mosque
I would like to thank you for this remarkable work of the European Union, for recognising the people of Indian origin and for giving information to the people around the world through them.
On 30th January is the death anniversary of worshipped Bapu, who showed us a new path.
On that day we celebrate the martyrdom day, on that day we pay homage to the great martyrs who lost their lives in protecting the country at 11 o'clock.
The path of peace and non-violence, this is the way of Bapu
Whether it is India or the world, whether it is a person or a family or a society worshipped Bapu, the ideals that Bapu has given us are still very relevant.
They were not just core principles
Currently, we see the dagger and the dagger how correct Bapu's things were
If we swear that we should walk on the path of Bapu - let's go, let's go - what can be a big tribute from him
My dear countrymen, conveying my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of 2018.
Where these 18 to 25 years of age should sit together and churn on New India, find ways and plans
How will we prove our resolves before 2022
How can we build an India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
B.
A.
I talked to them, there was no despair of disappointment, zeal, energy, dreams, dreams and dreams were those daughters who have been inspired by me and these are the strengths of the country. These are the future of my country, my dear countrymen, not only my countrymen, but whenever there is talk of the world's famous religious places, it is very natural to have the talk of the Sabarimala temple of Kerala. In this temple, there are millions of devotees coming here to take the blessings of Lord Ayyyappa Swami.
And especially at that place, which is located between the hills and the forests, how can this problem be converted into rituals, how can the way to get rid of the problem and what is so powerful in public participation - this Sabarimala temple is an example in itself.
Who will have made such rules
Hardly, there will be a citizen of India who does not respect him, does not respect him.
At that age, we are very bigger than all of us and are witnesses to different stages of the country, different phases of the country.
She is going to be 90 years old on 28th September
Before leaving abroad, I had the privilege of talking to Didi on the phone.
This conversation was the same, as in a very dull, the younger brother speaks to his elder sister.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam
I'm talking to Narendra Modi
Modi ji: So before I was thinking, I wish Hilata ji: Hamodi ji: My best wishes to you on birthday, congratulations forward.
Lata ji: A lot of people are older than age, but it is a big thing to get the blessings of what is bigger than your work.
Lata ji: Yes, I think that my parents have the blessings, and the blessings of the listeners.
I'm nothing
Modi ji: This is your humility, this is for all of us of the new generation, this is a big education for us. It is an impression for us that even after doing so much learning in your life, the rituals of your parents and that softness have always been given priority.
Lata ji:
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you ji: Ji Modi ji: You feed me something or the other Gujarati
Lata ji: What are you, you don't know.
I know that your arrival is changing the picture of India and that is what I am happy.
It looks very good.
Modi ji: Bus sister, be your blessings, be your blessings on the whole country, and you have always inspired me that people like us do something or the other.
Your letter also keeps getting me and if I get some of your gifts, then I have a special joy of it, which is a family relationship.
Lata ji: yes, yes
No, I don't want to hurt you, because, I'm looking, I know, how much business you are and how much work you do
What do you think
Whenever you came to touch your mother, I also sent someone to him and blessed him.
Modi ji: Yes
My mother remembered and she was telling me
Lata ji: And he blessed me on the telephone, so I liked Modi ji: Our mother was very happy, because of your love.
And once again I convey my best wishes to you on your birthday.
Modi ji: This time when Mumbai came, I would like to come to Rubaru ji: yeah, yeah, yeah
Lata ji: Jee Need, Need, Need
This will be my luck .
Modi ji: Pranam, Didi
Lata ji: Pranam
Modi ji: Many best wishes to you ji: Very salute
Modi ji: Pranam ji
Further for several weeks, all over the country, the festivals will be enjoyed.
Greetings to all of you, on the coming festivals.
In festivals, all the family members will come together.
Perhaps, these statements are not just words, we have an order, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Think, on the one hand, some houses shine with light, on the other hand, in front of it, in the houses of some people around it, there is dark shade.
In some houses, sweets are getting spoiled, so in some houses, children prefer sweets.
The real joy of these festivals is only when this darkness is sixth, this darkness is less - Uzziyala spreads.
We share the happiness there too, where there is no shortage, and this is our nature too.
In our homes, sweets, garments, gits, when delivery is in, think about one moment, delivery out.
At least in our households, which are in greater capacity, which we do not work anymore, we need delivery out such things.
In many cities, many NGs start-ups of young friends do this work.
They collect everything from the houses of the people, the clothes, the sweets, the food, the needy and the needy.
This time, can you eradicate the darkness under this chirag with full awareness and determination in this season of festivals
The smile on the face of many poor families, the festivals, your happiness will double your face, your face will be shiny, you will be given and illuminated, you will become Diwali and illuminated.
My dear brothers and sisters, in Deepawali, as a good fortune and prosperity, Laxmi comes home and home.
In our culture, daughters have been considered Lakshmi because daughter brings fortunate and prosperity.
Can we do the program of honoring this Laxmi of India on this Diwali
There will be many daughters around us, many multiplications that will be doing extraordinary work.
Someone will be working for the education of poor children, someone will be engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health, then someone will be serving the society by becoming a doctor, engineer.
Being a lawyer, trying to get justice to someone
May our society identify such daughters, respect them and proudly respect them.
Their honour programs are held across the country
One more work can be done about the achievements of these daughters, share more and more in social media, and use Bharatkilami (Lakshmi of India)
As we all launched a great campaign together, Selie with Daughter and that spread all over the world.
In the same way, this time, we should run the campaign, Laxmi of India.
Incentive of India's Laxmi means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen
My dear countrymen, I had already said about Mann Ki Baat that I get the privilege of interacting with many well-known people.
In the past, a student from far-flung Arunachal has sent me a big interesting letter.
And it says, I read the letter before you. Honourable Prime Minister, my name is Alina Tayang.
I'm from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh
This time when my Ceam result came, some people asked me what did you read the Cam Arriors Book
I told, that, I have not read this book.
But, go back, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times.
After this my experience was quite good .
I felt that if I had read this book before Ceam, I would have benefited a lot.
I liked many aspects from this book, but I also saw that there are many mantras for students but there is nothing more in this book for parents and teachers.
My little student friend, first, thank you for writing the letter
Thank you for reading am Harriors 2-3 times
What you have said is that if I can get out at the time of new education then I will definitely try to write some things for parents and teachers.
I urge all the students of the country, teachers and parents to tell me your suggestions about the aspects related to stress freezeam.
I must study it .
I will think about it and I will try to write it in my own words and in my own way, and it may be possible that if your suggestions come more then my new edition will also be confirmed.
So I ' ll wait for your ideas
I once again express my gratitude to our little friend of Arunachal, student Alina Tayang.
My dear countrymen, you also know about the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers, through TV.
But, don't you know I'm a common man like you too
If someone else was on this occasion, he would have become sad and disappointed, but, his face did not die, but he brought smiles on everyone's faces with his words.
Everyone has become convinced that the form of sportsman spirit was seen in their humility, simplicity and water consciousness.
The audience present there warmly welcomed their words
Even after the defeat in a tough collision, he praised his rival Nadal and gave a living evidence of the sportsman spirit.
However, on the other hand, Champion Nadal also lauded the game of Wanifil.
The humility of the loser in the same match and the humility of the winner was both worth seeing .
The thinking of our ancestors is really capable of
Mani Kanchan coincidence: Janayati Loksya Lochan Anandamyani, when a person contains qualifications and humility together, then who can not win the heart again
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of people around the world.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I am going to talk now, I am doing straight for you.
It is very difficult to stop it later .
But, if we start awakening and stop it, a lot can be saved.
With this spirit, I feel that today, especially with my youth, I must do some things.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit its addiction.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes, blood pressure increases very much to people who consume tobacco .
Everyone says so .
Tobacco addiction is caused by nicotine present in it .
In adolescence its consumption also affects the development of the brain .
But, today, I want to talk to you on a new subject.
You will be aware that recently the e-cigarette has been restricted to India.
E-cigarette is a type of electronic device separate from normal science.
A misconception about e-cigarette has been created where we all understand the dangers of normal science.
It is spread that there is no threat to e-cigarette.
They, this is the attempt that no member of the family should smoke, do not smoke
They know that smoking, tobacco causes huge damage to the body.
The drinker also knows and the seeer also knows
But the case of e-cigarette is very different.
There is no such awakening among the people about e-cigarette.
They are completely unaware of its danger and that is why sometimes e-cigarette enters home in Kauthuhal quietly.
Our youth runs on the path of waste unknowingly.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are mixed in e-cigarette, which have a bad effect on health.
You know, when someone smokes around us, we know that it goes through smell.
In such a situation, many adolescents and youngsters are seen roaming around in their hands, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes in their hands, and sometimes they become victims of this.
Young generation is the future of the country
The e-cigarette has been restricted so that this new way of intoxication does not destroy our youth country.
Children's life does not ruin the dreams of every family
This disease, do not accumulate these habits in the society
I urge you all to leave tobacco addiction and do not make any misconception about e-cigarette.
Let us all together build a healthy India
You have it.
Remember India
India means that if we go to the gym for two-two hours in the morning and evening, then it will happen.
This is our mother-in-law, this is our country, Bahuratna Vasundhara.
Many human gems have come out of this earth
India-Year has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, has been the land of work.
And these are those people who have eaten themselves for themselves, not for themselves, for others.
Similarly, a great Vibhuti is being honoured at Vetican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will declare Mary Threasia as a saint on October 13
The work done by Sister Mary Threasia for the good of humanity in his little lifetime of 50 years is an example for the whole world.
He had a wonderful attachment to the field of social service and education.
He built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and was engaged in this mission for life.
Once again I pay homage to Sister Mary Threasia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, India is not only a matter of pride for the entire world today, but today when we are celebrating Gandhi 150, 130 crore Indians have resolved to be free from the Sea Plastic.
In the direction of environmental conservation, the kind of leadership that India has taken all over the world, today the eyes of all the countries are towards India.
I am confident that all of you will be a part of the campaign to liberate from the Se-Plastic on 2nd October.
Everywhere people are contributing to this campaign in their own way .
But, a young man from our own country has launched a unique campaign.
I was focused on his work, so I tried to understand his new experiment by talking to him on the phone.
Maybe these things can be done to the people and the people of the country.
Mr. Ripudaman Belvi ji is making a unique effort they are plogging .
When I heard the plogging word for the first time, it was also new for me.
in foreign countries , perhaps these words have been used in some quantity .
But, in India, Riputman Belvi ji has made it a lot of publicity.
Let ' s talk to them
I congratulate you all and my friends this time on the occasion of the birth anniversary of auspicious Bapu, the Ministry of Sports is also on this occasion.
2 km plogging on 2nd October, these programmes are going to be held across the country.
We have heard what happens in the programme with the experience of Riputman ji.
With this We will not only take care of our health , but also protect the health of the mother of the earth .
This campaign is enhancing awareness among the people with utensils and sanitation.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step in this direction then India will move forward towards getting rid of single use plastic.
Riputman ji, once again, thank you very much
And I congratulate you, your team and for this new imagination.
They want to move forward to convert their lives into patriotism
One thing feels to remember a little in advance
Well, I will say it in detail in the next Mann Ki Baat but today I am saying in a little advance so that you get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember, October 31 is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
So you start preparing from now on
I will need to talk in detail but it is time now, some people can also start practising some schemes.
My dear countrymen, you will remember, on 15th August I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 you will visit 15 places in India.
At least 15 places and even if it is possible then make a night, two night stay program
You see, understand, experience Hindustan
How many varieties we have
And when they come to the festival of Diwali on holidays, people are required and therefore I will again urge you to roam around 15 such places in India.
Today our rank is twenty-four and five years ago our rank was at number 65 i. e.
If we try more, we will be able to make our place in major places of the world in tourism in 75 years of independence.
It is also necessary to see that in the days of Diwali, there is no arson from firecrackers, etc.
Whatever hesitation should be done for this, you must be careful.
Come on
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Can you imagine how hard did he work to make the Constitution of your country full of diversity
The Konkan coastal area, where the sea has an important role, many forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Fort, Murud Janjira, Swarna Fort etc. were either located on the seashores, or were surrounded by seas, Maratha used to do the responsibility of the security of these forts, Maratha navy had the combination of big ships and small ships in Maratha Navy, their naval personnel were very efficient in attacking and protecting any enemies and we should discuss Maratha Nevi and remember Kanhoji.
Thinking also feels scared, neither will there be soil, nor will trees and plants grow, where will human life be possible
Where will the animal be possible
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific methods that the earth and mother suffer from serious losses due to the use of urea more than required, the farmer is the son of the earth, how can the farmer see the earth and the mother ill
Can our farmers, the sons of our earth, the children of our land resolve to resolve that the use of urea in their fields today, 2022, when there will be 75 years of independence, half of the use of urea
The person of North-India will not know what is in South-India
The person of West-India will not know what is in East India
If we look at the diversity of our country, Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, then it is once a matter of fact that when he wandered in India, he got a new inspiration to see and live for him and to live for him, all these great men have made a comprehensive visit to India in the beginning of his work that he tried to know, understand India in itself. Can we try to live in different states of our country, to different societies, groups, their traditions, their traditions, their clients, their clients, their clients, their clients, their clients, their clients
Can you keep on Incredible India (Hash Tag IncredibleIndia)
You see, if all the people of one state will say that they should scrutinize it and how to promote tourist destinations with the intentions of the people in a way.
My dear countrymen, greetings
On one hand the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand, when news of violence comes from any corner of India, it is natural to worry about the country.
This is our country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who lives for the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have accepted public life values, non-violence, prosperity and are full of our minds.
Non-violence Paramo Dharma: These have come to hear from childhood, say
I want to assure the countrymen, who takes the law, who suppresses the path of violence, whether it is a person or a group, this country will never tolerate nor tolerate any government.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living and wearing.
We see diversity in every behavior of life .
Even our festivals are full of diversity and thousands of years old with our cultural heritage, see the cultural traditions, see the historical events, there will be hardly any day left in 365 days when there is no festival connected to us.
Now you must have seen that all our festivals walk according to the journal of nature
There is a direct relationship with nature .
Many of our festivals are directly connected to the farmers, are connected to the fishermen.
Today I am talking about festivals , first of all I would like to say to you lucky ducks .
Festival of Sanvatsari was celebrated in Jain society yesterday
Paryushana festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra in Jain society .
The last day of the festival is Sanvatsari .
This is really a wonderful tradition in itself .
The festival of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship
It is also called a forgiveness festival in a way and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other a miracle Dukkadam .
Anyway , in our scriptures , forgiveness is Veerasyabhushanam i . e . Bhushan of forgiveness heroes .
Forgiveness is a hero
We have come to hear these discussions and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say that forgiveness is the specialty of a powerful person .
Shakespeare, while describing the significance of forgiveness in his drama The Merchant of Enice, wrote that Mercy is with two blest, It blessed him that gives and hem that takes meaning forgiveness and whoever has been forgiven both get the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, in every corner of India these days, Ganesh Chaturthi has shouted and when it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi, it is natural to talk about public-Ganeshotsav.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and before the last 125 years of independence he became a symbol of the freedom movement .
And after independence, they have become a symbol of social education and social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi runs for 10 days
This great festival is called a symbol of unity, equity and purity .
Greetings to all the countrymen on the occasion of Ganeshotsav
Onam festival is being celebrated in Kerala now
One of the colorful festivals of India , Onam is a major festival of Kerala .
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala
This festival gives a message of love and harmony in the society as well as a new zeal, new hope, new faith in the minds of the people.
And now these festivals are also becoming the reason for the attraction of tourism.
And I will tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or the Durga Festival in Bengal has become the attraction of tourism in a way.
Our and festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
What can we do in that direction, we should think
A few days later in the series of these festivals, the festival of Eid-ul-Juha will also be celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Eid-ul-Juha
Festivals are symbols of faith and faith for us, we have to make festivals a symbol of sanitation in a new India.
Festivals and sanitation are associated in family life
Festival preparation means cleanliness
This is not a new thing for us but it is also important to create a social nature .
The public insistence of cleanliness should not only be in the house, in our entire village, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country, be a unique part of these festivals.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of modernity are changing.
These days, a new dimension, a new parameter, how modern you are, how modern you are, how much modern you are, how many moderns your thought-processes are.
Your activities have eco friendly, environment friendly behavior against him.
If there is against him in society , it is considered bad today .
And the result of this is that today I see that these days even in Ganeshotsav, the eco friendly Ganapati, as if a big campaign has emerged.
If you go to Tube then you will see that in every household children are making Ganesh ji, they are making Ganesh ji by bringing soil.
Use of different types is happening in every family
See how big change has come and this is a pleasant change
And as I said, our country is full of millions of stunning minds.
Three years ago, when the Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will be three years on October 2.
And, its positive results are coming out.
Coverage of toilets has reached around 67 from 39.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation
In the past, there was a severe flood in Gujarat
A lot of people lost their lives , but after the flood , when the water was reduced , so much wasted everywhere .
At such a time, in Dhanera of Banaskantha district of Gujarat, the workers of Jamiat Ulemaidhind cleaned the flood affected 22 temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
Allah ' s sweat sweated, all of them came out
The best example of unity for sanitation, such an example that inspires everyone, all the workers of Jamiat Ulemaidhind gave it
A dedicated effort for sanitation, if it becomes our permanent nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I call upon all of you to once again 15-20 days before the 2nd October Gandhi Jayanti, like Swachhta Hi Seva, the water service was a campaign for the sanitation, sanitation and service.
Create an environment for cleanliness all over the country
We can find opportunities wherever you get opportunities.
But we ' re all connected
Assume it as a preparation for Diwali in a way, accept it as a preparation for Navaratri, accept the preparation of Durga Puja.
My friends of social media can run a few constructive campaigns and inspire them to work on the ground of Virtual World.
This campaign by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in which you are competitive of essays, the competition for making short films is being organized by the Ministry of Cleanliness.
You can write essays in different languages and there is no age limit, there is no age limit.
You can make short film, you can make your mobile
Can make a 2-3-minute film that inspires cleanliness
It can be in any language, it can also be silent.
You see, how will this shine on October 2 of Gandhi Jayanti
You can imagine that after the 15-day cleaning campaign, after the sanitation Hi Seva, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, we will have a sacred joy within us to pay homage to Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I want to accept the loan of all of you in a special way.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude and not because you have been associated with the talk of mind for so long, I would like to express my gratitude and accept the loan because with this programme of Mann Ki Baat, millions of people get connected to every corner of the country.
The number of listeners is in millions but millions of people write letters to me, sometimes messages, sometimes messages come on phones, there is a big treasure for me.
This has become a big opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I wait for your messages as much as you wait for your mind
I ' m lucky because I get to learn something from all of you
You might think yes, man, you've ever made such a mistake
Sometimes something becomes a part of our habit that we do not think that we do wrong .
Prime Minister, I am speaking to Poona
I want to tell you about my friend
He always tries to help people but I am surprised to see a habit of it .
I once went to the mall to shop with him.
On a sari, he spent two thousand rupees comfortably and Rs 450 on the pizza, while the auto that was taken to the mall continued to be worth five rupees for a long time from that automan.
Returning, buying vegetables on the way and saving Rs. 4-5 by facilitating every vegetable
I think so bad.
You must tell your mind about this .
Now after listening to these phone calls, I am sure you must have been shocked, surprising and might have decided not to make such a mistake from the front.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell a goods around our house, a ferry person comes to our house, a small shopkeeper, a vegetable seller gets a relationship with us, sometimes whenever we have a relationship with an auto-rickshaw person, then we start to engage with it, we start to make it valuable, not so much, reduce two rupees, reduce five rupees.
And if we go to eat food in a big restaurant then we don't even see what it is written in the bill, we pay the money from the money.
Not only that, if you want to buy saris in Showroom, you don't have any money, but if you have a relationship with a poor person then you don't live without fault.
Have you ever thought of what happens to the poor mind
There is no difference between your life of two rupees five rupees but how much of your small habits would you have pushed his mind ever thought it
Madam, I am grateful to you, you gave me a message by calling the phone that touches such a heart.
I am sure my countrymen will also have a habit of doing such a thing with the poor .
My dear young friends, the entire country celebrates on 29th August as National Sports Day
This is the birthday of Major Dhyanchand ji, a magician of Hockey Player and Hockey.
His contribution to Hockey was incomparable .
I am reminding of the fact that I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports.
Sports become part of our life
If we are the young countries of the world then we should also be seen in the field of Tarunai Sports.
Sports i.e. Physical Integration, Mental Alertness, Personality Enhancement I understand what more needs
Sports in a way is a very big herb of heart mixing .
The younger generation of our country came forward in the sports world and today I would like to warn you that playing fields are more important than play stations.
Play a game but sometimes in the field and sometimes look at it with football.
Crickets are playing on computer but in the open field the joy of playing crickets below the sky is something else.
There was a time when the children of the family went out , the mother used to ask when you would come back .
Today the condition has become that when the children come to the house then they either start watching cartoons in one corner or get stuck on the mobile game and then you have to say that when will you go out
It is a matter of happiness for our youth that India is going to organise the IAF Under 17 World Up from 6th to 28th October.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home
Let us welcome our young guests from the world, with the festival of sports, enjoy sports, create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I want to share with the people of the country that have touched my mind last week.
I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of a very young age and some of them were born in the Himalayas .
Will sometimes spend 40-40 days together in water
Sometimes 30-30 days will be spent in water
These six daughters and this is the first event in the world with courage among the waves of the sea.
Who will be Hindustani who will not be sent down to our daughters
I salute these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the whole country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you must read it because it is a bold story, it will be a story of self-reliance and I will be happy to deliver these daughters to you.
My best wishes to these daughters and blessings.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we all celebrate Teachers Day
Dr. Radhakrishnan jis birthday is the former President of our country.
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life .
He always liked to live as a teacher
I bow down to him, the great scientist Albert Einstein had said.
It is the superior heart of the teacher to take pleasure in creative expression and knowledge. It is the most important feature of a teacher to enjoy creative feeling and knowledge among his students.
This time when we celebrate Teacher ' s Day , can we all make a resolve together
Can you run a campaign in a mission mode
If we make collective efforts then we will play a very big role in the transformation of the nation.
Let's go about this mantra to transform
Prayer Prime Minister
My name is Dr. Ananya Awasthi
I am a resident of Mumbai City and work for the India Research Centre of the World University.
My dear countrymen, Prime Minister Jan-Dhan Yojana has been a subject of discussion about the pundits of the economic world not only in India but in the entire world.
This campaign was launched by taking a dream in mind on August 28, 2014.
On August 28, the campaign of this Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is going on for three years.
30 crore new families have been connected with it, bank account has been opened.
This number is more than the population of many countries in the world .
Today, I am a big solution that within three years my poor brother sitting on that last corner of the society has become a part of the basic stream of the country's economy, his habit has changed, he has started coming to the bank, he has started saving money, he is feeling the security of money.
Sometimes money lives in hand, lives in jeb, if you are in the house then you want to spend the money.
If you have to do a good job in the coming days then money will come to work
In the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in banks by our poor.
In a way this is the savings of the poor. This is his strength in the coming days.
And with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, whose account opens has also got the benefit of insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Rs.
In many families, due to the insurance of one rupee, when there was a crisis over the poor man, the life of the head of the family ended, he got Rs 2 lakh in a few days.
Be it Dalits, tribals, women, emerging youth, youngsters who are intended to do something on their feet, millions of youngsters get no guarantee from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, banks and they themselves stand on their feet.
Today it is not so time but I will definitely tell the people of the bank that they should upload it on MyGov.in, people will be inspired by this thing that how a scheme brings transformation in the life of a person, how new energy is filled, hundreds of examples have come to me.
I will try my best to reach you and there is such a motivation that the people of Media can also take full advantage of this.
They can also inspire the new generation by integrating such people.
Man's mind is such that the rainy season is a very charming time for the mind.
Animals, birds, plants, nature everybody gets enjoyed on the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a dramatic form, it shows how big it is to destroy the water.
Nature gives us life, feeds us, but sometimes natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, its terrible nature destroys us very much.
The changes in the changing weather cycle and environment are also being made very negative impact.
For the past few days, natural calamities have been faced due to excessive rainfall in some parts of India, especially in Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal.
Flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Relief works are being done at widespread level.
Wherever possible, my colleagues of the Council of Ministers are also reaching there.
State governments are also making every effort to help flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and citizens working with service are also making efforts to help the people in such a situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, the soldiers of the Army, the people of the Air Force, the people of the NCR, the Paramilitary Forces, everybody gets involved in the service of disaster victims at such a time.
And 247 Control from Helpline number 1078 is continuously working to deal with the situation of floods.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government system was prepared by drilling the mock at most places before the rainy season.
NCR teams were installed.
Gradually we also made the nature that if we can create our activities according to the weather forecast, then we can avoid losses.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time there have been so many letters about GST, so many phone calls have come and people still express happiness about GST and express curiosity.
I also tell you a phone call: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard and was very impressed by your hardware accountants Day.
Similarly, in our country, Goods and Services Tax (GST) started on the date of last month itself.
Can you tell me whether the results are coming after a month as the government had executed
I would like to hear your thoughts about it, thank you.
The GST has been implemented for nearly a month and its benefits have started to appear.
And I am very happy that whenever a poor person writes a letter to me, he says how prices have been reduced due to GST and how things have been cheaper.
If a person living in the north-east, remote mountains and forests writes a letter that in the beginning it was scared of what was not known but now when I started learning it, I think it was more easier than before.
Trade became easier.
And the biggest thing is that customers have started increasing their confidence in the businessman.
Just now I was seeing how GST was impacted on transport and logistics sector.
How the movement of trucks has increased now
How the time is decreasing to distance
Highways are clutter free.
Pollution has also decreased due to the speed of trucks.
The goods are also reaching very soon.
This is the facility, but it also gives strength to the economic speed.
Earlier, due to different tax structures, the maximum resources of transport and logistics sector were engaged in maintaining the paperwork and they had to make new warehouses within every state.
GST, which I call God and Simple Tax, has actually created a very positive impact on our economy and in a very short time.
The rapid smooth transition, the rapid migration, the new registration, has created a new faith in the entire country.
And sometimes Pandits of the economy, Pandits of Management, Pandits of Technology, Indias use of GST as a model in front of the world.
There will be a Case Study for many universities in the world.
Because it is such a big change at such a large scale and with the involution of such millions of people to implement it in such a large country and to move forward successfully, it is a great height of success in itself.
The world will definitely study on this.
And GST has been implemented, all the states have participation in it, all the states are responsible for it.
All the decisions have been made by the states and the Center unanimously.
And the result of this is that every government had the same priority that there was no burden on the poor plate due to GST.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries, all the departments, all the officers of the Central and State Governments.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform, it is an economy that strengthens the culture of a new integrity.
There is also a campaign for social reform in a way.
I once again salute the Koti-Koti countrymen to make such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
We have been listening to this simplely since childhood and the reason for this is the beginning of the non-cooperation movement on 1st August 1920.
The uit India Movement was launched on 9th August, 1942, which is known as the August Revolution and on 15th August, 1947, the country was free.
In a way, in the month of August, many events have been specially associated with the ward of freedom.
But very few people know that leaving India, this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, those who have been associated with the glimpse of freedom, have been struggling, have been facing, are our inspiration to build a grand India of history.
The heroes of our freedom have given sacrifice, penance and sacrifice, what can be a great inspiration
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for the Indian freedom movement.
This movement had resolved the entire country to liberate from the British-Raja.
This was the time when the Indian masses against the British power had become a part of the uit India movement in every corner of India, be it village, city, be it read, be it illiterate, poor or rich.
The public anger was on its peak border.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were shaking their lives in the struggle with the mantra of die.
Millions of youth of the country had left their studies, left books.
Two different forms of non-cooperation movement and uit India Movement 1920 and 1942 Mahatma Gandhi.
The form of non-cooperation movement was different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity grew so much that the great man like Mahatma Gandhi did or gave the mantra of death.
There was peoples support behind all this success, peoples strength, peoples resolve, peoples struggle.
The whole country was fighting together.
And sometimes I think that if you look at the pages of history, then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle, which started from 1857, continued every moment in any corner of the country till 1942.
This long period created a glimpse of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was committed to doing something or the other.
Generations changed, but there was no shortage of resolution.
The country was trying every moment to overthrow the British Sultanate.
This labour from 1857 to 1942 created a situation that 1942 reached its peak and quit India was such a bugle that within 5 years, the British had to go to 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, he reached the people of the country.
And from 1942 to 1947, it became a peoples mind, it became a reason for the success of the five decisive years of achieving the country with success.
These five years were decisive years.
Now I want to add you to this math.
We were free in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It's about 70 years.
Governments came and came.
Arrangements were made, changed, dried up, increased.
Everyone has tried their own way to free the country from problems.
Successes also got.
Respects also awake.
As from 1942 to 1947, there was a decisive five years of achievement.
I see that from 2017 to 2022, we have come to the forefront of another five years of achievement.
On 15th August, 2017, we will celebrate as a resolution festival and when 75 years of independence in 2022, we will continue to make that resolve a reality.
There should be millions of resolves.
Efforts should be made to fulfill crores of resolves.
As 1942 to 1947 have become decisive for the country's independence, these five years can become decisive for the future of India from 2017 to 2022.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of independence of the country.
Then we all have to take a strong resolve today.
2017 is to make a year of our resolve.
We have to join this August month resolution and we have to resolve.
Come on, in the month of August 9, run a Mahabhiyan of Siddhi from the resolution.
A resolution that we will prove in the next 5 years.
Youth organizations, student organizations, NGOs etc. can organize collective discussions.
You can expose new ideas.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
What can I contribute to it as a person
Let us join the festival of this resolution.
Video, post, blog, articles, new ideas used to bring all these things to use technology.
Transform this campaign into a mass movement.
This is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to familiarize the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am supposed that you must propagate it, spread it.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Servant of the country, I get the opportunity to communicate with the country with the Red Fort.
I'm just an obligation. He does not speak a person there.
The voice of 1.25 crore countrymen echoes from the red crown.
I am happy that since the last 3 years, every corner of the country consistently suggests that what should I say on 15th August
This time too, I invite you, either send your thoughts on the Narendra Modi App on MyGov.
I myself read it and I will try to express it in the time I have on August 15.
In the last three years, I have heard a complaint in my 15th August speech that my speech becomes slightly long.
I have tried to make rules for me in more than 40-45-50 minutes.
I don't know if I can do it or not.
But I intend to try this time how to make my speech smaller
See, if you get success or not.
I want to do another thing today, my countrymen.
India has a social economics in the economy.
And we should never be less than that.
Our festivals, our festivals, they are just opportunities for happiness and prosperity.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
And in these festivals a natural joy is also added.
Festivals bring sweetness in relations, affection in the family, brotherhood in society.
Adds the person and society.
A comfortable journey from the person to the summit runs.
Importantly becomes an opportunity to go towards the adult.
As far as the economy is concerned, many months before Rakhi, hundreds of families start making rakhis in small domestic industries.
From Khadi to silk threads, not knowing how many kinds of rakhis and nowadays people like homemade rakhis.
Business of thousands of sweets, sweets and sweets connects with a festival.
Our poor brothers and sisters, the families go from this.
We burn lamps in Deepawali, it is just a light festival, it is not just a festival, it is not a festival.
He has a direct connection with those poor families who have made small soils.
But today, when I talk of the poor economy associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to talk about the environment as well.
I have seen that sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware of me and more active.
For the last one month, citizens consistently aware of the environment have written letters to me.
And he has urged you to tell about eco friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi before time so that people plan the choice of soil Ganesh.
First of all, I am grateful to such aware citizens.
He has urged me to say on this subject before time.
This time, the public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
The original sentiment with which Lokmanya Tilak ji had launched a public Ganesha Festival to commemorate the unity of the society and the awareness of the society.
Once again, we should make essay competitions in this year of Ganeshotsav, discuss meetings, remember the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak.
And this time I said very soon .
I am confident that all of you will join me and this will benefit from this that the poor artisans, the poor artists who make idols, will get employment and fill the stomach of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that be it the field of education, be it the economic sector, be it the social sector, be it sports, our daughters are illuminating the name of the country, getting new heights.
We are proud of our daughters, we are descending.
In the past, our daughters performed a wonderful performance in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players daughters this week.
I felt very good by talking to them, but I was feeling that the World Up could not win it was a huge burden on them.
He also had pressure on his face, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave me a different evaluation.
I said that nowadays the age of media is such that the requirements are increased so much and when success is not achieved then it also changes into anger.
We have seen many such games that if the players of India failed, then the country's anger breaks on those players.
Some people break the limits and say something like this, write things, there is a lot of pain.
But for the first time that when our daughters did not succeed in the World Cup, then 25 million people took that defeat on their shoulders.
Not only that, these daughters praised them and glorified them.
I see it a pleasant change and I told these daughters that you should see that this good fortune has been given to you only and you should get out of your mind that you have not succeeded.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won 1.25 million countrymen.
My dear countrymen, once again I remind you of the Agasth Kranti, once again on 9th August, again on 15th August, I am reminding you of the 75 years of independence.
Every countryman should make a pledge and prepare a 5-year road map to prove the resolve of every countrymen.
We all have to reach new heights, reach and reach the country.
Come on, let us go together, let us do something or the other.
The fate of the country, the future will continue to be better and move forward with this confidence.
Weather is changing
This time the heat is also very much
But it was nice that the rain is moving forward on your map in time .
In many parts of the country, the weather has become pleasant due to Jhajjam rains.
After the rains, cold winds have experienced relief from the heat of last days
And we all have seen that however turmoil in life, however stress, personal life, public life, the arrival of rain changes our mindset.
Today Lord Jagannath jis chariot yatra is celebrated in many parts of the country with great devotion and joy .
Now in some parts of the world the festival of Lord Jagannath ji ' s Rath Yatra is celebrated .
And the poorest of the country is associated with Lord Jagannathji .
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor .
And very few people will know that there is a word in English language juggernaut and it means a magnificent chariot that no one can stop.
And in this juggernaut's dictionary meaning, it is also found that this word has emerged from the chariot of Jagannath itself.
And therefore we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way .
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath ji, I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen and also salute Lord Jagannath ji in the Sri Charans.
The diversity of India is also its characteristics, Indias diversity is also the power of India.
The holy month of Ramzan celebrated with a sacred spirit in worship .
Now is the festival of Eid
My best wishes to all of me on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is the month of virtue donation, the month of sharing of happiness and the more happiness they share, the more happiness they grow
Let us all take inspiration from these sacred festivals and share the treasures of happiness, move forward the country.
In this sacred month of Ramzan a big inspiration of Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh came to me .
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live in that small village, in a way more population belongs to the brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
Inside this Ramadan the villagers decided to build toilets together .
And in this individual toilet , the government also gets assistance and the amount of assistance was given to them about Rs . 17 lakhs .
These 17 lakhs you spend for other facilities in the village
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for reversing this holy occasion of Ramadan on the occasion of the good of the society.
We know that three such states in our country are Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala, they have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana were also declared this week
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration of these five states, the governance and the people and the people for fulfilling this task.
We are well aware that in the life of a person, in the life of a society, we have to work hard.
If our handwriting is bad, if it is to be cured, then for a long time we have to try to be very aware.
Then the habit of the body, mind changes
The subject of cleanliness is the same
Such bad habits have become part of our nature .
Everyone's attention will be attracted.
Good inspirational events will also have to be remembered again and again
And I am happy that today cleanliness has not been a government programme.
This is becoming a movement of the masses and the masses.
And when the people sitting in the government move forward with public participation, how much power increases
In the past, a very good event came in my mind, which I would like to say to you.
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh
The administration there took a big job from the public participation .
100-hour non stop drive
And what was the goal
Creating ten thousand domestic toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in a hundred hours
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the people of Janardhana and the government have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in the next 100 hours.
71 villages
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people sitting in the government, to the government officials and to the citizens of those villages of Vijayanagaram district that you have presented a big inspirational example while performing hard work.
On the Narendra Modi App, they come to MyGov.in, come from letters, come to Akashvani.
Recalling the Emergency, Shri Prakash Tripathi has written that on June 25, he has presented it as a black period in the history of democracy.
This awareness of Prakash Tripathi ji's democracy is commendable and democracy is a system, it is not so, it is also a ritual.
Democracy requires eternal awareness and hence it is necessary to recall the trauma of democracy and move forward towards the good things of democracy.
1975 - June 25 - that was a black night that no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted into a prisonhouse.
The opponent voice was buried.
The dignitaries of the country including Jaiprakash Narayan were locked in jails.
The justice system was not able to escape the shadow of that horrific form of emergency.
The newspapers were completely wasted.
Democracy lovers fought a big battle and the country like India, such a large country, when they got the opportunity, how democracy exists in the fate of the people of India, showcased that power through elections.
We have to empower this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Hindustani is feeling the glory of high taxes in the world today.
21st June, 2017 - The entire world has become Yoga.
From water to mountains, people welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga.
Who will be Hindustani, who will not be proud of this thing.
It is not that Yoga did not happen before, but today, when Yoga has been tied in the thread of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Nearly all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their opportunity.
The Great All of China practiced Yoga in Peru, while people performed Yoga at 2400 meters above the sea level on World Heritage Site Machu Pichu in Peru.
In French, people made Yoga in the shadow of Eiffel Tower.
The programmes were held at 70 places in small places like Singapore and they have launched a week-long campaign.
NDC takes out 10 stamps of International Yoga Day
Oga Session with Yoga Masters organized at NFFC
NCSTA, Diplomats of the world have participated in it.
This time again, Yoga also worked for world records.
Nearly 55 thousand people in Ahmedabad in Gujarat have made a new world record by making Yoga together.
I also got the opportunity to attend the programme of Yoga in Lucknow .
But for the first time I got the opportunity to do yoga in the rains .
Our soldiers have also done yoga in Siachen where there is Minus 20, 25, 40 Degree Temperature.
Be it TBP, RP, ICS, everybody has made Yoga his part along with his duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Yoga Day, I had said that three generations of the family should share their photographs while doing yoga together.
Some TC Channel also carried forward this thing
Sir, I have a question that in the receipt of Kerala, we had told you that the books we give as a git should be given to us as a memento.
You had started this thing during your tenure in Gujarat, sir, but we are not able to see this much in recent Days.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had made a tradition in the government that we would not give a book, book or handloom, handkerchie would welcome it.
And the handkerchie of Khadi so that Khadi can also be promoted.
As long as I was in Gujarat, all of us had become a habit, but after coming here my habit was lost.
But he went to Kerala, then once again he became aware
And I have just started informing the government below again.
We can also gradually create a nature
And the age of booket is very low .
Once taken in hand, then leave
But if you give a book then in a way it becomes a part of the house and becomes a part of the family.
And when I am talking about this, how historical value of such things is
When I went to KK last year, the ueen of Britain in Hondon, ueen Liabeth invited me to dinner.
There was a maternal environment
He also made me a meal with great love, but later he showed me a small handkerchie and a thread woven in the emotional voice with great respect and shine in his eyes, he said that when I was married, this handkerchie was sent to me as a best wishes of marriage.
How many years have passed, but ueen Liabet has kept the handkerchief given by Mahatma Gandhi.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life, became part of his history.
I am confident that these habits do not change overnight and whenever they talk like this, they also have to be a victim of criticism.
But in spite of this, you should keep doing such things, you should keep trying.
Now I cannot say that I will go anywhere and if I come with a boat then I will refuse it, I will not be able to do it.
But still there will be criticism, but if you will continue to talk, then gradually there will be improvement.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister, there are many kinds of work.
I have drowned in files, but I have developed a habit for me that I read some letters every day from the letters that come to me and that is why I get an opportunity to join the common man.
Various letters come, different types of people write letters
These days I got an opportunity to read such a letter, I think I must tell you.
In a remote south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife of Madurai, Arulmozhi Sarvanan - he sent me a letter.
And what was the letter, he wrote that if I thought of doing some economic activity in the mind of the children's education in my family, then the family would get some financial help.
So I started some work in the direction of supplies by taking money from the bank and bringing some goods from the market.
In such a situation, I came to know that the Government of India has set up a system called Government-Marketplace.
So I have also registered God in it. I want to tell the countrymen, if you also get the opportunity then you will get the opportunity.
There ' s a big new kind of system
And then he has to order
So, all the departments of the government keep watching those people who get registries inside the GM.
Because of not being intermediaries in the middle , things are very cheap .
Now this Arulamozhi Madam has made all the registration of the goods he can give on this website of the government.
And fun is that the letter he has written to me is a big interesting.
This is Empowerment
This is the opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
Perhaps Arunmozhi ji had not written a letter to me, I might have not even noticed so much that a householder is working away from the system of GM, his goods can be bought to the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the power of the country .
There is also a transparency in it, there is also an empowerment in it, it also has entrepreneurship.
I would surely want those who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way to connect more than that.
I believe that Minimum Government and Maimum Governance is an excellent example of this and what is the goal of Minimum Price and Maimum Ease, Efficiency and Transparency
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga, on the other hand we can also proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the earth connected with Yoga, our dreams are also to cross those horizons of the remote heavens.
In the past, India has shown a lot in sports and in science.
Today India is not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISR launches 30 Nano Satellites with Cartosat-2 series satellites
And in these satellites, apart from India, there are about 14 such countries in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America.
And this non-satellite campaign of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the field of agriculture, in terms of natural calamity.
And the satellites that India has launched so far, this is the most weighing heavily satellite.
And if the newspapers of our country had compared it to the weights of the elephant then you can imagine how big work our scientists have done in the field of space.
One thousand days of Mars Mission have been completed on June 19
You will be aware of the fact that when we successfully created a place in the orbit for the Mars mission, this entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
The completion of a thousand days in our scientific journey is an important stop in our space journey.
In sports these days, we are also seeing that the trend of our youth is increasing.
Now it has started to be seen that along with studies, our younger generations have started showing their future in sports and due to our players, due to their maleness, their achievements, the name of the country is also illuminated.
Recently, India's Badminton player Kidambi Srikanth has won the Indonesia Open and has increased the value of the country
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to him and his coach for this achievement.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to join the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of Shachol of Athletics of Athlete P.
As much as we will promote sports, also bring sports, sportsman spirit.
Sports also play a very important role in the development of personality .
The importance of sports in the overall personality development is very important.
There is no shortage of talent in the country
If children are interested in sports in our family, they should give opportunity.
Everyone should dream for the next lympic
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season, the atmosphere of festivals, in a way, the experience of this period is new.
Once again I would like to convey my best wishes to you all at the time of the next mind .
This year's heat will hardly forget us.
But the rain is waiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has begun.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan, I convey my best wishes to the people of India and the world, especially to the Muslim community, to this holy month.
This is a country which is also a country that those who believe in God and those who reject God, those who worship idols and those who oppose idol worship, every kind of ideology, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, we have imbibed the art of living together.
And finally, be it religion, community, ideology, tradition, we give this message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramadan will surely help in furthering this path of peace, unity and goodwill.
I once again convey my best wishes to all.
I am happy that many people have given me weedback.
Everyone showed the enthusiasm to tell me personally.
I have not been able to read everything, I have not even heard the message of everyone, so many things have come.
However, some people are trying to learn new things using your tubes and trying to learn new languages.
Some people are learning cooking, some are learning dance, some are learning drama, some have written that we have now started writing poems.
Knowing, living, understanding nature is trying in that direction.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I felt that how much India had to struggle for freedom, how many freedom fighters had to sacrifice, how many years spent in jails.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved a lot at a very young age, so I request you to give some messages to the generation of today.
I am happy that the younger generation is interested in knowing our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Many years ago I went to Andaman Nicobar.
The cellular jail went to see.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a maji Janmath book in jail.
Poems used to write, write on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
The freedom fighters would have suffered tortures.
When Savarkar ji's maji was born, I read a book and from that I got inspiration to see the cellular jail.
There is also a light and sound show programme that is very inspiring.
There was no such state in India, there would be no language speaker of India who had not been able to supplement his youth in the jail of Andaman, who was suffering from black water for freedom.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji, the people of every language, every province and every generation had suffered tortures.
I would surely say to the younger generation of the country that the torture of the freedom we have received was suffered by the people, how many sufferings we had suffered, if we go to Cellular Jail, why was it called black water
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connect from natural means to nurture the Better Planet.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say several times that the world that we will not see is our duty to worry about it too, we also care about it.
Open the windows of the room, open the door, breathe the fresh air - a new consciousness comes.
A new energy emerges in our body, when the punch is connected to the ghosts that are made up of the body, a new consciousness appears in our body.
We have experienced this, but we do not register it, we do not add it to a thread and a formula.
After this, you must see that whenever you are in touch with the natural situation, a new consciousness will emerge in you and therefore, the global campaign to join nature of 5th June should become our own campaign.
Our ancestors protected the environment, we are getting some benefits from it.
If we protect, then our future generations will get the benefit.
Earth and environment are considered to be the root of power in Vedas.
And Atharvaveda is completely, in a way, the biggest guiding book of the environment and has been written thousands of years ago.
It is said here that Mother Land: Sons are importantly separated :
Vedas have said that the purity that is in us is due to our earth.
The earth is our mother and we are their sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, one thing is highlighted that Mahatma Buddha was born, he achieved knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana, below the three trees.
These days I keep getting news from the states.
A very big campaign of plantation runs as soon as the rain comes in almost all the states.
Crores of plants are planted.
Children of the school are also connected, social-service organisations join, NGOs join, the government itself takes initiatives.
This time we also promote and contribute to this work of plantation in this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has now become the first day for the world to go to 21st June.
The whole world celebrates it as World Yoga Day.
In a very short time, this World Yoga Day of June 21 has been failing in every corner, connecting people.
On one hand, many powers of scattering are showing their distorted face in the world, in such a situation, the world has a great contribution to India.
We have added the world to a source through yoga.
Like Yoga, body, mind, intellect and soul, Yoga is connecting the world today.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to emerging responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to live a life free of stress.
And this situation has reached even at the young age of seeing this thing.
Yoga's role is important for taking unpleasant medicines and passing the day, to live a stress-free life in such a hour.
Yoga is the guarantee of both wellness and itness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through yoga to experience the interval of health from the body, from the body, from the thoughts, from the ideas and from the practice.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world about Yoga Day.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to yoga, some rewards have been announced.
Gradually work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and said to me that you appeal that this time three generations of the same family will do yoga together on the third International Yoga Day.
Grandfather or grandmother or grandmother, parents, sons and daughters, all three generations should do yoga together and upload their pictures.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be such a comfortable coincidence that Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that as we had launched a campaign for the Seliewith Daughter and had a very interesting experience.
These three-generation pictures will surely be complimented for the country and the world.
You must send a picture to me on the Narendra Modi App, wherever the three generations do yoga on MyGov, all the three generations together.
Tomorrow, this will be a picture of today and tomorrow, which will be the guarantee of the beautiful tomorrow.
I invite you all.
We have about three weeks for International Yoga Day.
You also propagate the subject of yoga for three weeks, spread, add people.
In a way, this is the movement of preventive health care.
I invite you all to join it.
This phone call will also showcase you: Pranam Modi ji, I am from Naina Mumbai.
Tomorrow I always see Modi on TV and in social media wherever you go, people of that place pay special attention to cleanliness.
On your call, Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission.
Big and big, children have also been aware of cleanliness.
Many times they have seen the elders spreading dirt on the road, stripping them.
There the government machinery works for cleaning but these days there is a celebration of cleanliness in the society too.
Five days before my departure, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are a lot of cleaning programs.
The media also gives him a big priority and just a few days ago I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
There was a big cleaning campaign.
I did not even see it added.
But when this phone call came, I also started thinking and I saw that yes, it is true.
You can imagine how enjoyed I am, how enjoyed and how the country is doing these things in a better way.
I am happy to note that cleanliness has also been added to my visit.
The rest of the preparations for the Prime Minister's welcome will be the habit of being prepared - but cleanliness will be a major thing.
It is enjoyable and inspiring for any sanitation lover in itself.
I congratulate all those who emphasized the work of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
Well, that's a funny suggestion.
I do not know, I will be able to do it or not.
Modi ji, while deciding your migration, tell those who ask for migration, what would be the level of cleanliness if I have to call
On the basis of how much tons of garbage you will meet me, I will decide my stay.
Dea is very good but I have to think.
How big humanity will work.
One thing I would definitely like to say that we do not consider the waste that waste that waste is health, a resource.
Don't look at it as just a carbage.
Once we start accepting this waste and waste as health, many new ways of waste management will come to us.
With the help of the State Governments, the Government of India has decided to launch a major campaign of waste management with the help of the people representatives of the cities.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, solid waste, liquid waste will be available in nearly 4 thousand cities of the country.
Two types of garbage will be available, one of the green colors, the second of the blue color.
Like the waste of kitchen, vegetable peels, saved food, egg peels, trees and plant leaves etc. all these are wet wastes and put them in green garbage.
All these things are such that works in the field and if the color of the field is green, then it will be remembered what to put in the green waste.
Today I have to mention one thing with pride - even if a person decides in mind then how big a mass movement can be created.
The work of cleanliness is the same.
And the way they connected the people of the entire region and converted it into a mass movement, it is an inspirational example among themselves.
Riyasi Block of Jammu and Kashmir regarding Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, I was told that the Riyasi Block has been Open Defecation Free (Open Defecation Free).
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I was told that this entire movement has been released most of the women of that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He took out torch visits to make awareness and inspired the people of the house, streets and streets.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for the last 15 months, for the last 15 days, for the last 15 days, for the last three years, be it TV channels or social media, the accounting of the present government is going on.
I see this process as a very healthy science.
How has this 3-year term been done on every criterion
Every section of the society has analysised it.
And there is an excellent process in democracy.
And I clearly believe that the governments should be accountable in democracy, the people and the people should give account of their work.
I thank all those who took out time and discussed our work in depth, somewhere appreciated, somewhere support came, sometimes drawn shortcomings, I understand the importance of all these things.
Whether it is good, less good, bad, whatever it is, it is to learn from it and with the help of it it is to move forward.
Constructive criminalism emphasizes democracy.
For a conscious nation, for a conscious nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and as a common citizen, the impact of everything is on me as it is on the minds of any common citizen.
Somebody sees it as a communication, some people criticize it politically, but after such a long time I feel that when I started talking about the mind, I did not even think about it.
It seems as if I sit in the house between the family and talk about the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me by writing these things.
I am grateful to the President ji, the Vice President, the Speaker that he took time out and the people sitting in such a senior position gave this importance to the mind.
In a way, he gave a new dimension to the mindset.
Some of our friends were also talking to me when they were working on this book of mind.
Abu Dhabi is known as Akbar Saheb. Akbar Saheb proposed from the front that the topics that have been discussed in Mann Ki Baat want to prepare his sketch through his art and without taking a single rupee, to show his love, Akbar Saheb gave the form of a art.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, the next time when I meet you, the rains will have come in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have come up, the new education will start and a new pleasure, a new fragrance, a new fragrance.
Let us all move forward in love with nature in this environment.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
S.
Whether this aspect can be slightly emphasized in skill development
You take the cycle, but the three-heeler cycle that takes people and sometimes try to run
Most of the families in every corner of the country will be engaged in the health of their children .
Those who have lost their hearts will have some reliefs and where the zeam will run, there will still be a little preservation in those families.
But at such a time I will say that the last time I have spoken to the students about the mindset, listen again, those things will definitely benefit you at the time of the examination.
Today is 26th March
March 26 is Bangladesh's Independence Day
A historic battle against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh
And I wish Bangladesh to move forward, develop and assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development within this entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories, our shared heritage.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the composition of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913, he was not only the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize, but also gave him the title of Knighthood by the British.
And when the British killed the Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who had raised their voices and this was the period when a 12-year-old child had a deep impact on this incident.
In adolescence, the brutal massacre of Jallianwala Bagh gave a new inspiration to the child laughing in the fields and fields.
And in 1919, that 12-year-old boy Bhagat is the love of all of us, the inspiration of all of us - martyr Bhagat Singh
Three days before today, on March 23, Bhagat Singh ji and his companions, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that the incident of March 23 - the satisfaction of serving Mother Bharati on the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru - There was no fear of death
All the dreams of life were incorporated for the freedom of Mother India
And these three heroes are still inspired by us.
We will not be able to decorate the story of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words .
And the entire British kingdom was afraid of these three youths .
The jail was locked, the hanging was fixed, but how to move forward with them, the British were worried about it.
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23.
It was stolen, which is not usually done
And later, by bringing his body to Punjab today, the British quietly burnt it
Many years ago, when I had the opportunity to go there for the first time, I experienced a kind of vibration in that land.
And I would surely say to the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity, whenever they go to Punjab, they must go to the place of the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the time when the flame of freedom, its intensity, its expansion was increasing.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru inspired the youth for the armed revolution.
So just a hundred years ago - April 10, 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi had done Champaran Satyagraha
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the movement of India's freedom, Gandhi thought and Gandhi style, it was first seen in Champaran.
It was a turning point in the entire movement of freedom, especially in terms of the ways of struggle.
This was the period, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Kheda Satyagraha, the strike of the militarists in Ahmedabad, and the deep impact of Mahatma Gandhi's ideas and style of functioning was seen.
In 1915, Gandhi returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917, he gave a new inspiration to the country.
We cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our mind today.
Imagine that a person who returned to India in 1915, only two years of term
Neither the country knew them nor had their influence, it was the beginning now.
We can guess how hard they have suffered at that time, how hard they have to do.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that in which Mahatma Gandhi's organisation skills, Mahatma Gandhi's power to know the Nabs of the Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi, with his behaviour, to organise, motivate the poorest of the poor, the illiterate person to fight for the struggle, to bring them to the ground for the struggle, it sees a wonderful power.
And that is why in the way we experience the glory of Mahatma Gandhi
But if you think of Gandhi a hundred years ago, Gandhi with that Champaran Satyagraha, Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of very study for any person who starts public life.
We can learn from them how public life can be started, how much hard God has to do and how Gandhi did it
And that was the time when we listen to the names of big leaders, Gandhi had sent Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani ji, all of them to villages.
On one hand, filling the jail, on the other hand, spend yourself in constructive works.
A big wonderful balance was in the style of Gandhi's work.
What is the word Satyagraha, what can be disagreement, what happens in front of such a large calm - a whole new emotion was established by Gandhi, not by words, by a successful experiment.
Today, when we are living in the 21st century, who will be such a country that does not want to change India, who will be a country that does not want to be a partner for change in the country.
India is neither a government programme nor a political party's manifestation nor a project.
India calls for 1. 25 billion Indians
This is the feeling of how 25 million countrymen want to make a grand India together
There are many people who go to the hospital daily, help patients.
There are many people, they run for blood donation as soon as they know.
There are many people, someone is hungry, so they worry about his food.
Our country is multiple dwellings
Public service is the Lord-Service, it is in our ragas.
If once we look at it as a collectivity, organised, then how big it is
It is very natural for India to be criticised, discovered, look at it with different views and it is necessary for democracy.
But it is true that if 1. 25 billion countrymen resolve, decide the path to prove their resolve, take one step after another, then the dream of New India will prove to be true to our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all these things happen from the budget, from the government project, from the government funds.
If every citizen makes a pledge to follow the rules of the track, if every citizen makes a pledge that I will fulfill my responsibilities with honesty, if every citizen makes a pledge that one day in a week I will not use the petrol-diseal in my life.
You can see this country, which is dreaming of New India, 1. 25 crore Indians, will be able to see it in front of their eyes.
The meaning of saying is that every citizen should follow his citizen's religion, follow the duty.
Why shouldn't we also join Swaraj by disciplining our lives in this journey of Suraj
Let me invite you
My dear countrymen, I want to thank you today.
In the last few months, a large number of people joined the Digital Payment Digital Movement.
The curiosity has also increased, the poorest of the poor is also trying to learn and gradually people are moving forward without any cash business.
Since demonetisation ban, there has been considerable increase in different ways of digital payments.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
25 million Indians can resolve to work for 2.5 thousand crore digital transactions in this year
We have announced in the budget
We can do this in everyday life .
You don't imagine, but you can serve the country very big and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money, corruption.
In the past, there have been several programmes of Digidhan Mela for folk education and public awareness.
There is a resolution to do 100 programmes across the country
80-85 programs have been done
There was also a reward plan in it .
Nearly twelve and a half lakh people have received this reward of consumer .
14th April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar
The Digi-Mela will end on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
A hundred days is going to be completed and a last very big programme is going to be held
There is also a provision for a very big draw .
Let us contribute to how cash is less, how the behavior of notes is less.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that every time I ask for suggestions from people to talk about mind, many suggestions come.
But I have seen that there is always an insistence on cleanliness .
I have sent a message from Dehradun to a daughter named Gayatri, who is a student of 11th, who has sent a message: - Honourable Principal, Prime Minister, I bow down to you.
First of all congratulations to you that you have won this election with huge votes
I want to talk to you about my mind
I want to say that people have to explain how important cleanliness is
I'm going through the river in which people pour a lot of garbage and polluting the rivers.
The river comes through the Rispana bridge and comes to my house too .
For this river we took out a rally and talked to the people , but it did not benefit .
I want to tell you that by sending one of my teams or through Newspaper this thing is highlighted, thank you.
See, brothers and sisters, how much pain is the daughter of a 11th class
How angry is he looking at the garbage in that river
I consider it a good sign .
This is what I want, I want to get angry with the dirt in the minds of 1.25 million people.
Once there will be anger, anger will arise, anger will arise, we will start doing something against dirt.
And it is a good thing that Gayatri himself is expressing his anger, suggesting me, but at the same time, God is also saying that he made a lot of efforts, but failed.
He has also taken the form of a movement
And the fury of filth is increasing
Be it awareness, active participation, movement, it has its own importance.
But hygiene is more related to the habit of movement .
Work is difficult, but I have to do it.
I am confident that in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth, it indicates a good results in itself.
Whatever is listening to Gayatri in my mind today, I will tell all the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I am talking about Mann Ki Baat programme, I have been receiving several suggestions from the beginning and most people have expressed concern about food waste.
Half of them are not filled in the stomach and then leave them there.
You have ever thought that how much waste we do with what we leave these jokes.
Have you ever thought that if you do not leave the junk, then how many poor people can fill their stomachs
This is not the subject that has to be explained.
By the way, when mother serves young children in our family, she says that son, as much as you can eat, take as much as you can.
There is something or the other endeavour but still indifference on this subject is a social revolt.
Injustice to the poor
Secondly, if savings are saved then the family also has economic benefits.
Think for the society, it is a good thing, but this is the subject that the family also has the benefit.
I am not urging on this topic, but I would like this awareness should be increased.
You will get such people somewhere in every state of India.
Their life can also inspire the people not to join us.
We should take as much as we have food.
Look, this is the way for change.
And those who are aware of the health of the body always say that the belly should be slightly empty, the plate should be slightly empty.
And when it comes to health, it is World Health Day on 7th April, World Health Day.
The United Nations has set a target of health for all by 2030.
We are also familiar with the word expression, but if we have to make words, then some people also call it depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally suffering from expression.
The problem is that we cannot understand this in our surroundings too and perhaps we are also hesitant to speak openly in this subject.
He does not say anything because he feels a bit embarrassed.
I would like to tell the countrymen that the expression is not such that it cannot get rid of it.
A psychological environment has to be created and it starts.
The first mantra is, rather than the supersion of the expression, it needs its presidency.
What is happening to you among your friends, among friends, among parents, among brothers and sisters
Sometimes children living in the hostel of loneliness become more difficult.
If all the people are going out somewhere in the house then they say - no - no, I don't have to come today - I like to stay alone.
You have ever noticed why this does
You must assume that it is the first step towards expression.
If he doesn't like to stay in the group, he is going alone in one corner, then try to see that it doesn't allow it to happen.
Give him an opportunity to live in the middle of those people who speak openly with him.
Inspire him to express his joy and joy, expel whoever offers a leprosy inside him.
This is the best way
and expression becomes the cause of mental and physical diseases .
Like diabetes becomes the host of all kinds of diseases, the expression also destroys all our capabilities of fighting, courage, decision-making.
Your friends, your family, your premises, your environment - they can stop you from going to the presidency together, then you can bring it out.
There ' s another way I
Help me, share their happiness and grief, you see, the pain inside you will be eradicated.
If you try to understand their sorrows, do it with service, there will be a new confidence in you.
By connecting with others, by serving someone and selflessly serving, you can easily lighten the burden of your mind.
Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Treatment free from stress, liberation from pressure, journey towards happy mind - Yoga helps a lot.
21st June is International Yoga Day.
This will be the third year.
If there is any suggestion regarding the Third International Yoga Day in your mind, you must send your suggestions to me through my mobile application.
Whatever songs, poetry compositions you can prepare, it should be done so that people can easily understand.
I would surely like to talk to the mothers and sisters today because today the discussion of health has come out enough.
So in the past, the Government of India has made a major decision.
The women who are working class women in our country, the number of women in the working class is increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and it is welcome, but at the same time, women also have special responsibility.
The Government of India has made a big decision.
The women of the working class who have got the first 12 weeks of delivery, at the time of pregnancy, at the time of delivery and at the time of delivery will now be given 26 weeks.
There are probably two or three countries in the world, which are beyond us.
India has made a very important decision for our sisters.
And its original objective is to take care of that newborn, the future citizen of India, the right care of her in the early days of birth, if she gets a lot of love for her mother, then our children will become the trust of the country by becoming bigger.
Mothers health will also be good and that is why this is a very important decision.
And due to this, about 18 lakh women working in the formal sector will get the benefit of this.
My dear countrymen, the holy festival of Ramnavami on 5th April is Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
The life of all these great men continue to inspire us to resolve for a New India.
After two days Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, New Sanvatsar, Greetings to you for this new year.
This is the time for the farmers to get the fruits of their hard work after the spring.
This New Year is celebrated in different corners of our country.
Gudi-Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi as a New Year in Andhra-Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Sanvatsar Pooja in the area of Awadh, connected to Mithila in Bihar and Satuwani festivals in Magadh are held on New Year.
Innumerable, India is such a country full of diversity.
Cold weather is to go now
The season of spring has knocked us all in life
New leaves start coming in the trees after the fall
Flowers bloom
Gardens and gardens become green
The color of the birds begins to love the heart .
Not only flowers, fruits are also seen shining in the sunshine on the branches of the tree.
The fruits of summer start appearing in the spring of mango .
At the same time, the yellow flowers of mustard in the fields bind expectations to the farmers.
The serpents of the tasu or palash indicate the arrival of Holi .
Amir Khusro has described the moments of this change of weather .
The festival of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi puts colors of happiness in human life .
Love, brotherhood, in the atmosphere of humanity, we are going to leave Falgun last month and are ready to welcome the new month Chaitra.
You are the coincidence of these two months .
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions of citizens of the country that before the talk of mind, when I ask for suggestions, all suggestions come.
On Narendra Modi App, on Twitter, on Facebook, from Post, I am grateful to all of you for this.
And that is why he has said that I will give some information about the launch and interceptor mission of 104 satellites.
Shobha ji, you are very grateful that you remember the example of the pride of India.
Whether it is to deal with poverty, to prevent diseases, to connect with the world, to provide knowledge, information, technology, science has registered its place.
February 15, 2017 is a glorious day in Indias life
Our scientists have glorified Indias head in front of the world
SR has successfully launched 104 satellites in space, including USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and India through Mega Mission.
India became the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together.
And it is also a matter of joy that it is a successful launch of 38th consecutive PSU
There is a historic achievement for the SRC, but for the entire India.
Brothers and sisters, It is a very important thing in these 104 satellites - Cartosat 2 - This is the satellite of India and it will provide a lot of help to the pictures drawn through it, mapping of resources, infrastructure, assessment of development, planning of urban development.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters will help our new satellite artosat 2 on all these topics, how much water is available in the country and how it can be used for them.
Our satellite has sent some pictures as soon as it goes
He has started his work
It is also a matter of happiness for us that the leadership of this campaign has been done by our young scientists, our women scientists.
Such a strong participation of youth and women is a very proud aspect of the success of ISR.
I congratulate the scientists of ISR on behalf of the countrymen.
For the general public, for the service of the nation, for the service of the nation, for bringing in space science, they have always been maintaining their objectives and they are also creating new records.
These scientists and their entire team are as few as we congratulate.
Shobha ji has asked another question and that is about the security of India
India has achieved a very big achievement.
This thing has not been discussed yet, but Shobha ji's attention has been taken on this important thing.
This Mission with Interception Technology has achieved success by stacking the enemy's mission at a height of about 100 kilometres from the ground during its trial.
This is very important in the field of security .
And you will be happy to know that there are only four or five countries in the world who have this greatness.
When we see new technology, there is a new scientific achievement, we are happy to people.
And curiosity has played a very important role in the development journey of human life .
And those who have special intellectual talent do not let the curiosity remain as a curiosity, they also raise questions within it, find new curiosity, create new curiosity.
And the same curiosity becomes the reason for a new discovery.
They do not sit comfortably until they answer it
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years of human life, we can say that this development journey of human life is not a complete break.
Full break is impossible
The universe continues to strive to know the rules of creation and the mind of human beings.
New science, new technology is produced from it.
And every technology, the form of every new science, gives birth to a new age.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said that our younger generation should enhance the attraction of science.
The country needs a lot of scientists
Today ' s scientific causes a sustainable change in the lives of generations to come .
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a large unity competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Social useful innovation has been invited
Sometimes the problem also shows the importance of science to solve
The meaning of saying is that in society, there is a lot of people of such role in the country.
And our society is also becoming technology driven.
Arrangements are becoming technology driven
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our life.
Digi-dhan is showing big strength in the past.
Gradually people are moving forward from cash to digital currency.
Digital transportation in India is also increasing rapidly.
Locky Customer Scheme, Digi-Dhan Business Scheme have received huge support in our country in the past.
It has been almost two months, everyday 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees.
And it is a matter of great happiness that so far 10 lakh people have got reward under the Digi-Dhan Yojana, more than fifty thousand traders have got reward and more than 1.
Under this scheme, more than a hundred customers have received a reward of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received a reward of fifty thousand rupees.
Be it farmers, merchants, small entrepreneurs, professionals, domestic women, students, everyone is taking part in it, they are also getting benefits.
When I asked her analysis, you see only the youngsters who come to the age of adult, I am glad that those who receive the reward are 15 years old, then there are also sixty-seven years old elders.
From Mysore, Shriman Santosh ji has written on the Narendra Modi App that he got a reward of one thousand rupees under Lucky Customer Scheme.
Now they run cars, but in a way they have become ambassador of this scheme.
All the passengers are given the knowledge of digital all the time
They keep talking with such enthusiasm, encourage others as well.
I would urge the countrymen, the youth of the country and the Locky Customer Scheme either the Digi-Dhan Business Yojana that they have received, to make yourself an ambassador.
You lead this movement.
You should take this forward and this work in a way is a very important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
Everyone associated with this work is a new Anti-Corruption Cadre in the country.
In a way you are the soldiers of purity.
You know that Lucky Customer Scheme - 100 days when it is completed.
The birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April is a festival.
On 14th April, a pre-draw of crores of rupees will be drawn.
There are about forty-fifteen days left now.
Remembering Babasaheb Ambedkar , can you do one thing
Now Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary has gone.
This time Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and BI
I would like to say that Dr. Baba Saheb has laid the foundation for strengthening the foundation.
To reach BIM App to 125 crore hands by adding everyone to the house and house.
For the last two-three months, the impact of this movement has been made that a lot of success has been achieved in many townships, several villages and many cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has a huge contribution in the origin of our countrys economy.
The economic power of the village, strengthens the economic pace of the country.
I want to tell you about a very happy thing today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have laboured hard and filled grains.
The farmers' hard work in our country has resulted in record food production this year.
All the signs are saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time in the fields, there is such a flame, every day like Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is 8 more than the last record of the names of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I specially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I am happy that the farmers of my country listened to the voices of the poor and about two hundred ninety lakh hectares of pulses cultivated on the earth.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service to the poor of my country by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters are the officers of special thanks for the way farmers of my country worked hard on their heads and their eyes and produced a record of pulses.
My dear countrymen, it continues to run something or the other in this direction of cleanliness by the government, by the society, by the organisations, by the organisations, by everybody.
In a way, everybody looks aware of cleanliness in some form.
Government is constantly making efforts.
In the past, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, under the leadership of our Secretary, a programme of senior officers of 23 State Governments was held in Telangana.
And in the Warangal of Telangana State, not just the seminar in the closed rooms, but what is the significance of the work of direct sanitation and use it by using it.
Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise organised on 17-18 February in Hyderabad
The toilet pits of six households were cleaned up and the officers themselves showed that the two pit toilets used can be used and used again.
He also showed how convenient the toilets of this new technology are and there is no discomfort, no hesitation, which is a psychological barrier, it does not stop.
And we also clean more ordinary, we can clean a toilet pit.
And as a result of this effort, the media of the country has also promoted it very much, gave importance to it and it is natural when an ICT is being developed.
If the ASF himself cleans the toilet pit, then it is very natural to take care of the country.
And this is the cleaning of toilet pit and one of those whom you consider to be waste and waste but if you look at it in terms of fertilizer then it is a black gold in a way.
We can see what wealth is from waste.
And it is proved .
A standard Twin Pit Toilet for a six-member family - this model is filled in about five years.
After this, ease of eliminating waste can be redirected in the second pit.
In six to twelve months, the garbage deposited in Pit becomes completely decomposed.
It is very safe to handle decomposed waste and fertilizer is very important in terms of manure NPK
Farmers are well familiar with NPK.
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium - This is completed by nutrients and is considered to be the best fertilizer in the agriculture sector.
The way the government has taken these initiatives, others will have done such experiments very effectively.
And now in Doordarshan a special programme of sanitation news comes
The more such things will be highlighted in it, the more it will benefit.
Different departments in the government also celebrate Swachhta Pakhwada Regular.
In the first fortnight of the month of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development along with the Ministry of Tribal Airports Ministry is going to strengthen the cleanliness drive.
And in the second fortnight of March and two Ministries - Ministry of Shipping Shipping Ship Transport and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - these Ministries are going to take forward the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, the whole country experiences a new energy, increases confidence.
We all welcomed the performance that our Divyang players performed in Rio Paralympics.
In the final of the Blind T-20 World Up held this month, India defeated Pakistan and enhanced the glory of the country by becoming a World Champion for the second time.
I once again congratulate all the team players.
The country is proud of the achievement of these Divya companions
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, are determined, courageous, are resolved.
Every moment we can learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science - women of our country are not behind anyone
The footsteps are moving forward and illuminating the name of the country with their achievements .
In the last few days, Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy won the Silver Medal by our women players
My best wishes to all those players
8th March celebrates World Women's Day
In India, giving importance to daughters, increasing awareness about them in family and society, sensitivity increases
Beti Bachao Beti Teach this movement is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Today it is not just a government programme
This has become a campaign of social sensitivity and public education.
During the last two years, this programme has added general publicity, has forced people to think on this burning issue in every corner of the country and has changed the thinking of people towards the old customs that have been going on for years.
When the news is received that the festival was celebrated on the birth of the daughter, it is so enjoyable.
In a way positive thinking towards daughters is becoming the reason for social acceptance .
I have heard that the Uddalore district of Tamil Nadu has banned child marriage under a special campaign.
More than 175 child marriages have been stopped so far.
District Administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand daughters under Sukanya Samridhi Yojana
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all departments have been added to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana and efforts are being made to ensure the adoption of orphans and their education by the district administration as well as orphans.
A campaign is being undertaken for the education of villages and household daughters under every household knock programme in Madhya Pradesh.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to inspire the girls who had been drop-outed by running their child, their school campaign to re-elect them to school.
The meaning of saying is that this movement has also taken many forms of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao.
The entire movement has become a mass movement
New imaginations are associated with him
He has been turned as per local requirements
You are also associated with activism
You get to know a lot from me.
What is going on on the earth, what is going on in the minds of the village and the poor, it reaches me
I am very grateful to you for your contribution
Yesterday, Shri Krishna Janma Mahotsav celebrated across India
Someone can imagine that even after thousands of years, every festival comes with a new motivation, brings new inspiration and brings new energy and thousands of years old life is such that even today it can give examples and inspiration to solve problems, every person can find solutions to the problems of Shri Krishna and the problems of the present person.
Sometimes the task of raising rocks, sometimes taking meals, i.e. everything feels a newness and that is why today, when I am talking to you, then I take care of two Mohans.
A Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan, and the other Charkhadhar Mohan
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan left the shore of Yamuna, went to the coast of the ocean in Gujarat, stabilised in the city of Dwarka and the Mohan, born on the coast of the ocean, came to the banks of Yamuna and breathed the last breath of life in Delhi.
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan had used a lot of utilisation of his wisdom, his duties, his ability and his thoughts in the situations of that time, even thousands of years ago, to avoid the war, to avoid the struggle, to avoid the struggle and to tackle the struggle, and Charkhadari Mohan also chose such a way for freedom, to save human values, to save human values, to enable the basic elements of personality - for this, he gave such a form to the war of freedom that is strange for the whole world.
Be it the importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or the importance of smiling between all fluctuations in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna and that is why Krishna has also been known as Jagatguru.
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is busy preparing for another big festival and not only India but also in the whole world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi
He served the farmers who were being distinguished in Champaran, who served the mill laborers who were not being paid proper wages, they considered the service of the poor, the weak and the hungry people as the ultimate duty of their lives.
Whoever, whenever, whenever necessary, was always present for Mahatma Gandhi's service.
He not only emphasized the service but also emphasized the self-confidence associated with it.
The meaning of the word service is in the same sense that it should be done with joy - service Paramo religion :
But, as well as excellent joy, self-comfort: The feeling of this feeling is also in service.
This, we can understand the life of Bapu well.
This was all for Mahatma Gandhi, individual and society, humanity and humanity.
Whether it is Phoeni Farm in Africa or Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, in a unique way, they have always been stressed on social promotion community mobilization.
It has been my privilege that I have got the opportunity to visit several important places related to revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi used to emphasize the organization and feeling of service.
Community Service and Community Mobilisation is the feeling that we have to bring into our practical life.
In the true sense, this is the true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.
No countrymen
and collectivity has its own strength .
In the programmes of Gandhi 150, there should be collectivity and service.
Our ladies are clubs
He will continue to do the work of the Ladies Club of the modern era, but all the people of the Ladies Club will work together.
You can do a lot
To gather books old, distribute to the poor, spread knowledge, and I believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen have 130 crore imaginations and 130 crore undertakings.
There is no limit that has come in the mind - be it goodwill, goodwill, goodwill, and be it the service of complete dedication and that too is comfortable: - for the experience of an innovative joy
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha, Dandi is a very important turning point in the freedom movement.
In Dandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
The feelings arising from within your mind, any big literature will be more powerful and it may be that in today's times, in your eyes, in your pens, the form of Gandhi, perhaps it may be more relevant.
Several programmes, competitions, exhibitions have also been planned in the coming time.
But in this context one thing is very interesting that I want to share with you .
Haripura Panels was specially interesting in it .
You will remember that the Congress session was held in Haripura, Gujarat where the incident of Subhash Chandra Bose's Presidential electrification is recorded in history.
These art panels have a very beautiful past
Before the Haripura session of Congress in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal Nand Lal Bose of Shanti Niketan Art Building
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and showcase this heart work during the session.
This is the same Nand Lal Bose whose heart work increases the beauty of our Constitution .
gives a new identity to the Constitution
And his artistic practice has made Nand Lal Bose immortal along with the Constitution .
Nand Lal Bose visited the village around Haripura and finally made some cart canvas showing the lives of rural India
This invaluable artist had a tremendous discussion in the Enice.
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I would like to have some resolve from every Indian.
For the country, for the society, for someone else, something should be done.
This will be the best, true, authentic functioning of Bapu
The sons of Maa Bharti, you will remember that in the last few years, we run the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign across the country for nearly 2 weeks before October 2.
This time it will start from September 11
During this time, we will leave our homes and pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdan.
Whether it is home or streets, chowks or drains, schools, colleges to all public places have a great campaign of cleanliness.
In the same way, we have to end the system of collective use plastic.
This will save money and they will also be able to contribute to protecting the environment .
This time on October 2, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, on this occasion, we will not only dedicate them to the Open Defecation Free India but will lay the foundation stone of a new mass movement against plastic all over the country on that day.
Celebrate October 2 as Special Day
I also appeal to the corporate sector that when all these plastic wastes are collected, then come forward for its proper disposal, disposal arrangements.
This can be recycled
It can be made fuel
Thus , by this Diwali we can also complete the safe disposal of this plastic waste .
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit is in a way a gem of knowledge.
Whatever we need in life can get from it .
These days my contact has become very less but my contact was very much earlier .
foolish people call stones as gems
There is a great importance of food in our culture .
Until we have converted the knowledge of food into science .
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and infants, because this is the foundation of the future of our society.
Under the Poshan Abhiyan, nutrition is being made a mass movement through modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new and interesting ways
Sometimes one thing was brought to me.
Inside the Nashik , the whole of the paddy has become a big movement .
In this , in the days of harvesting , Anganwadi service collects a fat grain from people .
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women.
A person donating it becomes a kind of aware citizen social worker .
After that he himself becomes dedicated to this goal he becomes a soldier of that movement .
We all have heard about food processing in every corner of India in our families .
This ritual is done when the child starts feeding solid food for the first time .
Iuid not food solid food
Gujarat thought in 2010 that on the occasion of New Anna Prashan Sanskrit, children should be given complimentary food so that people can be alerted about it.
This is a very magnificent initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
In many states people run date food campaigns
If there is a birthday in the family, if there is a good day or a memorial day, then the family members go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food, tasty food, go to schools and the family members themselves serve children, feed them.
They also share their joy and pleasure .
A wonderful union of service and joy is seen .
Friends, There are many small things that our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, in the absence of awareness, poor and prosperous, both families are affected by malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as a Poshan Abhiyan throughout the country
You must join it, get information, you can also contribute some new pairs.
If you bring a single person out of malnutrition, that means we bring the country out of malnutrition
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there would be a lot of questions in this regard and that would happen and in the last few weeks, wherever I have met the people, the menvs.
With this expression, I have not only joined the youth of the world but also had never thought that I would become my place in young hearts in this way.
I never thought that the youngsters of our country and the world look forward to the diversity.
I never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the heart of the youth around the world .
And what happens
Just last week I went to Bhutan
I have seen that since I have got the opportunity to visit as Prime Minister and because of International Yoga Day, the situation has become such that if I go to anybody in the world then some five-seven minutes do not answer me about Yoga.
There will hardly be a big leader in the world who has not discussed with me about Yoga and I have experienced it all over the world.
But these days a new experience is coming
Anyone who gets the opportunity to talk, he discusses the issue of Wildlife and discusses the development.
Tiger, ion, livelihood and I am surprised how much interest people are
Discovery has planned to broadcast this programme in 165 countries in their language .
I hope that in such a way this programme will help the world familiar with the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity of nature in the ritual journey of India, this expression of discovery channel will help the world very well and now people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in our country.
But there is another interesting thing that some people also ask me one thing with consciousness that Modi ji should tell you that you were speaking Hindi and how was it so fast between you if you did not know Hindi
Has it been updated later
It's so frequently shot
They ask with great curiosity
Look, there's no secret in it.
Reality is that technology has been used in the conversation with Bear Grills.
So I used to say Hindi but it used to tell him that the dialogue would have become very easier because of this and this is the amazing thing of technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett, National Park.
You people also need to visit Nature and Wild Live Nature and places related to animals.
I have said before, I must say that you should go to the North-East in your life.
Inside you will expand
The country filled with diversity will also fill you with diversity as a teacher, as a teacher.
Last month I had the privilege of issuing Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
The population of tigers in India is 2967
A few years ago half of it was too difficult for us
Tiger Summit was held in Russia's South Petersburg in 2010 regarding tigers.
In this a resolution was taken while expressing concern over the decreasing number of tigers in the world .
This resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
We doubled the number of Tigers here in 2019.
Not only the number of tigers in India but also the number of protected areas and community services has increased.
When I was releasing the data of tigers, I also remembered the lion of Gir in Gujarat.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister there, the habitat of lions was shrinking in the forests of Gir
His number was decreasing
We took several steps after one in Gir
In 2007 the decision to deploy women guards there
Improved infrastructure to increase tourism
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife then only talk about conservation .
But, now we have to move ahead of conservation and think about compassion.
Our scriptures also have a very good guidance in this regard .
Therefore, we need not only conservation of our forests, vegetations and wildlife but also create an environment so that they can fruit properly.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda ji on September 11, 1893
This young saint of India, who shakes the human race all over the world, has left Indias rapid identity in the world.
The slave that the world was looking towards India with a very distorted sense, the words of a great man like September 11, 1893 Swami Vivekananda forced the world to change the view of seeing the world towards India.
Come on, Swami Vivekananda ji had seen the India that Swami Vivekananda ji had to go to India's capabilities.
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that on August 29, the National Sports Day is celebrated.
This will be a big interesting campaign for everybody for children, elderly, youth and women and it will be yourself.
But I ' m not going to tell his nuances today
I want to make you aware of itness and set some goals together for the country for it India.
My dear countrymen, I will wait for you on 29th August in India
Let's go with a new zeal, new resolve, new power.
My dear countrymen, today we will meet so much again in the matter of mind
I'll wait for you, your suggestions.
Let us all come together to realise Gandhis dreams to make India of the dreams of freedom fighters.
Let the joy of the inner , expressing the joy of service .
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
26th January, our Republic Day celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in the corner of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, in a way this ritual is also a festival which also makes the future generations aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities.
But still in our country, the duties of the citizens and the rights of the citizens - the detailed debates that should be discussed, the widespread discussions that should be discussed are not yet happening.
I hope that at every level, every time, as much as the force is given on the rights, the same emphasis should be given on duties.
Only on two tracks of rights and duties, India's democracy can move forward at a fast pace.
Yesterday is January 30, our devotee Bapu is the death anniversary.
On January 30, we pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by keeping them silent at 11 o'clock in the morning, 2 minutes.
As a society, as a country, it should be a comfortable nature of paying tributes at 30th January, 11 pm.
Why not be there for 2 minutes, but there is also a collectiveness, determination and reverence to the martyrs.
In our country, there is a simple respect for the army, towards the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave and gallantry awards who were honored with them and their families.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal and many categories.
When they know deeply about their courage, gallantry, purity, we also get surprise, pride and inspiration.
On one hand, we were all happy with the news of the zeal and enthusiasm of January 26, at the same time, the army personnel who were engaged in the defense of the country in Kashmir have achieved bravery due to avalanches.
I respectfully pay homage to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are well aware that I continue to talk about the mind.
January, February, March, April - all these months take place in every family, in the criteria.
One or half of the household is feeding for two children but the entire family is suppressed by the weight of Ceam.
So I decided that this is the right time that I should talk to the students friends, talk to their innovators, talk to their teachers because for many years, where I went, where I got it, the exam was a big problem.
Family disturbed, student disturbed, teacher disturbed, a big strange psychological environment looks at every household.
And I have always felt that it should come out of it and that is why I want to talk with young friends in detail today.
I got a telephone message of creation.
So I want to ask you so much that this atmosphere can't be pleasant
Well, the question has been asked by the creation, but this question will be in your mind.
Exams should be an opportunity of happiness in themselves.
It has been hard work throughout the year, now there has been an opportunity to tell, this festival of enthusiasm should be such a festival.
There are very few people for whom there is a place of exploration in the air, excellence is a presurrection for most of the people.
You have to decide that you will consider it as a pleasure that you will consider it as a presurre.
Whatever pleasure will be considered, it will be found that it will regret the presurrection.
And that is why I believe that the examination is a festival, take the examination as if it is a festival.
And when the festival takes place, when the festival takes place then the best among us comes out.
The feeling of the strength of the society is also at the time of the festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
Even in Ceam, there should be an atmosphere of festivals between friends and friends in the entire family.
You can see that this process will be conversed in place.
Festival atmosphere will make the burden free.
And I urge parents to create an atmosphere of festivals for three-four months.
It is true that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these examinations are conducted for three-four months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to convert these three-four months into festivals by taking their traditions, taking the environment of our families every year.
And you must have seen that when you are happy, smile, then you find yourself relaxed, you are easily relaxed and when you are rela then your years old things are also easily remembered.
A year ago what Teacher said in the classroom, the whole scene is remembered.
And you should know that the power to recall the memorial is the highest in the release.
If you are in tension, then all the doors are closed, do not go inside, do not come out inside.
There is a stalemate in the thought process, it becomes a burden in itself.
How did you remember out
But who was inside, came out immediately and came out because you were relaxed.
And that is why if there is any medicine for memorial recall then it is a relation.
And I tell myself that if it is a presurre, then we forget our things and rela, then we can never imagine, suddenly such things are remembered, they are very useful.
But when the tension takes place then your knowledge, your knowledge, your information gets buried down and your tension gets rid of it.
And that is why it is necessary that A Happy Mind is the sector for a good mark-sheet. Sometimes it seems that we cannot see the examination in the proper perspective.
It seems that he is a question of life and death.
Whatever exemplary exam you are going to give is the exemplary of what you have studied throughout the year.
This is not the criterion of your life.
What kind of life you live, how you live, how you want to live, it is not a zeam.
In your life, in classrooms, innotebooks, there will be opportunities for passing through many tests.
And that is why the exam has to do something with the success and success of life, get rid of such burden.
They went to the Air Force to be admitted, failed.
Believe me, because of that failure, if he was despaired, lost his life, would India get such a big scientist, such a big President could not get it.
The marks have become the most important.
Because of this, competition has increased very much, as well as stress has also increased in the students.
I would like to be aware of your ideas by taking this current direction of education and its future.
By the way, he has answered himself, but Cha wants me to keep something in it.
Marks and marks-sheets are a limited use of it.
Everything that happens in life.
Life goes on how much knowledge you have earned.
Life goes that you have tried to live what you have to go
Is there any coordination between your mission and ambition that you have got a sense of mission
If you believe in these things, you will be behind you by pressing the marks asking you will never need to run behind the marks.
You are going to work in life, skills are going to work, self-confidence is going to work and will work.
You should tell me that there will be a doctor of your family and all the family members will have a family doctor.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger cases, do you see the marks-sheets of that lawyer
You see his experience, his knowledge, his success journey.
And that is why the mark that is the burden of it sometimes stops us from going in the right direction.
But this does not mean that I should say that just, it is not to read.
It needs to be used for your criterion.
I was yesterday, I said today, he needs to know.
But if you occupy the marks then you gradually shrink yourself and limit yourself to a certain area to get marks only.
It may be that despite being promising in Ceam, sometimes fails in life.
Cha ji, one thing has also said that competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
There is a specialty of the life of most successful players that they compete.
If we inaugurate Mr. Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Twenty years continuously breaking their own records, defeating themselves every time and moving forward.
He has a wonderful life journey because he has adopted the path of more competitiveness than competition.
Friends in every field of life and when you are going to give zeam, if you could read two hours beforehand, can you do it for three hours
From inside, that energy is produced by itself.
If you are better then you will be careless, you will be filled with very faith.
If you mistreat him, you will be sad and disappointed, you will be filled with jealousy, that jealousy will be eaten to you, yourself and if it is equal, you will never feel the need for improvement.
How to do it before, how to do it, how to do it well, just focus on it.
You see, you will feel a lot of changes.
S. Sundar ji has expressed his feelings about the role of parents.
They say that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
He further wrote that my mother was not read-written, yet she used to sit with me and asked me to solve the question of mathematics.
Once you will learn to face, the maximum problem will end.
Acceptance opens a way to solve problems.
Expectations make the path difficult.
Accepting the situation, giving opportunity to open new paths and therefore accomplish what is there.
You will also be burdened free.
If one of our acquaintances was in the hospital due to heart attack, then the first speaker of the Lok Sabha of our country, Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, his son Purushottam Mavalankar, had ever been a MP, he came to see his health.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not ask any question about his health.
As soon as they sat and came, what is the situation there, what is the disease, nothing, quietly started to hear and in the first two-four minutes, they made such an atmosphere light.
In a way, we go to a sick person as we scared of illness.
I would like to say to the parents, sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have you ever felt that in the days of Ceam, give children an atmosphere of laughter and happiness
You see, the environment will change.
I have come to the phone call of a big wonder.
They do not want to tell the gentleman his name.
Listening to the phone, you'll know why he doesn't want to tell his name
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I can't tell my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
I tried to duplicate once in my childhood, for that I started preparing a lot that I tried to find the ways I could duplicate, due to which my entire time wasted.
In that time, I could have read the same number as I spent spending my mind to copy.
And when I tried to pass it by copying it, I was caught in it and because of me, many friends around me had a lot of trouble.
Your point is right.
These short-cut roads are the reasons for copying.
So the copy never benefits.
Copy makes you bad, so don't copy.
You must have heard many times and again that do not copy, do not copy.
I'm telling you the same thing again.
And once there was a habit of copying, there would never be a desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach
Whatever is your entire creativity, they spend in the ways of copying and if they give the same time on the issues of creativity, then perhaps there is no need for copying.
The consequences that will be achieved by the hard work of your Lord will increase the confidence that will be wonderful.
This basic perception is wrong, the root of the problem is that.
If we have to develop integral, then there is a life outside books and it is very large.
This is the time to learn to live him too.
Someone should say that I will complete all the examinations first, will play later, later it will do it, it is impossible.
Have you ever thought that when all this is in front, then come out two moments and look at some trees and plants, slightly lighten the mind, you see, with a freshness, you will come back in your room and in your books.
Whatever you are doing, take a little break, get up and get out, get out of the kitchen, find something of your choice, get a biscuit of your choice then eat and enjoy a little joke.
Whether it is five minutes, but you break.
You will feel that your work is becoming simple.
Everyone likes it or not, I do not know, but I have experience.
There is no need to stay in the room to take a deep breath.
Come below the open sky, go to the roof, sit down for yourself after taking a deep breath of five minutes, you can see that the body will be relaxed with one another and the relaxation of the body that you experience, not the brain organs will be relaxed as much as possible.
When I hold meetings in the elections, my voice sometimes sits.
So I came to meet a folk singer.
They came and asked me - How many hours you sleep.
I said - Why brother, are you a doctor
No-No, say- This is your voice that gets worse by speaking at the time of election, it is related to it.
You will take full sleep, only then your vocal card will get a full rest.
Now I had never thought of sleep and my speech and my voice, they gave me a herb.
So we really understand the importance of these things, you see, you will be benefitted.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping, but some will say that the Prime Minister has said, now there is no need to wake up, keep sleeping.
So do not do this, otherwise your family will get angry with me.
And if your marks-sheets will come on the day you will not show them, I will see them.
So do not do this.
And that is why I will say that this is a very big medicine to keep the mind, intellect, the body aware of the games played by the POF for Prapared and POF for Play.
Well, young friends, you are in the process of exams and I am sitting in mind.
Maybe these things of today will also do the work of relation for you.
If possible, do not, do not do it, otherwise it will also become a burden.
So, as I advise your family's parents not to be burdened, they also apply to me.
Make the criterion a festival to cross every criterion.
Then there will be no criterion, criterion.
Take this mantra forward.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that Coast Guard has placed its place among the world's 4 largest Coast Guard with all its 126 Ships and 62 aircraft built in the country.
While characterising this ideal sentence, the youth of the Coast Guard are ready to protect the maritime boundaries and maritime environment of the country in adverse circumstances.
And very few people will know that there are not only men in the Coast Guard in our country but women are also playing their responsibility in the same way by mixing their shoulders with their shoulders.
Our women officers of Coast Guard are Pilots, work in the form of servers. Not only this, they also take over the command of overcrats.
Vidya is considered as an opportunity to worship.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
Give my color to Basanti Chola - This is the same inspiration.
Greetings to my countrymen on the auspicious festival of this spring Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani always keeps filling with his imagination.
Since last month, he has started listening to the mind in regional languages immediately after completion of my mind.
It has received widespread approval.
People from far and wide are writing letters.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to join you.
Many best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
However, in the newspapers, new people are being caught every day, notes are being caught, raids are being carried out, good people are being caught.

Last month we were all enjoying Diwali
Like every year, on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the jawans.
I go every time, but the experience of this Diwali was something else.
The country's 1. 25 million countrymen, in a unique style, dedicated to the jawans of the Diwali, dedicated to the security forces, the impact of this was expressed on the faces of every jawans.
He looked full of feelings and not only that, the good wishes and messages that the countrymen sent, the security forces of the country were a wonderful response.
And people sent messengers only, not so, they were associated with the mind.
Somebody wrote poems, someone made pictures, someone made cartoons, someone made videos, i.e. nobody knew that every house had become a post of armymen.
With the contribution of all of you, the feelings of the soldiers of the country will be collected in this book with your imagination and your spirit towards the security forces of the country.
A soldier of the army wrote to me - Prime Minister ji, Holi for the soldiers, Diwali happens on the border, every time they are immersed in the security of the country.
Yes, yet, at the time of festivals, the house is remembered.
But tell the truth, this time it did not seem like this
It didn't happen that there is a festival and I'm not home
It felt as if we are also celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, the feelings that have awakened between the security forces of our country and the security forces in this environment should be confined to just a few occasions
I express my appreciation to you that we must remember the soldiers of our country in some form or the other form of a society, as a society, as a nation, as a nation, as a nation, whether it is a festival or a festival of happiness or an atmosphere of happiness.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases by 125 million
Some time ago I had come from Jammu and Kashmir to meet all the heads of the village there.
I got the opportunity to talk to him for a long time .
He had brought some things about the development of his village, had come with some demands, but when the talk was going on, it was natural, the situation of the valley, the law system, the future of the children, all these things were very natural.
And so lovingly, so openly, these heads of the village spoke, everything was about to touch my heart.
I had urged them to focus your attention on the future of these children .
Today, I am happy that all the Prime Ministers from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promises made to me.
Going to the village and awakened all the people away .
Just a few days ago, when the border was examined, the sons and daughters of Kashmir took part in the examination of the border, about 95, Pachanbe, and students of Kashmir took part in the examination of the border.
Our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development through education and for the bright future.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the students for their excitement, but my heartfelt congratulations to their parents, their families, their teachers and all the village heads.
Brothers and sisters, This time when I asked for the suggestions of the people for the matter of mind, I can say that the suggestions of all have been made unilateral.
Everyone used to say that talk more about 500- and 1000-notes in detail
Well, on 8th November, at 8 pm, while addressing the name of the nation, I had discussed the beginning of an epic to improve the country.
Even when I had presented this decision to you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is to implement that decision
And I was also guessing that in our normal life there would be a lot of new difficulties .
And even then I had said that the decision is so big, it will take 50 days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards the normal stage.
The campaign to liberate those diseases that we are suffering from for 70 years cannot be simple .
I can understand your difficulties well .
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation
A lot of efforts are being made to make you confused, even though sometimes incidents of distracting the mind have emerged, you have well understood this path of truth, you have well accepted this thing of the country.
Five hundred and thousand notes and such a large country, a lot of currency, billions of notes and these decisions - the whole world is looking very closely. Everyone is evaluating and evaluating it.
The whole world is looking at the fact that the 125 crore Indians of India will succeed in facing difficulties.
Perhaps there can be a question mark in the mind of the world
India is only a reverence to the 1. 25 billion Indians, it is a belief that 1. 25 billion Indians will continue to fulfill their resolve.
And our country will come out with penance in every way like gold and its cause is the citizen of this country. You are the reason for this success.
All units of Central Government, State Government, Local Swaraj Institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than one and a half lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends - day and night are engaged in this work.
In the midst of the tension, all these people are working very quietly as a yagna of the service of the country and as an attempt to make a great change.
Start in the morning, when the night will be completed, it does not even know, but all are doing
And that is why India will succeed in it, it is clearly visible.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank, post office are working between such difficulties.
And when it comes to the issue of humanity, they see two steps ahead .
Somebody told me that an adult in Khandwa became an accident of human beings
Suddenly money was needed
He came to the notice of the local bank employee and I was glad to know that he went to his house and to the elderly so that he could be treated.
Such innumerable stories emerge every day in TV, in media, in newspapers, in conversations.
Their strength was introduced .
Today, once again, he has taken that challenge and I am confident that the resolve of 1. 25 billion Indians, the collective mandate of all will make this nation a new force.
But evils are so spread that even today some people do not get habit of evils .
Some people still feel that these money of corruption, these black money, these uninterrupted money, these anonymous money, some other ways and bring them back to the system.
They're looking for illegal ways to save their money.
Sadly , in this he also liked to choose a way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money in their accounts or doing some work from them.
But, do not play with the lives of the poor by compassionately
You don't do anything that the name of the poor comes on the record and when it is checked then my lover is troubled due to your sin.
And there is such a harsh law of Anonymous property, which is being implemented in it, how difficult it will be
And the government does not want our countrymen to have any difficulty
A marchman from Madhya Pradesh, Ashish, who has fought against corruption and black money through this five hundred thousand, has praised me for telephone: - Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare
I am a common citizen of Village Tirali, Tehsil Tirali, District Harda, Madhya Pradesh.
It is very commendable that the currency notes of five hundred rupees have been closed by you.
Likewise, I have come from Mr. Yelappa Velankar ji of Karnataka: - Modi ji Namaste, I am talking to Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal District of Karnataka.
I want to thank you from my mind because you said that good days will come, but nobody thought that you would take such a big step.
Five hundred and thousand notes, seeing all this, taught black money and lessons to corrupt people
Every citizen of India will never have a good day .
I want to thank you for this .
Some things get to know through media, through people, through government sources, the enthusiasm of working also increases very much.
It is so joyful that it is so proud that what is the wonderful power of the common man in my country
And people go there, eat food and after 2-4-6 days when they pass there again, they return the money again.
This is the strength of my country, including service, sacrifice and authenticity.
But I don't know that tea is discussed, marriage is also done.
I came to know that on 17th November in Surat, there was a marriage that took place with a discussion on tea.
In Surat, in Gujarat, a daughter who came to her marriage only gave tea and did not drink any tea, no food program - because there was some difficulty due to the ban on bondage.
The processions also considered him the same honor
Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar of Surat - they have inspired themselves to contribute to corruption, against black money and in the fight that is going on through their marriage.
I also give a lot of blessings to the newly-familiar Bharat and Daksha and congratulating the occasion of marriage to this great yagna and turn it into a new opportunity.
Tea workers live and tea workers get money weekly
Now the note of 2000 rupees was found, then what did they do
The women of four hundred and a half women gathered together and the four bought them together and paid a note of Rs. 2000, they did not need a small currency, because the four bought them together and decided that they would get the next week, then we would take account of them.
People are looking for ways themselves
See how the life of the village is also changing.
Some people have got immediate benefits of this campaign
The country will get the benefit in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefits.
Every municipality has a difficulty of 50 taxes
But this time due to this decision of 8th date , all people ran to deposit their old notes .
In 47 urban units last year, a tax of about three and a half thousand crore rupees was received.
You will be surprised to know, you will also be happy - they have deposited Rs 13,000 crore in this week.
Said three and a half thousand and said 13 thousand
And that too came from the front
Now if this money has come up 4 times in that municipality then it is natural that there will be arranging utensils in the poor settlements, water will be arranged and anganwadi will be arranged.
There are many examples in which its direct benefits have also been seen.
Brothers and sisters, Our village, our farmers are a strong axis of our country's economy.
On one hand, due to this new change in the economy, between difficulties, every citizen is adjusting himself.
But I want to specially congratulate the farmers of my country today.
I was just taking the figures of sowing this crop
I am happy whether wheat, pulses, oilseeds, till the 20th of November, sowing has increased considerably as compared to last year.
Between difficulties, the farmer has discovered the paths.
Government has also made several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority.
Even after that there are difficulties but I am sure that the farmers who are suffering from all our difficulties and natural difficulties are always standing at the same time.
Small traders of our country, they also provide employment and also increase economic activity.
Millions of crores of rupees have been given to such small people from the money scheme because they do small businesses, millions of people do and speed up the business of billions of rupees.
But due to this decision it was natural to have difficulty too .
But I have seen that now our small businessmen are also serving customers through technology, through Mobile App, through mobile bank, through credit card, in their own way, on the basis of confidence.
And I want to tell my small business brothers and sisters that there is a chance, you also enter the digital world.
You also download the App of banks on your mobile phone
You also keep PSL machine for credit cards
I invite you that you can contribute to making a cashless society, you can create a whole banking system on your business, and today there are many ways except notes, so that we can run business.
There are technological paths, safe, security and is quick
I would like you to help me succeed this campaign, not only this, you also lead the change and I am confident you can lead the change.
I want to tell the labour brothers and sisters that you have been exploited.
There is a wage on the paper and when it is given in hand then it is another .
Sometimes the wage gets full, somebody stands outside, it has to be cuted and the labour force makes this exploitation a part of life.
With this new system, we want your bank accounts, your salary money deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages are followed.
And once the money has come to your bank account, you can also buy a small mobile phone or a big smart phone. Nowadays your mobile phone also works as an e-boatway.
Therefore, I urge the labour brothers and sisters to become a partner in this scheme because finally I have taken such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the farmers, for the labourers, for the deprived, for the deprived, for the victims, the benefits of this scheme should be met.
Today I specially want to talk to young friends
We say in the world with a jewellery that India is a country with 65 population, less than 35 years of age.
You young and young women of my country, I know that my decision has come to you.
I also know that you support this decision
I also know that you also contribute very much to this thing positively.
But friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true partner.
A wonderful opportunity to serve Maa Bharati has come to us, there has been an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
My young men, can you help me
Give me accompanied, it's not going to be so much.
As much as todays world experiences you, the older generation is not
Maybe the elder brother in your family will not even know and parents, uncles, uncles and maternal uncles may not even know.
You know what the App is, what happens, what happens online banking is, you know how online ticket booking is done.
Items are very normal for you and you also use it .
But today the great work that the country wants to do is our dream.
It's right that 100 percent of the cashless society is not possible.
And I want your physical help in this, need a time for God, a resolve for God and you will never disappoint me, I am confident because we all are the people who want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know how many opportunities are today for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking.
Every bank provides online facility
Wallet's straight means e-Batuwa
Many types of cards are available
Ordinary food phones can also be a cash transer
Whether it is dhobi, vegetable seller, milk seller, newspaper seller, tea seller, gram seller, everyone can use it comfortably.
And I have also emphasized on making this system more easier.
All banks are engaged in it, are doing it
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation that is unaware of it.
And all of you, I know very well, are active in this great task.
The kind of creative messages you give on WhatsApp - Slogans, poems, poems, stories, cartoons, new imaginations, laughing and joy - I see everything and the creation power of our younger generation among the challenges, it seems as if India was born in the field of war at any time, we are passing through such a big change.
But my dear young friends, I once again say, I need your help in this work.
G-Gi, I say again, I need your help and you, I am confident that millions of youngsters of my country will do this work.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business
You voluntarily have to lead this campaign to bring out these notes, to liberate the country from corruption, to get rid of black money, to free people from difficulties and problems.
Once you will teach people how to use Rupay cards then the poor will bless you.
If you teach these arrangements to the ordinary citizens then it will probably get rid of all the concerns and if all the youngsters of India feel like this, I do not believe that it will take more time.
Within a month, we can stand in the world as a new modern India and you can do this through your mobile phone, you can go to 10 households everyday and connect 10 households with it everyday.
This country has made a big revolution
My youngsters, I once again, once again ask you to take this campaign forward.
You must have seen that Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, is moving ahead with the campaign of cleanliness.
It seems that the subject of sanitation has spread in their ragas and then even on the birth anniversary of his father, he remembered the work of sanitation.
He has written that Harivansh Rai ji has a poem and he has written a line of soil, the mind of fun, the moment of life, my introduction
Harivansh Rai used to introduce his introduction through it.
My introduction to the soil, the fun of the soil, the heart of fun, the life of the moment, his son, Mr. Amitabh ji, who is running a mission of sanitation in his rituals, has written to me by using the poem of Harivansh Rai ji - Swachh Tan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, My introduction.
I respectfully bow down to Harivansh Rai ji
I also thank Mr. Amitabh ji for this kind of connectivity in Mann Ki Baat and for furthering the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now your thoughts through Mann Ki Baat and your sentiments keep me continuously connected to MyGov and Narendra Modi App through your letters.
Now it is a matter of mind at 11 o'clock, but in regional languages, it is going to start immediately after completing it.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is such a country that 365 days, in some corner of the country, some festivals are seen.
The people from afar will sometimes feel like the Indian public life, this is the second name of the festival, and it is also natural.
The festivals that have been traditional in India from Vedas to today have been a time-bound change festival, we have seen the courage to end the tradition of external festivals and changes in festivals according to the demand of time and society have also been easily accepted.
But one thing in all these can be seen well that this entire journey of the festivals of India, its expansion, its depth, its penetration in the masses, its original mantra is connected to the whole of the country.
Be it an extension of individual and personality, an attempt to expand the scope of our limited thinking, from society to the universe and make it through festivals.
All these things, our ancestors have joined the festival in a big scientific manner.
Today the whole world discusses development.
Nature-destruction is a matter of concern.
The festival of India is going to commemorate the tradition of tradition, nature and love, from the child to every person.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody has been a festival of responsibilities.
Nowadays, we celebrate Sunday, but those who are older generations, who are labouring classes, fishermen, you must have seen our tradition for centuries to celebrate Purnima and Amavasya.
That is, there was a tradition of celebrating the vacation here by connecting with the universe and science.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I said, every festival is an educational, it brings the understanding of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message to Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamaya - from darkness to light.
By burning the lamp of Deepawali, the blindness of the society which is shadowed, the person who is blind and shadowed is also free from the darkness and that is the festival of bringing light by burning the Diwali.
One thing we all know very well, go to any corner of India, go to the house of Amir-Se-Amir, go to the hut of the poor and the poor, in the festival of Diwali, in every family there is a campaign of cleanliness.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
If the poor will have their soil utensils, then the soil utensils also clean up such as just this Diwali has come.
Diwali is also a campaign for cleanliness.
But, it is time for time that not just cleaning the house, cleaning the entire premises, cleaning the entire village, cleaning the entire village, we have to expand our nature and tradition.
The festival of Deepawali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
In all the countries of the world, the festival of Deepawali is remembered and celebrated in some form.
Many governments of the world are also becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
The picture has been placed on Instagram and he has shared that picture with the world and has done it with great pride.
And what is the picture.
16 women MPs from the Englandapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament by wearing Indian saris and this photo viral has taken place.
And all this has been done on bankruptcy.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had come here, he said to me that I have to go back soon because I have to attend the Diwali celebrations there.
I mean to say that Deepawali, this festival of light is becoming an inspiration to bring the world community from darkness to light.
Together many firecrackers invite a very big accident to try to make a big voice of tax.
Never mind what things are around, there will be no fire anywhere.
In the days of Deepawali, the news of the accident, the news of the fire, the news of the death, makes a big concern.
And there is also a problem that in the days of Diwali, doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with their family in large numbers, then there is another crisis in the crisis.
It's not just one day.
Say Govardhan Pooja, Bhai Dooja, say Benefit Panchami, and take it to the light festival of Kartik Purnima, in a way a long period runs.
Along with this, we also celebrate the festival of Deepawali and also prepare for Chhath-Puja.
Chhath-Puja festival is a very big festival in the eastern region of India.
In a way there is a great festival, it lasts for four days, but it has a specialty - gives a great message to the society.
But the sayings are that Bhai, people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath-Puja is a festival in which the sun is also worshiped.
There is a great social message in it .
I would like to talk about the festival of Deepawali, say about Chhath-Puja. This is the time for all of you to convey my best wishes, but there is more time for me, thanks to the countrymen of Khaskar.
Our army personnel have been looting everything for the last few months, the events that have been taking shape.
On my emotions, the soldiers of the army, the soldiers of the security forces, this sacrifice, penance, hard work, my heart and heart are shadowed.
And one of the same thing was in mind that it was dedicated to the name of the bankruptcy security forces.
I invited the countrymen to Sandesh to Soldiers for a campaign.
But I want to say that today I want to bow down my head and say that there will be no human being in India, in whose heart there is pride for the army and the security forces.
The way it has been expressed, it is going to give strength to every countrymen.
We cannot imagine the security forces, so fond of encouraging and emerging as a message to you.
Whether it is a school, a college, a student, a village, a poor, a trader, a shopkeeper, a politician, a player, a cinema, a cinema, there will hardly be anybody who has not given it to the soldiers of the country, has not given a message to the soldiers of the country.
The media also reversed the occasion of expressing gratitude to the army and why not, whether it is BS, ROP, INDIA.
Whether it is Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Riles, Water Forces, Armys, Navys, Coast Guards, I cannot speak the names of all.
When we are in the mood of the festival, remember it at the same time, there is also a new strength in that memory.
Efficiency increases in a message and the country showed tax.
I really express my gratitude to the countrymen.
Many, who had art, did through art.
Sandesh to Soldiers on this ashtag, all such things have come in a symbolic manner.
I have sent a poem by Mr. Ashwini Kumar Chauhan, I would like to read it.
Ashwini ji has written - I celebrate the festival, I am happy, smiling, I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I am smiling, I am smiling, I am smiling, this is all because you are, I tell you today because you are the reason for my freedom you are happy, I sleep comfortably because I sleep comfortably because you are stationed on the border, you are bowing down to the mountain Ambar and the Chaman of India, you are the army of Ambar and the army of India.
My dear countrymen, whose mother is also full of army personnel and whose in-laws are full of army personnel, a sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Let us hear what the Fauji family says: - Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
Our younger brothers are getting a lot of incentives from the Sandesh to Soldiers campaign that has been launched on this Diwali.
I'm from an army family.
My husband is also Army Officer.
Myther and thether-in-law, both Army officers have lived.
So we are full of family soldiers and on the border we have many such officers who are receiving such good messages and are getting a lot of incentives in the Army Circle.
And I would like to say that along with Army Officers and Soldiers, their families and their wives also perform a lot of practices.
Thank You. My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the army are found standing on every frontier of life, not just on the border.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was free from defecation in the open.
Earlier, Sikkim was provinced, now Himachal also happened, Kerala is going to be on November 1.
The youngster of TBP, Shri Vikas Thakur - is originally from a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
So in the village he was probably going to be a village council at that time, he reached there and was discussing in the village meeting, construction of toilets and it was found that some families were unable to make toilets in the absence of money.
This development Thakur is a patriotic ecosystem of our country.
And then there was a need to refine the Himachal Pradesh Pen Execution.
Similarly, in Kerala, I really want to express my gratitude to the youth.
I came to mind that in the remote forests of Kerala, where there is no way, it can hardly reach that village after walking on foot throughout the day, it is also difficult to reach such a tribal panchayat Idmalakudi.
People never go.
Near that, in the urban areas, the students of engineering came to know that toilets are being constructed in this village.
NCC cadets, NSS students, engineering students, all together decided to build toilets.
The goods that were to be taken to make toilets, bricks, cements, all the goods that these youngsters took on their shoulders and went to those jungles of walking on foot throughout the day.
Work is going on at a very fast pace in all the states.
I have mentioned something.
The way he has taken up this work, the entire state, I am confident that soon the kerosene will be free.
How big changes will come, theft will also stop, the benefit of the environment will also be, the savings of our Foreign Exchange will also be saved and the convenience of the people will also increase.
Yes, there will be trouble, then the middlemen will have it, the dishonest will have it.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Everything of them should be said to the country even today, how to go, determines the standard for this.
Based on this standard, you decide.
There is a need for time that we will have to address the aspirations of the poor of the country.
To get rid of troubles, we have to take one step after another.
Why should not our old thinking be anything, but society has to free from the differences of son-daughter.
Now there are toilets for girls in schools and toilets for children too.
This is an opportunity for our daughters to feel discrimination-free India.
Though vaccination takes place on behalf of the government, millions of children are left out of vaccination and become victims of disease.
Mission Indradhanush vaccination is a campaign that is engaged in integrating the children who are left out, which gives children the strength to get rid of serious diseases.
After so many years of independence, after cooking the food on the wooden stove, the smoke of 400 cigarettes in the day should be taken to his body, what will happen to his health
It is an attempt to provide 5 crore families free of smoke to live and move towards success.
Small businessman, small businessman, vegetable seller, milk seller, candle shop runner, the moneylenders used to have such a fault in the interest of the moneylenders.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account, is a successful campaign for liberation of interest buyers.
The beneficiary will get the money directly to the banks through Aadhaar.
It is an opportunity to get rid of intermediaries in the lives of the common man.
A campaign is to run in which not just improvements and changes, but the path of liberation from the problem is being achieved and it is happening.
My dear countrymen, yesterday 31st October, the great men of this country - the unity of India who made the mantra of his life, showed him the festival of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels birth anniversary.
But the phone of a gentleman from Punjab, his pain, also touched me: - Prime Minister, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking Jasdeep from Punjab.
Sir, as you know that on the 31st of the date, Sardar Patel ji has a birthday.
And as we all know how the events took place in the country after his assassination.
Sir, I wanted to say how we can stop such unfortunate events that happen.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a person.
A Sardar, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, history is a witness to the fact that after Chanakya, the work of uniting the country was done by Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
The great man who did such a big bhagirath work, the successful effort to bring India down under a flag, salute that great man.
But it is also painful that Sardar Saheb lives for unity, because of his priority of unity, he was also a victim of anger, but never left the path of unity.
On the birthday of that great man who lives throughout his life for unity and on the birthday of Sardar, a page of injustice and history hurts us all.
However, in the midst of these problems, we have to move forward by taking the mantra of unity.
This is the strength of the country in diversity.
We also save the country from scattered thinking, scattered tendency.
Sardar Saheb gave us an India, the responsibility of all of us is to create a Shreshtha Bharat.
The original mantra of unity is the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
The journey of Sardar Saheb started with the struggle of farmers.
The farmer's son was.
Sardar Saheb played a very important role in reaching the freedom movement to the farmers.
The success of Sardar Saheb was the result of his organisation power and skill to make the movement of freedom as a power in the village.
But Sardar Saheb was just a person of struggle, not so, he was also a person of the structure.
Today sometimes we listen to Amul's name.
People are also familiar with every product of Amul today outside India and India.
But very few people would know that Sardar Saheb's divine vision was that he had imagined the unity of cooperative milk producers.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is a festival of light festival in the series of these Diwalis.
Guru Nanak Dev, his education and initiation is still a guide for the entire humanity, not only for Hindustan but also for the entire humanity.
Service, truth and Sarbat Da Bhala, this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
This was the basic mantra of peace, unity and goodwill.
Be it discriminatory, superstition, poetry, the campaign to liberate the society was in every matter of Guru Nanak Dev.
When there was a touching, untouchable, caste-religious, high-flower, its distortion, Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his ally.
Let us also, Guru Nanak Dev, who has given us the light of knowledge, who inspires us to leave discrimination, orders to do something against discrimination, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, if we have to move forward then who can be our guide than Guru Nanak Dev.
I also bow down to Guru Nanak Dev, when this light festival is coming.
My dear countrymen, once again, my best wishes to the soldiers of the country on this Diwali.
Your dreams, your resolves will be successful in every way.
I extend my best wishes to all of you.
Thank you very much.
In the last few days, in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir, in a terrorist attack, we lost 18 brave sons of our country.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
And that is why I would like to tell the countrymen this thing today and I would like to repeat what I had said on that day that I would like to repeat it again that the culprits would be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We're on our army.
I want to talk specially to the citizens of Kashmir today.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding anti-national forces well.
And as soon as they have started to understand the truth, they have separated themselves from such elements and walked on the path of peace.
Every parents want to work as soon as possible school-colleges.
The farmers are also feeling that their crops, fruits etc. have been prepared to reach the markets across the country.
Economic business also runs well.
And for the past few days, the business has started smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and goodwill are the way to solve our problems, the way for our progress is also the way for our development.
For our future generations, we have to cross new heights of development.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem together, take out the paths and also paves the best way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir, it is the responsibility of governance.
To make laws and orders, the government has to take some steps.
Sometimes people who think differently from what we think, keep new ideas.
In social media these days I get the opportunity to know a lot.
Every corner of India, the feelings of all kinds of people get an opportunity to know and promote democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harshvardhan of Class 11th held a different kind of idea in front of me.
He wrote that after the Uri terrorist attack, I was very distracted.
But there was no way to do and what a small student like me could do.
So I came to my mind how to work for the country.
And I pledged that I would study more than 3 hours daily.
I will become such a qualified citizen.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, at such a young age in this atmosphere of resentment, you can think healthyly, this is a matter of happiness for me.
But Harsh Vardhan, I will also say that the resentment in the minds of the citizens of the country is a huge value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri had made a great effort to touch this emotional world of the country in a very best way.
And he inspired Jai Jawan - Jai Kisan Mantra and inspired the common man of the country to work for the country.
Another way to express patriotism among the voices of bombs and guns is for every citizen, this was presented by Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to drive the freedom movement, when the movement was intensified and there was a need for a stop in the movement, he used to make that intensity of the movement inspired towards constructive works in the society.
If all of us are responsible for the army, the people sitting in the government should do their duty and with the responsibility of our countrymen, every citizen, the responsibility of this patriotism, we will also contribute to some creative contribution then the country will certainly cross new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T. S. Kartik wrote to me on the Narendra Modi App that the athletes that went to Paralympics have created history and their performance is the victory of human spirit.
Mr. Varun Vishwanathan also wrote on the Narendra Modi App that our athletes did a very good job and you should mention it in mind.
Not only you two, every person in the country has been an emotional interaction towards our sportspersons in paralympics.
Perhaps more than sports, this paralympics and the performance of our sportspersons have completely changed the perspective of humanity, the perspective of looking at Divyang.
And I will never forget this thing of our winner sister Deepa Malik.
When he received medal, he said that with this medal I have defeated disability.
There is a lot of strength in this sentence.
This time in Paralympics, 19 thletes, including 3 women from our country, participated.
In comparison to the rest of the sports, when Divyang plays, physical capabilities, skills of sports, this is the biggest thing - will power, will power.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won 4 medals by performing the best so far - 2 Gold, 1 Silver, 1 Kasya Medal.
Debendra Jhajharia, a brother who received the world medal, brought the world medal again and brought it again after 12 years.
And they were not Divya from birth.
He had to lose one of his hands due to electricity current.
You should think that the person who gets the first world medal at the age of 23 and gets the second world medal at the age of 35, how big he would have done in life.
Mariyappan won a gold medal in Thangavelu High Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of only 5.
Poverty did not even come under their determination.
Neither he is a resident of a big city, nor is he from the middle class rich family.
Despite passing through difficulty in life at the age of 21, despite physical difficulties, he gave medals to the country with the ability to resolve.
In the name of Athlete Deepa Malik, many victories have been associated with their name.
Varun C. Bhati won a bronze medal in high jump.
These medals have done a lot to look at the medals of Paralympics and their magnificence in our country, in our society, in our neighborhoods and in our disabled brothers and sisters.
Our sensitivities have been awakened, but the vision of looking at these persons with disabilities has also changed.
Very few people will be aware of how the persons with disabilities have done this in the paralympics of this time.
Just a few days ago, there was a lympics competition in the same place.
Anyone can think that the record of the general lympics was broken and broken by the people of Divyang.
This time it has happened.
In the lympics competition of 1500 meters, the world medal record that was created by the person who had made it, the Abdellati Baka of Algeria made a new record in the race of 1500 meters in less than 1.7 seconds.
Not only this, I was surprised that the fourth of the persons with disabilities who had not got any medal as a runner, had run in less than the world medal in the general runners.
Once again, I congratulate all these players and in the coming days, India is moving forward towards making a smooth plan for Parallimpics and for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat.
He also told me some part, and that I presented it to the people there, people were surprised.
On that day, I got the opportunity to dedicate a book and collected successful stories of the lives of some persons with disabilities.
There were big inspirational events.
The Government of India has recorded the world on Navsari's land, which I consider to be important.
Within eight hours, six to six persons with disabilities, who could not hear, successfully used to feed machines to listen to them.
He got a place in the Guinness Book of World Record.
It is a matter of pride for our countrymen to have three or three world records by the Divyangs in the same day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we started the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of worshipped Bapu.
And that day also I had said that cleanliness should become a habit, it should be a duty of every citizen, it should be an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt.
Now, when two years are taking place on 2nd October, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 1.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today we can all say that everybody has tried to move forward.
Meaning that the country has moved forward towards cleanliness.
This has also been confirmed, the direction is correct, the fruits are good, what is happening with a little effort, it has also been seen and that is why everybody, whether it is a common citizen, whether it is a government office or a road, whether a bus stand or a railway, a school or a college, a religious place, a hospital or adult, a village poor, a farmer women, everyone is contributing something within cleanliness.
Media friends have also played a positive role.
But the beginning has improved, the efforts have been made, and we will succeed, this belief has also arisen.
This is also necessary and if we talk about rural India then so far, about two crore twenty-five million toilets have been constructed and in the next one year there is an intent to build more than one and a half crore toilets.
I just went to Gujarat, then the officers told me that Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will prove the goal of Porbandar on October 2.
Congratulations to those who have done this thing, and congratulations to those who are trying to do this thing, and I urge the countrymen to take a pledge and move forward for the sake of mothers and sisters and for the health of small children.
Especially, I want to present a scheme for young friends who nowadays use a lot of technology.
Everyone has the right to know what the cleanliness mission is in your city and for this, the Government of India has given a telephone number - 1969.
We know, Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and celebrated the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019.
These 1969 numbers - You will not only be able to know the situation of construction of toilets in your city but also apply for construction of toilets.
The Government of India has also expedited the corporate world to come forward.
Please sponsor such youth professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts as a Swachh Bharat fellows.
This cleanliness campaign is not even a matter of being limited to rites.
Cleanliness becomes a nature, it is not enough.
In today's era, health connects with sanitation as well as revenue models are also compulsory.
We have to move forward with the Swachhta Mission as well as towards East to Compost.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the compost that is prepared from the waste.
These are provided to the farmers who want to go to organic farming.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, who have suffered a lot due to chemical fertilizer, if they need such fertilizer in some quantity then they should be provided.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing to this work as a brand ambassador.
It's a job to do.
Ministers from all over the country, Chief Ministers, Mayors from the metropolitan cities, commissioners - all these together are going to contemplate on this.
What can happen in technology
How can employment opportunities be increased in this
All the topics are going to be discussed.
And I see that there are fresh news for cleanliness.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and launched a Jagaran campaign for toilet construction.
He himself worked and contributed to constructing about 9,000 toilets.
In the past, you must have seen that a team led by Hing Commander Paramveer Singh, from Devprayag to Ganga Sagar, swimming 2800 kilometers and gave a message of sanitation.
The Government of India has also made a calendar of one year by its own departments.
Every department works on cleanliness for 15 days specially.
In the coming October, from 1st to 15th October, Rinking Water and Sanitation Department, Panchayati Raj Department, Rural Development Department - these three are going to work together by making a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective sectors.
And the last two weeks of October, 16th October to 31st October, three more Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing.
My citizens also request that if you have any connection with the work done by these departments then you should also join.
You must have seen that the survey campaign of cleanliness is also going on these days.
Once again, the condition of cleanliness was presented to the people of the country by surveying 73 cities.
Now there is a turn of more than one lakh people who are close to 500 cities and because of this, there is a faith in every city that let's go, brother, we have left behind, now we will do something good next time.
There is an atmosphere of competition for cleanliness.
I hope that all of us should contribute to this campaign.
October 2 is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is going to be two years.
I urge you to buy something or the other of Khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This time also I urge every family to have something of khadi so that Diwali can be burnt in the poor household.
On October 2, while Sunday, as a citizen, can we join ourselves somewhere in cleanliness
2 hours, 4 hours physically connect yourself to the work of cleaning and I tell you that you share me on the Narendra Modi App.
If you are video then share video.
See, with the efforts of the people all over the country, once again this movement will get a new strength and a new speed will be achieved.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a joy in yourself to give him life and no one should recognise him or not.
It is his campaign to bring food items, clothing, all these together to the needy people.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the streets and the families used to demand the old toys and those toys who used to come, they used to present them in the Anganwadi which was of the poor township.
This is a kind of donation festival.
I convey my heartfelt best wishes to those youngsters who are engaged in this work.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, today is the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and the centenary year of his birth from today.
The theory of the Sarvajan Hitay-Sarvajan Sukhay Antyodaya - this is their contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the welfare of the last person.
How can the poorest of the poor get the fruit of development
He had presented the entire economic agenda in every field of water and two words.
The country celebrated their birth centenary year as a poor welfare year.
We can liberate the country from poverty by going to the society, governments, everybody's attention, the benefits of development and the poor.
It is a symbolic form of the poor welfare year of the same century.
I respectfully bow down to Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji, the rich reverence of our ideological heritage.
My dear countrymen, I started talking about Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashmi.
It was my authentic attempt that it should not be a program of praising government works.
How the common man of this country inspires me.
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the manner in which you have praised Mann Ki Baat, the manner in which you have blessed.
I am also grateful to Akashwani that he not only broadcast these things but also made a lot of efforts to bring it to all languages.
I am also grateful to those countrymen who wrote letters after Mann Ki Baat, suggested the doors of the government, highlighted the shortcomings of the government and Akashwani made special programmes on such letters and called the people of the government and gave platforms to solve the problems.
So Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue, it has become a new opportunity for social transformation.
What can be the cause of great satisfaction for anybody and therefore, I thank everyone associated with making it a success.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durga-Puja next week, the festival of Vijayadashmi, the preparations for Deepawali, in a way a different atmosphere takes place in the entire country.
This is a festival of power and prosperity, the unity of society is the strength of the country.
Whether it is Navratri or Durga-Puja, how should it be a festival of worship of power, the worship of unity of society
How to make a festival connecting people
And that is the means of true power and then we can celebrate the victory of tax together.
Come on, take the sadhana of power, take the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on August 29, the magician of Hockey is the birth anniversary of Dhyan Chand ji.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day all over the country.
I pay homage to Dhyan Chand Ji and on this occasion I would like to remind you all of them of their contribution.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, he played an important role in giving India the gold medal of Hockey Hockey.
We all know the name of cricket lover Bradman.
He had asked for Dhyan Chand ji - We Scores Goals Like Runs. Dhyanchand ji was a live example of patriotism and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, an opposition player hockeyed the head of Dhyan Chand Ji.
There was only 10 minutes left to end the match at that time.
And Dhyan Chand ji made three rounds in those 10 minutes and said that I gave the revenge of the injury with a round.
My dear countrymen, however, whenever the time comes to mind, there are many suggestions on MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
I am seeing it a very positive thing for the common citizens to have so much affection, so awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to say something about it.
Beyond cricket, there is so much love for the citizens of India and sports, so much awareness and so much information.
Reading this message for me, this too became a cause of great inspiration in itself.
A Shriman Ajit Singh has written on the Narendra Modi App, please speak this time on his participation in the education and sports of daughters in Mann Ki Baat because he has made the country proud by winning medals in Rio Limpics.
Any Sriman Sachin writes that you are requested to mention the Indus, Witness and Deepa Karmakar in this matter of mind this time.
The medals we got, the daughters gave it.
Our daughters once again proved that they are not less than anyone in any way.
It seems like the daughters of the whole of India have taken the initiative to illuminate the name of the country.
Summit Thakur on MyGov has written that we could do better in the lympics.
He has written that honorable Modi sir, first of all congratulations for the two medals we won in Rio.
But I want to draw your attention to whether our performance was really good
And the answer is, no.
We need to set a long journey in sports.
Our parents still stress on studying and academics.
In the society, the game is still considered to be waste of time.
We need to change this thinking.
The society needs motivation.
And no one can do this work well with you.
In such a case, Shri Satyaprakash Mehra ji has written on the Narendra Modi App, there is a need to occupy mankind on curricular activities, especially by taking children and youth to sports.
Thousands of people have expressed this feeling in a way.
It can not be ruled out that we can not perform according to our hope.
In some cases it happened that those who were performing in India, who were performing in the sports here, could not reach there, even there and only two medals have been found in the medal table.
But it is also true that even if you look at medals, then for the first time in many subjects, India's players have shown a lot of good work.
Now, within the shooting, our innovative point of view, he was in fourth place and he lost the medal from a very small distance.
In Gymnastic, Deepa Karmakar also wondered that he was in fourth place and due to a little difference, he missed medals.
But how can we forget this thing that it is the first Indian daughter to qualify for lympics and lympic finals
Something similar happened in Tennis with the pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
We have performed well this time in the athletics.
After P.T. Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar qualifyed for track field finals.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years the women's hockey team reached the lympics.
Vikas Krishna Yadav reached the uarter-inal in Boing, but could not be able to brown.
Many players, for example - Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhoknal, Atanu Das are many names, whose performance is good.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we will continue to do the same, then perhaps we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
The Government of India will go under its depth and study what practices are being done in the world.
We will create a roadmap for what we can do well.
2020, 2024, 2028 - We have to plan with a distance thinking.
I also urge the State Governments to make such committees and what can we do in the sports world, what can our state do, what can the state do
And I urge every citizen in India to send me suggestions on the Narendra Modi App.
Write to the government, discuss Association and give your memorandum to the government.
State governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is a Teacher's Day.
I also learned a lot from these small children.
For me, on September 5 was also a Teacher's Day and for me, there was also a Day of Education.
But this time I have to go for the G-20 Summit, then I decided that today I will express my feelings and feelings in mind.
The mother's place in life is as much as teacher's place.
And we have seen teachers who are more concerned about themselves.
They spend their lives for their disciples, for their students.
These days, after the Rio Lympic, there is talk of Pullela Gopichand ji all around.
They are players, but they have presented an example of what is a good teacher.
Today I am looking at Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher besides a player.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji, his penance, his dedication to the game and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
The contribution of teachers in all of us is always felt.
On 5th September, Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji is the birthday of former President of India and the country celebrates him as Teachers Day.
They reached any place in life, but they always tried to live themselves as a teacher.
Sometimes I think that I remember so many stories of my teachers because they used to be our hero in our small villages.
But today I can say with happiness that one of my teachers - now he is 90 years old - even today his letter comes to me every month.
And even at the age of 90, I am surprised that even in this condition, he writes with such beautiful letters and my own letters are very bad, because of this whenever I see somebody's good letters, I am very respected.
You must share your teachers on Narendra Modi App, photographs with your teacher, any incident with your teacher, any inspiration for your teacher.
See, looking at the contribution of teachers in the country, it is also very valuable in itself.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival is going to be held in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a disintegration and we all want our country, our society, our family, every person and his life to be disintegrated.
But when Ganesh talks about the festival, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of the Public Ganesh Festival - this is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Through the Public Ganesh Festival, he made this religious occasion a festival of national awakening and a festival of social rites.
And through the public Ganesh Festival, there should be a huge discussion on the questions that touch the society and life, the creation of programmes should be such that the society gets a new energy and a new pace.
Even today, now not only Maharashtra but also in every corner of India, public Ganesh festivals have started taking place.
All the youngsters also make enough preparations to do it, enthusiasm is also very much.
And some people have still made a lot of effort to follow the spirit of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
He holds discussions on public subjects, essays compete, compete with Rangoli.
In the brilliant brilliances that touch the society, they also highlight the issues that touch the society in a artistic manner.
In a way, a massive campaign of public education runs through public Ganesh Festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspirational mantra that Swaraj is our birth and right.
Suraj is our priority, can we not give a message to the public Ganesh Festival about this mantra
Come on, I invite you.
It is true that the festival is the power of society.
Festival fills a new life in the life of a person and society.
Without the festival, life is impossible, but according to the demand of time, it also has to be driven.
This time I have seen that many people have written a lot on Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja - those things.
And they are worried about the environment.
He has said that Modi ji, you should explain to the people about Mann Ki Baat that do not use the statues of Ganesh ji made of the Plaster of Paris.
Why not use Ganesh ji made of soil of village ponds
POP statues are not friendly to the environment.
They have expressed a lot of pain, others have also done it.
I also pray to you all why not come back to our old traditions, the idols of Ganesh, the statues of Durga by using soil.
The protection of the environment, protecting our rivers and ponds, protecting the small animals of this water from the pollution in it - this is also the service of God.
Ganesh ji is a disgusting.
So we should not create such a Ganesh ji, who creates density.
I don't know how you will take these things.
Many such institutions, individuals work very hard for the Ganesh of the soil.
Co-friendly Ganeshotsav - this is also a work of social service.
There is still time between Durga Puja.
Right now, we will decide that the idols that our old families used to make, they will also get employment and will be made from the soil of the pond or the river, then again it will go and get it, then the environment will also be protected.
I convey my best wishes to all of you to Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa, on September 4, Mother Teresa will be addressed by the title of Saint.
Mother Teresa had put his entire life for the service of the poor in India.
When Mother Teresa gets the title of Saint, it is natural to be proud of all Indians.
In the event that will be held on September 4, an official delegation led by the Government of India, our Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj will also be sent there on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
From the saints, from the sages, from the Muniyas, from the great men, every moment we get to learn something or the other.
We will continue to find something or the other, will continue to learn and will continue to do something good.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, how big change comes.
Jan Shakti is considered to be the form of God.
In the past, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the people for clean Ganga, for cleaning of Ganga with the cooperation of 5 State Governments.
On the 20th of this month, those people were invited in Allahabad that were the heads of villages living on the banks of the Ganges.
There were also men, women were also.
He came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of Ganga coast sworn in the witness of Mother Ganga that they would immediately shut down the tradition of open defecation in their villages of Ganga coast, drive to build toilets and contribute to the village cleaning that the village will not allow Ganga to be dirty.
I congratulate these Prime Ministers for coming to Allahabad for this resolution, somebody from Uttarakhand, somebody from Uttar Pradesh, somebody from Bihar, somebody from Jharkhand, somebody from West Bengal and all of them for this work.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India and congratulate those ministers who have fulfilled this vision.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the 5 states that they have taken an important step in cleaning the Ganga by connecting the manpower.
My dear countrymen, some things touch me sometimes and I have a special respect for those who have imagined it.
On July 15, more students from around seventeen-two schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote a letter to their parents.
Someone wrote in English, someone wrote in Hindi, someone wrote in Chhattisgarhi, he wrote a letter to his parents and said that there should be toilet in our house.
These children from the age of seven to seventeen years did this work.
And it was so impressed that after getting the letter, when the school came on the second day after getting the letter, the parents caught a letter to the Teacher and the parents promised that they would make toilets till the date of the flight.
Congratulations and congratulations to those students who have made this vision, and to those parents who have decided to make toilets by taking their child's letter seriously.
This is what inspires us.
In Koppal district of Karnataka, a daughter of sixteen years of age Mallamma - this daughter Satyagraha against her family.
It is said that he had left the food and that too for God to ask for anything, not for bringing any good clothes, not for eating any sweets, but for daughter Mallamma, it was that there should be toilet in our house.
Now there was no financial condition of the family, the daughter was stuck on id, she was not ready to leave her Satyagraha.
Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village, came to know that Mallamma had satyagraha for toilet, then also look at the specialty of the village's head Mohammad Shafi that he tried eighteen thousand rupees and made a toilet within a week.
Look at this daughter Mallamma's life and look at the head of the village like Mohammed Shafi.
How to open ways to solve problems, this is the manpower.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become a resolve.
Some Indians have made it their own choice.
But everyone is associated with it in some form, everyone is contributing to it.
It will be a competition and those who will be victorious on October 2, Gandhi Jayanti will be rewarded.
Hey, nowadays you can also make films from your mobile phone camera.
Come on, go ahead, you have my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to deepen our relations with our neighbours, our relations should be simple, our relationship should be alive.
A very important thing happened in the past, our President, Honourable Pranab Mukherjee, launched a new program in Kolkata, the Akashwani Mitra Channel.
Now many people will feel that what should the President inaugurate a radio channel
But this is not the channel of ordinary radio, it is a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
So here, Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Betar, they will share content with each other and on both sides the Bengali-speaking people will enjoy the Akashwani.
AIR has a huge contribution to people to people contact.
The President launched this.
I also thank Bangladesh for the fact that they are associated with us for this work.
I also congratulate AIR friends that they are giving their contribution even in foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the work of a good Prime Minister, but finally I am a human like you.
And sometimes emotional events touch me a little more.
Such emotional events also provide new energy, inspiration and inspire the people of India to do something or the other.
In the past, I got such a letter, touched my mind.
A mother of about 84 years, who is a retired teacher, wrote this letter to me.
If he had not forbidden me to declare my name anytime in his letter, then my mind was that today I should talk to you by giving them the name and the letter he wrote that when you had appealed to leave the Gas Subsidy, I had left the Gas Subsidy and later I had forgotten.
The letter of the Prime Minister of India for me is not less than a Padmashree.
Our countrymen, you will be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those who left the Gas Subsidy and some of my representatives will go to the letters of the letter.
My efforts are to write letters to more than one crore people.
Under the same scheme, my letter came to this mother and he wrote to me that you are doing a good job.
Your campaign to liberate the poor mothers from the smoke of stove and therefore I am a retired teacher, my age will be 90 years in a few years. I am sending you a donation of Rs. 50,000 so that you can work to free such poor mothers from the smoke of stove.
You can imagine that as a normal teacher, the mother who passes on the retired pension, when you give 50 thousand rupees and poor mothers and sisters to free from the smoke of stove and provide gas connections.
The question is not of Rs 50,000, the question is of the spirit of that mother and such koti mothers and sisters are their blessings, which makes me trust and power for the future of the country.
And I did not even write the letter as the Prime Minister, wrote a direct letter - Modi Bhaiya.
I salute that mother and also salute the mothers of India who have always been doing something or the other to do something.
My dear countrymen, we were upset due to famine last year, but this month of August was constantly filled with the difficulties of floods.
Floods occurred in some parts of the country repeatedly.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the units of the Local Swaraj Institutions, the social institutions, the citizens, have made every effort to do as much as they can.
But among the news of these floods, there were also reports that needed to be remembered.
What is the strength of unity, let's go together, how big can you get
This will be remembered this month of August this year.
In August, 2016, the party that has a huge political opposition, the party that did not leave a single opportunity against each other, and almost 90 parties across the country, a lot of parties in Parliament, all the parties together passed the legislation of GST.
Its credit goes to all parties.
And this is an example of all the parties, if they go in one direction then how big work is done.
In the same way, whatever happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together talked about Kashmir with a voice.
He also gave a message to the world, sent a message to separatist elements and expressed our condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
And all of us believe that there is a vote of 125 crore people, from the head of the village to the Prime Minister, from the head of the village to the Prime Minister that if anyone knows, whether it is a young man or a security worker, it is our own loss, it is ours.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by furthering these small children, sometimes they will have to answer these innocent children too.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, as a government, we all have the responsibility to give more strength to unity, expose more and then the country can make its bright future.
I have faith in the power of 1. 25 million people.
Thank you very much today.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, this morning I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youngsters of Delhi and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports in the entire country will color every young man with enthusiasm.
We all know that in a few days the world's largest sports is going to be Mahakumbh.
Rio is going to repeat in our ears.
Our hopes and aspirations are very much, but the sportspersons who have been sportspersons in Rio are also of the 125 crore countrymen.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India organised a very good event in Run for Rio, Khelo and Jio, Khelo and Philosophy.
In the coming days, wherever we are, do something or the other to encourage our players.
No matter how much fun to eat, everything has to be left.
I'm ready to do this work on your behalf too.
It is ready to become the Prime Minister of the country's postman to deliver these sportspersons your message.
If there are no research and innovations then as the stagnant water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a burden.
And if we continue to live with the trust of old technology without research and innovation, then we will become external in the changing times of the world and that is why the government has taken several steps to attract science, research and innovation towards technology in the new generation.
And that is why I say Let us innovate and when I say Let us innovate to innovate, then my AIDS
If we want to create net generation innovators then our children will have to join it and therefore the Government of India has taken the initiative of an Atal Tinkering Abs.
Wherever there will be such tinkering app festivals in schools, they will be given Rs. 10 lakhs and Rs. 10 lakhs will be given for maintenance in five years.
If we have a strong and prosperous Incubation Centre then there is a system for innovation, for start-ups, to use it, to bring it to one position.
In the same way, India is battling many problems.
We see problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find technology solutions.
We have called upon the younger generation of an Atal Grand Challenges of the country to look at the problem, find the path of technology to resolve, research, innovation and bring it.
The Government of India wants to give a special prize to the technology discovered for solving our problems.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were worrying about famine and these days there is also a joy of rain and news of floods.
The State Government and the Central Government are making a lot of efforts by mixing the shoulder to shoulder to help the flood victims.
In spite of some difficulty due to rain, every mind, every human mind becomes foolish because our entire economic activity has rains and cultivation.
Sometimes such a disease occurs that we regret all life.
Can be saved from Engue.
Keep in mind a bit of cleanliness, be slightly cautious and try to be safe, pay special attention to the children and it is not that such a disease occurs in the poor habitations, it is not such a case of engagement.
The Engue comes first in a happy and prosperous area and therefore we understand it.
You must have seen advertising on T, but sometimes we are slightly indifferent about awareness about it.
The government, the hospital, the doctor - they will do their jobs, but I will also pray to you that we should not enter our households, in our households, in our households, in our households and in our households, there should be no illness due to water.
I want to attract your attention towards another trouble, dear countrymen.
Life has become so compassionate, it has become so raceful that sometimes we do not have time to think for us.
If you get sick then you feel sick, get alright soon and therefore you can put any antibiotics in the body.
Immediately I get rid of the disease, but my dear countrymen, the habits of taking antibiotics on these paths can create a very serious crisis.
You can get relief for some moments, but without the advice of doctors, we should stop taking antibiotics.
I urge you to complete the course of the day the doctor has asked to take.
The bacteria that spread TB and malaria are bringing about such changes in themselves at a rapid pace that there is no effect of medicines.
It is called antibiotic resistance in medical language and therefore it is necessary to follow the rules of antibiotics.
When the matter of health has come out, I want to add one more thing.
The worries of the mothers who are in pregnancy in our country are sometimes very upset.
In our country, about 3 crore women take pregnancy every year, but some mothers die during delivery, sometimes mother die, sometimes child die, sometimes both child and mother die.
It is fine that in the last decade, the rate of untimely death of the mother has come down, but even today, the lives of pregnant mothers are not saved in large quantities.
During pregnancy or later the deficiency of blood, reproductive infection, high BP - whenever the problem is destroyed his life.
Keeping in mind these things, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months - Prime Minister's Safe Maternity Campaign.
Under this campaign, free examination of all pregnant women will be done in government health centers on 9th of every month.
The life of both mothers and children can be saved and I am sure Gynecologist cannot serve this service freely for the poor mothers on the 9th of a month.
Can not my doctor brothers and sisters put twelve days in a year for this work for the poor
I'm sure you'll join.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is collectively discussed in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
In the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also discusses the tree, even in the battlefield, worrying about the tree means how much it will be, we can guess.
In the Gita, Lord Krishna says - Ashwath: Sarva Vrikshana i.e. I am a peepal in all trees.
In the Venus policy, it has been said - Nasti original innovation - there is no such vegetation in which there is no medicinal properties.
Those who donate the tree, they give wire in the world as a tree child.
Therefore, the parents who want their welfare should plant good trees and follow their children.
Be it our scriptures, sages, sages, policy, discipline of Mahabharata - but in today's generation there are some people who show these ideals to live.
A few days ago, I came to me an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, who touched my mind.
In the Discipline Festival of Mahabharata, the tree also fulfills the responsibility of the child in the world, Sonal has taken the initiative of fulfilling the desires of the society, not only of his parents.
Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer of Narayanpur village in Junnar taluka of Pune in Maharashtra, he married his granddaughter Sonal in a big inspiration.
Such a scene touching the mind was in that picture.
The idea that Sonal himself is a agricultural graduate, came to him and presented mango plants in the marriage, look at the love of nature in the best way.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became a immortal story of nature and I congratulate Sonal and Mr. Mahatra ji for this innovative effort.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims come to the temple of Amba ji in the month of Bhadra, once a social worker organization decided that those who came to the temple would plant them in the prasad and tell them that this is the prasad of Mata ji, this plant should be made big by going to their villages and homes, the mother will continue to bless you.
I repeatedly tell the farmer brothers that we ruin our land on the banks of our fields, why not we cultivate timber in place of that fence.
Today, to make India home, to make Urniture, billions of Kharbas have to be brought from abroad.
If we plant such trees on the banks of our farm, if we come to work with urniture and home, then after fifteen-twenty years you can also sell it by cutting it from the government's permission and you can also become a new means of your income and you can also avoid importing India.
In the past, many states have run a lot of campaigns using this weather, the Government of India has passed an AMPA law right now, due to which more than forty thousand crore states are going to go to tree plantation.
I am told that the Maharashtra government has planted about two and a half million plants in the entire state on July 1, and next year he has resolved to plant three crore plants.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Desert-Bhoomi - has done such a big forest festival and has resolved to plant twenty five lakh plants.
Twenty five lakh plants are not small in Rajasthan.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they know how big it has been taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover city percent by Twenty Twenty-Nine (2029).
Gujarat also has a very bright tradition of the Forest Festival.
This year, Gujarat has taken up several such projects as Aamra Forest, Ekta Forest, Shaheed Forest, as a Forest Festival and launched a campaign to plant millions of trees.
I am unable to mention all the states, but are eligible for congratulations.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa in the past.
This was my first visit and when there is a foreign visit, there is a diplomacy, there are talk of trade, there are discussions about security, there are many Moses.
But for me the journey of South Africa was a pilgrimage in a way.
When we remember South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
In the world, non-violence, love, forgiveness - when these words fall on the ears, Gandhi and Mandela - their faces are seen in front of us.
During the tour of my South Africa, I went to Phoeni Settlement, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
The train in which Mahatma Gandhi had sailed and the train which had laid the foundation stone for making Mohandas Mahatma Gandhi was also fortunate for that journey.
But what I want to say this time, I got the opportunity to meet the gentlemen who had contributed to the same opportunity for equality and for the same opportunity for their youth.
He fought with Neelson Mandela on his shoulders and fought for twenty-twenty years with Nelson Mandela in jails.
In a way, he had called upon the entire youth and I was fortunate to visit these great personalities, Mr. Ahmed Kathrada, Mr. Laloo Chiba, Mr. George Bios, Ronnie Kasriles.
Original Indians, but wherever they went, they were there, were ready to live for those who lived among them.
On his face, even after doing so much penance, it was not visible anywhere.
A kind of duties - not the symptoms of the duties that have been described in the Gita, it looked very simple.
My mind will always remember that meeting - equality and equal opportunity.
There can be no big mantra for any society and government.
Equality and mother-in-law, these are the ways that take us towards the bright future.
Children want a good future.
The primaryity will be different, but the path is the same and that is the path of development, equality, equal opportunity, equality, equality and mother-in-law.
Let us proud of these Indians who have shown the original mantras of our lives in South Africa too.
Being a woman, I am very sorry to her family.
And as technology is doing a big role in the economic system, those who misuse it also come to the ground.
You must have sometimes been confused and they write a letter in such a good way, as if it seems, it is the right letter.
Any firm sends a letter pad and gets your credit card number, debit card number and your account becomes empty through technology.
This is a new way of fraud, it is digital fraud.
I think that it should be avoided, awakened and if such false things come, then they should share their companions and make them slightly aware.
I would like that Shilpi Verma has brought a good thing to me and you would have experienced it, but perhaps you would not have seen it so seriously, but I think it is necessary to see it.
My dear countrymen, if the session of Parliament is going on these days then during the session of Parliament, I also get the opportunity to meet many people of the country.
But these days I had a pleasant experience.
Some students of Aligarh came to me.
Artificial paintings have been done at the station.
Not only this, the plastic bottles or canals that were lying in such garbage in the village, they gathered them in search and collected them and planted soil and planted them and made vertical gardens.
And by making these vertical gardens in plastic bottles towards the railway station, they gave it a new form in a way.
If you ever go to Aligarh, then look at the station.
Nowadays I am aware of these reports from several railway stations in India and locals are identifying their area on the walls of the railway station by their art.
A newness is feeling.
This is an example of how changes can be brought from public participation.
Congratulations to all those working in this way in the country, special congratulations to my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with the rainy season, there are festivals in our country.
Festivals will be celebrated in the temples, in the worship houses and you will also have to join the festival outside.
The festival of Rakshabandhan is a festival of special importance here.
Like last year, can you not present the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of your country on the occasion of Rakshabandhan this year
Think, give such a gift to the sister, who really protects her in life.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country who was born in India.
75 years of uit India and 70 years of Indias independence can give us new inspiration, awake new zeal, an opportunity to do something for the country.
The whole country should be colored with the color of the freedom fighters and once again feel the joy of freedom.
This environment should be created by all of us and the festival of independence should not be a government programme, it should be of the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope you too will do something or the other related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Definitely send his picture to the Narendra Modi App.
Make an environment in the country.
Dear countrymen, on August 15, I get a privilege to talk to the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
There will also be some things in your mind, which you want to keep your point of view from the Red Fort as intensely.
I invite you, the ideas that come in your mind, which feel that as your representative, as your principal servant, I should tell you this thing from the Red Fort, you must write it to me.
What should be said from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is a matter of 125 crore countrymen.
Let me invite you, let me remind you of the freedom fighters, remember the great men who live for India and move forward by taking a pledge to do something for the country.
Greetings to all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
I am also grateful to Akashwani that he has made a successful effort to present this thing in regional languages at 8. 00 pm.
And I am also happy to note that those who listen to me later bring their feelings to me through the letter, through telephone, through MyGov website, through Narendra Modi App.
Many of your things help me in the work of the government.
How active the government should be in public interest, how primarily the work of public interest should be, my interaction with you for these things is very useful.
I hope you will surely emphasize how democracy can be done by becoming more active and more active.
The heat is increasing.
The maximum part of the country is feeling the horrific fire of heat.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The jungles were reduced, the trees were cut off and in a way humanity destroyed the nature and paved the way for its own destruction.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
There are discussions for the environment throughout the world, there is concern.
This time, United Nations have subjected this to zero tolerance for illegal ildlife trade on World Environment Day.
It will have to be discussed, but we have to discuss trees and plants, also discuss water, how to increase our forests.
Because you must have seen the fire in the forests in the lap of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir - Himalayas in the past.
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha - I could have a meeting of all drought-affected states, but I did not do this.
What to say to the states, listen to them closely.
Normally, in the government, how much money went from the Government of India and how much was spent - it does not matter closely.
It was also surprising for the officials of our Government of India that many states have made excellent efforts, in respect of water, in respect of environment, in order to deal with the situation of drought, for animals, for the affected humans and in a way, why not the government of any party in every corner of the country, it was experienced that this problem was also observed about what op-formant solutions should be done to deal with a long-term situation.
In a way, it was also a learning experience for me and I have told my Policy Commission how the best practices should be taken in all the states.
Some states, especially Andhra, have used technology to be used by Gujarat.
I would like to ensure that we and the States have made special efforts by the NITI Aayog.
Public participation is the basis of a very big success in solving such problems.
As we go to the temple, give some prasad and some of the prasad falls, then there is anger in the mind.
Take him up and ask forgiveness from God five times.
This water is also the offering of God.
If a drop is wasted, then we should have pain.
And that is why water irrigation is equally important, water conservation is equally important, water irrigation is equally important and that is why per drop-more crop, micro-irrigation, at least water harvest.
Now it is a matter of happiness that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, some drip-irrigation, some sprinkler is using.
I sat with the states and some states have successfully used drip irrigation for paddy and rice cultivation and due to this their yield also increased, water was saved and wages were also reduced.
When I heard from these states, there are many states that have taken huge targets, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have done a big job in drip irrigation and they are trying to join two or two or three lakh hectares of micro-irrigation every year.
If this campaign runs in all the states, then agriculture will also be very beneficial, water will also be accumulated.
Our brothers of Telangana have tried to utilize the water of Godavari and Krishna river through Mission Bhagirathi.
Andhra Pradesh has also tried to use technology and groundwater recharging in the Neeru Pragati Mission.
In the mass movement that Maharashtra has created, people are also sweating and giving money.
I really feel that this movement will be very useful to protect Maharashtra from the future crisis.
Chhattisgarh has launched Loksuraj - Jalsuraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh has Balram Talab Yojana - about 22 thousand ponds are not small figures
Rajasthan and Gujarat have launched a major campaign to revive them as a Jal Mandir, where there are more ancient times of age.
Rajasthan has launched the Chief Minister's Water Self-Swamping Campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas where there is a problem of water.
He has launched a huge campaign of Heck Ham.
They have tried to stop water.
Some states have launched a campaign to stop ten-ten, twenty-two kilometers of water by making small dams in the rivers.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that this is June, July, August, September - we decide, we will not allow a drop of water to be wasted.
And this doesn't mean just the subject of farmers
This is a matter related to the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban, the rural, the rich and the poor. Therefore, the rainy season is coming, the water is our priority and this time when we celebrate Diwali, then also enjoy how much water we saved, how much water we stopped.
You see, our happiness will increase many times.
What an invaluable treasure is this given by the Lord
Media gave a detailed account of the problem of water in the past.
I hope that the media should guide the people to save water, run the campaign and become a partner for ever liberating from the water crisis, I also invite them.
My dear countrymen, we have to make modern India.
We have to make transparent India.
If we have to bring a lot of systems to one corner of India, then our old habits will also have to change a bit.
Today, I want to touch a topic on which if you help me, we can successfully move forward in that direction.
If you want salt, then give such a vegetable in return.
Business used to run from the market system.
But now the time has changed.
The whole world is moving forward towards the Cashless Society.
We can also get the money and pay the money through the electronic technology system.
You can also buy things, you can also buy bills.
And it will never raise the question of theft of the zeb.
There will be no concern about keeping the account, there will be automatic account.
The beginning will be slightly difficult, but once the habit will take place, then this system will be simplified.
And this is because we launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana these days, the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country have been opened.
So, while coordinating with Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM), JAM, we can move forward towards this Cashless Society.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given with Jan-han account.
In the coming days, this card is going to work with both credit and debit.
I don't need to get the money out of the zeb, count, count.
There is no need to roam together.
Whatever the initiatives taken by the Government of India, how to pay by a PSU, how to take money.
It will be very easy to transact money through your mobile phones and it is a matter of happiness that N.P.I.
In a way, the bank has worked in that direction at your door.
Post Office has also been alerted for banking services.
If we learn to use these systems and habits then we will not need this currency, notes will not be required, money will not be required, business will run on its own and it will result in a transparency.
Look, once we start, we will move forward very simplely.
Twenty years ago, who had thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands.
Gradually habited, now you can not live without it.
It may be that this cashless society may take the same form but it will be better if it happens in less time.
My dear countrymen, whenever the games of lympics come and whenever the sports start, then we sit down on the sir, how much we left behind in the world medal, we did not get the silver mill, do not run from the brown.
Everybody has in their own way to encourage our players who go to Rio Lympics.
Writing a song, making a cartoon, give a message, encourage a game, but the entire country should create a very positive environment towards these players.
The results will come - it will come.
It becomes very powerful in itself, when the player feels that 25 million countrymen are standing with him, then his fun gets encouraged.
I have seen the suggestions that have come from all over the country and these days I have seen that an atmosphere of Cootball has started to be seen throughout the country.
Many people are making their teams with initiatives.
I have received thousands of suggestions on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Maybe many people cannot play but there is so much interest in the games of thousands of youngsters in the country, it was a pleasant experience for me in itself.
We know the attachment of cricket and India, but I have seen so much attachment to Cootball, it indicates a very pleasant future in itself.
So, for all our sportspersons, the eligible for Rio Lympics, we have created an atmosphere of zeal and enthusiasm in the coming days.
Everything should not be done with the criterion of victory and defeat.
With sportsman spirit, India has made its identity in the world.
I appeal to the countrymen to do something in creating an atmosphere of enthusiasm and enthusiasm towards our sports partners.
Since last eight-ten days, new results are coming from somewhere.
I am talking about those students who have worked hard and laboured hard throughout the year, have started coming after a result of 10th, 12th.
It has become clear that our daughters are showing the persecution.
It's a matter of happiness.
My best wishes and congratulations to those who have succeeded in these results.
I would like to tell those who have not succeeded once again that there is a lot to do in life.
If the results have not come according to our wish, then no life gets stuck.
Should live with faith, should move forward with confidence.
But a big new kind of question has come in front of me and I never thought about it.
But I was surprising, everybody in the house told me this thing, hey, hey, hey, four marks would come more and you would have 90 percent.
That is, my family and my friend, my teacher - no one was happy with my 89.33 percent marks.
Everybody was telling me, man, your 90 percent for four marks.
Now I cannot understand how to handle such a situation.
Is this everything in life
What did I do, wasn't it good
Did I even fall a little less
I don't know, there is a burden experience on my mind.
I have read your letter very carefully and I think that perhaps this pain will be of millions of students like you, because it has become an environment that instead of satisfaction, dissatisfaction is another form of negativeness.
We can never take the society towards satisfaction by finding dissatisfaction from all things.
It would have been better if your family, your colleagues and friends had praised your 89.
I have written Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur, he has written about this way.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
I don't remember the poem completely, but I had read a long time ago, a poet had written that I made a picture of pain on the lives of life.
I wish a single viewer had also shed tears on the picture of my pain.
This was the word of poetry, I do not remember it anymore, but it is a poem long ago, but this was the feeling.
There is a burden on you to fulfill the expectations of the people.
I will tell you so much that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses expectations, keep listening, but stay on your point of view and try to do something better.
But if you do not satisfy what has been found then you will never be able to build a new building.
The strong foundation of success is the basis of big success.
The dissatisfaction arising out of success cannot be the ladder of success, it becomes the guarante of failure.
But I want to say this thing more to my parents and colleagues that you do not apply your expectations to them by grace with your children.
And Friends, Have you ever failed in life
Whoever cannot bring good marks in Ceam, he goes ahead in sports, goes ahead in music, goes ahead in artwork and goes ahead in business.
God has given everybody a wonderful mode.
Just recognise the power within yourself, emphasize it, you will go ahead.
And it happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument named Santur.
There was a time when the Santur instrument was associated with the world music in the valley of Kashmir.
But there was a Pandit Shiv Kumar, who handled him and today made an important instrument in the world.
Shahnai - Shahnai was in a limited place in the entire area of our music.
Most of the kings and maharajas used to have their place on the gate.
But when Ustad Bismilla Khan took the hands of Shahnai, today the world has become the best instrument, it has become an identity.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that the expenditure on the health of our poor families also imbalances the life track.
And it is true that the cost of not being sick is very low, but after being ill, the cost of being healthy is very high.
Why do not we live such a life so that there is no disease, there is no economic burden on the family.
One is the biggest basis for prevention of sanitation disease.
If anyone can do the biggest service of the poor, then he can clean up.
And the second for which I constantly urge, it is Yoga.
Some people also call him Yoga.
June 21 is International Yoga Day.
There is also an attraction to Yoga all over the world, a reverence and the world has accepted it.
Our ancestors have an invaluable gift to us, which we have given to the world.
The world suffering from stress gives the strength to live a balanced life.
Prevention is Better than Course. Being healthy in the lives of a person associated with Yoga, being balanced, being rich in strong will, being a life full of unconsciousness and concentration in every work are the simple achievements.
21 June - Yoga Day, this is not just one event, it increases its scope, every person has a place in his life, every person has 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes for Yoga.
And for this, June 21, Yoga Day inspires us.
And sometimes a collective environment causes change in the lives of a person.
Look at this thing, get it done in your village, get it done in your neighborhood, get it done in your city, in your school, in institute, in offices.
Start a month from now, see, you will become a partner on June 21.
I have read several times that in many offices, as soon as the regular morning is received, yoga and pranayama are collective, the efficiency of the entire office increases so much, the culture of the entire office changes, the efficiency changes.
You must join that day, the whole world is going to do yoga.
You do not stay behind anywhere, this is my request.
Your health is very important to make India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I continue to join you through Mann Ki Baat.
Dear countrymen, greetings to you all again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Namaste.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2016
Please change this condition, Ravi ji has expressed a lot of anger, but I believe that he may not be angry with me, he is angry with the situation.
P.
J.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that on the first page of the newspaper, only positive news was published, he continued to say this thing. A few days ago, a newspaper had written a letter to me, he said that we have decided that on Monday we will not provide any negative news, positive news and these days I have seen some T.
This time also I have seen a lot of letters, comments, phone calls have been received. There are many stories, suggestions, inspirations, everyone wants to do something or the other and I want to say something that I want to integrate.
You might remember the last time I had discussed a book on the stories of Premchand ji and we had decided to share some things about the book through the Narendra Modi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people have shared information about various types of books
I am glad that people are discussing and discussing books written on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business, lifestyle etc.
Some people have also advised me to talk about many more books
But one thing I have to accept that now I can ' t give time to read a lot of books .
But one of the benefits required that if you write and send it, I have got the opportunity to know about many books.
But this is the experience of the last one month, I think that we have to move forward.
Why don't we make an extensive book coorner on the Narendra Modi App and whenever we read a new book, write it there, discuss it and you can sugest a good name for our books coorner.
Friends, It seems that when I had touched this thing in the matter of water conservation, but perhaps today I am feeling that even before my saying, water conservation was a matter of touching your hearts.
And I am feeling that the hearts of India have shaken these days about water .
Several initiatives are underway for water conservation across the country.
People have shared information about traditional methods
Media has launched several innovative campaigns on water conservation
Be the government, the NGOs are doing something at the war level.
Seeing the capability of collectivity, the mind is feeling very good, it is getting very satisfactory.
Villagers donated labour and worked to give a certain direction to the waterfalls flowing from the mountain.
That too is a pure indigenous method
This has not only stopped the waste of soil and crop, but also the fields are getting water.
You will also be happy to know that the beautiful state of North East Meghalaya has become the first state in the country that has prepared its water policy, water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, the cultivation of crops is being promoted which require less water and the farmers also have no harm.
I would like to specially congratulate the Government of Haryana for communicating with the farmers, inspired them from traditional farming and for less water crops.
Now the time has come for festivals .
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals .
Why not use this fair for water conservation
People from every section of the society reach the fairs .
We can give the message of water conservation in these fairs in a very effective manner, exhibitions, dramas, message of water conservation along with festivals.
Friends, Some things in life fill us with zeal and especially the achievements of the children, their accomplishments and their accomplishments, give us a new energy and that is why today I want to talk about some children and these children are Nidhi Baipotu, Monish Joshi, Dewanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aaronyesh Ganguly and Hrithik Ala-Manda.
You will also be filled with pride and zeal with what I will tell about them.
We all know that cancer is a word that the whole world is scared .
It seems that death stands at the gate, but all these ten children have not only defeated the fatal diseases like cancer, cancer, but have illuminated the name of India all over the world with their exploits.
In sports, we often see that the players become a champion after winning tournaments or after winning medals, but this was a rare opportunity where they were champions before participating in the sports competition and that too was the champion of the war of life.
In fact, World Childrens Winners Games were organized in Moscow this month.
This is a unique sports tournament in which youth cancer survivors i.e. those who have come out with cancer in their lives take part.
Competitions like Shooting, Chess, Swimming, Running, Cootball and Table Tennis were organized in this competition.
All these ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament
Some of these players won medals in more than one game
In fact, 2019 has been a very good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists had launched A-Sat in March and after that there was no more discussion about the big and important news like A-Sat at that time in the superannuation of Handriyaan-2 elections.
While we enabled the A-Sat missile to kill the satellite three-seven kilometers in just three minutes.
And now, on July 22, the entire country was proud to see how the Handriyaan-two moved from Sriharikota to space.
The pictures of the launch of Chandrayaan-2 filled the countrymen with pride and zeal, happiness.
Chandrayaan-two, this mission is special in many ways.
Chandrayaan-2 will further clarify our understanding of the moon
This will give us more details about the moon but, if you ask me what two big learnings I have received from Handriyaan-two, then I will say, these are two learnings i.e. Faith and Cearlessness i. e.
We should trust our talents and capacities, trust our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Handriyaan-two is completely indulged in Indian color.
This is Indian from Heart and Spirit
is completely a indigenous mission
This mission has once again proved that when it has to be a new taxation in the new sector, it has to be a new taxation.
The way our scientists, in record time, have launched all the technical issues by doing one day and night, it is unprecedented in itself.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists
We all should be proud of this and even after interruption they did not change the time to reach it , many are surprised .
We also have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but always remember that the ability to overcome it is also within us.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share information about a very interesting competition, competition, and invite the youth of the country to a ui Competition.
I urge young friends, students to participate in this ui competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with your share.
I urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers to work hard to make their school victorious.
For these victorious students, there will be a historic event of their lives, but for this, you will have to take part in ui Competition, get the highest marks, you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have observed one thing
Our Mann Ki Baat has speeded up the cleanliness campaign from time to time and similarly the efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired the mind.
The journey that started five years ago today is establishing new criteria of cleanliness with the participation of the people.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal situation in sanitation, but the way we have achieved success in sanitation campaigns from public places, it is the strength of the resolve of one and a half million countrymen, but we are not going to stop so much.
This movement has now moved from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days ago I was watching the story of Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and left his job in the US and returned to serve Mother Bharti
He took the initiative to make Delhi not only clean but beautiful some time ago.
He started with his team with the ruins of Lodhi Garden
Through Street Cart, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of the bridge and the school to the slums and slums, when they started boiling their skills, the people also got together and in a way it started.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with stream paintings during the Kumbh
There is no voice in colors and lines, but the message of the indradhanush that is made from these pictures proves to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of the sanitation campaign.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of setting up of health in our society.
In a way, so we have to move forward in the direction of making garbage from garbage.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting comment on MyGov.
This conference belonged to Mohammed Aslam, a brother of Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote that it looks nice to hear the program of mind
I am happy to note that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme in my State of Jammu and Kashmir.
This program was organized in June
I think such programmes should be held every three months .
At the same time, there should also be an online monitoring of the programme.
With my view, this was the first of its kind, in which the public directly interacted with the government.
Brother Muhammad Aslam ji sent this message to me and after reading it, my eagerness to know about the Back to Village Programme increased and when I went to detail about it, I felt that the entire country should also be aware of it.
This program shows how desperate the people of Kashmir are connected to the mainstream of development.
In this programme, for the first time, the officers who had never seen the villages directly reached the villages and reached their doors so that the obstacles in the work of development can be understood, the problems can be overcome.
This programme lasted a week and in all the about four and a half thousand panchayats of the state, government officials informed the villagers in detail of government schemes and programmes.
How can Panchayats be further strengthened
How can their income be increased
What could their services affect the lives of the common man  The villagers also openly told their problems .
Friends, It was not a government feedback that the officers returned to the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat and this gave them the opportunity to spend time in the village.
Several other things were also included to make this programme interesting.
Sports Competition for Children under Khelo India
The same sports kits, MNREGA Job Cards and SST Certificates were also distributed.
People of Kashmir become open partners in this festival of development
It is a matter of joy that the Back to Village Programme was organised in such far-flung villages where government officials had to travel for one day and a half days while climbing the hills through remote roads.
Many officers were so overwhelmed by their welcome that they stayed in villages for more than two days .
It is very pleasant to organize Gram Sabhas in these areas, participate in a large number of people and prepare plans for themselves.
New resolution, new zeal and spectacular results
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, want to create barriers, they can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendra, honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented the glory of the month of Sawan in one of his poems.
People from different cultures and languages across India celebrate the month of Sawan in their own way
Whenever we look around us in this season it seems as if the earth has covered the green sheet .
All around, a new energy starts communicating
In this sacred month many devotees go to Kanvad Yatra and Amarnath Yatra, while many people fast regularly and eagerly wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami
During this time the festival of Raksha Bandhan is also a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
When you are talking about the month of Sawan, you will be happy to know that this time the most devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the sacred Amarnath cave since July 1.
More than the pilgrims who were involved in this journey lasting for 60 days in 2015, have joined this time only in 28 days.
For the success of Amarnath Yatra, I would like to appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests.
Those who come back from the journey are convinced of the spirit of warmth and affection of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future .
I have been told that since this year, in Uttarakhand, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months.
For the first time, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there after the terrible disaster in 2013.
I appeal to all of you that you must visit parts of the country whose beauty is seen during the monsoon.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and travel, perhaps, there can be no greater teacher than that.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and vibrant month of Sawan should communicate with you new energy, new hopes and new hopes.
In the same way the month of August comes in remind of uit India .
I would like you to make some special preparations for 15th August to seek a new way to celebrate this festival of freedom.
On the other hand, this is the time when there is heavy rains in many parts of the country
By the way, when we see T, the same aspect of the rain looks all over the flood, filled water, traffic jam
The second picture of the monsoon in which our farmer, shining birds, flowing waterfalls, greenery covered earth, you will have to come out with your own family.
Rain, freshness and happiness i.e. reshness and appines both bring together. I wish this monsoon continues to fill you with happiness.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
Today, the people of the Christian community are celebrating Caster all over the world.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of Wester.
And for some people, it will also be a criterion that on the one hand, T-20 Ricket World Up, on the other hand, you might still be waiting for the match of India and Australia.
In the past, India has won two best matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
A very good momentum is coming.
Today, when Australia and India are going to play, I extend my best wishes to the players of both the teams.
65 percent of the population is young and we have lost in the world of sports, it is not a matter of fact.
It's time, a new revolution in sports.
24 teams of the world are coming to play in India.
In 1951, 1962 ASEAN Games, India won the world medal and India was ranked fourth in 1956 Limpic Games.
But unfortunately, in the last few decades, we went on the lower piece, left behind, fell down, fell.
Cootball is an opportunity. Can you give me your suggestion
I consider it a great opportunity to brand India at the global level.
I consider the opportunity to identify Indias youth power, what was found between Match and what was lost in that sense.
By preparing for this host, we can decorate our strength, express our strength and we can also brand India.
Can you send your suggestions on me, Narendra ModiApp
My dear students, in the days of holidays, you must have thought for tourism.
Some people go out of their states.
Last time also I had urged you to upload photos from wherever you go.
People, languages, food habits, do not know what to see.
India is full of diversity.
Get out to see once you will be watching the whole life, you will be watching
I am lucky and I have got the opportunity to visit a lot.
When he was not the Chief Minister, he was not the Prime Minister and was younger like you, I visited a lot.
I consider it a good sign.
It gives an opportunity to see something new in itself.
I hope you can contribute to cleanliness whenever you visit these holidays
Can't it be very scientific, but it's happening.
As a tourist, can you emphasize cleanliness on the tourist destination
I am confident my young man will definitely help me in this.
India is far behind in tourism compared to the world.
But if we have to emphasize our tourism then we can attract the world.
We can attract a very large part of the world's tourism and provide employment opportunities to millions of youngsters of our country.
Be it governments, institutions, society, citizens, all of us are working together.
Let us try to do something in that direction.
My young friends, vacations should come in such a way, I do not like this.
You also think in this direction.
Would you like to know that your holidays, the important years of life and its important time
I have an idea to think of you.
Can you pledge to add a new thing to your personality, a skill in holidays
If you do not come to swim, then you can make a pledge in the holidays, I can learn to swim, if you do not want to run a cycle, then I will run a cycle in the holidays.
Even today I type the computer with two fingers, can I learn typing
How many skills are there for the development of our personality
Why not learn him
Why not remove some of our shortcomings
Why don ' t we allow our powers
Now imagine that there should be a lot of classes in it, there should be a trainer, there should be a lot of gestures and big budgets.
Assume yourself in your surroundings, you decide that I will make best from the waste.
Look at something and start making it from it.
Namaste Prime Minister, you said in the summer holidays that birds also feel heat, so we should keep in water in a utensil and place in our balcony or on the roof, so that birds come and drink water.
I did this work and I was happy, this excuse was my friendship with a lot of birds.
I urge you to repeat this work back in the matter of mind.
And I was not in my mind that today I would say something about this subject but that Abhi reminded me that last year I had for birds in a soil utensil outside the house.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to Abhi Chaturvedi a child.
He called me and reminded me of a good job.
Abhi told me that he has been doing this work for a year and many of his birds have become his friends.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved the birds very much.
He had written in his poem - will not let you go away, will fill the courtyard with donations and fill the hood, we will fill the sweet cold water.
Let us also do this thing of Mahadevi ji.
I also congratulate Abhi and express my gratitude that you have reminded me of a very important thing.
Shilpa Kuke from Mysore, he has kept a big sensitive issue for all of us.
He said that those who sell milk near our house, those who sell newspapers, postmans come.
Sometimes those who sell a utensil pass through there, selling clothes pass.
Have we ever asked them for water in summer
Have we ever given him water
I am very grateful to you, Shilpa, you have kept a very sensitive subject in a very simple manner.
This is the right thing but if the postman came to the house in the midst of the heat and we gave water to him how much it would like to be.
Well, this is the nature of India.
But I am grateful to Shilpa that you have served these things.
What is the situation of the market, what is the situation in the markets, what is going on in good crops these days, what are the medicines suitable
Not only this, there is a button in it that directly connects you with agricultural scientists, connects you with exports.
If you keep your question in front of him, he answers, explains, you are.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters should download this Kisan Facilitation App on their mobile phones.
If you trie then what does your work come from it
And if there is some shortage then you also complain to me.
But we also have to think of the countrymen what will happen without water
Is this time our ponds, our ponds, the way water flows in the ponds, where the waste or some waste gets destroyed then water stops coming and the water conservation is gradually decreasing.
Can we make those old places once again by digging and cleaning them for more water irrigation
If the water is saved, even in the first rain, if the water is saved, the ponds were filled, our river drains were filled, then sometimes the rains were stopped, then our loss is reduced.
This time you must have seen 5 lakh ponds, fields and ponds.
MNREGA has also emphasized on creating assets for water irrigation.
There will be many such villages in the country, there will be many progressive farmers, there will be many aware citizens who have done this work.
But still there is a need to do more.
I welcome it.
The misuse of more fertilizer has made our mother sick and we are the sons of Mother Earth, children, how can we see our motherland sick
This fertilizer is the same, however the best fertilizer, but if you use more fertilizer then it will become a cause of waste.
The farming will benefit as much as the water will be saved, the more life will be saved.
My dear countrymen, on 7th April is World Health Day and this time the world has concentrated World Health Day on Beat Diabetes and defeat diabetes.
Diabetes is such a host that he is eager to host every disease.
Once the diabetes enters, a lot of sicknesses go back to their homes and body.
It is said that in 2014, there were about six crore diabetes patients in India.
The reason for the death of 3 percent is that diabetes were found.
And there are two types of diabetes, one type-1, type-2. Type-1 is dynasty in Type-1.
And due to Type-2 habits, due to age, due to obesity.
The world is worried about diabetes, so 7 stars have been kept in World Health Day.
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest reason for it.
Physical labor is decreasing.
The name of sweat is not O-Nishan, it is not going to walk.
Can we do something to defeat diabetes in our personal life by taking some inspiration from the date of 7
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we do not hesitately get medical check-ups.
And then after a very bad situation, it is noticed that I was very old diabetes.
On March 24, the world celebrated TB Day.
We know, when I was small, I was afraid to hear the name of TB.
But the number of TB patients is very much compared to the world.
This means that this disease is such that it can be checked soon.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is being done in this direction.
You get checked once.
And this disease can go.
Just be the right treatment and the treatment continues till the disease is destroyed.
I would urge you to defeat TB or Diabetes.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But this is not from the government, the doctor, the medicine until you do it.
And that is why I urge my countrymen to defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, there are several important occasions in the month of April, especially the birthday of Bhimrao Baba Sahib Ambedkar on 14th April.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages.
I am fortunate that on April 14 this year, I am fortunate to visit Baba Sahib Ambedkar's birthplace Mau.
Baba Sahib has given a lot to become a good citizen.
We can pay a great tribute to him by walking on that path and becoming an excellent citizen.
In a few days, Vikram Sanvat will start.
Different states are celebrated separately.
My best wishes to all for the New Year.
You can listen to your time.
You can hear on your mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you.
The youth of India takes time to look at T, to get information about it.
Perhaps there will be no district of India where I have not got the opportunity to go.
Like before, they do not go on the same route, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
And there is a possibility of a lot of employment through tourism.
And the identity of your personality will increase so much that your confidence will increase.
This will probably be a matter of your companions.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
If you download it in your mobile phone through this Kisan Facilitation App then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weighther in your palm.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for the rest, there has been an opportunity for summer holidays but for the farmers, there is an opportunity to sweat even more.
He waits for the rain and before waiting, the farmer gets ready to prepare his field so that he does not want to let a drop of rain waste.
For the farmers, the time to start the season of farmers is very important.
That's the same food, huh
You must worry about him.
But when TB and death were added, we were scared but now we have become careless about TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
You would have listened to my mind on the radio, but the mind would have felt that the teams of children are starting, some people's tenth-twelfth features are perhaps starting on March 1.
So it would be the same in your mind.
I also want to join you in this visit.
The more you are concerned about the health of your children, I am equally concerned.
But if we change our way of watching the exams, then perhaps we can be anxiety free.
I had said in my previous mind that you must send your experience on the Narendra Modi App, your suggestions to me.
I am happy that the teachers, the very successful students who have been careering have sent me a lot of things by their parents and some thinkers of the society.
Secondly, there were thousands of things that I believe that this is perhaps a very important subject.
But most of us have limited the subject of Ceam to the school premises or to the family or to the student.
The suggestions that have come on my App, it seems that these things should continue to be discussed in the entire nation.
Today, I want to talk to my parents, examiners and their teachers especially in this matter of my mind.
I have heard what I have read, which I have been told, I will also tell some of them.
I will also add what I think.
But I am confident that these 25-30 minutes will be very beneficial for those students who have to give their life.
I want to tell you the message he has sent to the youth of India, such as Bharat Ratna Shriman Sachin Tendulkar,: - Namaskar, I am speaking Sachin Tendulkar.
I know that Jeams are going to start in a few days.
Many of you will also have tense.
My only message is that you will have your parents, your teachers, your family members and friends.
Wherever you go, everyone will ask how your preparation is going on, how many perceives you will score.
I would like to say that I would like to say that you will have some target sets for yourself, do not come in the preservation of anybody else.
You must work hard, but set a realistic achievable target for yourself and try to achieve that target.
So it was very important for me to induce a solution.
And those targets I always tried to take care of them.
My occupation was on the balle and targets themselves became a slole-sloley achieve.
I will tell you that you, your thinking is very important.
Positive thinking will be positive results.
So you must be positive and the upper one must give you good results, this is my best hope and I would like to give you the best wishes.
Friends, see what Tendulkar ji is saying.
Do not press it under the burden of execution.
You have to make your future.
You decide your goals from yourself, decide your own targets - free mind, free thinking, free power.
Why not competitive
Why do we waste our time to compete with others
Why do not we compete with ourselves
Why do not we decide to break all our previous records
You see, no one will stop you from moving forward and when you break your previous record, you will not expect anyone else for happiness and satisfaction.
There will be satisfaction from inside.
Friends, do not consider the examination as a mark game.
Where to reach, how much to reach
Do not get stuck in that account.
Life should be added to any great purpose.
One of the dreams should walk and be resolved.
These tests, they are going to be right or not, they account for it.
And that is why if these dreams are huge, then the examination will become a festival of joy in itself.
Every examination will be a step to fulfill that great objective.
Every success will become a key to achieving that great objective.
If you take a very big objective and sometimes it will be less than expected, then disappointment will not come.
And there will be courage to force, to force, to try and try.
Thousands of people who have written me small things from the mobile phone on my app.
Shreya Gupta has emphasized that there is a healthy mind in the healthy body.
Keep in mind your studies as well as your health so that you can write healthyly in Ceam.
Now, on the last day, I will not say that you start punishing and sitting and go to run three kilometers, five kilometers.
But one thing is true that how your routine is in particular in the days of Ceam.
Anyway, 365 days of our routine should be consistent with our dreams and resolves.
I agree with one thing from Mr. Prabhakar Reddy ji, he has urged him to sleep on time and revise early in the morning.
The Entrance Centre and other things should be reached before time.
This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, I probably do not dare to say because I am slightly indifferent to sleep and my sufficient friends also complain to me that you sleep very little.
This is my deficiency, I will also try to fix it.
The scheduled sleep time, deep sleep - it is as important as your whole day and activity and this is possible.
Otherwise, there is a habit of some people, they keep talking on a long telephone before sleeping.
And when I talk of sleeping, do not think that I am asking you to sleep for Ceam.
I am talking about sleeping for a stress-free state to give you a good exam on the time of Ceam.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
Otherwise, there should be no such thing that the marks come down and the mother asked why the son came down, then say that Modi had asked to sleep, then I was asleep.
Do not do so .
I don't believe.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even if one or half part of our body is suffering a little.
Not only this, our routine also gets crushed.
And that's why we don't think anything small.
You see, do not trap yourself in the habit of communicating in what you have ever fixed.
Decid, look at it.
You must have seen these two types of people.
There is also a negative impact on the consequences of the paper that will come in the tension.
On Vishwanathan Anand, he will tell his experience.
You must have seen, their eyes do not even go around.
Sometimes we used to listen, not the incident of Arjun's life, how did he look at the bird's eyes
When we see Viswanathan playing in the same way, his eyes are completely i on a bigger target and it is an expression of peace inside.
It is true that someone should say that peace will come again, it is difficult to say that but it should be tried.
If you are not talking to friends or are walking alone, you are foolish and foolish, you are shaking a lot of books then it cannot be a peaceful mind.
You imagine that you are standing on the edge of a pond and look very good things below.
But suddenly if a stone starts shaking more water in the water, then the excellent thing that was seen below, is it visible
If the water is calm, then things are not so deep, they are seen.
But if the water is unrest, then there is nothing below.
You will not only find the treasure if you have an unhappy mind.
If there is a peaceful mind then it will emerge from your treasure and your ease will become simple.
And sometimes I try to understand more concentrates, then I feel stress within it.
Then I think, no, no, I'm going to relax, then I'll be good.
So I have done my technology development myself.
I'm very deep breathing.
I breathe deeply.
Three times and five times I breathe deeply, the time goes 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, but then my mind becomes quiet and ready to understand things.
Maybe this is my experience, you can also work.
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing.
If parents have also been written in the house and even if parents are teachers, then again write the entire paper again, tell what you wrote, what happened
Yeah, I made a mistake.
Hey, man, I knew it, but I didn't remember.
We get stuck in that.
Make memories of old joy and happiness with the family and on topics.
If you have ever gone somewhere with your parents, then remember the scenes there.
Just leave them and spend half an hour.
Rajat ji's talk is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, while describing him in the present context, he is trying to bring this rites to Sarita in the country and the world.
I am also grateful to the revered Murari Bapu that he gave us a very good message.
Friends, I want to tell you another thing today.
I am seeing that this time people have discussed Yoga in the experiences that have shown me.
And it is a matter of joy for me that somebody whom I meet in the world these days doesn't get some time, somebody doesn't talk about yoga.
Well, Friends, I will say that today, start doing yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
But those who do yoga are at least eam, so do not do it today, do not do it.
Do so.
But it is true that Yoga is a very big key in the development journey of Interman, whether it is a student in life or a success of life.
Simplely is a simple key.
You must pay attention to it.
Yes, if you are aware of any yoga in yourself, you will ask them if you have not done yoga earlier in the days of Ceam then you will tell them about two or four things that you can do in two or five minutes.
Look, if you can
Yeah, I have a lot of faith in it.
My young friends, you are very quick to go to the examination hall. Do you want to sit on your bench at the earliest
Why do these things in a hurry
Why do not you make such a management of your whole day that if you stop in traffic, then also we will reach on time.
Otherwise, such things create a new stress.
And one thing is that the time we have got, the question paper that is instructions, we sometimes feel that it will eat our time.
It's not so friends.
You should read those instructions closely and it will go for two minutes or three minutes or five minutes and there will be no harm.
But with the confidence of the same paper, now I have this paper, no new questions are going to come, I have to deal with such questions and when I started thinking again, he wrote that I understood this paper so easily and read it for the first time that it did not come to me, but I was not aware that the same thing has been kept in another way, but this is the same thing I know.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Sometimes the question seems difficult by not understanding the questions.
I emphasize the fact that you read the questions twice, read three times, read four times and try to match it with what you know.
It is a matter of happiness for me today that Bharat Ratna and our very respected scientist CNR Rao have stressed the patience.
In very few words, but a very good message has been given to all of us.
What I take half an hour to say, he says in three minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am very grateful to Rao Saheb that he inspired the children of the country.
Be firm, dedicated and dedicated to what they have said, this is the matter of education, determination, diligence. Be firm, friends.
If you are standing, then fear will also be scared.
And a golden future is waiting for you to do good.
Now a message on my app has been shared by Ruchika Dabas.
He said that in his family there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere at the time of Ceam and this was also discussed in his companions.
Positive environment by mixing all.
This is true, as Sachin ji also said, positive approach, positive frame of Mind Positive Energy exposes.
Why not at any stage of life, the best examples, the truth events also give a lot of inspiration, give a lot of strength and create a new path at the time of crisis.
We all read about Thomas Elva Adison, the inventor of the Electricity Bulb, in our syllabus.
But today that electricity, that bulb also illuminates the lives of our people.
It is said that the failure also contains the possibility of success.
JK rolling is an excellent example that success can ever be achieved by anyone.
Harry Potter Series is popular all over the world today.
But it was not so from the beginning.
How many problems they had to face.
Rolling himself had said that in the difficulties, he used to put all the energy in that work, which actually meant for them.
Nowadays, the entire family and the entire school and the teacher becomes all of them.
But without the support system of parents and teachers, the situation is not good.
It becomes easier if we become a team, be it a unit or be it a unit or be it a unit or be it a part of a systematic manner then the examination becomes easier.
Shri Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on App, he has complained that parents should never pressurize their children to demand more marks.
Only should be encouraged to prepare.
They should be relaxed and worry about it.
Vijay Jindal writes, do not burden their expectations on children.
This is right.
I don't want to say more to parents today.
Please do not make pressure.
If he is talking to any of his friends, do not stop.
Make a slight environment, make a positive environment, see, your son or daughter will be so confined.
We like to join him.
We also want to move forward from the rapid pace of science.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Knowledge, Science, Technology should become a simple part of our development journey and this time theme of National Science Day is Make in India.
Friends, sometimes successes are very late and when success is achieved then the vision of seeing the world also changes.
Perhaps you might have been very busy in Ceam, then perhaps it may have been possible that a lot of news has not been registered in your mind.
But I want to repeat this thing to the countrymen too.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a huge and important diet in the world of science.
Scientists of the world worked hard, generations came, they did something or the other and after almost 100 years, a success took place.
Gravitational waves were highlighted and detected from the mentorship of our scientists.
This is a very far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only authenticates the theory of our great scientific instein of the last century but is considered a great discovery for physics.
It is a matter of coming to the entire world for humanity, but as an Indian, we all are happy to note that our country's sons and promising scientists were also associated with it in the process of searching.
I want to congratulate all those scientists today.
Our scientific efforts will also be made to move forward in the future.
This kind of system is at two places in the world, India is the third.
Indias connectivity will further strengthen this process, and will get a new speed.
India will also become an active partner in the process of this great scientific diet of human welfare among its limited resources.
I once again congratulate all the scientists and best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I write a number to you, from tomorrow you can listen to my mind by missed call and listen to your mother tongue.
I also have to give a zeam tomorrow.
125 crore Indians are going to take my demonetization.
But yes, you might have seen, I would have heard how healthy I am, how self-confidence I am.
Just, tomorrow become my zeam, start yourself.
And if we all succeed, then the country will also succeed.
Friends, Greetings and best wishes to you.
Be free from the stress of success and failure, move forward from the free mind, keep on singing.
Talk of mind, December 2015
I look at this portal and from Pune, Mr. Ganesh V.
No, we have to bring about a change in the requirements of India. The poor person works somewhere, he gets physical labour, but by a young innovation, make the poor a little comfortable. I consider this as a start-up, I will ask the bank to help such a young man, I will also tell him that he will go ahead with courage, he will get the market.
And then I thought that it seems to be a disabled person from the eyes, but it feels that he has a tra power, extra power. And then I had a thought in my mind that why we should use the word Divyang in the place of disabled persons in our country. These are those people who have one or more organs in which divine power is a communication of divine power, which we don't have the ordinary body. I feel like this word. Can my countrymen prevalent the word Divyang in place of individual handicapped persons
Send me on this portal, I would sure that the younger generation of my country thinks about the duty. On January 26, when we celebrate Republic Day, can we commemorate the statues of all the great men in our city by the citizens, by the school-college children, the cleanliness of that complex, the best sanitation, the best adornment of the best of 26th January
Dear countrymen, Namaste.
During the holy festival of Deepawali, you must have celebrated the holidays very well.
There will also be an opportunity to go somewhere.
And with new zeal and enthusiasm, business employment will also have started.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas will also start.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
Sometimes festivals work to fill the wounds, sometimes festivals give new energy.
But sometimes when the crisis comes in this time of the festival, it becomes more painful, and it seems painful.
From every corner of the world, the news of natural calamities continue to come.
Nor have you ever heard nor have you ever thought about such natural calamities.
We are now feeling how fast the impact of climate change is increasing.
In our own country, the way in which excessive rainfall and that too has been affected by the losses in Tamil Nadu for a long time, for a long time, for a long time, the states have also been affected.
Many people were killed.
I convey my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
State governments gather with full power in relief and rescue work.
The central government also always works together with the shoulder.
Now a team of Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I am confident that even after this crisis on the power of Tamil Nadu, he will start moving forward at a very fast pace and he will continue to play his role in furthering the country.
But when they look at the problems all around, we need to make a lot of changes.
15 years ago, the natural calamities used to be part of an agricultural department, because more natural calamities i. e.
Today, its form has changed.
After the earthquake of Nepal, I talked to Pakistan Prime Minister Shri Nawaz Sharif.
A good start has happened.
Today, I have received Lakhwinder Singh's phone from Jalandhar in Punjab.
I am speaking to Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab district Jalandhar.
We cultivate organic farming here and guide a lot of people about farming.
I have a question that people who set fire to these fields, how to guide the cattle or the shrub of wheat, how to spoil the microorganisms of the Mother Earth and how to get relief from it in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh ji, I am very happy to hear your message.
One is happy that you are a biological farming farmer.
And yourself do organic farming. Not only this, you understand the problem of farmers well.
And your concern is correct but it is not just in Punjab, Haryana.
This is the habit of our people all over India and traditionally we go on the way to burn the remains of our crops.
Secondly, there is no training for what measures are there.
And when the impact of this crisis began to come towards the cities, a bit of voices started to be heard.
But the pain you have expressed is right.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are also very precious.
They themselves have a biological manure.
Secondly, due to this burning, the upper layer of the earth burns.
For a moment my farmer brothers and sisters, think that our bones are strong, our heart is strong, the kidney is good but if the skin above the body is burnt then what will happen
By the same way, these residues of the crop do not just burn the knot, it burns the skin of Mother Earth.
The layer above our land burns, which pushes our fertility land towards death.
And that is why he should make a positive effort.
This throat once again drowned in the ground, even then it becomes fertilizer.
Or if a pitcher puts a bit of water by putting a pitcher in a pit, then it becomes the best type of organic manure.
I once got the opportunity to talk to the farmer brothers who cultivate banana.
And they told me a great experience.
Earlier, when he used to cultivate banana and when the banana crop was over, he had to spend Rs. 5,000, 10 thousand, 15 thousand per hectare to clean the banana thorns.
And till the people who picked him up, he was standing like that.
But some farmers proved 66, 8-8 inch pieces of that throat and buried it on the ground.
So the experience came to know that there is so much water in the throat of this banana that if there is a tree, there is a plant, there is a crop then there is no need to get out for three months.
The demand for the thunderstorm that had to be spent earlier, today the demand for thunderstorm has increased.
How big can the small experiment also benefit, these are not less than our farmer brother any scientist.
Dear countrymen, on December 3, the entire world will remember the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Last time I had discussed the organ convention in Mann Ki Baat.
I had also talked about NET's helpline for the organ convention and I was told that after that, the phone calls have increased nearly 7 times.
Very well-known people, including film actress Ravina Tandon, are associated with it.
Organ Contion can save valuable lives.
Angadan comes in a way with immortality.
When the organ goes from one body to another, that organ gets a new life, but that life gets a new life.
What can be the best donation and what can happen.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness on this sector and in the true sense, the needy will get better help because these helps cannot be received from anywhere until no one donates.
As I said earlier, December 3 is celebrated as Disabilities Day.
Physical and mentally handicapped people are also rich in an unprecedented courage and strength.
Sometimes pain occurs when sometimes they ridicule.
Sometimes the feeling of compassion and mercy is expressed.
But if we change our vision, then these people can inspire us to live.
Some taxes can inspire to pass.
If we have a small problem then we sit to cry.
Then I remember that my crisis is very small, how does it live
And that is why these are the source of inspiration for us.
His will power, his way of fighting with his life and his ability to convert the crisis into capabilities.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
4042 years old.
In 1996 Kashmir, Javed Ahmed was shot by terrorists.
He lost a part of the intestine and intestine.
Serius Nature has become a spinal injury.
The ability to stand on his feet went forever, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
Terrorism injury could not even worry about them.
His own responsibilities, but the biggest thing is that without any reason, an innocent person has suffered so much trouble, youth has been in danger but no resentment, no anger, no anger, no anger, this crisis has also changed to the sensitivity of Javed Ahmed.
He dedicated his life to social service.
The body does not give it together but for 20 years they have been immersed in the education of children.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for handicappedness in public places, government offices
They are working on it.
Is Javed's life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I specially remember the life of Javed Ahmed, his penance and his dedication on 3rd December.
In the absence of time, I am talking about Javed, but the lamps of such inspiration are burning in every corner of India.
They are giving new light to live, showing the way.
On December 3, there is an opportunity to recall everyone and inspire him.
Our country is so huge.
There are many things in which we are dependent on governments.
Be it a person of the middle class, a person of the lower middle class, a poor person, a Dalit, afflicted, exploited, deprived, there is a constant relationship with the government systems.
And as a citizen, sometimes there is a bad experience from some government Babu in life.
And that unconscious experience changes our vision of looking at the government system throughout the life.
There is also a truth in it but sometimes lakhs of people sitting in this government do good work with service, dedication and dedication which never come to our eyes.
Sometimes we don't even know, because it is so easy that we don't know that any government system, any government officials are doing this work.
The ASA workers in our country which are networking across the country.
I have never heard about the ASA Workers among the people of India, nor have you heard.
But when I am the world-renowned family entrepreneur of the Bilgates Foundation, his success in the world has become an example.
We had given joint Padma Vibhushan to both such billgates and Milindagets last time.
They work very socially in India.
Whatever he has earned for his retirement time and life is spending in working for the poor.
Whenever they come and meet and whoever they have got the opportunity to work with ASA workers, they praise them so much and they have so much to say that what kind of dedication is the dedication of the ASA workers.
He explains how much enthusiasm is to learn new and new things.
In the past, the Orissa Government gave special respect to an ASA worker on Independence Day.
A small village of Balasore district of Orissa, Tendagaon is a hopeful worker and the entire population there is a scheduled tribe.
And there is an area affected by malaria.
And Jamuna Mani Singh, a hope worker of this village, decided that now I will not let anyone die from malaria in this village.
Going home and home, if you come to know about a little fever.
Based on the primary arrangements taught to him, it is for treatment.
Emphasising that every house uses pesticides mosquitoes.
As your own child goes to sleep properly and as much as the care should be done, the ASA worker Jamuna Mani Singh works with full dedication to avoid the entire village mosquitoes.
And he fought malaria, prepared to compete with the entire village.
So how many Jamuna will be Mani.
There will be millions of people who will be around us.
We'll look at them with a bit respect.
Such people become the power of our country.
How to become big companions of the happiness and misery of the society
I salute all such ASA workers through Jamuna Mani.
I urge you to see this.
Not only this, but also look at others, read it and maybe you will want to add such things.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
- Discuss the books and if a enthusiastic young man goes to the schools of the neighbourhood about these books and tell the children of the eighth, ninth, tenth grade to see that this happened here.
So you can become a social teacher in the true sense.
Let me invite you to join the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worried about climate change.
It is also a matter of concern that climate change, global warming, dog-dagger are being discussed and it is getting approval as a standard before doing every work.
The temperature of the earth should not increase now.
It is also the responsibility of everyone.
I had once said that on the night of Purnima, the street lights should be closed and bathed in the full moon light for hours by darkness.
The light of that moon should be experienced.
And when a friend sent me a link, I got the opportunity to see him, I thought that I would tell you this thing too.
Nobody feels like a woman from T by doing nourjahan in Kanpur, nobody has got the good fortune to read more.
But one such thing is doing which perhaps nobody would have thought.
He is working to give light to the poor using solar energy.
He is fighting with darkness and illuminating his name.
He has set up a committee of women and has planted a plant of solar energy lanterns and he gives lanterns at a rent of Rs 100 a month.
The cost of about Rs 3-4 per day is about Rs 3-4 per day but there is light in the entire household and it works throughout the day with solar energy in that plant.
Now see what big people of the world would have done for climate change but a Noorjaha perhaps inspires everyone.
And anyway, Noorjaha means to illuminate the world.
The light is spreading through this work.
I congratulate Noorjahan and I also congratulate you T because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur in front of the country and the world.
Many congratulations.
Abhishek ji thanks.
The message you sent from Gorakhpur to me.
Pradhan Mantri MRA Yojana under the ununded.
Those who do not get money, they get money.
By the way, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But in such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people got 42 thousand crore rupees from the Pradhan Mantri MRA Yojana.
Whether it is a dhobi, a niece, a newspaper, a milk seller.
I am happy to note that about 66 lakh women have 24 lakh women.
And most of the people of SC, ST, B are those who work hard and try to run the family with respect to their feet.
Abhishek himself has told about his enthusiasm.
I also have a lot of news.
I just told someone that there is a Shailesh in Mumbai.
He got a loan of Rs 8.5 lakh from the bank under the MRA scheme.
And they started sewage dress, cleaning business.
I had said about the time of my Swachhta Abhiyan that the Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new enterprises.
And Shailesh Bhosle showed it.
They have brought a tanker and I was told that in such a short span of time, they also returned to the bank.
After all, this is the intention of our MRA scheme.
Someone told me about Bhopal's Mamta Sharma that she got 40 thousand rupees from the bank from the Prime Minister MRA scheme.
He is working to make a batuva.
And it makes a batuva but earlier it used to bring money from more interest and it used to run business with a lot of difficulty.
Now due to his good amount of money coming together, he made his work more good.
And earlier due to the extra interest and due to the reasons he had spent more than one thousand rupees every month due to his coming into his hands.
And his family started to grow gradually a good business too.
But I would like the plan to be more propagated.
All our banks are more sensitive and help more and more smaller people.
In fact, these people run the economy of the country.
The people who do small work are the economic power of the country's meaning.
We want to emphasize that.
It's good, but it's better to do.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel on October 31, I had discussed an India-Shreshtha Bharat.
These are the things that should continue to be aware of social life.
The unity of the nation's Praise of Liberty should continue to be the sanskar sarita.
I want to make this an India-Shreshtha Bharat a scheme.
MyGov had asked for suggestions on it.
How should the construction of the programme be
What happens to people
How to increase public participation
I said for all the suggestions.
I was told that there are enough suggestions coming.
But I expect more suggestions.
No big prices have also been declared.
You also apply your creative mind.
This mantra of unity integrity can be made an India-Shreshtha Bharat connecting this mantra to each other.
What is the plan, how is the program
Whether it is a beast or a glorious one, it is also a lifelong one and it is easy to connect everyone.
What do the government do
What to do with the Vivil Society
There may be many things.
You enjoy wearing clothes, but I will be urging you to exercise.
I will be urging them to keep the body healthy, sometimes they will use the good weather for exercise.
And make an environment in the family, be it a festival of the family, it is an hour to do all this together.
So there is a good weather, then it will also be a good habit.
Once again I have got the privilege of connecting you with Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the fifth one-day match between India and South Africa is going to play in Mumbai.
This series is named Gandhi Mandela series.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased further.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Centre of Akashwani.
Congratulations are to be given because when I started talking about the mind, many people went to join him.
A 12th student of Kerala was associated with Shraddha Thamban.
I have to talk about Kerala once again.
The students of Saint Mary Per-Primary School in Chittor, Kochi, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter is special in many ways.
One, these girls have made a picture of Mother India with their thumb mark, on a very big cloth.
He has sent me that picture of India and Mother India's map.
Earlier I was surprised why he made a map of India with his thumb mark.
But when I read his letter, I realized that how much good symbolic message was given to him.
These are those girls who have just tried to awaken the Prime Minister, it is not so.
He is also trying to make people aware and his mission is Angadan.
They are running a mass awareness campaign for organ donations.
He has also done drama stages by going to many places so that the understanding of Angadan spreads among the people.
Angadan became a tendency and tendency.
These girls have written to me in a letter that you appeal to the people about organ donation in your mind.
He says Angadan should make a festival.
These days, I have a lot of messages on phone call.
Devesh of Delhi has given me such a message.
Every year one lakh eyesight is needed.
On death in a road accident, the organ of the body can be donated.
Some laws are also very confused.
Efforts have also been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made a very good effort to reduce the paperwork and speed it up.
Today, I can say that the organ donation is in the front line of Tamil Nadu in the field of Angadan.
Many social institutions, many NGs are doing a very good job in this direction.
In order to promote organ transplant, the National Exchange and Tissue Transplant Organization (NET) has been set up.
A 247 Elpline 1800114770 is also available.
And it has been said here that the best description of Ten Tykteen Bhujitha is in this mantra.
In the past, we all had seen on TV that a poor thieves, hawkers and his wife were transplanted in Delhi's GB Pant Hospital.
And it was brought from Lucknow to Delhi by making a special effort.
And that operation was successful.
A life survived.
Angadan Mahadan
We should realise this feeling of Ten Tyktan Bhujitha and we must emphasize this thing.
Dear countrymen, now we have celebrated the festival of Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days, the festival of Diwali will also be celebrated.
Eid is also celebrated, Ganesh-Chaturthi is also celebrated.
For the first time on the earth of India, such a big scale is being organized.
Leaders of Chavan African countries and unions have been invited.
African countries are being one of the largest conventions outside Africa.
The relations between India and Africa are deep.
The population of India is as much as the population of African countries.
And if we meet both, we are one-third of the world's population.
And it is said that millions of years ago, it was the same territory.
Later, these two pieces were divided from the Indian Ocean.
There is a lot of similarity between us.
And about 27 lakh people of India have lived in these countries for a long time.
India has economic relations with African countries, cultural relations, diplomatic relations, but India plays a very important role in training the younger generation of most African countries.
Human Resource Development, Apacity Building has read more than 25 thousand African students in India.
And today there are leaders of many African countries and have been studying in India.
So how deep we have.
And from that point of view this Summit is very important.
Generally, when the summit is held, the heads of different countries are found.
Similarly, the meeting of the heads is going to be held in a summit.
Look, it is our endeavour that it should also be a meeting of the people.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the RM Minister of India, made a very good programme.
An essay competitiveness programme was organised among the children of the failed schools of the BSF, the programme for writing poems was organised to increase their participation.
About 16 hundred schools participated in it.
There were also schools outside India and India.
And thousands of schoolchildren have written things that enhance India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, Mahatma Gandhi's birth land from Porbandar to Memorials of Mahatma, an exhibition, mobile exhibition from Porbandar to Northern States is reaching Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of schoolchildren saw this exhibition, the villages and villages saw it.
There were many best compositions in this competition.
I take care of a composition, I feel good, so I want to tell you.
But it is clearly visible to us how the opportunity to connect the people is.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the children who have participated in it, to more than 1600 schools and the RM Ministry.
On August 15, I had proposed a proposal regarding MP Adarsh Gram Yojana for the last time.
After that many MP friends realized this work.
Staying with a big mind.
Last month there was a workshop in Bhopal.
In which these ideal villages are being made, the head of the village, the collector of that place, some of the MPs there, the Indo-Government, the State-Government, all together discussed deeply about the ideal village scheme.
Under the influence of these Left militants, many areas have been wasted there.
But our MPs are very senior, sometimes there have been deputy-speaker in Parliament, Shriman Karia Munda ji, for the tribals, he has spent his life.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to make an ideal village.
I congratulate Mr. Karia Munda ji, the Honourable MP.
Just like I got a news from Andhra.
Andhra MP Ashok Gajapati Raju ji himself was consumed in the scheme of Adarsh Gram and he chose Puri Gram Panchayat for Adarsh Gram through Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The rest of the system is being done, but they have done a big special innovative job.
Shriman Ruwala ji started the Kurtai Kut Sugarcane Festival on March 11 in the village.
The people of all the areas got united in it.
How to make the village a centre of economic activity, how to market the production of the village itself.
His efforts to make a self-sufficient village along with the ideal village are actually an officer of congratulations.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be the matter of mind and how can it not be the matter of cleanliness
Savita Rai has sent me a message from Mumbai through a telephone. Every year we clean our homes to prepare for Diwali.
Let us make this Diwali clean along with our homes as well as our outside environment and keep it clean even after Diwali.
They have attracted attention to the right thing.
I would like to recall you, my dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, the media, especially the media of our country, launched a big campaign and showed all the things where the firecrackers had fallen after Diwali and said that it is not right.
So your point is true that we should do whatever we worry before the festival even after the festival.
Every public program should be done.
And today I want to especially congratulate all the media worlds in India.
And I was also watching how many activities are going on.
How many people are working themselves like the One Like One Mission for this.
How many places in our country have been kept so clean.
All these things were exposed and I had heartily congratulated that commendable work of the India TV Group at that time.
However, since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan has been launched, I have seen that from Andhra, Telangana to T.
And he added about 51 lakh children from about 55-56 thousand schools to this work within Andhra and Telangana.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, parks, a big campaign of cleanliness has been launched in many places.
Now these news gives a philosophy of the power to realize the dream of a clean India.
ABP News has started a programme in the name of my country, and has worked to train the countrymen by highlighting the awareness of cleanliness among the people.
There are hundreds of channels in our country, thousands of newspapers, everybody, I am not able to take the name of all, due to lack of time, but this campaign has been launched.
And that is why Savita Rai ji has suggested that the entire country is assuming this work and taking it forward.
From Meghalaya, our Governor, Mr. Shanmuganathan, he has written a chit to me and by writing a chit, I have mentioned the Mavalyannong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last several years this village has taken up a pilgrimage of sanitation and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this sanitation.
And it is said that a few years ago, he had received the award as the Leanest Village of Asia.
This is what we all believe that our country will definitely be clean.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to say the pride of one hundred and a half million countrymen. See, we have freed our mother India from dirt.
My dear countrymen, I had told the Red Fort on August 15 that there are some things where corruption has been housed.
When the poor person goes for a small job, no one knows what he suffers and how the broker's group grabs the money from them.
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who fully checks a person in the interview of one minute, two minute.
And with this idea, I had announced that why not we are the jobs of this small piece, we should end the tradition of interview there.
My dear young friends, I would like to proudly say that the government has completed all the processes and the non-Getted posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government will no longer be interviewed for recruitment and interview.
January 1, 2016 will be implemented.
We will not interfere in the process where the process is going on, but, it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
So my best wishes to all young friends.
Well, in the last budget, we had declared an important plan.
Gold has become a part of social life in our country.
Gold has been considered as the medium of economic security.
The key of the crisis is considered to be gold.
Gold can become the economic property of the country and every Indian should contribute to it.
Today, I am happy that in the festival of Diwali, when Dhanteras and people buy special gold on that day, before that we are going to launch important schemes.
We have brought the Global Monetisation Scheme.
Under this, you can deposit your gold bank and the bank will give you interest on it as you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier we used to keep the gold locker and we had to pay the locker's rent.
Now keep the gold bank and the money bank will give you interest in the form of interest.
Say that the countrymen can now become gold property or not
Can gold be converted into a vibrant force from Dead-Money or not
That's what we have to do with you.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
One more thing is that in the Sovereign Gold Bonds you do not have a golden leaf in your hands.
So you will get two and a half thousand rupees instead of that paper.
So we're starting it.
Where to keep the gold, his concern will be removed, and no one will come to steal the paper.
So I will keep this scheme with security guarantee in front of the countrymen in the coming week.
I am happy to tell you that we are also bringing Gold ueen.
The world ion with Ashok Chakra has been about 70 years of independence, but till now we have been using the World Hoin or the World Bullion Bars.
At the same time, the world hygiene of twenty grams will also be available for the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, Iron Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel is the birth anniversary.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
Remembering Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the map of the whole of India comes out.
This great man has made a big contribution to the unity of India.
Iron and man have introduced their strength as a man.
We will pay tribute to Sardar Saheb, but his dream of uniting India was his dream.
Geographically he showed taxes, but the mantra of unity should be the medium of our contemplation, behavior, expression.
Many creeds, many sects, many quotes, many castes, many environments, how many varieties are our country and this diversity is due to which our beauty is.
If there was no diversity then perhaps we can not do the beauty we are proud of.
And therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, goodwill, unity are the herbs of development.
Over the last several years, on 31st October, there are programmes of Run for Unity in many corners of the country.
I have heard this time also its plans are being made around, people are preparing for a race for unity with enthusiasm.
The race of unity is the race for development in the true sense.
In the second sense, the guarantee of development race is also a race of unity.
Come, pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Proceed the mantra of unity.
Brothers and sisters, Now all of you will be engaged in the preparations for Diwali, cleanliness will be done in the house.
New things will be bought.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated separately in every corner of our country.
I extend my best wishes to you for the holy festival of Deepawali.
But, in the days of Diwali, some accidents also come in mind.
My dear countrymen, I have to visit Britain on the second day of Deepawali.
I am very excited this time for my visit to Britain.
The Government of India and the State Governments also provide scholarships to such classes of society, be it Dalit, tribal, backward, such promising children who go abroad.
I am confident that when such children of India go to UK, this place of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage for him, it will become a pilgrimage for him, it will become a land of inspiration and learn something in life but to live for the country later, this message was given by Babasaheb Ambedkar.
And that is why I am saying that during my visit to Britain, I am specially excited, the subject had been complicated for many years and now that building becomes the property of 1.
I will also get another opportunity in London, unveil the statue of Lord Vishwaswar.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Vishwaswar for democracy and for the Employment of Women is a really studying aspect of the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Vishwaswar on the land of London is an excellent example of how long the great men of India thought.
So you know that when such incidents are related, the mind of all our countrymen gets thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with the talk of mind.
I get your suggestions through telephone, MyGov.in.
Akashwani is also discussed about your letters.
There is talk of calling government officials.
Some people write their problems, there is also an attempt to solve problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
I have got the privilege of learning some languages but still there are so many languages that where did I learn
But yet, I am grateful to the Akashwani that they broadcast this matter of mind at 8 pm in the regional language of every state.
Even though that voice is of someone else, but it is of my mind.
Last time I was completing one year today we are entering the new year.
Greetings to my dear countrymen once again.
Jai Hind
Talk of mind, September 2015
My dear countrymen, greet you all
And on the other hand, the Parliament and the infants of this country on the one hand should talk about cleanliness and the good fortune of this country. This movement is going on for the sanitation of the ideas, the atmosphere of hatred towards the dirt, a awareness towards cleanliness, it will force the governments to work, it will do it.
Whether it is Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat, Municipal Corporation, Municipal Corporation or State or Centre, everybody has to work on it. We have to move ahead with this movement, we have to move ahead with the shortcomings. And in 2019, when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
And I was surprised that the child, the entire Gita, the entire Gita, was foolish. But when I asked him, the shloka used to tell him, he used to define him in English, he used to define him in Hindi, I asked his father, he said, he was speaking at the age of five years.
Say, we don't even know, so I said, and what is the situation in studies, only the Gita reads and does something
Once again, I have got the opportunity to come amongst you to talk about the mind.
In the remote south, people are colored in the festival of Onam and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Government of India has implemented several new schemes for social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short time, in a wide range, all of them have accepted these schemes.
I had made a small plea that on the festival of Raksha Bandhan, we should give this security plan to our sisters.
I have come to know that eleven crore families have been associated with this scheme since the start of the scheme.
And I was also told that almost half of the benefits have been received by the mothers and sisters.
I think it's a good sign.
I also extend my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious festival of Rakshabandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken on a large scale a year ago.
I also saw the riches of the poor.
The account was to be opened from ero balance but the poor saved and saved the amount of Rs.
The main stream of the economy is the banking sector and this system has also emphasized the plan for bank friends so that they reach the poor's house.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
And now thousands of people have become entitled to take overdrafts under this Jan Dhan Yojana.
And the poor can get money from the bank.
Once again, I congratulate all the concerned and urge the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters who have opened the bank accounts not to break the relationship with the bank.
This bank is yours, you should not leave it now.
I have brought you, now it is your job to catch him.
Our accounts should be active.
But in a very short span of time, all my citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat took over the situation.
He played an active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating and once again Gujarat went on the path of peace.
This is the right path of peace, unity, brotherhood and on the path of development, we have to walk shoulder to shoulder.
Development is the solution of our problems.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
They got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I tell you the truth that in a way, I have got the opportunity to listen to the perspective of the kind of music that is playing.
Their words were selected, their way of conversation, i.e. the generosity that is in the Sufi tradition, which is the privilege of a music, all of them were experienced in the midst of these scholars.
I felt very good.
Perhaps it has become the most important to bring the world to the right form of Islam.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition that is associated with love and liberality will reach this message far and wide, which will benefit humanity, will also benefit Islam.
And I also tell others why we do not believe in any community, but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days, and I consider this invitation as my luck.
In India, the scholars of the Buddhist tradition of many countries of the world are coming to Bodhgaya and are going to discuss global issues related to humanity, I have also received an invitation and I am happy that those people have invited me to come to Bodhgaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru went to Bodhgaya.
I am going to get the opportunity to visit Bodhgaya with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you the talk of mind specially today.
I have already mentioned this topic in Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard, I will have heard in Parliament, you will have heard in public meetings, you will have heard in mind.
I have been saying one thing every time that the mind of the government is open about the fact that there is a dispute about the And Acquisition Act.
I have been saying this again and again that I am ready to accept any suggestion of the interest of the farmers.
This means that my government was formed, the situation that was before it has now been replaced.
But there was a work incomplete and that was 13 such points that were to be completed in a year and that is why we had brought it to the ordinance but the matter was also confused due to these disputes.
We are implementing those 13 points that are directly connected to the farmers, we are implementing them under the rules so that farmers are not harmed, there is no economic loss and therefore, we are fulfilling the 13 points that were left in the previous law, and I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan is not a slogan for us, this is our mantra - the welfare of the villages, the welfare of the poor farmers - and only then we had said on 15th August that the Department of Agriculture, but the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be set up with the decision that we have taken very fast.
I have to say another thing that two days ago, fifty years of the 1965 war took place and whenever it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is very natural to remember Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan Mantra too.
And it is very natural to remember all those martyrs who keep the tricolor flags of India, their joy and joy.
I salute all the stakeholders of the victory of the 65th war.
I salute the heroes.
And the incidents of such history continue to inspire us.
The way I had the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi tradition last week, it was a pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to talk to the dignitaries of the country for hours.
He got the opportunity to hear and I am happy that in the field of science, India is doing excellent work in many directions.
Our scientists are actually doing excellent work.
Now we have an opportunity to make these amendments reach the masses.
How to convert the principles into tools
How to add Lab to Hand
He has to move forward as an opportunity.
I also got many new information.
I can say that he was also a very inspiring and academic for me.
And I saw that many young scientists were telling them with fervor, how dreams were visible in their eyes.
And when I had said last time in Mann Ki Baat that our students should move forward towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are many opportunities and possibilities.
I have many letters from the citizens.
From Thane, Mr. Parimal Shah has written to me on MyGov.in regarding educational reforms.
Emphasis on reforms in the education sector.
I have to say a thing to my young friends that I had told the Red Fort on August 15 why this interview for lower level jobs
Everyone runs, and perhaps this is also one of the reasons for corruption at the lower level.
And I had said on 15th August that I want to get rid of the interview tradition below one level.
I am happy that in such a short time, it has been 15 days, but the government is moving forward very fast.
The information is being sent and almost now the decision will be implemented that small jobs will be discharged from the interview round.
The poor will not have to run for recommendation.
There will be no deploitation, there will be no corruption.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For health, the mother-mortality and child-mortality of Khaskar, for his action plan, all to action worldwide contemplated in the land of India.
This was the first time outside the United States, in any other country.
And it is true that even today, every year in our country about 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die at the time of delivery and immediately after that.
It's worrying and scared.
Well the improvement is enough.
India has started to appreciate at the international level, yet this figure is not less.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of tetanus in the death of mothers and infants.
The world has accepted it.
But we still have to save our mothers, save our newborn children.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays the news of dengue is coming.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And what I am talking about Swachh Bharat is directly connected to it.
We see advertisement on T, but our attention does not go.
Advertisement is printed in the newspaper, but our attention is not taken.
There are ways to keep cleaning in small things in the house with pure water.
There is widespread public education in these things, but we do not care and sometimes it seems that we live in a very good house, we are very good and we do not know that ourselves are filled with water and somewhere we invite dengue.
I would urge you all that we should not let death become so cheap.
Life is very precious.
It is not okay that the apathy of water, indifference to cleanliness, it becomes a cause of death.
Around 514 centers across the country are available for free checking facilities for dengue.
It is useful to protect life from time to time and collaboration with you all is very important in this.
And cleanliness should be of great importance.
These days, festivals are celebrated in our country in a way from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali.
Why not add every festival to cleanliness now
You see the rituals will become nature.
My dear countrymen, today I have to tell you a good news. I always say that now we will not get the opportunity to die for the country but we have got the privilege of living for the country.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
Race Cross America is a cycle-race in the United States, it is very difficult that is about 4,800 kilometers long race.
This year, these two brothers won this race.
See, how everyone is making their own efforts to take the country forward.
And this is the case when such incidents listen to, the chest gets strained.
Sometimes due to experiment, we make serious injustice to our youth.
And the old generation always feels that the new generation does not understand anything and I understand that this series has been running for centuries.
My experience about the youth is different.
Sometimes talk to the youth, then we also get a lot to learn.
I have met many youngsters who say that brother, I have taken a fast in life.
Some people say that I have kept ycle-ay a day in a week.
It's good for my health too.
And I also enjoy being my youth.
Nowadays, bicycle also runs in many cities in our country and people who promote bicycle are also very much.
But these are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today, when two youngsters of my country hoisted the flag in the US, I liked to mention the direction in which the youth of India think about.
I specially want to congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
I'm happy.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar - The land of Indu Mill of Mumbai - the case was hanging for a long time to make his memorial.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now there will be a magnificent inspirational monument of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, who will continue to inspire us to work for Dalits, victims, exploited, deprived.
But at the same time, where Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar lived in London - 10, King Henry Road, that house has now been bought.
When Indians traveling around the world go to London, Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the memorial that is now going to be built by the Maharashtra government, will become our inspiration.
I extend my greetings to the Government of Maharashtra for both these efforts to honour Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My dear brothers and sisters, Before the next Mann Ki Baat comes, you must tell me your ideas because I am confident that democracy runs by people-to-people partnership.
The country can move forward only by mixing the shoulder with the shoulder.
My best wishes to you.
This year the rain has started well.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will definitely get help in sowing kharif.
And a happy thing has come to me and I am very happy.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor should need pulses, there should be a little oil in vegetables, etc. to eat.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, July 26 is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The country's farmer's relationship is as much as the land is as the youth of the country.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers was heavy on hundreds of enemies.
I salute those brave soldiers who foil the efforts of the enemies by not taking care of their lives.
The war of Kargil was not only fought on the borders, in every city of India, in every village, this war was contributed.
This war fought for those mothers and sisters, whose young son or brother was fighting with enemies in Kargil.
The daughters fought, whose hands have not yet got the henna of limelight.
And therefore, today, on Kargil Vijay Diwas, I salute all these soldiers.
On 26th July, I consider it a very important point of view because, after the formation of our government in 2014, we started MyGov on 26th July in a few months.
Our resolve to increase public participation in democracy, to add people to the work of development, and I am happy to say that after one year, about two crore people have seen MyGov.
Nearly five and a half lakh people have interacted and the most happy thing is that more than fifty thousand people have suggested on PM applications, they took time out, mind apply, this work was considered important.
Now the matter is small, but neither in the government anybody came to this attention, nor was it thought about it.
But on the suggestion of brother Akhilesh Vajpayee, the government seriously considered and today this system was implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today, the people who are made, tag-lines are made, the programme is created, the policy is made, there are very positive suggestions on MyGov.
There is a new rash Air experience in the governance system.
There is a new consciousness experience.
These days, I have started suggesting on MyGov, what should I say on August 15
Suchitra Raghwachari from Chennai, he has sent some suggestions.
Beti-daughter, speak on daughter-daughter, speak on clean Ganga, speak on clean India.
But it brought me an idea, what should I say this time on 15th August
You can send to MyGov, write letters on Akashwani and write letters at the Prime Minister's Office.
I believe, perhaps it is a good idea that my speech on August 15 should be suggested by the people of Janardhana.
I am sure you will send good suggestions.
I want to express my concern towards one thing.
I do not want to give any preaching nor do I find a way to avoid the responsibilities of the units of the state government, central government or local Swaraj.
Just two days ago, I looked at the scene of an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver continued to drown for 10 minutes.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people continue to write on this thing that you may speak something on road safety.
Beware of the people, Hoshakot Akshay of Bangalore, Amay Joshi of Pune, Prasanna Kakunje of Murbidri of Karnataka.
And when you look at the data, the heart gets shaken.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to the accident, due to road accident, one dies every 4 minutes.
And the biggest concern is that about one-third of those who die about 15-25 years of age and one death shakes the entire family.
The work that the government should do should be done, but I look forward to parents, my children, whether they run two-wheelers or run our-wheelers, the environment of paying attention to the saetty should also be increased in the family.
Another project for us is going to be expanded further, ashless Treatment, Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara. From there, for Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangao, Mondia highways, we are giving priority to the first fifty hours.
To provide information about the accidents across the country, the system of toll-free 1033 numbers, ambulances, all these things have been done after the accident.
For not being an accident, we all really need to see that one life is very lovely and one life is very lovely.
Sometimes I say, become an employee Karmayogi.
In the past, some incidents came in my mind, I felt good that I should talk to you, sometimes the person who works, sometimes gets tired and sometimes gets tired of a few years.
I like to see this big example of how life can be brought to my work.
Vijay Biswal has told how his interest, his art, his capabilities can be added to his work.
It may be that Vijay Biswal's painting will be discussed in the coming days.
And I also came to know that the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh started a work that touched my mind and I like it.
They started the operation devastating war - now it will be somebody, listening to it will be something else.
See how Raksha Bandhan has changed, I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
A news had come to my ears, sometimes these small things enjoy my heart so I am shared with you.
There is a small village by Keshla in Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village tried to make toilets for the last few months.
And now no person has to go to the open in that village.
He did this, but when the whole work was completed, the whole village celebrated a very big festival like that.
These best examples of how the values are changing in social life, how the people are changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I am writing from Bhavesh Deka, Guwahati, regarding the questions of North-East.
However, the people of North-East are also a lot of activity.
They keep writing a lot, it's good.
But today I would like to say to them that there is a separate minister for the North-East.
They will go to the districts, go to the villages, meet the local government officials, talk to the people and talk to the citizens.
They will listen to the problems, they will also do what the Government of India has to do to solve the problems.
These efforts will bring very good results in the coming days.
And those officers who come here and come here also feel that how beautiful the state, how good people, how many good people have to live by developing this area and solving their problems.
If they return with this resolution, even after coming to Delhi, it has become very simple to understand the problems there.
So a good endeavour is an attempt to go from Delhi to far east, which I am saying Act East Policy. This is the fact.
My dear countrymen, we all are proud of the success of the Mars Mission.
But sometimes it comes to the ideas that if we talk to the younger generation and ask them what you want to be ahead then one or half of the 100 people will get a student which will say that I have to become a scientist.
It is a matter of great concern to reduce the trend towards science.
It is a very important need to take interest in innovation, encourage them and know their capabilities.
I also keep telling the IAS officers of the government that if you have gone ahead by writing so much, then you should also go to a school-college for two-four hours in a week and talk to the children.
Whatever experience you have, the power you have will be able to work for this new generation.
Work is difficult, but it's to do.
We have launched it and in the coming years, we have got 24 hours of electricity to the villages.
Even the children of the village, if they have to study in the days of examination, then there is no problem of electricity.
Even if small industries are to be installed in the village then electricity is available.
Today even if you want to make mobile charge then you have to go to another village.
The benefits that the cities get, they should meet the villages.
And that is why we have started Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti programme.
I know that such a big country, lakhs of villages and villages have to reach home and home.
But, it is only for the poor to run.
Today, he decided to talk about things like mind.
In a way, our country has the opportunity for the month of August, the month of September, the festivals.
There are many festivals.
My best wishes to all of you.
Send me suggestions for August 15.
Your ideas will be very useful for me.
In the last Mann Ki Baat, I had prayed to you that if you go somewhere in the holidays, and if there is a memorable picture then incredible.
When I said, I did not think that such a strong result would be found.
Millions of people posted photos, on Twitter, on Facebook, in Instagram.
I can say that more than one vision can be seen, India is full of diversity.
Be it architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas.
Perhaps the Government of India has never thought that in terms of tourism, people can do such a big job that you people have done.
And I felt so much that I also re-tweeted him.
We will continue to see this thing, the world will see it, our countrymen will see it and our new generation will see it.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister but the person within me sometimes loses himself from all the posts and positions.
21st June, International Day of Yoga, I can say that my mind was agitated in the same way when I kept this topic in the NC.
We can say with the claim that the sun never moves in the world of yoga practicers.
The way Yoga was honoured by the world, the way the whole world raised on its shoulders, who would be a Hindustani who would not be proud.
The mind got crushed.
And when the people of France, for whom the Sean river and the Fiel Tower are very glorious, they liked that place to do yoga, they gave the place of equality.
People in New York performed Yoga on Times Suare.
If it is a matter of Australia, Sydney, then the picture of Pera House comes in front of us.
The citizens of Australia have done yoga at the same time by keeping yoga equal to the Pera House.
Whether it is North America, Silicon Valley, Milan's Kumo Thedral, it is a matter of pride in itself.
Similarly, the NPAC-Kepping Force also performed a very good show of Yoga.
Even in India, on Siachen, on the white ice sheet, our youngsters were making Yoga programmes by the navy in the ocean, all around, wherever our navy ships were.
Delhi has registered its place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became Yogapath.
I am grateful to the country and the world and I can say that it was not a programme.
It seemed like a new curiosity, a new joy, a new zeal, a new engagement from every corner of the world.
A few days ago, when a family from Twitter, Vietnam tweeted a photo of a younger child, it was so dear that photo, it became so popular all over the world.
Everybody, women and men, children, villages, villages, developing Countries or developing Countries, everyone has joined.
Yoga became a reason for connecting the world in the true sense.
But I am feeling one thing and every Indian can feel proud that the world is very eager to know India.
A curiosity towards India has increased.
The values here, the traditions here, the legacy here, the world wants to know.
We all have the responsibility to distribute this legacy without laggel, to the world, to introduce the world.
But we will be able to introduce this when we are proud of our legacy.
Sometimes we are so familiar with our things, what is new in it, it seems like our family values, we do not know that Indias family values are very big for the world.
I'm sure I'll be stupid.
There are many things that our ancestors have given us and the best of them have the right to the world.
The success of International Yoga Day has come to bring a new responsibility with happiness and satisfaction.
It is our responsibility to give us the best yoga teacher to the world.
It is our responsibility to see all the traditions of Yoga from a platform to the world.
Introduction of institutions related to yoga, information about Yoga Gurus, information about yoga.
If you have to learn yoga then you can learn, wherever you want yoga teachers, you will get from here, you should prepare a database and I believe you can do it.
Let's start anybody from anywhere, it will also become a new power.
I also look at the events of the last few days and the working government, the running government, once the goal is fixed, we have seen how the results can be achieved.
And when there was disappointment all around, we should not forget that one voice was heard from all four sides a year ago, nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine that AYUSH is a department in the government, no one will ever pay attention to it.
In 2-5 years, if a small news comes in the newspaper, then it will come in a corner, a small department, but it leads Yoga Day.
And in the world, small departments have shown such a big job by organizing.
If the goal is in front, then the small unit also works the best, it is a sample.
In the past, the world saw how our people saved the victims of Yemen.
Within hours, when the people of India were running to help Nepal, when the working government had to open the Jan Dhan Account in the bank, the people of all the banks came to the ground and in a short span of time, millions of countrymen were connected to the bank.
On August 15, I had appealed for toilets from Red Fort to schools and I had said that by August 15, we have to complete this work.
It was a great courage to call for the work that was not done in 60 years, about four and a half lakh toilets were made, but today I can say with satisfaction that it is still late for the arrival of 15th August, but it was not completed, but people completed the work of making toilets in almost schools.
I mean, the government, the people, the government, all want to work for the country.
Last month we had launched three public security schemes, I had done from Calcutta.
There has been very positive results in such a short time.
We have worked very little in terms of public security in India but due to these three schemes, we are engaged in a very big jump.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined somewhere in the schemes of these public security but we have to move forward.
Rakshabandhan festival comes in the month of August.
On behalf of Rakshabandhan's brother, sister can have a big gift.
Let us all try to fulfill this resolve by meeting with me.
When I talk about the mind, many people also send suggestions to me.
This time, I should say something for the monsoon, many people have sent such suggestions.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harsh Vardhan ji of Mysore, Pravin Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji, said that for monsoon, you must tell something about the mind.
They have sent good suggestions.
You may also have to enjoy hot pakods, hymns, cornes, as well as tea in the rain.
But as soon as the sun rays give life, the same rain gives strength to our life.
The water of the village should be in the village, the water of the city should be in the city, it should be our resolve, it should try to stop water.
And the rain water stops and if the land returns and the earth gets recharged then the problems of the year are solved.
I always tell the people that if you go to Porbandar in Gujarat and if you go to the house of Mahatma Gandhi then there is a tank in the geography of his two hundred years old house in which the rain water was straight there.
Porbandar is on the coast of the sea, but sweet water was stored in the house by collecting rain water, at that time there was so much care.
We can also do it.
We all should be in large quantities by the social organisations and the youth in this rainy season.
And I give a suggestion and I have a direct experience, a very successful experience.
This is my entire rural technology.
When you plant the plant, put an old soil clock in the plant bugle and fill it with water.
If you fill water twice a month, it will also run.
I also keep telling the farmers, instead of putting a fence on the banks of your field, plant trees.
They will become your property.
And we know that in the days of rain, diseases spread very much in water.
Due to moisture increase in the environment, bacteria start to grow and cleanliness becomes very important for this, cleanliness becomes very important.
The request to drink pure water is necessary.
It is true that the number of cases we will do, the disease will be away from us.
Water should be required, rain should also be avoided but disease should also be avoided.
Our countrymen, now we have launched three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
There are about 500 small towns in our country.
Under the AMRUT scheme, we have taken a big campaign to make our cities livelihood eligible.
In the same way, such a country should also be equal to the world.
There should be a smart city in the country and on the other hand, the poorest of the poor should have a house to live in the country and the house should also be arranged for the school to study in the nearby areas where there is electricity, water, toilets.
In 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence, we want to give home to the countrymen.
With these three things, a big plan has been started.
I am confident that all these schemes will work in bringing about changes in urban life.
I myself are associated with you all through social media, many new ideas keep meeting with you people and also get good information about the government.
But sometimes a person sitting in a remote village also touches our heart.
You know that a Beti Bachao-Beti Teacho Programme is being run by the government.
But when the government's program makes a person, society, village, then how much it increases.
In the past, a Sarpanch of Bibipur village of Haryana, Shri Sunil Jaglan ji, took him a very funny initiative.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low compared to children.
There are about 100 districts in the country in which this condition is worrisome.
The highest in Haryana.
But the Sarpanch Beti Bachao Abhiyan of a small village of Haryana is such a turn, then the mind is very happy and a new hope is awakened.
So I express my happiness.
But I have got inspiration from this incident and therefore I also urge you to post yourself with your daughter, with your daughter, with your daughter.
Beti Bachao-Beti Teaching the idea by writing a tagline, by writing the best line, it can be in any language, whether English or Hindi or your mother tongue or any language.
The very inspiring tagline I will be of Selfie your daughter and I will retweet you.
We all can transform this thing into a mass movement in a way to save daughter-daughter.
The work which was started by brother Sunil from Bibipur village of Haryana and all of us should move forward together and I urge you to possess the selectivewithdaughter.
So my best wishes to all of you in this rain, enjoy the rain.
Make our country green.
The International Yoga Day is not for one day, you will continue the practice of Yoga.
You see, you'll see the benefits.
Make a part of your life, it must be done.
Incredible India, you must travel somewhere, keep sending photographs.
The country and the world will know how much diversity our country has.
One of them felt that there was a lot of money about handicrafts.
We have to reach the world, we have to reach the features of India all around.
And we have a simple medium, we must reach.
My dear countrymen, today I will meet the next time for the next thing.
In a slight atmosphere, 130 crore people used to listen, repeat, and sometimes their own things became inspiration for their own people.
You can imagine how it might have been in the middle of the Kalkhand.
Perhaps it wasn't a living program
This programme was a lifestyle, a feeling of mind, affiliation of hearts, and because of this, the time that went between me was very difficult for me.
I was missing something every moment and when I talk about the mind, I may say that the words are mine, the voice is mine, but, the story is yours, the male is yours, the ultimate is yours.
was feeling a vacancy
But this Sunday waited a lot
Well, it's got a chance.
Many messages have come in the last few months in which people said that they are missing the matter of mind
Sometimes I feel that this is my own journey to harmony .
This is my important journey of adult .
My silent interaction with you for me was also a part of the experience of my visit to Spiritual.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions, why did I go to Kedarnath
Most people have taken political meaning from it .
For me, that was the opportunity to meet me.
In a way I went to meet me,
I will not tell other things today, but I will do so much that the vacancies that were due to this shortfall of mind, in the valley of Kedar, in that solitary cave, perhaps he had given an opportunity to fill something.
The rest is your curiosity - I think I will ever discuss it too .
As people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, your efforts to emphasize a positive thing, I always feel in your words.
The letters that come for the matter of mind, the inputs that are received are completely different from government functioning.
In a way your letter also becomes a cause of inspiration for me and sometimes becomes the cause of energy .
Sometimes you do some words to hold my thought process .
People keep the challenges faced by the country and the society, then they also explain solutions along with it.
If someone writes for sanitation then he is expressing his resentment towards dirt but also appreciates the efforts of cleanliness .
If someone discusses the environment then he feels pain, but at the same time, he also tells the experiments he has seen and the imaginations he has in his mind also depicts.
It tells us that there is no shortage of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
It is necessary to incorporate those strengths and talents, provide opportunities and implement them.
Mann Ki Baat also points out that all 130 crore countrymen want to join the country's progress with strength and activism and I will definitely say that I have so many letters in the matter of mind, so many telephone calls come, so many messages are received, but the element of complaints is very low and somebody has asked for himself, so one thing has not come to me in the last five years.
When I analysis these things you can imagine how much joy will come to my heart, how much energy will I get
Actually I have not come - you have brought me, you have made me sit down and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
With this feeling, let's go ahead with the talk of mind
When Emergency was imposed in the country, its opposition was not limited to political realms, it was not limited to politicians, till the bars of jail, the movement was not limited.
In the Emergency, every citizen of the country started feeling that something has been snatched.
Recently, the Mahaparva of Democracy, the huge election campaign, the rich to the poor, all were ready to decide the future of our country with happiness in this festival.
When something is very close to us, we ignore the importance of it, its claiming facts also ignore it.
In India, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, more than 61 crore people voted, City One More
This number can be very common for us but if I say that if we leave China then more than the population of any country in the world had voted in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the US, is almost double
The number of voters in India is more than the population of the entire Europe
It introduces the vastness and wideness of our democracy .
The 2019 Lok Sabha election was the world's largest democratic election in history so far
You can imagine how much resources and human power would have been required to complete such elections.
Elections of millions of teachers, officers and employees were possible by day-night hard work
To successfully fulfil this great man of democracy, where about 3 lakh security personnel of the paramilitary forces performed their responsibility, 20 lakh policemen from different states also laboured.
As a result of the hard work of these people, more than the last time voting took place this time.
About 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM (M) machines, more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines, how big can you imagine for voting
All this was done so that it can be ensured that no voter is deprived of his franchise.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, polling station was created for just one female voter.
Polling stations located at the highest height in the world are also in India
This polling station is located at an altitude of 15,000 feet in Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh
Apart from this, there is also another fact that is proud in this election.
Perhaps, this is the first time in history that women have voted with enthusiasm like men.
The percentage of voting of women and men in this election was almost equal
Another encouraging fact related to this is that today there are 78 women MPs in Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the election process and bow down to the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth many times, don't book, I was urging you to give books instead of flowers in the welcome.
Since then people have been giving books in a sufficient place .
However, I could not get a lot of time, but during my migration, I got a chance to read some of his stories again.
His stories contain the whole of Indias mindset .
When I was reading the story of his name of drug addiction, my mind myself went on economic inequalities in the society.
This story of amindar's son God and the poor family is learned from the story that if you are not careful then when the effect of bad complication goes on, it does not seem to be known.
The second story, which touched my heart inside, was Idgah, the sensitivity of a child, his pure love for his grandmother, so mature feelings at the younger age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid reaches his grandmother with a stick from the fair, in fact, human sentiment reaches his peak.
The last line of this story is very emotional because it has a very big truth of life, the child Hamid played the part of old Hamid, the old man Amina, the girl Amina.
Such a big merciful story is the night of Pus
In this story a living picture of the irony of a poor farmer ' s life was seen .
Turmeric farmer is happy even after his crop is destroyed because now he will not have to sleep in the field in the cold winter
Though these stories have been done almost a century ago, their relevance still feels the same.
After reading them, I felt a different kind of experience.
When it is being read, in any media, I was studying about the Akshara Library of Kerala
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village settled between the dense forests of Idukki
P.K. Murlidharan, teacher of Primary School and P.V. Chinnathampi, who runs a small tea shop, both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by filling them in the clutches and putting them on the back.
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone with tribal children
Gujarat campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat
Millions of people of every age group participated in this campaign to read books .
In today's digital world, at the time of Google Guru, I would also urge you to take out some time and place the book in your daily routine.
You will really enjoy a lot and write about whatever book you read on the Narendra Modi App so that all the audience of the mind will also be able to know about it .
My dear countrymen, I am happy to note that the people of our country are thinking about issues that are not only a challenge for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Belagavi's Pawan Gaurai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written to me about water related challenges.
Water has great importance in our culture .
You give your blessings like your mother , your grace continues to rain on us .
Due to lack of water many parts of the country are affected every year .
You will be surprised that only 8 of the water received from the rain throughout the year is saved in our country .
I am confident that like other problems, we will also solve this crisis with the strength, cooperation and resolve of one hundred and thirty crore Indians with public participation, peoples strength and people.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been created in the country keeping the importance of water paramount.
This will facilitate speedy decisions on all matters related to water .
A few days ago I tried to separate something
I wrote a letter to Sarpanches across the country to the village head
I wrote to the village heads that to save water, to save water, to save the drop-drop of water, they should convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha and interact with the villagers.
I am happy that he has shown full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month, millions of people in thousands of panchayats have donated labour.
People in the village-village resolve to collect one drop of water
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat program, I want to tell you about a Sarpanch
Listen, the Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Cuttackamsandy Block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us the message to all my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas
People there, once again are ready to play their active role for water conservation.
My best wishes to all the Gram Pradhans, all the Sarpanchs and their activeness.
There are many Sarpanchs across the country who have taken the lead of water conservation.
In a way the entire village has become an opportunity.
It seems that the people of the village have now gathered in the competition to build water temples like in their village.
As I said, a collective effort can result in great positive results.
There can be no formula to deal with water crisis all over the country
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country in different ways.
But everyone's goal is the same, and it is to save water, water conservation
Drainage lines are being cured in Punjab
This is getting rid of the problem of waterlogging.
The creation of a tank in Thimmaipalli (Thimaipalli) of Telangana is changing the lives of the people of villages.
In the Kabirdham of Rajasthan, small ponds built in the fields have made a major change.
I was studying a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working very well on renewable harvesting together.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we are united and striving firmly, we can also make impossible possible.
When people join, water will save
Today I am requesting 3 requests from the countrymen through Mann Ki Baat
My first request is as if the countrymen gave cleanliness the form of a mass movement, start a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us all resolve to save every drop of water together and I am confident that water is the prasad of God, water is the form of Paras.
Earlier they used to say that with the touch of Paras iron becomes gold .
I say, water is Paras and by Paras, by touching water, new life is created.
Initiate an awareness campaign to save one drop of water
Tell about water related problems, as well as propagate ways to save water
I specially urge the celebrities of different sectors to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Be it a film world, a sports world, a media partner, a people associated with social organisations, a people associated with cultural organisations, everybody should lead this movement in their own way.
Awake the society, add society, join the society
You see, we will see changes in front of our eyes.
My second request to the countrymen is that many traditional methods are being used for conservation of water in our country for centuries.
I urge all of you to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to the birthplace of Porbandar, worshipped Bapu, then there is another house behind the house of worshipped Bapu, there is a water storage tank of 200 years old and even today there is a arrangement to stop rain water, then I always used to say that whatever Kirti temple goes to that water tank must be seen.
Let us motivate people to protect water by making a list of more and more methods related to water conservation.
You can share your content using Jan Shakti4Jal Shakti Hashtag
My dear countrymen, I am also grateful to you for another thing and express my gratitude to the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again, with the activism of Yoga Day, with the zeal, three-four generations of each family came together and celebrated Yoga Day
Yoga Day is increasingly increasing in the awareness that has come to light for the healthcare.
Everyone, in every corner of the world, as soon as the sun comes out, if a yoga lover welcomes it, then it is a complete journey of sunrise.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from Air Force to Aircraft Carriers, from A Gyms to the desert, from villages to cities wherever possible, not only Yoga was done at all such places but it was also collectively celected.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, well-known celebrities, ordinary citizens from many countries of the world showed me on Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their respective countries.
That day, the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that healthy and sensitive persons are needed to create a healthy society and Yoga ensures that.
So the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service .
Should not such a service be recognized and honored
Announcement of Prime Ministers Awards to contribute excellently in the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019 was a matter of great satisfaction for me in itself.
This award has been given to organisations around the world about which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly to the promotion of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, who has made Yoga popular throughout Japan
Japan Yoga Niketan runs several institutes and training courses there or take the name of Ms. Antonietta Roy of Italy who started the Sarva Yoga International and spread Yoga throughout Europe.
These are inspiring examples in themselves .
If it is a matter related to yoga, can Indians stay behind in it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger has also been honored and has been dedicated to Yoga for the past several decades.
It is a very important journey for me to join your ideas.
Come on, let's keep talking.
Keep listening to your emotions, be careful, keep understanding.
Sometimes I try to live those emotions
Be your blessings
You are my inspiration, you are my energy
Come and sit together and enjoy the matter of mind and keep the responsibilities of life.
Then once again the next month will meet again for the matter of mind .
Thank you very much.
This weather is also of heat on one side, and there is also a joy of heat somewhere.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2015
Mann Ki Baat, December 2014
I have seen that there was no programme of evils of the government and I believe that in a way there was a hardship to get out of the problem and because of this, the atmosphere of good discussions has started. They have been sensitive to the responsibility of the government. They cannot be indifferent now. I would like to ask those youngsters who have been drunk and drunk, whether you have ever thought that you might have realized a different life in two hours and four hours of drunkenness.
Have you ever thought
Imagine
This is the money of drugs if they go to terrorists
If terrorists buy arms from these money
And with those weapons a terrorist will have to shoot in the chest of my country's young man
The young man of my country will be martyred
Have you ever thought of killing the red of a mother, the life of the mother of India, the life of the mother of the country, the life of the country, the soldier's chest, isn't it
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their folk progress with our children
Modi ji is not you tired
One month is very long .
A lot of incidents occur in the country and the world .
You all celebrated Diwali with enthusiasm and enthusiasm .
There are festivals that keep enthusiastic in life from time to time, the poor, the rich, the village, the city, the festival has its own importance in everybody's life.
Sometimes they think that uit Yar. People are useless, people have nothing to do. Our country is the same.
I am talking about my mind last year and today I say that it is very important to change this thinking that our country is not like this, the people of our country are not such.
Sometimes I feel that the country is far ahead and the governments are far behind.
And when I am experienced , I say that perhaps it is very important for the governments to change their thinking .
And I am saying that I am seeing that these youngsters are committed to do something or the other to do.
And it ' s also doing in its own way .
I had said last time, buy at least one khadi cloth.
I didn ' t ask anyone to be a khadi - holder . But I received information from the Khadi storage that in a week about a hundred and a half per cent handread and twenty five percent sales increased .
In a way , more than double khadi was sold in a week from 2nd October to 1st October compared to the previous year .
This means that the people of the country are many times ahead of what we think.
I salute the Indians .
Cleanliness . One can imagine that cleanliness will take the form of such a mass movement.
There are many expectations, and should also be.
And I see a good result, cleaning is now being seen in two parts.
What will the people sitting in the government system do to do for the old filth, the filth of dirt.
There is a very big challenge but you cannot escape from responsibility .
All the governments will have to take steps for this responsibility because the pressure of the people is going to increase.
And the media is also playing a very good role in it .
But the other aspect that is very enthusiastic, joyful and satisfactory to the mind. The common man has started feeling that let's leave the first thing, let's not do dirt.
We will not be able to make a new filth .
Satna, some of the people of Madhya Pradesh, some of them have done Bharat Gupta, they sent a mail to my mygov.
He was going to visit his railway. He said his experience. He said that Saheb used to go to the railway earlier, this time too I went to the railway but I am seeing that every passenger in the railway keeps eating and drinking in the railways, throwing papers. Not only that, he used to find that there is a dustbin in the box, put garbage in it.
And when he saw that there was no arrangement in the railway , he himself collected his garbage in the corner .
He said this was a very pleasant experience for me .
I am grateful to Bharat ji that he brought this information to me .
But I am seeing this that the most effect has happened in small children .
Hundreds of families talk about the fact that if our child eats chocolates somewhere then the paper takes up immediately .
I just saw someone in the social media that someone had written. Today's hero.. and in today's hero he gave a picture of a child.
You see. Everyone feels that our country, we will not filth.
We ' ll not be able to make filthy .
And whatever they do, they feel embarrassed, somebody gets shy.
I consider this auspicious sign .
One good thing is also happening that those who come to meet me these days, people from all the regions of the society meet.
Someone speaks on cleanliness, somebody speaks on education, somebody discusses social reforms.
Somebody is discussing that our family life is being destroyed .
I think , otherwise , if such a businessman comes first , he will talk to the government about his own interests .
But I see a big change .
They talk less about their selfishness, talk about taking some responsibility related to society.
When I see these things by adding, I am noted that we are moving forward towards one very good change.
If my poor family is not sick , there will never be any economic crisis in his life .
If he remains healthy then he will work hard, earn and run the family.
And therefore my hygiene is directly related to the health of my poor brothers and sisters .
Whether we are able to serve the poor or not, we do not filthy, it is also beneficial for the poor.
I have also seen that those who are working in this field are sending me the stories of their success .
But I came to know about two things from my government .
After my saying that the officers of the H . . . Ministry they felt that we should do something too .
And the officers together made a plan .
See , the example of how changes start in the government .
One thing he decided that if he wants to go to technical education then he has planned to give him special scholarship by favouring such a one thousand good specialty-abled child .
I congratulate all the officials of the department for their thoughts .
I had the opportunity to go to Siachen in the past .
I spent in the midst of the dead soldiers for the country of Diwali .
When the country was celebrating Diwali, I went to Siachen.
Because due to them we are able to celebrate Diwali, I went among them.
I have experienced how many difficulties they live in life.
I salute the soldiers who protect the country .
But today I have to say another pride .
The youth of our country work in the field of security .
At the time of natural calamity , no one is ready to dare to protect us by putting a baggage of life .
I specially congratulate these soldiers .
I had just got an opportunity from the winners of our country, young students, young women and sportspersons.
I got a new energy .
His zeal, zeal, I was seeing that our systems and facilities are very low compared to other countries, but instead of complaining, they were talking about doing something more with zeal and enthusiasm.
For myself, the tea and drink programme for these players was very inspiring.
On one side, I want to tell the countrymen, and I really want to say with my mind and it's my mind.
And I am confident that the countrymen have faith in my words and my intentions.
But once again I want to repeat it from my side .
As far as black money is concerned, Black Money is concerned, my countrymen, trust your principal servant, this is the Artificial of Feth for me.
The money that has gone out of the poor of India should come back to Pi-Pi.
There can be differences about what is the path, what is the system.
And it is natural in democracy , but on the basis of the knowledge I have , my countrymen , I assure you that we are on the right path .
Today, no one knows, no one knows, no government knows, no one knows, nor did the previous government know how much money was out.
Everyone keeps describing different data in their own way.
I do not want to complicate with those figures, my commitment is that there are two rupees, five rupees, millions, billions and billions of people. This is the money of the poor of the country and should come back.
And I assure you that there will be no dearth in my efforts .
There will be no fault .
Just make me bless you.
Whatever I have to do for you, whenever I have to do, I will definitely do it.
I assure you this .
I have received a letter .
Shriman Abhishek has come from Parikh .
However, this kind of feeling was revealed by many mothers and sisters even when I was not the Prime Minister.
He has told me that you must discuss this matter about your mind .
I agree with his pain .
When I talk about the next mind, I will definitely discuss this drug addiction, this drug mafia and that is why the youth of India can face a huge crisis, the next time I will discuss it.
If you have some experiences in this regard, you have some information, if you have saved the habit of addiction, if you have some ways to save yourself, if you have played a good role, if you give me some such information then I will talk about these good efforts in front of the countrymen and all of us will create an environment in every family that no child should go on this path due to frustration, we will definitely discuss it in detail.
I know that I am handling the topics in which the government first comes to the courtroom .
But how long will we keep things hidden
I am also daring to dare . Because of your love .
Because of your blessings and I will continue to do .
Some people have also told me that Modi ji, you were saying that give us suggestions, give it on face book, give it on Twitter, send e-mail.
But there is a large section of the country, who do not have this or what they do.
Your point is right .
This facility is not with everyone .
So I tell you that if you want to say something about my mind, then you listen to me on the village-village radio, then you will also send a letter to me, you will definitely reach me.
And I will definitely take it seriously because the active citizen is the largest capital of development.
You write a letter, that means you are very active.
To talk of my mind, your mind should also be added.
Maybe you must write a letter .
I'll try, then next month to talk to you.
My efforts will be made whenever I talk, I will do it on Sunday, I will do it at 11 o'clock in the day.
So I ' m enhancing the facility to reach you .
Gradually the beginning of cold is happening .
There is a very good weather for health .
But along with this there is also a very good weather for health .
Don ' t let it go .
Use it a lot .
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Vijayadashmi.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Vijay Dashmi.
I will try, if possible, talk to you twice a month or once a month.
Further, I have also thought in my mind that whenever I talk, it will be Sunday and the time will be at 11 o'clock in the morning, you will also be convenient and I will also be satisfied that I have succeeded in delivering my mind to your mind.
Today, the festival of Vijayadashmi is a festival of victory of goodwill on the evils.
But a gentleman of Ganesh Venkatadari Mumbai, he sent a mail to me, he said that in Vijayadashmi, we resolve to eliminate ten evils within us.
I express my gratitude to him for his suggestion.
Everyone must think that by defeating the worst evils within himself, I feel that as a nation, let us resolve to liberate all of us on the sacred festival of Vijayadashmi and finish the dirt and we can resolve this on the festival of Vijayadashmi.
I had said one thing yesterday in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that I will invite nine people and they will upload their video in social media while cleaning themselves.
When we talk about Mahatma Gandhi, the matter of khadi comes in very natural meditation.
You know that our own scientists have successfully used Mars to reach Mars at a minimum cost, successfully.
There is no shortage of strength, just we have forgotten our power.
Have forgotten yourself.
I remember Swami Vivekanandaji who used to say one thing, Swami Vivekananda often used to say one thing.
Once, the child who had gone with the lion had grown up now.
He said what you're doing.
You're a lion.
They have made me bigger.
Look at my voice, see my way of conversation.
So the lion said that let's show me who you are.
He took him to a well and showed his face inside the water in the well and told him with his face-to-face, look, the face of both of us is one.
I am a lion, you are also a lion and as soon as the self-confidence awakened from within him, he also started crying like that lion, a lion among the sheep.
The existence inside him was awake.
Swami Vivekanand ji used to say this.
My countrymen, there is immense power and immense power within 1.
We need to recognize ourselves.
We need to recognise the strength within us and then we will be victorious and our nation will be victorious and successful by taking that self-respect and recognition as Swami Vivekanandji had said.
I spent two hours with them, perhaps it was a very emotional, very inspiring event of my life.
God has probably liked that family, but that child is the responsibility of the entire nation.
Later, I had so much emotional touch that I used to do different Olympics for Special Abeld Children in Gujarat.
Thousands of children used to come, their parents used to come and I used to go to myself.
And that is why I felt good for Gautam Pal's suggestions that he had given, and I thought that I should share this suggestion that I had received.
A story I get even more attention.
If you knew why did you not tell.
My countrymen, unless we resolve to walk, we do not stand ourselves, then those who show the path will not be found.
We will not be able to catch the finger.
We will have to start walking and I am convinced that hundreds of millions of people are capable of walking and will continue to walk.
People send big interesting suggestions to me for a few days.
Some people have said that when they start small industries, the process of registration should be easier.
I will definitely inform the government for him.
Some people have written to me and sent children to teach skill development from grade fifth.
Someone has written to me that every hundred meters should have a dust bean, to arrange cleaning.
Some people have written to me and sent that the polythene pack should be banned.
Many suggestions are sending me.
I would like to say to you from now on, if you will send me a truth incident somewhere, which is positive, which will inspire me, inspire me to the countrymen, if such truth happens to me with evidence then I will definitely talk about my mind, I will definitely reach the countrymen.
Come, let us all together serve our mother India.
We should take the country to new heights.
As it comes to mind, I will definitely keep talking to you in the future.
I have told you the things that came in my mind today.
Then when I will meet, I will meet on Sunday, I will meet at 11 o'clock in the morning but I am confident that our journey will continue, your love will continue.
After listening to me, if you want to say something to me, definitely get me, I will like it.
I felt very good to talk to you all today and radio is such a simple medium that I will be able to reach far and wide.
I will reach the poorest of the poor household because my country's strength is in the hut of the poor, the strength of my country is in the village and the strength of my country is in the mothers, sisters and youngsters, my country's strength is in the farmers.
With your trust, the country will move forward.
I express confidence.
I believe in your power, so I believe in the future of India.
The mind is filled today while starting the matter of mind
10 days ago, India-Mata lost their brave sons
These brave heroes have contributed to protecting 1. 25 billion Indians.
The countrymen could sleep peacefully, so these brave sons had kept one by night and day.
In the terror attack of Pulwama, after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, people from all over the country, and in the minds of the people, there is shock and resentment.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families have risen all around
I bow down to all the brave sons of the country who have sacrificed their lives in protecting the Mother India.
This challenge faced by the country, we all have to forget about casteism, communalism, regionalism and all other differences so that our steps against terror are stronger than ever before, stronger and decisive.
Our Armed Forces are always introducing unique courage and valour .
In order to establish peace , where they have shown a wonderful ability , the same attackers have also worked to give answers in their own language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack
Army has resolved to destroy terrorists and their helpers
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational things of his family through the media have further emphasized the courage of the entire country.
Ramniranjan ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, the zeal that has been introduced in this hour of grief inspires us all.
He said , " They will send their other sons to fight enemies , and if needed , they will go to fight . "
The whole country is saluting the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of Shaheed Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur of Odisha
He has also taken a pledge to join his only son .
When the body of the martyr Vijay Shoren wrapped in the tricolor reached Gumla of Jharkhand, the innocent son said that I will also go to the army
The responsibility of this innocent expresses the feeling of children and children of India today
Such feelings are being seen in the house of our brave, mighty martyrs.
One of our brave martyrs is not exception in it, their family is not exceptional
Whether it is the family of the martyr Vijay Maurya of Deoria, the parents of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six-year-old son of Shaheed Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of the martyrs is full of inspiration.
I would urge the younger generation to know and understand the spirit that these families have shown.
What happens to patriotism, what happens to sacrifice, we will not need to go towards the old events of history.
In front of our eyes, these are living examples and these are the reasons for the inspiration for the future of India.
My dear countrymen, for such a long time of independence, the war memorial that was waiting for us all is going to end now.
The curiosity of the countrymen about this is very natural.
Udupi on Narendra Modi App, Shri Omkar Shetty of Karnataka has expressed his happiness at the preparation of the National War Memorial.
I was also surprised and painful that there was no national war memorial in India.
A memorial where the bravery of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives to protect the nation can be preserved.
I decided that there should be a memorial in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been built in such a short time.
Tomorrow, that is, on February 25, we will hand over this national military memorial to our army.
The country will make a small effort to repay its debt
The heart of Delhi is that place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are present, just near it, a new monument has been built.
I am confident that going to the National Military Memorial for the countrymen will be like going to a pilgrimage site.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the nation to the soldiers who sacrificed the highest sacrifice after independence .
The design of the monument shows the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The concept of the National Military Memorial is focused on our concentrate circles i.e. four cycles where the journey from the birth of a soldier to the martyrdom is depicted.
The iron of Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the martyr soldier
The second Circle is the bravery cycle that shows the courage and bravery of the soldiers .
This is a gallery where the exploits of the bravery of the soldiers have been carved on the walls.
This Circle shows the sacrifices of the soldiers.
In this the names of the soldiers who sacrificed the highest sacrifice for the country are written in the golden letters .
After this the protector cycle displays security
This circle has a row of dense trees
These trees are symbols of soldiers and are giving a message to the citizens of the country that every moment the soldiers are deployed on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Overall, the National Military Memorial will be identified as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country, to express their gratitude, to research them.
There is a story of those sacrifices who have laid down their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and developed.
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our Armed Forces, Police and Armed Forces in the development of the country in words.
In October last year, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be grateful to those men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our security .
I hope you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
You must share your pictures taken there on social media so that others also get inspiration from it and they too are eager to see this sacred place, this memorial.
My dear countrymen, your thousands of letters and comments for Mann Ki Baat, I get to read through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your session, I came to my mind a very interesting comment of Atisha Mukhopadhyay ji .
He has written that on March 3, 1900, when the British arrested Birsa Munda, his age was only 25 years old, it is a coincidence that on March 3, Jamshedji Tata's birth anniversary is also there.
And they further write that these two personalities are completely from two different family backgrounds that have enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand
In a way of paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in mind is like bowing down the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand .
These two great personalities have not raised the name of Jharkhand but the whole country .
The whole country is grateful for their contribution .
Today, if our youth need an inspirational personality for guidance, then it is Lord Birsa Munda
The British hid and caught them very cleverly when they were sleeping .
Do you know why they resorted to such a cowardly action
Because the British who created such a large empire were also afraid of them .
Lord Birsa Munda shook the English rule equipped with guns and guns only with his traditional arrows.
In fact, when people get an inspirational leadership, then the collective will of the people on the power of arms is huge.
Lord Birsa Munda fought with the British not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals .
In his little life he did all this .
Life filled with darkness of the deprived and the exploited shining like the sun
Lord Birsa Munda gave his sacrifice at the young age of 25 years .
Birsa Munda is the son of Mother India, in every part of the country.
Perhaps any corner of India would be such that no one has contributed to this war of freedom that lasted for centuries.
But unfortunately, the stories of their sacrifice, valour and sacrifice have not reached the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda has convinced us of his existence, then a person like Jamshedji Tata gave the country a big institution.
Jamshedji Tata was a truly visionary, who not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation.
They knew well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry is necessary for the future.
Not only that, he also established several world-class institutions like Tata Steel and other industries.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai was born on 29th February.
As you all know that this day comes only once in 4 years
The wealthy, peaceful personality, Morarji Bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Record to present the highest budget in Parliament in independent India is the name of Morarji Bhai Desai
Morarji Desai led India in that difficult time when the country's democratic fabric was in danger.
Morarji Bhai Desai shook himself in the movement against the Emergency to protect democracy
For this, he had to pay a huge price even in old age .
At that time the government arrested him and put him in jail
But when the Janata Party won elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country
During his tenure only 44th Constitution Amendment was brought
This is important because the 42nd Amendment brought about during Emergency, which had been brought back to reduce the powers of the Supreme Court and other provisions that used to abusive our democratic values.
Like 44th Amendment, a provision for publication of proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies was made in newspapers
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored in this amendment, it was also made provision that the original officers found under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution can not be violated even during the Emergency.
For the first time, it was arranged that on the written recommendation of the Cabinet, the President will announce the Emergency and it was also decided that the period of emergency cannot be extended once more than six months .
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the way democracy was killed in 1975 by implementing the Emergency could not be repeated again in the future.
The future generations will always remember their invaluable contribution in maintaining the greatness of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my tribute to such a great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, this time also there was a lot of curiosity among the people about the Padma Awards.
Today we are moving towards a New India, we want to respect those people who are doing their work on the grass-root level with efficiency.
They are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways by their labour force
In fact, he is a true karmayogi who is selflessly engaged in public service, social service and national service.
You must have seen when the Padma Award is announced , people ask who it is
In a way, I consider it a great success because these are people who are not on the front page of T.
They are away from the world of glare, but these are people who do not care about their name, just believe in working at the grassroots level.
Yoga : He lives in a way the message of Karmasu Kaushalam Gita
I want to tell you about such a few people
You must have heard about the Daitari Nayak of Odisha, he is not called Janal Man of the Disha. Daitari Nayak cut the mountains in his village and made a canal path for three kilometers. With his hard work, the problem of irrigation and water has ended forever.
Take Abdul Gafur Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job to revive the traditional disease paintings of Kutch.
They are doing a big job to bring this rare painting to a new generation .
I gave a gift to former US President Barack Obama to the artwork made by Abdul Gafur
Among those who receive Padma awards are known as Shabbir Syed Gau - Mata of Marathwada .
The way he spent his entire life in the service of Gomata is unique in itself .
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who first tried to empower the victims and the exploited through the Calengium movement in Tamil Nadu and started the community based small financial system.
Even at the age of 100, he is training yoga to people around the world and has so far made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers
Jamuna Tudu, known as Lady Taran in Jharkhand, worked boldly to take iron from Timber Mafia and Naxalites. He not only saved 50 hectares of forests but also united ten thousand women and inspired to protect trees and wildlife
It is the power of Jamuna ji's hard work that today every child of the village plants 10 trees on the marriage of 18 trees and girl at the birth of every child.
The story of the Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagali of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration, even though he himself is disabled, it is difficult to get an example of the work he did for the upliftment of Divyang women, it is difficult to find an example that by establishing an institution named Chakshu Women's Sevakunj, he is engaged in the renowned work of making blind children self-reliant.
Farmer aunt of Muzaffarpur in Bihar i.e. the story of Rajkumari Devi is very inspiring.
They have presented an example in making women empowerment and farming beneficial.
Farmer aunt connects 300 women in their area with Self Help Group and motivates them to make economically self-reliant
He trained the women of the village as well as other means of employment. The special thing is that they worked to connect technology with agriculture and my countrymen, perhaps for the first time that 12 farmers have got Padma awards in the Padma awards given this year.
Normally very few people associated with the agricultural world and very few people who do direct farmers have come to the list of Padmashree .
This is a life-style picture of changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk to you about a heart touching experience that I have been feeling for the past few days.
Nowadays, wherever I am going to the country, I am trying to meet some beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat scheme PM-JAY i. e.
He was treated by this scheme and he became the head of a healthy house, hard work and was a victim of his family career, he was unable to work. This scheme benefited him and he became healthy and started living a new life.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about twelve lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme.
I found how big change is coming in the lives of the poor .
If you all know any poor person who is unable to treat him in the absence of money , then tell him about this scheme .
Different Education Boards across the country will initiate the process for testing of boards of Class II in next few weeks
My best wishes to all the students, their parents and all the teachers on behalf of me.
A few days ago, a very big event of exam-pay discussion in Delhi was held in the work of Town All.
One of the special features of the discussion on the examination was that there were open discussions on various subjects related to the examination .
There have been many aspects that can definitely be beneficial for students .
All the students, their teachers, parents can see the recording of this entire programme on YouTube. Greetings to all the team workers for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, it is not possible to talk about India and not to talk about the festival
There is hardly any day in our country that there is no significance of which there is no festival
because we have this legacy of thousands of years old culture
After a few days the festival of Mahashivaratri is going to come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday then a special significance of it is spread in our mind and temple .
Many of them were discussed and their confidence was really affecting - inspiring .
During the interaction, when I was talking to one of them, he said, I am a stakeholder then I am mimicry in entertainment programmes, then I asked him whom you mimicry
So he told me that I mimicry to the Prime Minister
So I told them to look very comfortable for me and I was very surprising, so they did the entire micry of the way I talk about.
I felt very good to hear that people not only listen to mind but also remember it on many occasions.
I was really very impressed by the power of that Divya young man .
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to join you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Through radio I ' m in a way going through millions of families every month .
Many times talking to you all, reading your letters or listening to the ideas sent on your phone, I feel like you have considered me a part of your family.
It has been a very pleasant experience for me .
Friends, Election is the biggest festival of democracy.
The next two months, we will all be busy in the glory of the elections.
I myself will be a candidate in this election
Respecting the healthy democratic tradition, the next mind will be on the last Sunday of May
That is, in the month of March, the month of April and the month of May, all of our feelings of these three months, I will start with the strength of your blessings with the strength of your blessings with a new belief after the election and I will continue to talk to you for years.
Once again I thank you very much from my heart.
Shri Shri Shivkumar Swami ji, Dr. Siddhganga Math of Tumkur district in Karnataka was not among us.
Shivkumar Swami ji dedicated his entire life to social service
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us Kayakve Kailas i . e . while doing hard work is like being in the residence of Lord Shiva, Kailash Dham .
His fame was a scholar who had a wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer
He put his entire life in the matter that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge
It was a priority in the lives of Swami ji that the farmers should have well-being in every way.
Siddhaganga monastery regularly organised animals and agricultural fairs .
I have got the privilege of getting the blessings of the supreme goddess Swami ji many times .
In 2007, our former President, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, visited Tumkur on the occasion of the Centenary Celebrations of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swami ji.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for worshipped Swamiji on this occasion .
This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shivkumar Swami Ji and the mission of Siddhganga Math in a beautiful way.
Once again, I offer my respect to such a great man.
On January 25, the Election Commission was the Foundation Day, which is celebrated as National Voters Day, National Footers Day
The people of the world are surprised to see the scale on which elections are held in India and it is natural for every countrymen to be proud of the Election Commission by looking at the best of our Election Commission organises it.
There is no stone unturned in ensuring that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, gets an opportunity to vote.
It is very natural to be proud of the Election Commission when they hear these things
Keeping in mind that voter, that voter gets an opportunity to use his franchise, for this, the entire team of EC employees goes far and wide and arranges for voting - and that is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for continuously striving to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the polling process and ensure independent and fair elections.
This year, the Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country, this will be the first time where the youth born in the 21st century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have got the opportunity to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders .
Now they are going to become part of the decision process in the country
The time has come to connect the dreams of God with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register God if they are eligible to vote.
It is my duty to vote together - this feeling should grow within us.
For any reason in life, if not able to vote, there should be great pain.
Sometimes there is something wrong in the country , it should be sad .
I urge the well-known celebrities of the country to make people aware about the fact that we all should vote together or vote on the day of polling.
I hope that a large number of youth will be registered as voters and will further strengthen our democracy with their participation.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some wonderful, unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is multinational
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different style.
On the birth anniversary of Netaji, I got the opportunity to inaugurate a Museum Museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to Indias freedom struggle.
You know that many rooms, buildings have been closed since independence inside the Red Fort.
The rooms of those closed Red Fort have been converted into very beautiful museums, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and III.
Museum dedicated to Indian National Army
In one brick of these museums, the fragrance of our glorious history is settled.
The stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle on the traps of the museum inspire us to go inside history.
At the same place, the British Government prosecuted the brave sons of Bharat Maa Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillo and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was visiting the memories related to Netaji in the Red Fort, at the Kranti Temple, then I met a very special cap and cap of Netaji's family members.
Sometimes Netaji used to wear the same cap
I kept the cap in the museum, so that the people coming there should also see the cap and inspire them to patriotism.
In fact , the bravery and patriotism of their heroes needs to be repeated to a new generation .
Just a month ago on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands
In a program, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place, where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there is a tradition on 15th August.
This was the opportunity to complete 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and efficient organizationer
A brave soldier who played an important role in the fight for freedom
Let's go to Delhi, you give me blood, I will give you freedom, like Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian with joyous slogans.
For many years, it has been demanding that files related to Netaji be made public and I am happy that we can do this work.
I remember the day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
We together talked about Netaji and paid tribute to Netaji Subhash Bose.
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop many places associated with the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road connected to Baba Saheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or the Kranti Mandir
If you come to Delhi you must visit these places .
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too I want to share a story related to Netaji's life with you.
I have always considered radio as an important medium to connect with people, in the same way Netaji also had a deep relationship with the radio and he also chose radio to communicate with the countrymen.
I was told that these radio stations, weekly news bulletins were also broadcast in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pasto and Urdu languages.
The programmes to be broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the general public and their programmes also strengthened our freedom fighters.
A visual art museum has also been built in this Kranti temple .
This is an attempt to tell Indian art and culture in a very attractive way .
There are 4 historical features in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and art works of three centuries old .
Excellent works of great artists such as Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avninder Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy, Sailoz Mukherjee have been performed in the museum.
And I would especially urge you to visit there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji .
Now you must have been thinking that this thing is happening here and I am talking to you about the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore .
You have to go to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician so far
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter .
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to most of his works
He believed that the painting seeer himself understands that painting, knows the message given by him in painting from his perspective.
Their paintings have been displayed in European countries , Russia and in the United States too .
I hope you will visit his paintings in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have given the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and works.
There was such a saint - Sant Ravidas
Ravidas Jayanti on February 19
The two of Sant Ravidas ji is very famous .
Sant Ravidas ji gave a big message through a few lines .
He had said that there is a caste in the caste, which can not be connected to Ketan's feet, Raidas human beings, unless the caste is dispersed of the banana stem, the leaves below the leaves then the leaves below the leaves and finally nothing comes out, but the entire tree ends, in the same way humans have also been divided into castes and humans have not been there.
They used to say that if God is indeed in every human being, then it is not appropriate to share them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour in his entire lifetime through his messages
It will not be wrong if it is said that they have explained the real meaning of the reputation of labour to the world .
He used to say that if you want to mind then in Kathauti Ganga meaning if your mind and heart are sacred then God lives in your heart .
The messages of Sant Ravidas ji have affected the people of every section, whether the Maharaja of Chittor or the queen of Chittor or the Meerabai were all his followers.
I once again bow down to Sant Ravidas ji
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov to highlight the aspects of Indias space programme and its future.
He also wants me to urge the students to take interest in space programmes and to think out of the sky and to think out of the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate your ideas and the message given to our children in particular.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad where I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud of the fact that today the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students are reaching the space.
The Kalam set was launched by our students on 24th January.
Sounding Rockets created by university students in Odisha have also made many records.
Since the independence of the country till 2014, the space mission has been started in the last four years.
We have also created a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft.
We will soon register the presence of India on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign.
Our country is also using space technology in protecting lifestyle.
Whether it is cyclone, or rail and road safety, all these are getting a lot of help from space technology.
NAI devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which are helpful in their safety as well as economic progress.
We are using space technology to further improve the delivery and accountability of government services
Housing for All i. e.
Along with this, about three and a half million properties were also geo-tagged under MNREGA.
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country
It has a great contribution to our better relations with many countries of the world .
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative that has gifted development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through its extremely competitive launch services, India today launches satellites not only of developing countries but also of developed countries.
The heavens and stars for children are always very attractive .
Our space programme gives children an opportunity to think bigly and move ahead of the boundaries which were so far considered impossible.
This is a vision of watching stars for our children as well as inspiring to find new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that those who played the games have come to the forefront of the Tarun and Youth players in Khelo India this time.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January
When the local ecosystem of our sports will be strengthened, that is, when our base is strengthened, our youth will be able to showcase the best of their capabilities across the world.
This time in Khelo India, the players of every state have performed well at their own level.
The life of many medal winners is very inspiring .
They live in a parking shed with their family
At the same time, the captain of Maharashtra's Under-21 Women's Kabddi team is from Sonali Helvi Satara.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother promoted the skill of Sonali
It is often seen that daughters do not get so much promotion in games like Kabdadi .
Despite this, Sonali chose Kabddi and performed excellently
Asansol's 10-year-old Abhinav Shaw, Khelo India Youth Games is the youngest gold medal winner
A farmer's daughter Akshata Baswani Kamati wins gold medal in weightlitting
He credited his victory to his father, his father is a farmer in Belgaum.
When we are talking about the creation of India then it is the New India of the resolve of youth power
These stories of Khelo India are showing that the people of big cities are not only contributing to the creation of New India but also the youth from small towns, villages, towns, youth, youth sporting talents.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many prestigious beauty contests.
