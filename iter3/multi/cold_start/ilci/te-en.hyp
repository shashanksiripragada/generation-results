Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yeah , others .
On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is a mixture of both in languages as well .
It is called ' kachchi ' .
Although there is ' speaking language ' here , it has not been written on its own .
If you want to write kachhi then you have to write in Gujarati script only .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes came and the whole city was destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisal-Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisal - Toral is very charming .
If we returned back on that road by which we came then we had to take holidays again a month ago and there schools were opened in Mumbai .
But what did we do  Now we made a journey on trains by telling to the fast buses of Gujarat .
Small train going to Meteruge from Bhuj reaches Rajkot .
From there another small train of Meteru Gage reaches Ahmadabad and from Ahmadabad the big train of Broad Gates reaches Mumbai .
Considering the main basis of the economy of Rajasthan the tourism system is going on in a very desolate situation these days .
Due to the dangers of increasing terror in Vishwik Mandi and South Asia the tourism system has become very deep .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has become very less in these days .
In the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to the figures the number of tourists of the country has decreased by 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists has decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
A total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in 2008 in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countrymen and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists participated in the year 2009 , only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this there are two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 national and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists .
People associated with the tourist spot are very worried about this situation .
The founder of Rajputna Holiday Makers Sanjay Kaushik said that the tourism system was completely affected by the incident of Vishwik Mandi and radicals .
In comparison to the other country of Asia we have not even developed the tourism system strong , based on it .
Because of this the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the French tourists are maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism the present year Rajasthan has spent very well .
After 2002 AD this first thing is to reduce the number of tourists of Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism nothing new is happening .
Desert , buildings , forts , ponds , forests all are also old to enjoy the tourists .
In the tourism sector the words of working with the name of village tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism are said to be very important but nothing has been done in this direction .
Facilities of tourists coming to Rajasthan are also very less .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan the incidents of violence and violence in the present year have also taken the beauty of this state to the international level .
The government of Rajasthan has given the status of industry for tourism in Rajasthan a few years ago but it has become limited to papers only .
One example of the victory of Rajasthan government in tourism is the Tourism Development Corporation of Rajasthan .
The Rajasthan government established RTDC in 1979 AD with the aim of increasing the number of tourists in Rajasthan and developing them based on tourism .
This branch provides facilities like residence , food , traffic , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 branches in this institute .
In this 39 hotels , 22 motorals , eight territories , three journeys , one unit journey and two train palaces on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan Wheels but this institute has also been behind several years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakhs and it is estimated that in 2009 - 10 it would increase to 632 lakhs .
The situation of hotels of this institute is such that in the last five years even forty percent rooms were not filled in these hotels .
Along with hotels the other branches of the organization also cause a lot of harm to it .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Whales .
Tourists are unable to attract this train .
Despite the decreasing rent it could not attract tourists .
Like this at present during the Pushkar fair also the favour of the tourists has been seen less .
In the year 2007 - 08 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by the RTDC door , this year this number was reduced to 217 only .
In the midst of all these there is no dearth in attracting tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . city train .
This train is continuously benefiting .
Last year RTDC has benefitted nine and a half crore rupees through this train .
Due to this deficiency occurring in the tourist area of Rajasthan it has become natural to see the destruction of the tourism sector .
Tourism is the most dependent of the economy of Rajasthan .
If man wants to do something in his mind then he can make gold from soil .
Subrat Rai showed it the truth by making a modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahyadri mountain peak of Maharashtra .
The dream he had seen that he was developing everyday and seeing that he looks joyful shine in his eyes .
This joy of him was also seen during the beginning of Ambe Valley Niji Airport .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been successful in making its place a good city .
In this city spread over more than 10 thousand crores only in 9 percent area hotels , houses and other facilities have been provided .
In 91 percent area plants , ponds , waterfalls , poundines and other facilities have been made .
Several industrialists have come forward to make their houses in this city built only for Koteshwar and today there are about 800 families in this city .
Initially industrialists and rich have bought here as their rest houses in the form of Hollyday Home but today they have made their own first house and from here they keep on coming to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambe Valley is the fort of Korigarh , this place is very beautiful .
The ruins of Leekawali in West Siang district are very important .
The ruins of a large temple were found in the excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple the idols of Tamar and gods and goddesses were found in excavations which are mostly in ruins .

In this place a idol of ten hands of Durga Mata got .
Behind the name of this idol and place there are many sweet stories and ancient stories of the locals here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the glorious stories of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in this ruin is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the mention of the glory of Tamreshwari Devi is found .
During the period of Chetia kings in the north - eastern hills this god is believed to be the people of remote areas .
The jungles here used to worship Goddess .
Here people also sacrificed , after which King Gaurinath Singh was deprived .
Some other ruins were found in Lohit district of Arunachal .
It is said to be the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar in the middle of Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the stories present here this place is an ancient Vidarbha , where at one time King Bhishmak ruled .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower land of Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Deegar , Mishmi etc . are the guides of the tourists here .
These people themselves also have a lot of faith in this homkund .
Near Brahmakund itself is the main Parashuram Homkund .
On the day of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the ruins mentioned above the description of the pilgrimages of Arunachal Pradesh the ruins of roaming in Diwang - Valley district are also very historical .
The ruins of monkeys made of bricks near Roing are still telling its story .
The ruins of bathing , soil strips and other ponds on its all four sides with soil walls and the ruins of roads on the width are still silently engraving its ancient grand stories .
We reach ero at four o'clock through jeep from Shaharnart Lakhimpur situated above .
This place is the headquarters of Lover Subasiri district .
Located at a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place attracts everyone 's heart .
This is the same charming place where there is an extremely important situation .
It took several days to reach here before the roadways to go to Jeep .
On reaching here the views of tall cedar trees , beautiful primrose , vollet , wild contrary , strawberries and rosemberries enjoy the visitors .
Apple and aluch are very good here .
Located at a height of approximately 1524 metres a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the people situated in the desert state .
They have made it their heaven .
The crops of cereals are very good here .
This place is ' rice treasure ' .
This ten miles long plain is a testimony example of their hard work and agricultural expertise .
Their farming is sufficient from Kali river .
The beauty of this valley by pain is engraving the moonlight .
Located towards the left hand the sight falls on the red color of the leopard coming in the sky on the skies in the middle of the snowy mountain peak .
There is a lot of cold in the air .
Along with shivering cold in the environment one feels moisture as well .
One sound that comes on putting feet is seen on the layer of wood .
The weather is quiet and it is not visible very well because of being depressed before sunrise .
The sight remains on the red color situated in the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bunch situated in Balkani .
The thin layers spread as soon as the hand falls swallows with light sound and the hand gets separated immediately by the cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , coming to this small village in the middle of these mountains covered with snow , this is the first experience of spending the night in life .
This is the third snake for me in Swiss .
Before this spend a long time in Janiwa or around it .
Located on both sides of the valleys of the thin Balkhati river most of the people are spread till a great height of light stones .
This is the main river of Switzerland Ron Valley on both sides of which there are many small cities .
Contrary to the Ron river the national highway and the vehicles going on it are clearly visible .
On crossing the journey of 300 kms away and two and a half hours in the car the Janiwa waterfall , along with the waterfalls of the Janiwa waterfall and half the Ron river , near the city of Montro coming from the east , Jeniva waterfall which is called Lake Lema in French .
This 100 kms long and 10 kms wide waterfall is the city of Geneva in the west .
From there the waterfall turned into a river and flows towards the west .
On the right side the waterfalls flowing shine , touching the sky are the peaks of the Alps mountain .
Crossing a beautiful small town of Luke we left this highway on the left side , on the north side the mountain way .
On the third day the sun is giving sun to all the corners due to the southern face of the hilly plains .
In comparison to the valleys the peace of snow can not be considered less here .
The way the snow goes towards a height , the snow grows deep .
While on both sides of the road there is no cold in the air because of the environment peaceful and bright sun .
We reached a small village named Thel by deciding the journey of approximately 20 k . . on this narrow mountainous road .
There are large storeyed palaces made of wood with roofs of rocks and slopes .
In this three storied building the foundation stone made of cement concrete is also part of controlling the necessary facilities like electricity , water , laundry .
Valai is famous for grapes in Switzerland .
This is the main center of wine alcohol .
Grapes are grown in 37  of the total area of Kental .
The grapes gardens of the villages situated on both the sides of the Rone valley give importance to the unique beauty there .
It is a part of the tourism department here to go on foot in the vinegar garden , to roam them , to make them rest at night in the villages there and to show the taste of alcohol by taking them to the salvation industry .
In a small business named Age there is a very big museum of wine juice in a clock built in the 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to get artificial booking done .
Once again we go through that jungle frozen with dawn .
The mind of the questions asked by the children crossing up to three - four k . . has become even more unhappy .
Suddenly there is a dramatic and charming change in the scene of a sight .
Right straight , on the left side of the road a crowd of beautiful houses is established in the plains of very dense valleys .
People are skiing in snow in the plains of synonym from the edge of the village .
The dense forest of the goddesses is spread till the Kond peak on skiing slope .
There is dense snow on all four sides .
The rays of the sun are shining on the houses of the houses .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also the same peace is spread .
From the mountain peaks to the valleys all around it is the bright snow empire .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round wheel situated in the middle of that business .
The name of business is Lukarbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Lukarbad is approximately 1500 hundred .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and healthy people coming here can be estimated from this point where there are 1700 apartments with the facility of 6900 beds and 1500 style 28 hotels , Tambu camping site , 90 bed health center 50 restaurants .
65 waterfalls of hot water have been discovered till now in Lukarbad .

After reaching the village one feels completely hot .
In the rising sunrise the snow on the roof of the house shines .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the ' national heritage protected ' in Switzerland .
It has been said in Darjeeling that Sikkim only goes to Sikkim 's taxis so that there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the place is another , but the mountain is the same , the trees and trees , the wind shouting .
It trembles the whole body .
This is the light of blue blue brightness in the rainy season .
As soon as the plan of Darjeeling journey was decided , the decision to take the camps of Karsiang was taken first .
Karsiang is a small city in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens is full of dust forests .
Good tea is famous for production .
On going towards Darjeeling from Siliguri the tea gardens start exploring smiles and welcome the people coming towards themselves .
From the middle of tea gardens going on the road attracts the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains full of jungles , on the other side dense slopes .
Once the jungle was seen tea gardens once .
There was a green empire all around .
Once I can see this natural jungle of Kangru Padda or see the tea garden roasted by humans .
Both were attracting towards themselves .
The beauty of the tea gardens is that much beautiful .
On going to the roads on the roads the creation looks marvellous .
We were passing through the narrow narrows going to Pamula and passing through the way .
Time is also spending .
The gardens of wild and tea are not over .
Sometimes small towns were seen .
Houses - buildings etc . were seen very well on a hill from a distance .
This is Karsiang .
After stopping here we made a plan to roam around a day .
That is why we took a vehicle and left for Karsiang .
First of all is Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles .
To reach the deer park one has to leave the vehicle very below .
The beauty of Karsiang is spread till the top even today the tourist spot has not been developed .
Although the city is very well and very peaceful .
While the road was constructed , to reach the deer park filled with jungles the joy of climbing the road between charming and dusty trees was giving us courage .
The other place is Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suside Point .
It is said that during the British time lovers used to take their lives from here .
Although there is a park and restaurant here .
There is a pillar of Siddhinuma which is seen from the height a beautiful view of estimating the entire city .
In the tea gardens nearby women are tied up on their backs and playing hands very fast .
There is a museum outside Kasiang city , but that day we could not go there because it was very important to roam the beautiful environment of tea garden .
The next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in us , but it was very difficult for us to roam in the same way how can we roam
But the weather is very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed the sun .
This garden is a beautiful place with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more enjoyable than this .
The Gangamaya flowing from the top of some mountains going a little down from here was seen .
The magnificence of the waterfalls amidst the rocky rocks is sparked here .
We saw in Rock Garden the waterfalls in the empire of stones and rocks , while the waterfalls in Gangamaya are decorated with stones in the world .
Both of these places are very low in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw smoke in Darjeeling after climbing up with the help of a vehicle .
From here all the mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of Durbani .
The quantity of environment was very clean till now .
When we moved towards Monastery , the crowd of clouds did not know where they came and the clouds were blooming .
In the evening there was a plan of shopping on the Mall road .
In the journey of Darjeeling the journey of Town Train illuminates like a bright moonlight .
Tower train journey from Darjeeling to Gum and Dhum to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
There is a slight rest in boating and gardens in Mirik lake here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar through this route , where handloomed sweater etc . are found in Nepali industry .
There is also facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape is different .
Not only greenery of tea gardens here but there are sounds of forests and waterfalls .
The most famous tourist spots of Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But because of no time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
If we come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in the winter season , then the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here have drowned their faces .
My condition was a small journey very pleasant and thrilling journey .
This journey is not of foreign countries but of Rajasthan but is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a favorite thing among us in which sometimes travels towards itself , sometimes some important place , water ships or any city like a city full of rose carts or pink or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some major attraction people are brought towards themselves .
The place which I am talking about was just about four and a half years ago , but along with the construction of which this place came there he really saluted the forest .
Not only the wishes of the people going there but also for the residents there .
Our guide in my ears Rambabu replied my words , yes , before that we did not even think that we could stay like this in the jungle .
50 percent of Sibbadi is the same place .
Suddenly I felt that so many locals did not get work in the heritage hotels .
Rambab , a resident of Ajabgarh , worked in Jaipur before this and today this great royal royal royal grandeur is in the garden of Aman .
He himself made his words and deeds a new way .
The estimation of ' Aya ' is ' Amman Bagh ' .
There nobody will talk to you with English .
Aman Bagh is actually a tourist spot with peace and comfortable experiences .
That garden also has a history of itself and the most important thing is that you will also introduce you to the nearby areas there .
In the houses of the emperors of Rajasthan how many people have roamed in Bhangarh of Bhutan , why should you go away , even in the people of Jaipur , Kuchhek had spent the night at this very place
After the construction of Aman Bagh the big people of the country and abroad came there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi called me completely there but I could not go .
This thing is that she had lost her own way and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there for the invitation of our foreign kinsmen but it seemed as if those people who want to spend their holidays in less time had to go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left in those seven gardens where Alwar king used to organise camps for hunting .
Its construction was done in fifteen hundred twenty .
Its old wall is witness of those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Bagh in the shadow of trees full of mountains and smelling trees hypnotise you .
As you come in the same way welcome to you by which you will feel that you are paying attention to great peace here .
Together with the building of the head of Manikarn the aarti mantras are called alive .
We reached there in the evening and we felt putting a surrounding in that garden .
The guests were decorating the jewellery , immediately relaxed that it was very interesting for me .
All the buildings and forts are inspired .
The beauty of them is their lining .
Yes , on all the new things , artistic . There is no wonder that Amanbagh has got a gift even today .
Manezer decided our program in the morning .
First of all walking along with Rambab and then jeep journey in Bhanugarh .
While going on a small road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the sun rays were spreading gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the rails were harvesting .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw the crop of tobacco .
This glimpse of rural life is a special experience of zeki Kosam .
After that we reached Bhanugarh through jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable fruit for millions of dollars .
The method of Aman Bagh Alavinda is also genetic jaggery and curd .
Then it was understood why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also being made to show the tribe life .
What is it true .
There is no doubt and no such thing happens in many states and tourists also show more interest in it .
This tour is usually decided from four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this stopping , eating etc are also part of it .
As such an attempt is being made to explore such a place where there was not much development and there was no special effect on time in the quantity of life of nature and people .
At the same time ancient tourist sites etc are also there .
Besides this , it is also paid attention to surveying the traditional keys .
In fact , such journeys have to be shown directly to the tourist destinations and traditions of vegetation in that area .
Although it feels a little difficult to think , but such tour is really very interesting and feels a different kind of experience .
A lot of journey is enjoyable for us .
By this even if you are with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can free your favorite book for a long time .
Yes , here is so important that we have heard of spending and staying optimistic in this journey for a long time .
This is the reason that for enjoying them some things must be kept in mind , especially sometimes you are watching any foreigner 's destination through a tour .
Before taking a ticket look for a good middleman .
Students , seniors of the army , children etc . get rid of them , both of them also have the facility of stone .
As soon as the ticket is less then it is better to put a bus tour plan for the last minute that it is better to go before the plan .
Instead of tour ticket know about the entire tour rate .
This is cheap .
There are also some suggestions for the goods , hence one should also know about the quantity and weight of the goods .
If this happens anywhere then you will have to pay some of your materials in terminals or more money .
Along with this also know the information of insurance or harmful treatment in the tour company .
Carry on bags are good , take it .
Because these are fit in the rock situated on the seat .
Keep in mind this thing also that while changing the bus during the journey the responsibility of the goods will be yourself .
From wherever you go by bus reach there , one hour before time .
You should take special care of this thing at the time of rope .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will also have the opportunity to get a good seat .
While selecting seat keep an eye on your convenience also .
In the back seat there are lots of wrinkles , but there is no suitable reading in the front seat .
If you have to go to urinary bladder again and again then take the last seat and do not like much intervals then the seat on the window bed will be good for you .
Now a serious thing .
If you are in the seat of putting hands on both the sides then sit on the last seat and keep your bag on the other .
If there is no maximum number of people in the bus then planning is successful .
If the facility of washing in the bus is that while selecting the seat keep in mind this thing also because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Introduce the bus driver and conductor .
In this way you get very important information from them .
It is said that while cleaning the bus everyone has to go out .
During this time do not keep your luggage on the seat because the buses do not take responsibility for it .
If the bus stops anywhere then come back on time .
If you do not come from time to time , you can get your place to a new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus in Terminal .
It is said that if Rome is not seen in Europe then it can not be seen any more .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city in ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .
The capital of Italy Rome is one of those ancient cities of the world from where civilization has arisen .
This is the reason why its chest is seen in the synthesis .
Rome , Roman Katholic religion situated on the banks of Tiber river is a pilgrimage for the religious people because the main  Pope ' residence of this religion is also in Rome .
The ancient Rome was on seven hills .
A wall , Sarvial Wall was built around it in the fourth century .

Rome symbol is calcium .
This huge monastery was built in 80 AD and 50 thousand visitors can sit together here .
In colossium gladeater i . . swords used to show the efficiency of sword .

Pethian . This magnificent ancient temple is built in 27 AD .
In the middle of this large tomb is 30 feet empty field .
Due to this place devotees felt as if their prayers were directly reaching to the goddesses .
The idols of Goddesses are built all around in the temple .
However , in 601 AD this temple was converted into church .
Although there are many gardens in Rome but Vila Borgis is worth mentioning .
Therefore on going to Rome do not forget to see them .
Definitely go to the museum built here because if you miss them then you will get a chance to see good idol artefacts .
The idols made here are magnificent as alive as if they are talking to us now .
Here the first Napolian brother Paulin , her marriage took place in the dynasty of Borgis , a idol lying on the bed looks so alive that you can not see it for a few minutes .
The main attraction of Rome is the pounds there .
There are approximately 300 forts here in which grand pounds are built .
The most famous pound ' Trevie Point ' here .
It is believed that if anyone wants to come back to Rome then they should put a coin in this pound with this pleasure .
It is believed that by doing this this desire will definitely be fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city has not been completed till then till you can see Vetican City .
Since sixth century this place was the residence of the main religious guru ' Pope ' of Roman Katholic religion .
Although it is in Rome itself but in 1926 it has been given the status of an independent city .

Cycling River Cruise on the roads of Goa , enjoying the full joy of cold sea winds and world famous Goa is very convenient for spending the comfortable days .
On seeing in today 's situation the fare of going to Maldives is 28 thousand rupees for coming back to Delhi very cheap .
After this if you stay in the fair then even then you can get hotels a little less expensive but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the money in the pocket will be reduced .
Securez is very useful here .
Before December in the week of Kochi Luikruz Maldives and Colombo started the only cruise of India .
Louis Cruise has got many names in the business of European company and cruise hotels .
Although due to some problems Louis Cruise has now reduced its service but it is believed that they start returning from October .
In Lui Cruise ship A . . . Aquarien you can go to Maldives for about 5850 rupees per person every night for three days cruise .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
But if there are two elders then the children of 15 years are completely free .
Not only this .
Tea-typhan , food are available at the fare of cruise .
Every moment is of Kalakshakshetra along .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the time of the time available in Maldives , the works available in your pockets - from seaplane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly a seaplane comes in front of you then you will feel like a sportsperson .
But this TV of 12 - 15 seats is excellent in all the ways to roam in Archipelego like Oterplane Maldives .
It is not known when it flys in the air running like a speed boat on water .
On flying completely you will not feel the feeling of ordinary flights flying .
Every moment your sight will be seen below the window , in the blue colored water of different types of sites of Maldives the resort islands and the Koral islands are covered with smoke .
Everything looks so well .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trace Maldives is one of them , near which there are twenty sea lines .
If you want you can roam around four thousand rupees -LRB- for every person -RRB- in a single hour or you can take the rent for spending the whole day in the sea line .
Although if you go from island to another island then the journey of sea plane will be necessary because this is the way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey that you will never feel the feeling of finishing it .
The journey of Sepline from 12 km to 183 kms is done in Maldives islands .
We were in the biggest antique and sovenier shops of the capital of Ahmaddi market of Male .
One day before the President of Maldives Mahmood Nashid of Selsman Maldives he was listening very carefully to the conversation given by the President of Maldives at the World Environment Conference in Copenhagen .
In fact , I have not seen any Indian listening to the conversation of the presidents or prime ministers so much .
But when there is questions of the existence of a new creation on this earth , then it is so impossible for such seriousness .
Many people have considered it unemployed in the meeting of the water in the Maldives in October but on going to Maldives it seems that if the nature treasures take away from us then the world will get down to the unemployed situation .
There are some such significances in the beauty there .
It is believed in that small country that how much beauty is mixed .
While returning from the market tour to its cruise back towards Jetty when our eyes go towards the road then feel that the people here can understand the value of these beauty at what level .
The water is so clean that the fish swimming in the depth of several metres below the lappost light is seen with all its colors .
This is a part of the sea which is completely separated from the city .
If you can see some centimetres of water from any city of India or the water of the river completely then you will consider you to be very fortunate .
On returning to Emvi acamerine we were roaming in the jungle for two hours in the evening spent in Male .
Coral reef is the life here .
As far as possible in the stones of the tombs you will also get to see the thorns of stones .
Just a few moments before listening to President Nashid 's conversation we were standing outside the residence of his government .
It is no belief that we are in front of the highest testimony building of another country till some time nobody is able to protect .
We are taking photographs of Vasara and gardens situated at a distance of approximately fifty kilometres through the door of their building .
Can you think about any royal house in India
It was also known here that President sometimes crossing the road on foot goes to his office before two blocks .
The statue of Maldives is astonished .
That is why I was very waiting for the next day .
Goddess meaning that day some important incident will take place .
In the morning a ship from Cruise brought us to Airport Island .
From there we reached Maldives Base roaming around in the runway .
In the first evening when the cruise was reaching near Male then we immediately reminded of the sea line going up .
How many photographs have been seen .
But then it was not lost that the next day there was a chance of traveling in it .
We had to go to Rangali Island by the sea line of Trace Maldives .
Thousands of trees spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea line flying up to a height of approximately thousands of resorts and Koral islands are unforgettable .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
It is adventurous to climb up by holding the breath hard with thrilling and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Konarad resort of the Hillton Hotels in Rangali island it seemed as if we reached some other world .
In such a world , there is no relation with any country outside it .
Vasta is not like this as well where it is difficult to get out such beauty or silver .
Vihar on Konrad is also possible on foot or also with battery riding vehicles .
While going from Jetty to the main island on both the sides of the bridge the view of the lifestyle of the species of the species is unique .
Now in the nature around us we are not able to believe us naturally , we reached such a place , we could not imagine .
With the help of stairs we reached the glass room in the sea water below several metres which was inside the water .
This room is usually a dining room .
We can see all kinds of small fish , corals , snow clapping and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of sitting on the decorated chairs there was very thrilling in us .
The fare of visiting this island from Male to Siplen and to see it and to see it under water is Rs . 47 thousand for a person .
We did n't feel like returning from there .
We are also ready to throw our passports in water .
But you know , this is not so easy .
Besides this belief that whenever there is any chance then fortune will definitely be brought here .
For many days plans are being made to go out of Delhi but it is not possible to go anywhere with stress of work .
Wildlife loved childhood since childhood but why did I think that this simple Jim Corbett would not go .
In 2006 this is the second bike tour after biking till Pegog Lake situated ahead of Khardugla in Ladakh .
In the month of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the smoke which came out of the excitement showed our speed .
The journey between Hafood and Gajrola is really observed .
Smoke from above and smokeless roads in front .
Many times it seemed as if we were still lost .
As if we reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Right we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres away from Ramnagar .
Our resorts were in Dhikuli near the park , whose booking we had already done .
That day there was a special program that when we were cold we first went to roam on the coast of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we left the carbot museum , very hard at a distance of 2 k . . was near Dhangadi Gate .
From there we went to tour Ramnagar situated below .
It was the right evening to come back .
On deciding from Delhi we went out to see the lion roaming around in the jungle , I had seen the lion all night in dreams .
I suddenly heard a very big sound in the middle of a deep sleep at night and after that the dogs did not ask for two hours .
The decision of roaming Kaladungi and carbot falls had come before hesitation .
The distance of Kaladungi is thirty kilometres , only then came on the carbot fall route .
Kaladungi Jim Corbett Sahab Museum , where some important things related to real life have been kept .
The return was twelve and a half .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village .
The journey to reach the resort is waiting for us .
It was told that they had provided the facility of singing in a Saint Bijarani there .
When asked about number one then it was said that there was a lot of Grassland and Tigers come towards that side to save from cold at this time .
On reaching Bijarani we gave us a guide , who takes two hundred fifty for four hours to roam .
We left for going inside the jungle .
We saw many types of animals and deer there of various species .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , which had big teeth .
I took photographs with courage .
In the midst of this the guide Tiger started trekking .
The guide said that around 150 tigers in the park , some of them have died now .
At many places we also saw their marks , but because of not seeing the tigers I was disappointed .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain the Tiger was ruined .
That is why I remembered my old friend of Haldani .
I called him Saradake .
I told him I came to Carbot.
He asked whether he had seen the tiger or not .
These words of him are like arrows to me .
I said gradually, no.
There is no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody gave us advice that you should take inner safari .
