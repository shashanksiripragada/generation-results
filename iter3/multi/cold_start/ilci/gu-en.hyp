His language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes, it's different.
On one side of Kutch Sindhi and on the other side Gujarat is therefore a mixture of both in languages .
It is called ' Kutchi ' .
Although this is a ' speaking ' , it is not its own script .
If you want to write Kutch then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near the Bhuj itself is that Anjar city where earthquake has occurred many times and the whole city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal - Toral .
The story of Jaisal-Toral is very interesting .
If we come from the same path from the way we will have to take more holidays of one month and on this side schools will open in Mumbai .
So what to do  Now we will travel in the railways by welcoming the fast buses of Gujarat .
The small train from Bhuj to meter gauge will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and the big train of broad gauge from Ahmedabad will reach Mumbai .
Considering the main base of the economy of Rajasthan the tourism industry is passing through bad times these days .
Due to the increasing terror threats in global recession and South Asia tourism industry has been very stubborn .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country has been recorded very less in these days .
The latest data published recently by the Rajasthan government shows that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased more than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to statistics the number of national tourists has decreased by 9 . percent and the number of foreign tourists has decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
A total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in 2008 in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during the year 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 national and ten lakh 77 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included in it .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried because of this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Holiday Makers of Rajputa says that global recession and terror incidents have completely affected the tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not develop ourselves a strong base structure of tourism there .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , England , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism recent years have been better for Rajasthan .
After 2002 AD this is the first time that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has decreased .
From the point of view of tourism nothing is happening .
Desert , Havelis , Fort , Wawa forest are all old to roam the tourists .
In the tourism sector the government is talking about working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get facilities very less .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years the incidents of invasion and invasion have also made the image of this royal image luxurious at the international level .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry in the state years ago but it has remained consolidated to papers only .
One example of the success of the Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the basic structure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1987 AD .
This corporation provides facilities of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 big , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one transport unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the situation of this corporation has also worsened for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years even forty percent rooms of its hotels have not been installed .
Along with the hotels the other units of the corporation are also making it a big mistake .
Among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
This can not be the attraction of tourists towards the railway .
Despite reducing the rent these tourists can not attract .
Similarly in recent years there has been a deficiency in the interest of tourists towards the Pushkar fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in this fair in the tourist village built by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists had stayed this year this number decreased to 217 .
The satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth in the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . royal train .
This railway is continuously providing benefits .
Last year RTDC has benefitted about nine and a half crore rupees from this railway .
Due to this deficiency in the area of tourism in Rajasthan the lines of concern in the tourism sector are natural .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is a desire to do something in the heart of man then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Rai has shown it true by establishing modern city Amboveli in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .

The necessity of irrigation gets fulfilled by the Kali river .
The trees of pine increase the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the redness standing in the sky on the horizon in the middle of the snowy mountain ranges of the left hand .
There is such a cold in the air .
Along with the cold in the environment one also feels moisture .
With the sound of garbage below the feet the slopes of snow covered on the surface of wood are seen .
In the environment they are narrow and because of the blurredness of the sunrise before sunrise nothing was seen much .
Vision becomes stable on the redness of the east .
One feels to sit on the plates lying in the ankles .
On applying hands the smooth skin of the skin gets stuck with the sound of ordinary bitterness and the hands get separated from the shock from the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from his country , this is the first experience of spending nights coming in this small village in the middle of these hills buried with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third tour in Swiss .
Before this we spent a lot of time in life or around it .
On both sides of the small flowing river and the dense population settled in the valley is spread till very high on normal slopes .
This is the main river Rhone valley of Switzerland on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The parallel highway of the Ron river and the trains running on it are clearly visible .
The journey of 300 kilometres away and half an hour from the car is half the way then along with the parallel of the Geneva lake and half the Ron river coming from the eastern direction , the Jinova lake which is called Lock Large in Fench is found .
Geneva city is located 100 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide on the western part of this lake .
From there the lake goes forward towards the west after becoming a river again .
On the left side is Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps mountain ranges crossing the lake .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke from the export of the left side we leave this highway and come to the hilly path towards the north .
Because of the slope of the mountain being south - face the sun of the afternoon is giving full sunshine all the corners .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here - almost not like .
As we move towards height , denseness of snow has started increasing .
Despite the accumulation of good snow on both sides of the road there is no special cold in the air because of clean sky and shining sun .
After completing the journey of about 20 kilometres on this circular hill road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thel .
Chalet slopes are covered with roofs , totally large multi-modal bungalows made of wood .
There are rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , dhobighat along with parking of trains in Bhoyra made of cement contract of three storied bungalows .
Valai is famous for the farming of grapes in Switzerland .
This alcohol is the main center of making alcohol of grapes .
37  of the entire cantonment is cultivated on the ground .
In the villages situated on both sides of the Ron Valley gardens of grapes provide a unique area to the beauty there .
Moving till the grapes garden , taking night rest in the villages there and drinking alcohol in the liquor factory is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small village named Age there is a very big museum of wine of grapes in a fort built in the 12th century , to see which foreign tourists have to register from the front .
Once again we come out of the midst of that jungle descending from Dawanal .
Till three - four kilometres on the entire road the mind becomes very distressed by the questions occurring in the children .
On one side suddenly dramatic and charming changes come from the scene .
Right in front , a beautiful group of houses is settled on the upper slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road .
People are skiing in snow on the slopey slopes from above the village .
Above the skiing slope till the peak of the mountain dense forest of Deodar is situated .
On all four sides the snow is lying .
The roofs of the houses of the population are shining due to the direct rays of the sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Peace is spread here also .
From the top of the mountains to the valleys all around the empire of white snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round of rounds in the middle of that village .
The name of the town is Lukarbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Lukarbad is around 1500 .

On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
In the blooming heat the large surface of snow is shining above the roof of the houses .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the places conserved in the form of a national importance heritage in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that Sikkim can go only taxis of Sikkim hence tests are not done .
The journey is going on , the region is the other , but the mountain is the same , the trees are the same swimming winds .
The moisture on the whole body is that .
The blue colored splendor in the atmosphere of rains is the same .
As soon as the plan of Darjeeling journey was ripe , the first to see Karsiyang was finished .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of dust forests .
Famous for production of excellent tea .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then in the beginning only tea gardens welcome their coming towards itself .
Crossing through the road amidst tea gardens fascinates the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountain filled with forests , on the other side deep green valley .
On this side sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens are seen .
There was an empire of greenery all around .
Once I fell into unconsciousness , see these natural jungles that the tea plants planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful wilderness was , the more beautiful tea gardens spread far and wide .
On going to the roads of the roads the creation looks marvellous .
The circular and circular path of the snake was passing .
The time was also passing .
If we did not pass , then wilderness and tea gardens .
Sometimes small towns were seen .
From a distance itself a hill started to look very dense with houses etc .
This was Karsyang .
Staying here at one place we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
Therefore taking a car we got out on a tour of Karsyang .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach the deer park from above the climb i . . the train had to be left very low .
Despite being covered with the beauty of Karsyang one could not be developed and famous as a tourist spot .
Although the city is very beautiful and clean .
Despite the path being deserted the joy of climbing the road between the luxury and dust trees to reach the deer park surrounded by forests was offering courage to us .
The next place was Egal Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called suside point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to give life to the kiss from here .
Nowadays , it is contained with a park and restaurant .
There is a dome with stairs here from the height of which beautiful scenes are present by observing the whole city .
In the tea gardens nearby women were tired of breaking the tea - leaves running hands with a topy ladder on the back .
There is a museum outside the Karsyag city on that day we could not go there because it was very important to roam the free environment of this garden .
The next day the tour of Darjeeling was decided .
It was a thrilling experience among themselves , but it was a greater concern than that if the rains were falling then how would we roam around .
But the union was very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the blooming sun .
This garden , wide rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers are a beautiful place .
The way to reach here is even more charming than that .
Getting down a little more from here the Gangamaya surrounded by mountains was found .
From here amidst wide rocks the maya of waterfalls is spectacular .
In the Rock Garden we found that waterfalls are spectacular in the empire of rocks and wide rocks here then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Gangamaya is engraved with stones .
Both these places are situated very below the hills of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of a car we saw batsia loops in Darjeeling .
From here the whole hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of Durban .
The joy of the weather was clean till now .
But where we moved towards Monastery , the incident as if they were present and started shining .
In the evening arrangements were made for tour and shopping on Malrod .
Toy train increases the joy of journey in the tour of Darjeeling .
The journey of Toy Train from Darjeeling to Dhum and Dhum to Darjeeling is special attraction for tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake and some rest in the garden here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar by this route , where handmade sweaters etc . of Nepalese artisans are found .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is the only city of Darjeeling district , but its form and color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens but there is a commutation of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots in Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolegaon which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in the shadow of cold , but here the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling stopped me .
My recent journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not from foreign countries nor from outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a interesting subject in itself in which sometimes travels towards itself , sometimes be it a special place , a ship of water or any royal train or a city like a rose city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come to the forefront .
The place which I am going to do is just ready about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation this place is situated there it has actually turned into a jungle .
Not only for the people going there but also for those who stay there .
The words of my guide Ram Babu Mina in my ears , Sahiba before that we could not even think that we could stay in the jungle like this .
50 percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work even in the heritage hotel .
The resident of Ajabgarh Rambabu used to work in Jaipur first and now in this unique royal estimation Aman Bagh .
They had driven themselves to speak in a new color .
Sahiba ' is an estimate of Amman Bagh .
There nobody calls you with English address .
Aman Bagh is indeed a journey of peace and all the facilities .
This garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it makes you aware of the surrounding areas also .
Some of the people spending holidays in the royal estimation of Rajasthan would have roamed Bhangarh of Bhutan . Why away , some of the Jaipurites may have spent nights in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have gone there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi had called me there with Taluka but I could not go .
It is a different thing that he himself had reached Bhangarh after forgetting the road .
This time suddenly when I reached there on the invitation of my foreign guests I felt that those people who want to spend a glorious holiday in a short time , they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is a garden saved from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to hunt for hunting .
Its construction was done in eighty and twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
In the shadow of dense trees surrounded by mountains the first glimpse of Aman Bagh fascinates you .
As you come inside the way you are welcomed , it seems that attention has been given to the divine peace here .
Along with binding mouli in Kannada the mantra of Mangalachar is given a living uplift .
We had reached falling in the evening and we thought of killing a circle in front of that garden .
The jewellery of my guests who have been decorating , suddenly said , ' This is very interesting ' .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . It was not surprising that Aman Bagh has recently got awards .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all the journey on foot with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the sunlight was spreading gradually .
The dry lake was seen in which the farmers were farming .
This year rains did not fall but for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
For which such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable moment of million dollars .
The method of calling Aman Bagh Avajo was traditional and by feeding jaggery and curd he left us .
Now it has been understood why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard , Tour package is also kept to show tribal life .
Is this the right thing
Undoubtedly and this happens not one but in many states and the tourists also show a lot of interest in it .
This tour is usually prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
Eating etc . are also included in it .
This way an attempt is made to discover such places where there is not much development and where time has not been affected on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this there are also places worth seeing for ancient tourists .
Besides this , attention is also given to the traditional juice .
Actually , the purpose of such a tour is to make tourists feel with the way of living and traditions of that place .
Although it seems a little difficult in thinking , but such a tour is really interesting and makes a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
Despite being with many people from this you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to stop without your favorite book .
Yes , it is so important that along with giving a lot of time from less expenditure and peace tour definitely keeps the demand of your patience .
This is the reason that to consider it some things have to be taken care of , especially then , some foreign places are going with the help of bus tour .
Take a good package before taking a ticket .
Students , senior humans , children etc . get discount on them , then there is a arrangement of liberation for two persons also .
Although it is cheap to buy tickets from before , therefore instead of setting a bus tour in the last moments it is better that you plan a little before .
Get information about cyclonic journey without ticket on both sides .
It falls cheap .
Regulations for goods are specially stiff , hence ask about the weight of goods and weight .
It does not happen anywhere that you have to leave your luggage at the station or have to pay more fees .
Along with this also know the rules of insurance or compensation from the tourist company .
The bags to keep with it are appropriate , walk with it .
Because it comes altogether in horses above the seat .
Keep in mind that during the tour the responsibility of goods will be yourself while changing .
From where you have to catch the bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the coming season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will have a good seat choice .
While fixing the seat keep in mind the beauty .
If there is a lot of shock on the last seat , then it will not be right to read on the next seats .
If you have to go to urine again and again then take a seat with a corner and if you do not like to be more disturbed then the window seat will be appropriate for you .
Now the matter of a walker .
If you are in the firack of two seats then first sit on the corner seat and keep your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus then the plan will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing while fixing the seat , because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identification with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus everyone is called to go out .
During this time do not keep your luggage on the seat because it does not take the responsibility of getting lost .
Wherever the bus stops , come back .
If you do not come in time then your place can be found to some new characters and you will have to wait for another bus at the station .

On the roads of Goa , Cycling , River Cruise , Cold sea winds and enjoying the full enjoyment of world famous Goan cuisines , Jinjar Hotel situated here is an excellent option .
If you see in today 's date then the fare of returning back to the cheapest person from Delhi for Maldives is of 28 thousand rupees .
After this if you can stay in Male and still get hotels in less rent but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then it will be small .
C cruise proves beneficial here .
In the first week of December Loui Cruise started the only Cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo from Kochi .
Loui is a European company and is very nominee in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Loui Cruise has now established its services , but there is a possibility of recurrence from October .
At the ship of Lui Cruise M . . Ekwamerin you can go to Maldives for a three-day cruise at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per night .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if there are two elders then children of less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
What else do you want
Tea-snacks , food all are included in the fare of cruise .
With the entertainment of every time .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy entertainment , activities available in Maldives from your creeds - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If a sea plane is standing in front of you suddenly while roaming in big airplanes then you will feel like a sports .
But this town with 12 - 15 seats is excellent for touring the island group like Oter Plan Maldives .
On the surface of water running like a speed boat when it flys in the air , it does not know .
You do not feel the flight of ordinary airplanes in the entire flight .
Every time your eyes remain strong below the window , watching the Resort Islands and Coral Islands in different shadows of Maldives in blue water .
Everything is clearly visible .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Tross Maldives is one of them which has sea plane .
If you want then you can travel for about four thousand rupees -LRB- person for a few hours -RRB- or then you can take the whole sea plane on rent for your whole day tour .
Although if you go to any island before Male Island then the journey of sea plane will be necessary because this is the same way of journey between different islands .
And it is such a journey which the mind of completion might never do to you .
C plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- best Mavilevaru -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the capital 's biggest ancient and memorable shops in the Ahmaddi market of Male .
All the sellers were listening very carefully to the speech given by the President Mohammad Nashid of Maldives in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before .
If I say honestly then I have not seen any Hindustani listening to the speeches of Presidents or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a question of the existence of a best creation of this earth then such seriousness was necessary .
Many people may have considered the meeting made inside the water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October , but it seems to be going to Maldives that if the cop of nature snatched it from us then how much the world will become .
Something like this is special in the beauty there .
In this small country as if such beauty does not fulfil .
On returning from that tour of the market towards Jetty to go to its cruise when the sight went to the water of the sea running along with the unconscious road then it was felt that the people here understand the cost of this beauty for how long .
The water was so clear that the fish floating in the depth of several metres below the lamppost were seen with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can see some centimetres in the sea connected to any city of India or water of the river clean then you will consider yourself to be lucky .
On returning to M . . Aquamrin two hours of the evening spent in Male were roaming around in the brain .
Coral Rif -LRB- stones of parallel -RRB- is the life here .
Even on the stones laid on the tombs you will get the stones of the tombs .
Some time before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we stood outside his official residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the best personality of any country , there was no security worker till far .
With enjoyment we were taking photographs of gardens and Agashi about fifty metres away by spreading hands inside the doors of their bungalows .
Do you think about the house of a common leader in India
It was also found that the President sometimes crossing the road on foot reaches two blocks ahead on his way .
Every thing about Maldives was amazing .
That is why I was aware of the patience of the next day .
It was known that that day was to be special .
In the morning a boat from Cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the basket of Trans Maldives while cutting the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near Male then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing from above .
I had seen so many photographs
But then it was not known that the next day there would be a chance of riding in it .
We had to go to Rangali Island one hundred and fifty kilometres away from the sea plane of Trace Maldives .
Hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives were unforgettable to see from the sea plane flying up to a height of about a thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a flight to stop breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching Conrad Resort of Hilton Hotels on Rangali Island it seemed as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no relation with any outside world .
The relationship was not in such a way that it was difficult to find out the beauty like that there or Vilasita .
Walking on Konarad can also be done on foot or with a battery operated car .
The view of water life on both sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was marvellous .
Nowadays we could not hear ourselves from the nature of the surroundings , that we reached such a place , was imaginable .
On descending down in the sea water several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a food block .
On all sides we were able to see people doing unique types of small - big fish , corals , snowcling and scuba diving .
The imagination of food sitting on the decorated table was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of visiting and lunching underwater on this island coming from Male to sea plane is only 47 thousand rupees for one person .
We did not want to return from there .
We were ready to bath in the water of our skin .
But we knew it was not possible .
On returning back with that desire with heavy mind sometimes , at some point the nervous system will definitely be brought here .
For many days plans were being made to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work it was not possible .
Since childhood wildlife was fond of wildlife , then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
This was the second line tour after biking till Pegong lake ahead of Khardungla in Ladakh in 2006 .
On the afternoon of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the journals who had come out of journal disappeared our speed .
The journey between Hapur to Gajraula was really tired .
Dhummas from above and bad roads in front .
Many times it felt that now it fell .
After doing anything reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Although we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Amara Resort Park was in Dhikuli , whose foundation was done before us .
On that day there was some special program but despite being cold we first came to tour the coast of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we left the Corbett Museum , which was near the Dhangadi door very difficult 2 kilometres away .
From there we continued to visit Ramnagar below .
Returned in the evening .
It was decided from Delhi that if the lions roaming open in the jungle would definitely see then all night I had seen tigers in dreams .
Suddenly in the middle of the deep night I took a lot of jealousy and after that the dogs who started roaming started then they did not stop for two hours .
Therefore before this information came to visit Kaladhungi and Corbett waterfalls .
Kaladhungi is thirty kilometres away , while Corbett waterfalls come on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kaladhungi , where some major things related to his life are kept .
On coming and coming they were spent twelve and a half .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village .
On reaching the resort Safari Jeepsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they have arranged sighting in the number one side business there .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more grassland and tigers come towards this side to escape from cold during this time .
On reaching Bijra we were given a guidance , which takes two and a half hundred rupees to roam around four hours .
We started roaming inside for the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , which had long teeth .
I did photography properly .
In the middle of them the guide started pursuing the tiger .
Guidelines have said that around 150 tigers are there in the park , of which recently some have died .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws but I was sad because of not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to come to Delhi .
In my mind the past of the tiger was in the morning .
Then I remembered a old friend of Haldwani .
I made him the same phone .
I told him that I am coming to Corbett .
He asked whether the tiger was seen or not .
This word of it was felt like a tear .
I said gradually , not .
There was no permission to take bikes in the park .
Somebody advised us that you take safari for inside .
