Its language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it's different .
On one side of Kutch there is a mixture of both in the form of Sind and on the other in the form of Gujarat as well .
It is called ' kachchi ' .
Although this is ' dialect ' , it is not its own script .
If you want to write Kutch then you have to write it in Gujarati script .

The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through bad conditions these days .
Due to the danger of increasing terror in global recession and South Asia tourism business has become serious .
In the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan to be counted among the major states of the country due to tourism special deficiency has been registered in these days .
According to the recent data published by the Rajasthan government in 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased more than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to statistics the number of national tourists has decreased by 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists has decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 26 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakhs 58 thousand 918 countrymen and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas in 2009 a total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 619 national and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People related to tourism sector are very worried about this situation .
Rajputa Holiday Makers ' director Sanjay Kaushik says that global slowdown and terrorist incidents have affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not even developed strong infrastructure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has decreased by 3 . 29 percent in the last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are very much .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The past few years have been good for Rajasthan in terms of tourism .
This is the first time after 2002 when there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
Nothing like this happens due to tourism .
Desert -LRB- desert -RRB- , havelis , forts , forests , buffalo forests all are old to see tourists .
In the tourism sector rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism all the governments do big things but nothing is done in this regard .
The facility of tourists coming to Rajasthan is also very less .
At the same time due to the incidents of expedition and expedition on foreign women tourists this state has been scared at the international level .
The Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of industry in this state a long time ago but it was limited to papers only .
One example of the success of the Rajasthan government regarding tourism is the Tourism Development Corporation Limited ( RTDC ) .
With the aim of increasing tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic form of tourism the Rajasthan government established RTDC in 1979 .
This institution provides facilities like residence , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are 75 departments of this institute .
In which 29 hotels , 22 models , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one connectivity and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but for a few years the situation of this institute has also worsened .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is likely to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years even forty percent of its hotels have not been filled .
Along with hotels the other elements of the institute are also harming it .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There was no attraction among tourists about this train .
Even after reducing the rent this can not attract tourists .
Likewise in the present year there has been an unconsciousness among the tourists about a lot of fairs .
In the year 2007 - 08 the tourist village built by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists had stayed , this year there has been a decrease in this number and it is 217 .
The most satisfactory thing from RTDC was that there was no dearth in the attraction of tourists for Palace on Wheels i . . royal adventure .
This fire cart is making useful .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees by this train .
This slowness coming in the tourism sector of Rajasthan is natural to have an environment of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is a desire to do something in the mind of man then he can remove gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has shown it in fact by establishing modern city Ambo Valley in the range of Sahyadri mountains of Maharashtra .
Seeing the dreams he had seen , he is enjoying his eyes on seeing progress every day .
This joy of him was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley was successful in building its place in the form of a unique city .
In this city spread over 10 thousand acres only 9 percent of the land has hotels , houses and other facilities .
On 91 percent of the land trees , ponds , ponds , carpets and other facilities have been provided .
Many industrialists came forward to make their houses in this city built for crores of husbands and today about 800 families are living in this city .
Initially industrialists and ministers have bought their Asia in the form of Holiday Home but now it has been built its own house and they also visit Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambe Valley is the Korigarh Fort which provides the beauty of this complex .
The ruins of Leekawali in West Siang district are very important .
The ruins of a large temple have been found while digging .
On the pillars of stones of this temple the work of idols of lotus and gods and goddesses has been found which is mostly in a ruined state .
Malini Than is an important place in this part .
At this place a decorative idol of Durga Devi is found .
Behind the name of this idol and place many sweet stories and ancient stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still the glorious stories of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in this ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the description of the glory of Tamreshwari Devi is found .
During the time of Chetia kings this goddess was recognised in the north - eastern mountain .
The people of the tribe here used to worship the goddess .
Here the sacrifice of humans was also given which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Ironit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which are located in the midst of Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the gallantry prevailing here this place is an old Vidarbha , where the king had once done the kingdom of Bhishmak .
Brahmakund is in the lower part of the Ironit river , which is a famous place of Ironit district .
The desert , mishmi etc tribes here guide the travellers .
These people themselves also have great faith in this pond .
The famous Parashuram Kund is near Brahmakund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned remains described in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the remains of Roing in the Diwang - Valley district are also historically important .
The ruins of brick ponds near Roing are still telling their story .
The ghats of bathing , being surrounded by pucca streams and all around another pond and getting the remains of wide roads are still singing the moons of their ancient grandeurful heroes .
We reach ero in four hours through jeep from the city of Upper Assam North Lakhimpur .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansari district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place attracts the hearts of the guests .
This is that charming place where people of Apatani community live .
It takes several days to reach here before the road of jeep was built .
On reaching here the views of tall deodar trees , beautiful Premroz , Waolet , wild curtains , strawberries and Rasberries enjoy the visitors .
Apple and pomegranate are produced here .
At a height of about 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of Apatani people .
With its tireless hard work the fathers have made it their heaven .
There is a lot of rice farming here .
This place is the treasure of rice .
Ten miles long this is a living example of the hard work of the plains and the skills of the farming .
The need for irrigation of black rivers is fulfilled .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
The vision falls on the light redness coming out of the sky on the horizon in the middle of the snowy mountain ranges of the left hand .
There is a good cold in the air .
One also feels wet along with the cold touching in the environment .
The sound of garbage below the feet is seen on the layer of leaves stuck on the wooden floor .
In the environment there is restlessness and because of the spread of the evening before sunrise nothing was seen much .
The vision remains shiny on the redness of the east .
The desire to sit in the balcony lying in the balcony .
As soon as the rotten layer of ice gets stuck with light sound and hands get stuck in a moment to feel cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending nights in this small village settled in the midst of these mountains buried with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third journey in Swiss .
Before this spent a long time in Geneba or around it .
Situated in the valley on both the sides of the Uthal Balkhati river the dense settlement is spread up to a very high slope .
This is the main river Rhone valley of Switzerland on both sides of which many small towns are settled .
The parallel highway of the Ron river and the trains running on it are clearly visible .
At a distance of 300 kms and carni two and a half hours the journey of half an hour and along with the parallel of Jeneva lake and half the Ron river coming from the eastern direction near the city named Montrex which is called Lec Lemon in French -LRB- Lock Lemon -RRB- .
Geneva city is located 100 kms long and 10 kms wide on the western end of this lake .
From there the lake goes towards the west after becoming a river again .
On the right side of the lake are Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps ranges .
After crossing a beautiful small city named Leuk we left -LRB- exit -RRB- leave this highway , we come on the north mountain road .
Because of the slope of the mountain southwards the sun of the evening is giving a lot of light to all the sides .
The quantity of snow is less than the valley - almost not with it .
As soon as the height goes ahead , the denseness of snow has started increasing .
Despite good snow accumulated on both sides of the road there is no special cold in the air because of clean sky and shining sun .
After fixing the journey of about 20 kms on this rotating hilly juice we reached a small village named Thel .
Chalet - with descending roof , there are large multi-storied bungalows made of wood completely .
There are rooms to control the necessary services like parking along with electricity , water , laundry in the basement built by the cement concrete of this three storey bungalow .
Wildlife is famous for grape farming in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making dry grapes .
37  of the whole of Canton is the field of grapes on the ground .
In the villages settled on both sides of the Ron Valley grapes gardens of grapes provide a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Take the bottom of wine yards , furnace them , relaxing them in the villages there and taking them to the shops of grapes and chewing the wine testing is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Aigle is a very big museum of alcohol made of grapes in a small fort built in the 12th century , to see which foreign tourists have to register an artificial record .
Once again we go through the same jungle descended from Dawanal .
Till three - four k . . road the mind becomes even more upset with the questions of the children .
Suddenly dramatic and charming changes come from the scene on a rotation .
On the left side of the road , on the upper slope of the deep valley a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in snow on the slopes situated in the upper part of the village .
The dense forest of Deodar is spread till the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the town are shining due to the direct rays of the sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
The same calm is spread here also .
On all four sides from the peak of the mountain to the valley is the empire of Dhawal snow .
Within the next five minutes you reach the middle of that town on a big round chakra -LRB- Round RDF base -RRB- .
The name of the town is Lukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Lukarbad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists coming here , sportspersons and health workers can be estimated from this fact that there are 1700 beds and shelters 1500 , 28 hotels , camping sites of tents , 90 bed health centers and 50 restaurants .
In Lukarbad 65 sources of hot water have been found till now .
40 lakh litres -LRB- up to 51 OC -RRB- water coming out of it is reached around small and big thirmal pools made in the whole town , some bridges are inside the five star hotel and others are according to the economic level of the people of various income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
A large layer of snow is shining on the roofs of the houses in the lukewarm sunlight .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the places conserved in the form of a national importance heritage in Switzerland .
It was said in Darjeeling itself that Sikkim can only go to the taxis of Sikkim because of which checking is not done .
The journey is going on , the state is the second , but the mountain is the same , the trees are the same , the cooling wind is the same .
That is the wet floating shivering on all the body .
In the season of rainy season fitness is the same .
As soon as the plan of Darjeeling journey was completed , it was decided to take a glimpse of Karsiang first .
Karsiang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of dust forests .
Famous for production of excellent tea .
If we move ahead towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then the tea gardens spread in the beginning welcome the people coming towards us .
Going through the road passing through tea gardens charms the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains full of jungles , on the other side deep green valley .
Here sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen .
There was a kingdom of greenery all around .
Once I got disturbed see these natural jungles that see the tea plants planted by humans .
Both were attracting themselves .
The beautiful jungles are as beautiful as far as tea gardens are .
If you look at the roads of the road then the creation feels magnificent .
The narrow and circular road like a snake walk was moving ahead .
The time was also gone .
If it was not finished then it was a forest and tea garden .
Sometimes small towns were seen .
A very denseness was seen from far off from a hilly house - house etc .
This was Karsiang .
Staying here at one place we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
Therefore taking a train we left for a picnic of Karsiang .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by huge jungles all around .
Approximately one has to leave the train very below to reach the deer park .
Despite being filled with beautiful beauty Karsiang has no longer been developed as a tourist spot .
While the city is very good and clean and beautiful .
Despite the road being deserted the luxury of reaching till the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the road through dust trees was giving us adventure .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
There is a point located at a height on the other side of this city .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to give life by flying from here .
At present there is a park and hotel here .
There is a jean-like dome here from the heights of which a beautiful view is prepared by observing the whole city .
In the tea gardens around the women were busy in breaking the tea leaves running hands with extreme speed by putting a tape on the back .
There is a museum outside the Karsiang city but on that day we could not go there because it was more important to roam around in the unmatched environment of tea gardens .
The next day it is decided to roam Darjeeling .
It was an adventurous experience on its own but there was a greater concern than this that if such rains continue to happen then how will we roam
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching to the Rock Garden we roamed around enjoying the dry sun .
This park is a very attractive place with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The road to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
Going a little further down from here Gangamaya was found surrounded by mountains .
The beauty of the waterfalls situated in the rocks here is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we found that waterfalls in the empire of stones and rocks are very beautiful here while the maiden world of waterfalls in Ganga Maa is engraved with stones .
Both of these places are standing very below the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw batsia loops in Darjeeling by lifting up with the help of a car .
From here on the basis of television the whole of Darjeeling mountains and city can be seen .
The wave of the weather was still clean .
But as we went towards the monastery we did not know where we came and started spooning .
In the evening plans were made to roam and shopping on the mall road .
In the tour of Darjeeling toys enhance the joy of adventurous journey .
From Darjeeling to Ghoom and Dhoom to Darjeeling the journey of Toy Agra is a special attraction for tourists .
Here in Mirik lakes boating and luxury in the park .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar by this way , where Nepalese artisans get sweater etc . engraved by hand .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is like a city of Darjeeling district but its form and color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens but there is abundance of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is Ladakh and Lolegaon , which are full of forest - waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to Darjeeling in the shadow of cold but here tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling kept me tied with you .
My present journey was very attractive and thrilling .
This journey was not of foreign countries nor of Rajasthan but is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an attractive subject in itself in which sometimes travels towards itself , sometimes some special place , water ship or any royal train or any city like rose city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction people get attracted .
The place I am going to do is just about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place has come there he really did the welfare of the forest .
Not only for the people going there but also for the people living there .
My guide in my ears rotates the words of Ram Babu Meen , Sahiba even before this we can not even think that we can stay in the forest .
50 percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work even in Heritage Hotel .
Ram Babu of Ajabgarh used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in the Aman Bagh of this unique royal style .
He brought his speeches in a new color .
Sahiba ' is the estimation of Aman Bagh .
There nobody speaks to you with English telephone .
Aman Bagh is actually a picnic spot with peaceful and comfortable facilities .
The history of that garden is also our history and the biggest thing is that it makes its introduction to the surrounding region also .
How many of the people spending holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have toured Bhangarh of Bhutan .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people from all over the country and abroad have reached there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi had called me there with my heart but I could not go .
It is a different thing that he had already reached Bhangarh after waiting for himself .
This time suddenly when I reached there with my foreign guests then it seemed as if people wanted to spend a good holiday in less time then they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden of those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to hunt for hunting .
Its construction was done in one hundred and twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Bag surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees attracts you .
As you come inside the way you are welcomed , it feels that attention has been given to Divya Shanti here .
Along with making valuables in Mangata the mantra of Mangalachar is made alive .
We had reached after evening and we decided to kill that garden a round .
My guest Jackie , who is a decorative , said easily , ' This is very attractive ' .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . It was not surprising that Aman Bagh has also got a prize at present .
The administrator decided our program for the morning .
First of all roamed on foot with Rambabu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on narrow roads we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the sun rays were spreading gradually .
The dry lake was seen in which the farmers were farming .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw tobacco cultivation .
For Jackie such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
Just in the morning I saw a tourist of Halland sitting carefully .
This is an invaluable moment of million dollars .
The method of abstaining from Aman Bagh was also traditional , giving us jaggery and curd , he gave us relief .
Now it was noticed why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard that for seeing the life of the species a tour package is kept .
Is it right
Sufficiently and this is not one but in many states and tourists also show special interest in it .
This tour is usually prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In these staying there , food etc . are also included .
This way an attempt is made to find such places where there was not much development and where there was no special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At that time where old tourist spots etc are also present .
Besides this , attention is also given on doing all the triditional cuisines .
In fact , the purpose of such a tour was to introduce tourists to the methods and traditions of living in that place .
Although this idea seems to be a bit difficult , but such tours are really attractive and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
With this even with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give more time to stop your favorite book .
Yes , it is sure that along with giving a lot of time in less expenditure and restlessness these tours definitely expect patience from you .
This is the reason that for enjoying them it is necessary to keep in mind some things , mainly when you are watching some foreign destinations with the help of bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking the ticket .
Students , senior people of Military , children etc . get suits on these , while there is a arrangement of suiting for two people also .
By the way , shopping of adventurous tickets is cheap , therefore it is better to plan a bus tour in the last moment that plan a little quickly .
Instead of tower ticket get information about round trips .
These are cheap .
The rules regarding baggage are specially complicated , therefore consider the size and weight of the goods .
Never happens that you have to leave some of your goods on the terminal or you have to pay more fees .
Along with this also know the rules of insurance or compensation from the tour company .
Carry on bags are good , take it .
Because they sit together in the rack above this seat .
Keep in mind this thing also that while changing the bus during the tour the responsibility of luggage is your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there for an hour before time .
During the busy season you should pay special attention to this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better seat options will be with you .
Keep in mind whether the seat is pleasant or not while choosing .
If the ceiling is more sitting on the back seat then there is no confirmable reading on the next seat .
If you have to go to the toilet continuously , then take a seat in the elbow and if you do not like much obstruction then the window seat will be good for you .
Now the thing of one quarter .
If you are thinking of both of them then first sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other seat .
If there is no crowd in the bus then the plan will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing while selecting the seat , because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identification with bus drivers and conductors .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus all are asked to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because they do not take the responsibility of sitting on losing .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time then you can get your place to another man and you will have to wait for the bus .

If you look at today 's date then the fare of returning to every person from Delhi is 28 thousand rupees for Maldives .
After that even if you stay in Male then you can get hotels at some less rent but to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives if you go to any island nearby then the slope will be small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial .
From Kochi in the first week of December Louis Cruise started the only cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very famous among cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some difficulties Louis Cruise has now established its service , but it is likely to start again from October .
On the ship of Lui Cruise M . . Aquarin you can go at least 5850 rupees per person at the rate of every night for a three day cruise for the journey of Maldives .
That is for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if there are two elders then complete free for the child of less than 15 years of age .
What else do you want
In the fare of cruise tea - breakfast , food are all included .
With the entertainment of every time .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives with the help of your desire - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If there is a single plane standing in front of you suddenly while sliding in big airplanes then you will feel like playing .
But this twelve-15-seat vimana is excellent for roaming around Maldives Sarkh Island .
They never understand that while running like a speed boat from the surface of water they fly in the air .
In the entire journey we do not feel the journey of normal aircraft .
Our eyes keep on roaming continuously below the window keeping in mind the blue water of different beauty of Maldives , Resort Islands and Prawal Islands .
How clean everyone looks .
There are only two sea planes in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these companies where there are 20 planes .
If you want then you can travel for about 4 thousand rupees -LRB- each -RRB- for an hour or you can take the entire airplane in your possession throughout the day -LRB- just a lot of money -RRB- .
If you go to a different island than Male Island then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the only way to travel on different islands .
And this is such a journey that you do not want to end .
The journey from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Mavilevaru in the north -RRB- takes place in the Maldives island .
We were in the most ancient and sovanier shops of the capital in the Ahmedabadi market of Male .
All the sellers were listening carefully to the speech given by the President Mohammad Nashid of Maldives in the World Climate Conference of Copenhagen a day before .
I have not seen any Indian listening to the speech of the President or the Prime Minister so carefully.
But when there was a question of the existence of an intellectual object on this earth then such a seriousness was adventurous .
Many people might have understood the meetings taken inside the water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October but on going to Maldives it feels that if it takes away from itself then the world will become a valley .
There is something special in the beauty there .
There is no such beauty in that small country .
After that journey of the market while returning to Cruise on returning to the port , if your sight goes to the water of the sea then it feels as if the people here do so much of the beauty .
The water was so clean that the fish swimming deeply below the lamppost was seen with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which is completely connected to the city .
If you are able to see the water of sea or river near any city of India for some centimetres then you will consider yourself to be lucky .
While returning from M . . Aquamrine two hours of the evening spent in the male keeps roaming in the heart .
Prawal rock -LRB- Munga rock -RRB- is the life here .
It is so that you will also find chicken rocks on stones of graves .
After listening to the speech of President Nasid for some time we stood outside his official residence .
It was not really felt that we were standing outside the residence of a supreme handicraft of the country and no one was protected from far off places .
We were enjoying taking photographs of only 50 metres long gardens and thorns by handing them inside the gate of their bungalow .
Can we think about any leader's house in India
It was also understood that the President sometimes walking on foot on his own reaches his office two houses ahead by crossing the road .
Everything in the context of Maldives was exciting .
That is why I was waiting for the next day very carefully .
It seemed that that day would have been special .
In the morning a name from Cruja brought us to the airport island .
From there on the base of Trans Maldives by putting a run wheel rotten .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near Male then we immediately knew the plane going from above .
Such photographs were seen , theirs .
But then it was not imagined that the next day there would be an opportunity to roam from it .
By the sea plane of Trace Maldives we had to go to Rangali island a hundred five kilometres long .
To see hundreds of resorts and Praval Islands spread on the sea of Maldives by the sea plane flying at a height of about thousand metres is unforgettable .
Such beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
The flight of breathing stops with thrill and excitement .
But on reaching Conrad Resort of Hilton Hotel on Rangali island it felt as if we have reached a different world .
In such a world which has no relation with any outside world .
There was no such relationship that it was not possible to get the beauty and comfort like there .
The journey of Konarad can also be done on foot or by a battery driven car .
Going to the main island from the port to the main island the view of water on both sides of the bridge is unique .
Now if we could not separate ourselves from the surrounding nature then we reached such a place which was unprecedented .
We went to such a room of glass while descending down from the stairs till several metres below the seal which was in water .
Our room was altogether a dining room .
At all across the glass we could see unique types of small fish , snakeling and scuba diving people .
The imagination of eating sitting on tables there was very thrilling .
The expenditure of one person to visit this island by sea plane from Male and take lunch inside water is 47 thousand rupees .
There was no mind to return from there .
We were ready to leave our passport in water .
But we knew that it was not possible .
Heavy mind returned with this hope that sometimes the fate would bring back to this place .
For many days it was decided to go away from Delhi but because of the busyness of work it was not possible .
Since childhood the favorite of wildlife was then thought that why do not you see Jim Corbett at this time .
This was the second bike journey in Ladakh after biking till Pegong lake near Khardungla in 2006 .
On 27th afternoon we left Jim Corbett from Delhi but the excitement that had come out was swallowed up with our speed .
The journey from Hapur to Gajraula was really tired .
Smoke from it and bad road in front .
Many times it felt that now we fell .
How to reach Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was near the park which we had already registered .
There was no special program on that day even after winters we went to tour the shores of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we went to see the Corbett Museum situated near Dhangadi Gate at a distance of 2 kilometres .
From there we left for a tour to Ramnagar below .
There was a lot of evening while returning .
While coming out of Delhi we decided that the lions roaming openly in the jungle would definitely see that the whole night I had a lion in dreams .
In the darkness of the night I suddenly heard it in a loud duration and after that dogs started hungry like that which did not stop for two hours .
Earlier Kaladhungi and Corbett waterfalls were worth seeing .
Kalatungi is thirty kilometres long and Corbett Fall is on the road .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kalatungi where some important things related to his personal life have been kept .
Twelve and a half o'clock till returning .
Kalatungi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled in this village .
On reaching the resort safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It is said that they have arranged sighting in a number of sites there .
Asked about one number it was told that there is more greenery and tigers come to the same place for protection from cold .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half hundred rupees for roaming four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
We saw two trunk elephants inside which were long and long teeth .
I made a lot of photography .
During this time the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide told that there are about 150 tigers in the park among which some have died .
At some places we also saw the pieces of their claws but because of not seeing the tiger I was disappointed .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my head the wad of the tiger was filled .
Then I remembered one of my friends of the attack .
I made him such a phone .
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
He asked whether the tiger was seen or not .
Its words are like an arrow .
I spoke gradually , not .
There was no permission to take bikes in the park .
Somebody told us that you take a safari to go inside .
