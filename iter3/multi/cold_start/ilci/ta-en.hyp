A small garden is surrounded by jungles all around .
For reaching from the height the train is left very low .
Though Karsiyang is full of beauty , there is no fame of development in tourism .

For spending holidays in the best statistics of Rajasthan how many people are roaming around the Bhubaneswar , why should you go away , some of the Jaipuris have spent the night in this area
After opening the Aman Garden most of the people of the country and abroad reach there .
I remember that night when Sabna Ashmi called me interestedly but I could not go .
If they had reached Bangadh after finding the way themselves then this is a different kind .
This time suddenly on the invitation of his foreign guests I felt there that these people want to spend a good holiday in less time so that they should go to Aman Garden .
This garden is a separate garden conserved in those seven gardens where Alwar king had gone to the hunt .

On seeing in the dry lake the farmer was harvesting in it .

The rural life of Jog has been such a unique experience .
After that we went to Bang Aut through jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist spot sitting very carefully .
These are millions of dollars invaluable moments .
According to Alvida from the Aman Garden also gave us a traditional answer by giving jaggery and curd .
Tourists can now know why to spend so much here .
I was told that for seeing the life of the tribals a tourist group was established .
What is it right
Of course this is seen in some other states and tourism shows special interest in it .
This tourism is organised for 4 days to 2 weeks and this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this how to stay there .
In such a way an attempt is made to do such explanation where there is no excessive development and there is no special arrangement of lifestyle of natural and people .
At the same time there are also ancient tourist species .
Besides this attention is also given to surveillance of triditional guise .
In fact the lifestyle and tradition of that place can be seen directly to such tourists .
Though it is very difficult to think , but such tourism gives interest in going and gives a different experience .
Tourists are very enjoyed on the bus .
Even if you see a crowd of people here then you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can take too long to read your favorite book .
Yes , along with spending less and giving peace all the time , this journey definitely makes us satisfaction .
To celebrate this it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching some foreign destination buses through tourism .
Before taking the ticket search for the best tea .
Students , military people , children etc . get tickets here for both the people there is ready arrangements for both the people .
In the same way it is better to buy a prescribed journey , that is why in the last trains arrangements of tourism are best if arrangements are made beforehand .
Instead of traveling they should tell about Round Trips .
The expense of morning is also less .
It is very important to take things , hence listen to things of obesity and weight .
You leave some of your things with temporary duration or then fill the electronic substances .
Along with this get the taste of insurance or harm from the tourist group .
Take garry on packs is comfortable .
Because it can be applied on the rock above the sheet .
Keep in mind this thing that during tourism the responsibility of changing things from the bus is on its own .
Wherever you have a bus , go one hour before that time .
During busy season you should keep this thing in the main period .
In fact as soon as you go , such a good sheet system is near you only .
Keep in mind the facility while selecting the seat .
Take the posterior seat too much but there is no facility of studying in the front .
If you have to urinate again and again then take a seat of afar , do not want to have much trouble then you will have the best sitting near the door .
Now there is a temporary thing .
If you both sit in the bottle sitting then first sit in the bottle of the corner and keep your back on the other side .
That is why if there is no crowd on the bus then your arrangement will be successful .
Therefore if there is facility of vashroom on the bus then keep in mind this thing while selecting the sheet that after some time it is difficult to sit there .
Introduce bus drivers and contents .
This way you get sufficient information .
While cleaning the bus all are told to come out .
During this time do not keep your commodity on the sheet because if it is removed then the buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stand , return back to time .
If you do not go for time then you can see a new journey in your place and you will have to expect another bus .

But this division of 12 - 15 drops is best for touring the Archie Baley Covet -LRB- island hut -RRB- like flying Maldives .
In the bottom part of the water the speed boat is running like a boat , it is not known when it emerges in the air .
You do not have the experience of flying on airplanes ordinary .
Every time you are watching below the window , look at the Rising Islands and Goral Islands in the water below the different settlements of Maldives .
How many two c-blain companies are all there .
There are two Blain companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is a good place in which there is a sea plane .
If you want then you can roam around 4000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- in an hour or the entire plane will be rented for you to travel throughout the day .
If you go to the island of Value then it is necessary to travel in C Blain because it is normal to travel between different islands .
And if you are afraid that this is a journey then you do not travel in it .
The journey from 12 k . . to 183 k . . is done in Maldives islands .
We were in the shops of the capital of the Ahmati Bazar of Maldives .
All the cellsmen are listening to the words given by the President Mohammad Nasit of Maldives in the Cave Halls a day before very carefully .
I am convinced that no Indian has heard the speeches of President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a challenge at the stage of a unique creation of this earth then such a terrible thing is necessary .
In October some people know the mantra of the people going inside the water through the cabinet of Maldives very well that they go to Maldives because the wrath of nature gets caught from us how poor the world becomes .
In the beauty of this place there are many such specialities .
There is no such magnificent tomb in that small country .
On roaming around the market they return towards Jetty to go back to their guruj then surely while paying attention to the road the food of sea water is done because the people here know this beautiful surprising border .
The fish swimming in a few metres deep below the light of Lamp Bong has been showing with all its colors .
This is a sea portion which is connected with the city .
If you are able to see some centimetres clean in the river or sea water connected to any city of India then you will be able to enjoy yourself .
Returning to M . . Aquarius in Maldives in the evening for two hours keep on roaming in Jagan .
The life of this place is Koral Rep .
Until now you will get stones and buffaloes on the pinnacles .
In order to listen to President Nashi 's speech we were standing outside some government clutches .
We were ahead of the premier residence of the best position of one country , there was no security for a long time because we could not believe .
We were taking photographs at a distance of approximately 50 metres from the gardens and footpaths on his terrible gate .
Can you think like this by taking it to the house of a common head in India .
It is said that President had always crossed the roads and had come to his office before two blocks .
In the matter of Maldives everything is worth seeing .
That is why I was expecting the next day in patience .
It was important for that day to be good fortune .
In the morning from Guruji a boat entered us till Air Force Jalland .
From there we reached the place of Trans Maldives by roaming around the railway .
Later in the evening when Guruji had come out of Maldives then we immediately identified the C Blain coming out of the top .
We were watching so many maps of him .
But then there was no doubt that the next day there was a chance to pay attention to it .
We were going to Rangali Island at a distance of 500 kilometres from the sea plane of Trans Maldives .
From the seashore of Maldives flying up to a height of about 1000 metres the canopy of hundreds of Richen and Goral islands spread in the sea of Maldives was unforgettable .
This beautiful water is not available anywhere .
This is a journey to stop breathing with thrill and excitement .
But on going to the Hillton Hotels Sin Gond Resort on the Rangai island we feel like coming to the world else .
In such a world , outside there was no connectivity with any other world .
It was difficult to find out the beauty or luxury life there .
One can also go to Konark by walking on foot or by a battery running vehicle .
While going from Jetty to the main island the life of both the sides of the bridge is unique .
Now we have not been able to be natural with the nature of the nearby imagination imagination .
We reached a glass room while descending in the sea water several metres below the stairs which was inside the water .
In fact there was a lunch and a room .
On all sides through glasses we can see the magnificent kind of small fishes , corals , snockerling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated tables is thrilling in itself .
For seeing this island on the sea plane from Male and for drinking food at the bottom of water the rent of one ruler is 47 thousand rupees .
There is no mind to return from there .
We were ready to drive our passport in water .
We know that it's not possible.
We came back with the same confidence in our mind , sometimes the luck will take us back to a turn .
For a long time a plan was being made to go to Value from Delhi but because of the work being done it did not happen .
Because of the desire of wild animals from the child we thought why should not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 after picking up to Yegong lake at some distance from Kardukla in Ladakh this is another biker .
In the morning of 27 December we went out of Delhi to Jim Corbett but the speed that came out with which the stoppage had reduced our speed .
The journey from Hapur to Kajraulau was really tired .
Snow from the top and worse road in front .
Many times it came to pass that when we were waking up .
On one way we reached Karjraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We had come to Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett National Park is at a distance of 20 kilometres from Ramnagar .
We were in Tiku near our resort park , we had already registered it .
Today there is no special event that after getting cold we first went to tour the banks of Koshi .
We left the Corbett Museum for two - three hours , which was very difficult at a distance of 2 kilometres .
From there we went to Ramnagar roaming down for days .
It took a long time to return .
If you see the tiger left in the jungle then I will see a tiger in the dream of the whole night .
In the midst of the deep night I suddenly heard a loud voice , after that the dogs did not start crying for two hours .
Therefore first comes on the Kaladungi and Corbett waterfalls .
In Kaladungi there was a museum of Jim Corbett National Park , where some information related to their own life was kept .
The museum of Jim Corbett Museum in Kaladungi .
It was half an hour to return .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village .
On reaching the hotel Safari Gypsy was waiting for us to visit .
He said that one of them is organised to roam there in Saint Bijrani .
While talking about the number one is more there the tigers come towards that side to protect the cold .
On reaching Bijarauli we felt a guide , for four hours we bought hundred and fifty rupees for roaming .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
There many types of birds and monkeys have been seen .
Inside we saw elephants with two thorns , which had long teeth .
I got a stable film.
In the midst of this the guide started trekking the filth .
There are about 150 tigers in the park in which some tigers died in the same year .
At many places we saw their feet , but I was sorry to see the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain there was a deficiency of not seeing the tiger .
Then I remembered a old friend of Haldwani .
I contacted him on the phone.
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
He asked if he had seen the tiger or not .
This word of him fell like a pigeon .
I'm not slow.
There is no permission to take a bag for the park .
One told us that to go inside take a buffalo .
