Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it ' s different .
On the one side of Kutch , Sind and on the other , Gujarat is therefore a mixture of both in languages .
It is called ' kachhi ' .
Well , it ' s ' bid ' , it ' s not its own script .
If you have to write Kutchi then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where earthquakes have occurred many times and the whole city has collapsed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal-Toral .
The story of Jaisal - Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the same path from which they had come then we will have to take the whole month 's holiday and on the other hand schools will open in Bombay .
So what to do  Now the fast buses of Gujarat will travel in the train by calling Tota .
The small train of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and the big train of Broad Gauge from Ahmedabad will reach Bombay .
The tourism industry , considered to be the main foundation of the economy of Rajasthan , is passing through bad times these days .
Due to the increasing terror threats in global recession and South Asia tourism business has been deeply shocked .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan to be included in the major states of the country has recorded a lot of reduction these days .
Recent data released by the Rajasthan government shows that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent compared to 2008 .
According to statistics the number of native tourists has decreased by 9 . percent and the number of foreign tourists has decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 natives and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
These included two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 natives and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Holiday Makers says that world recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are most .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
In terms of tourism recent years have passed the best for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has decreased .
From the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , havelis , fort , Bavadia , Forest everything is the same old to love the tourists .
In the tourism sector all the governments talk of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get facilities very little .
At the same time incidents of rape and tampering in Rajasthan along with foreign women tourists have also made the image of this state stained at the international level .
Years ago the Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of industry in the state but it has remained confined to papers only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan Government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited ( RTDC ) .
The Government of Rajasthan had formed RTDC in 1979 with the objective of promoting tourism and developing tourism infrastructure in Rajasthan .
This corporation provides facilities of housing , food , traffic , boating etc to the tourists .
There are 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motals , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one traffic unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has remained thin for many years .
RTDC deficit in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh , which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years even forty percent of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with hotels the other units of the corporation are also reaching it a big loss .
Among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not be attracted to this rail .
Despite reducing rent it could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Mela .
In the year 2007 - 08 in this fair in the tourist village built by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists stayed , this year this number decreased to 217 .
The satisfactory thing for RTDC has been that there has been no dearth in the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . the royal train .
This rail is continuously benefiting .
Last year, RTDC benefited about 9. 5 crore rupees from this rail.
Due to this decline in tourism sector in Rajasthan , it is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If you want to do something in man ' s heart , he can make gold from soil .
Subrata Roy has made it true by establishing modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain range of Sahyadri of Maharashtra .
Looking at the dream he had seen , he looks joyful in his eyes by day and day .
His happiness was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has succeeded in making its place as a better city .
In this city spread over 10 thousand acres only 9 percent of the land hotels , houses and other facilities have been set up .
91 per cent of the land has been provided trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities .
Many industrialists have come forward to build their houses in this city built for millionaires and today about 800 families are living in this city .
Initially industrialists and rices bought their shelter here in the form of Hollyday Home but now it has made its own first house and from here they commute Mumbai for functioning .
Behind Ambe Valley is Koyrigarh fort which provides beauty to this area .
The ruins of Leekawali are very important in the western Siang district .
Remains of a large temple are found in excavation .
On the pillars of stones of this temple the excavation of idols of lotus and gods and goddesses has been obtained which is mostly in ruined state .
Malini Than is an important place in this region .
At this place a Dasabhuja statue of Goddess Durga has been found .
Behind the name of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the glorious story of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories there is a description of the glory of Tamreshwari Devi .
At the time of Chetia kings this goddess was recognised far and wide in the north - eastern hills .
The people of the tribe here used to worship the goddess .
Here the sacrifice of humans was also offered which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other treasures have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called Khandahar of Bhishmak Nagar which is located in the terrain between Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the stories prevailing here this place is an old Vidarbha , where once the king used to do Bhishmak kingdom .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place in Lohit district .
The Digaru , Mishmi etc tribes here guide the travellers .
These people themselves have a great reverence to this Kunda .
Near Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kunda .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned treasures described in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the treasures of roing in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The remains of brick ponds near Roing are still telling their story .
Ghats of bathing , pucca stairs and other ponds are surrounded by pucca paracota and getting the remains of wide roads are still singing silence of their ancient grand stories .
We reach ero for four hours by jeep from the city of Upper Assam North Lakhimpur .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place charms the heart of the visitors .
This is the same charming place where emergency lives .
It takes several days to reach here before the way of jeep was formed .
On reaching here the views of high deodar trees , beautiful Premrose , Waolet , wild curtains , strawberries and Rasberries enjoy the visitors .
Apple and potatoes are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread over 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of emergency people .
Emergency people have made it their heaven with their tireless labour .
There is a lot of rice cultivation here .
This place is a store of rice .
This ten miles long plateau is a living example of their hard work and the skill of cultivation .
The necessity of irrigation is met by the Kali river .
The trees of pine put four moons in the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the light redness emerging in the sky on the horizon in the middle of the snowy mountain range of the left hand .
There is a lot of cold in the air .
Along with cooling cooling in the environment one also feels moisture .
With the sound of garbage below the feet the layer of the wooden layer is seen on the floor .
In the environment there is nervousness and due to the smoke shadow of the sunrise prior to sunrise , nothing is seen more .
The eyes remain on the redness of the east .
There is a feeling of sitting on the bench lying in the balcony .
The smooth layer of the palanquin gets shaken with the sound of a light glass and the hand gets separated from the shock from the feeling of coolness .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village settled amidst these hills covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent in Geneba or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both sides of the thin Balkhati river is spread very high on light slopes .
This is the valley of Rhone , the main river of Switzerland on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
On the other side of the Ron river highway and crawling trains have begun to clear on it .
At a distance of 300 kms and half an hour from car the journey of two and a half hours from the car is found in the same way as Geneva lake and along with half the Ron river coming from the eastern direction near the city named Montreu , Geneva lake which is called ec emon -LRB- Lock Lama -RRB- .
Geneva city is settled on the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake goes forward towards the west after becoming a river again .
On the right side of the lake are mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke from the exit of the left side we come on the hilly path of the north , leaving this highway .
Due to the slope of the mountain being southward , the sun of the slope is giving full sunshine to all the slopes .
The quantity of snow is less here than the valley - almost not equal .
As soon as the heights go towards , the density of snow has started increasing .
There is no special coolness in the air because of the clear sky and shining sun on both sides of the road , despite accumulation of good snow .
The journey of about 20 kms on this rotating hilly road reaches a small village named Thel .
Shailet - with slope roofs , are completely large multi-storeyed bungalows made of wood .
In the basement made of cement concrete of this three - storeyed bungalow , there are rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , ladry , including parking of trains .
Valai is famous for cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This is the main center of making wine grapes .
Grapes are cultivated on 37  of the entire Canton land .
In the villages settled on both sides of the Ron Valley gardens of grapes provide a wonderful dimension to the beauty there .
Take the bottom of grapes , touring them is an integral part of the tourism business here by taking them to the villages there and taking them to the factory of grapes .
In a small town named Age -LRB- Aigle -RRB- there is a very big museum of grapes in a hoteau made in the 12th century , to see which foreign tourists have to get a fire booking .
Once again we pass through the same jungle .
Throughout the way up to three - four k . . the mind becomes even more distressed by the questions of the children .
Suddenly , dramatic and charming changes come from the scene at a turn .
Right in front , on the slope above the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing -LRB- skiing -RRB- in the snow on the slope slope from above the village .
The dense forest of deodar is spread above the skiing slope till the peak of the mountain .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining due to the direct sun rays .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same silence is shadowed .
From the peak of the mountain to the valley all around the Dhawal empire of snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round round round round round between that town .
The name of the town is Lukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level , the population of Luckerbad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from this fact that there are 1700 apartments and rocks with the capacity of 6900 beds , 28 hotels , camping sites of tents , 90 bed health centers and 50 restaurants .
65 sleeps of hot water have been found so far in Lukarbad .
Approximately 40 lakh liters -LRB- up to 51 o ' clock -RRB- warm -LRB- up to 51 o ' clock -RRB- , about 30 small and big thermal pools made at places , some pools are within five star hotels and others are according to the pockets of people of different income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
The thick floor of the snow is shining above the roof of the houses in the blooming sunlight .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the places conserved in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that Sikkim can only go to the taxis of Sikkim hence checking is not done .
The journey is going on , the state is second , but the mountain is the same , the trees are the same , the sandy winds are there .
The moisture swimming on the whole body is the same .
During the rainy season the sunlight is the same .
As soon as the plan for Darjeeling Yatra was finished , it was first spread to take a look at Karsiyang .
Karsiang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunshine forests .
Famous for excellent tea production .
While moving towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , in the beginning the tea garden welcomes those who smile towards themselves .
Between tea gardens passing through the road enjoys the heart for the first time .
On the one hand , the green mountains full of forests , on the other side the green trench .
Sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen here .
There was a kingdom of greenery all around .
Once I was disturbed , see these natural jungles or tea plants planted by man .
Both were dragging towards themselves .
As beautiful forests were , as beautiful tea gardens spread far and wide .
If you go to the roads of the road then the creation looks amazing .
The snake ' s snake ' s dried and vertical path was passing through .
The time was also going on .
The forests and tea gardens were not spent .
Sometimes small settlement was seen .
From a distance , a hilly house , etc . appeared very dense .
It was Curseyag .
After staying here at one place we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
Therefore taking a car we got out on a tour of Karsiyang .
First of all Dear Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach the climb i . . to reach the deer park the car had to be left very low .
Despite being luxurious with the beauty of Karsiang , it has not yet been developed as a tourist destination .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the destruction of the way , the greed of reaching till the deer park surrounded by forests and the joy of climbing the way between sunshine trees was giving us courage .
The next place was the Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the age of the British lovers used to jump from here and give life .
At present , it is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a stair-like dome here on observing the whole city from the height of which a beautiful view is present .
In tea gardens nearby women were busy in breaking the tea leaf running hands with a basket ladder on the back .
There is a museum outside Karsiang city , but on that day we could not go there , because touring the environment free from tea gardens felt more important .
The next day it was decided to roam Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was a great concern that if it was raining , how would we roam
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching the rock garden we roamed enjoying the sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
On moving a little further down from here Gangamaya was found surrounded by hills .
The charm of waterfalls amidst rocks is spectacular here .
In Rock Garden we found that the waterfalls in the empire of stones and rocks are charming here then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is decorated with stones .
Both of these places are standing very below the hills of Darjeeling .
Arising up with the help of a car we saw the Valasia Loop in Darjeeling .
From here the whole hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telescope .
The mood of the weather was smooth so far .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , we came from where to decreasing and shouting .
In the evening there was a plan to walk and shopping on the mallrode .
In the tour of Darjeeling the Twelve trains put four moons in the journey .
The journey of Tway train from Darjeeling to roam and from Dhum to Darjeeling is special attraction for tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake and short stop in gardens here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where handmade sweaters etc . of Nepalese artisans are found .
There is also arrangement for going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is the only city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens but the movement of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots in Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of forest waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to visit Darjeeling in the shadow of cold , but the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling bound me with ourselves .
My recent journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not abroad nor outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes travels towards itself , sometimes some special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people go stretching .
The place I am going to talk is just about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place has come there , it has actually turned into a jungle .
Not only for those who go there , but also for those who live there .
In my ears , my guide , Ram Babu , sings the words of Meena , We could not even think that we could live in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff belongs to this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many locals did not even get the job in the Heritage Hotel .
Ram Babu , a resident of Ajabgarh , used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal style Aman Bagh .
He has driven his own speech into a new color .
Sahiba ' is an idea of Aman Bagh .
There no one calls you from English .
Aman Bagh is actually a tourist place with peacefulness and comfortable facilities .
That garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces you to the nearby area .
How many of the people who spend holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have toured Bhangarh of the ghosts  Why should I go away , some of the people of Jaipur would probably have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi called me there from Tahedil but I could not go .
It is a different thing that he himself had gone astray and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there on the feast of my foreign guests , it seemed that those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden saved from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stay for hunting .
It was constructed in nineteen , hundred twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Bagh , surrounded by hills and in the shadow of dense trees , charms you .
As soon as you come in , the way you are welcomed , it seems as if attention has been given to divine peace here .
The mantra of Mangalachar is a living pronounced as well as tied a mauli in the wrist .
We had reached the slope in the evening and intended to set up a round of gardens .
My host , Jackie , who was a marvellous man , suddenly said , It ' s interesting .
All are motivated by castles and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is artistic on new , no wonder that Aman Bagh has recently received awards .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all , a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey of Bhangarh .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the sunlight was spreading gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain , but for the first time , we saw tobacco cultivation .
For Jeki , such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
These are millions of dollars invaluable moments .
The way of saying goodbye to Aman Bagh was also traditional , he gave us away by feeding jaggery and curd .
Now it came to know why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show tribe life .
Is it true .
Of course , this is not one in many states and tourists also show a lot of interest in them .
These tours are usually prepared for time from four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , food etc .
This way there is an attempt to explore such places where there has not been much development and where time has not been specially affected on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this where old tourist sites etc are also present .
Besides , attention is also given to serving the triditional cosine .
In fact , the purpose of such a tour is to make tourists comfortably with the ways and traditions of living in that place .
Although it looks a little difficult in thinking , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
Despite being with a lot of people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favourite book a lot of time without distortion .
Yes , it is sure that along with giving a lot of time for less expenditure and comfort , these tours definitely keep the demand of patience with you .
This is the reason that for enjoying them it is important to take care of some things , especially when you are watching a foreign destination through bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking tickets .
If students , senior people of military , children etc get discount on them , then there is an arrangement of relaxation for two people also .
By the way , it is cheap to buy tickets in advance , so in the last moments it is better to plan bus tour that planning should be done a little before .
Two they know about round trips instead of tickets .
They are cheaper .
Rules regarding baggage are very hard , so inquire about the size and weight of the goods .
It may not be that you have to leave some of your goods on the terminal or have to pay extra fees .
Also know the rules of compensation of insurance or losses from the tour company .
Carry on bags are right , take it .
Because they get fit in the rack over the seat .
Keep in mind that while changing the bus during the tour the responsibility of the goods will be yourself .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the Biji season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will have a good seat option .
While selecting the seat keep in mind the confirt .
If there are more shocks on the previous seat , then there is no confirmable reading on the next seats .
If you have to go to Lu repeatedly , then take a seat on the corner and if you do not like to be too distorted then the window seat will be better for you .
Now it ' s a clever thing .
If both of you are in the clutches then sit on the corner seat and keep your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing while sucking the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identification with bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get a lot of important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus all are called to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because if it is lost , the buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time , you can get a new passenger in your place and you have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
It is said that if Rome was not seen in Europe , then nothing was seen .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .
The capital of Italy Rome is among those old cities of the world from where civilizations have developed .
This is the reason why its impression is seen on Western Civilization .
Rome , situated on Taibar river , is a pilgrimage for the followers of Roman Catholic religion , because the main residence of this religion ' Pope ' is in Rome itself .
The ancient Rome was settled on seven hills .
In the fourth century a wall , Sarvial Wall was built around it .
The ruins of this can be seen even today around Rome .
Rome is famous all over the world for ancient buildings and their remains .
This city with luxurious palace , grand church , beautiful fountains , domes and museums keeps the magic of charming you at first sight .

Large shops , church and palaces made here put four moons in the grandeur of this road .
It is worth mentioning that this road is the main road of Rome .
This unique building is built on ' Capitoline Hill ' and is situated at a very height .
The stairs of climbing it were built by famous sculptor Michael Angelo in 1536 .
In front of the capitoline there is a brass statue of Emperor Marx Orelius riding on the horse , who ruled Rome till 160 - 180 AD .
This magnificent idol will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on the capitoline is also a different identity of this building .
A church , museum and ancient temples are also built in ' Capitaline Complex ' .
The symbol of Rome is colosium .
This huge akhara was built in 80 AD and 50 thousand viewers could sit together here .
In colosium the gladiator i . . swordmen used to show their duties .
They used to compete not only with each other but also with wild animals .
These warriors , whether from other swords or animals , continued until one of the fighters died .
There were many forums in ancient Romes .
Let ' s say that places of mixing are called Forum in Rome .
Here all the social , religious , economic , political and political activities of the city were carried out .
Among them the most famous forum was Romanam and the remains of the palaces , temples and pillars are present even today .
Of course on seeing them the guess of the grandeur of ancient Rome becomes very good .
Pathian . This wonderful ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
There is an open space of 30 feet in the middle of its huge dome .
Due to this place devotees felt like this , as if their prayers were reaching to the gods directly .
The idols of gods and goddesses are made all around inside the temple .
However , in 601 AD this temple was made a church .
Although there are many gardens and gardens in Rome , but Vila Borgis is unparalleled .
Therefore do not forget to see it on going to Rome .
Definitely go to the museum made here also because on missing it you will lose the opportunity to get rid of the best sculpture .
The idols built here are unique and it seems so alive that as if they will speak now .
Here a idol lying on the bed of the sister of Napolian First , Paulin , who was married in the Borgis royal family , looks so alive that you will not be able to stay without seeing it alone at some moments .
The special attraction of Rome is its fountains .
There are approximately 300 buildings in which magnificent fountains are made .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trevie Fountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come back to Rome then he should put it in a coin fountain with this desire .
It is believed that by doing this this desire is definitely fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city will not be fulfilled till you can see ' Vatican City ' .
Since the sixth century this place has been the residence of the highest religious chief ' Pope ' of the followers of Roman Catholic religion .
Although it is in Rome itself , it has been given the status of an independent city since 1926 .
Look at the famous St . Peter Church of Vatican City , St . Peter Square , Fountains , Museum etc .
Of course they will show you the view of a different world and will always give you a memorable experience .

Neighbouring state of Maharashtra Goa is consistent with its beautiful sea shores and various water sports which is like a heaven for tourists where simplicity of the grandeur of ancient times gets to see from the tour of ancient churches .
Situated in the capital of Goa Panjim , Jinjar Hotel makes this journey of the western coast excellent .
Cycling , rever cruise , cool sea winds and world famous Goan cuisines on the roads of Goa are the best options to spend comfortable days here .
If you look at today 's date then for Maldives the cheapest return fare from Delhi is of 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Male then still you can get hotels in some less rent but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December , Lui Cruise from Kochi started India ' s only cruise for Maldives and Colombo .
Loui Cruise is a European company and is very popular in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Louis Cruise has now postponed his services , but he is expected to start again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a cruise of three days at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per person at the ship of Lui Cruise M . . Aquamarin .
That is for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are old then children below 15 years of age are absolutely free .
And what you want .
The fare of cruise includes tea and breakfast , food .
The entertainment of every time is together .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainments , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly one plane will stand in front of you then you will feel to be a toy .
But this twin overplane of 12 - 15 seats is excellent in an undisputed way to roam around Archipelego -LRB- island group -RRB- like Maldives .
On the surface of water running like a speed boat when it gets up in the air , it does not know .
In the entire flight you do not have the experience of flights of common airplanes .
Every time your eyes remain strong below the window - in the blue water of different sheds of Maldives watching the resort islands and Koral islands .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two plane companies in Maldives .
Trace is one of the Maldives who has twenty C planes .
If you want then you can roam around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or then the entire plane can hire for the satisfaction of your day long -LRB- provided the pocket is deep -RRB- .
By the way if you go beyond the Male Island to any island then the journey of the sea plane will be necessary because this is the means of journey between different islands .
And that ' s a journey that ' s going to end , perhaps never .
C plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Mavilevaru in the north -RRB- in islands of Maldives .
We were in the capital ' s largest antique and sovanier shop in Ahmedi Bazar of Male .
All the cellsmen were listening very carefully to the speech given by the President Mohammad Nashid of Maldives in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before .
If I say honestly then I did not see any Hindustani listening to the speeches of the Presidents or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But , when there was a question of the existence of an unprecedented creation of this earth , it was so serious .
In October , many people may have considered the meeting inside the water by the Maldives cabinet , but the Maldives feels that if the nature ' s anger snatchs it from us , the world will become very poor .
Something like this is special in the beauty there .
In that small country as if it is not so beautiful .
Returning towards Jetty to go back from that tour of the market to its cruise , when the eyes went in the water of the sea along with the barbarous road then it was felt that the people here understand the price of this beauty to what extent .
The water was so clear that the fish swimming in the depth of several meters below the lamppost was seen with all its colors .
It was a part of the ocean which was very close to the city .
If you can see some centimetres in the sea or river water adjacent to any city of India then you will find yourself happy .
While returning to MV Aquamarin , he was roaming around for two hours in the evening spending in the garland .
Coral reef -LRB- Muga rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even on the stones on the graves you will get muga rocks .
Shortly before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not sure that we were ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country , there was no security worker till far .
With fun we were dragging photographs of gardens and verandah just fifty metres away from the door of his bungalow .
Can you think of a leader ' s house in India
It was also known that President sometimes crossing the roads on foot two blocks reach their office ahead .
Everything was about Maldives .
That is why I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
It was a fault that the day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the base of Trace Maldives while roaming around the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near the male , we immediately recognized the C plane passing through the top .
The pictures that had seen .
But then it was not supposed that the next day it would get an opportunity to ride .
We were about to go to Rangali Island , one hundred five kilometres away from the C plane of Traus Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying at a height of about a thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
He was a breathing flight with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Conrad resort of Hilton Hotels on Rangali Island it felt as if we had reached another world .
In a world that had no external world .
There was no such thing that it was difficult to meet the beauty or luxury outside there .
Tour on Konrad can also be on foot or with a battery driven car .
While going from Jetty to the main island the view of water life on both sides of the bridge was amazing .
Now we could not even make ourselves easy from the nature of the surroundings , that we reached such a place , was imaginable .
While descending into the water of the sea several metres below the stairs we reached a glass room which was inside the water .
The room was actually a dining room .
On all sides we could see humans while diving small - big fish , corals , snorkelling and scuba of unique types .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated tables there was very thrilling in itself .
On coming to this island from Male to Sea Plane the rent for seeing it and underwater lunch is 47 thousand rupees for a man .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to excuse our passports in water .
But he knew it was not possible .
Heavy heart returned with this hope that sometimes , at some point the fate would definitely come here .
For many days it was planning to go out of Delhi but it was not possible because of the busy work .
Since childhood there was a fond of wild life then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
This was the second bike tour after bikeing from Khardungla near Pegong Lake in Ladakh in 2006 .
We left for Jim Carbet from Delhi on the morning of December 27 , but the fog that came out of the jeopardy roamed our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Fog from above and bad roads in front .
Many times it felt that now it fell .
Somehow reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o ' clock .
Carbet Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near the park , which we had already booked .
There was no special programme on that day , despite the cold , we went to the shores of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we left the Carbet Museum , which was near Dhangari Gate 2 kms very difficult .
From there we went down to roam Ramnagar .
It was late in the evening .
The lion roaming around in the jungle had come out of Delhi , then I would definitely see the lion in dreaming all night .
In the midst of the depths of the night , I suddenly heard a tremendous shock , and after that the dogs that started screaming did not stop for two hours .
So the suggestion of roaming black and carbot falls came first .
Kaladungi is thirty kilometres away while Carbet Fall falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kaladhungi , where some important things related to his personal life have been kept .
Returning and returning at twelve o'clock .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled in this village .
On reaching the resort the safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that he has arranged siteing in the number one site Bijarani there .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more Grassland and Tigers come on the same side to avoid cold during this time .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half hundred rupees for rotating four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tuskers of elephants , who had long teeth .
I photographed a lot .
In the meanwhile the guide started tracking the tiger .
The guide said that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of which have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was sad because the Tiger did not see .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind , the Tiger ' s fitur was riding .
Then I remembered Haldwani ' s old friend .
I called him like this .
I told him that I ' m coming to Carbet .
He asked whether the Tiger was seen or not .
Her words were kissed like arrows .
I gradually said , No .
There was no permission to carry a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take the safari inside .
