The tourism industry which is considered to be the main foundation of the magnificence of Rajasthan is passing through these two widespread distances .
Due to the increasing risks in world depression and South Asia the business of tourism has been deepened .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan which are counted in the major states of the country has been recorded in these days special deficiency .
The latest figures released recently by the Rajasthan government tells that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has come down more than 10 percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to statistics in the number of foreign tourists 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists has decreased 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 AD in Rajasthan a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 746 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 35 thousand tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 25558691 countrymen and 1073414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the field of tourism are very worried about this situation .
Instructor of Rajputa Holde Macrus Sanjay Kushik says that the accidents of world depression and mischief have affected the profession of tourism in a bad way .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we can not even create strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decrease of 3 . percent in comparison to the last year .
21  of the foreign tourists coming to India tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism the present year has become excellent for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing has happened .
Desert , havelis , forts , buffaloes , jungles , all are the same old for pulling tourists .
In the field of tourism the talk of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism , all the governments increase but what has not been done on this side .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
At the same time , along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years the promises of zona and jealousy have also marked the importance of this state at the international level .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in the state years ago but it remained confined to papers only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTC -RRB- .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to promote the basic infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 AD .
This corporation provides the facilities of setting up , food , movement , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are total 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 metals , eight cafeteria , three dharamshalas , one movement unity and two train palace on - wheels and Royal Rajasthan on - wheels have also been made thin for many years .
In the year 2008 - 2009 the Ghata of RTDC was 185 lakh , which is expected to be 632 lakh in the year 2009 - 2010 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years 40 percent rooms of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also reaching it a big ghat .
Among them are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There is no attraction of tourists towards this rail .
Despite reducing the taxis also do not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a deficiency in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Mela .
In the year 2007 to 2008 in this fair in the tourist villages built by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists stayed , this year this number was reduced to 217 .
In the middle of all this it is worth patience for RTDC that there has been no dearth in the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Raji rail cart .
This train is continuously reaching the benefits .
Last year the RTDC benefited from this rail of 9 . crore rupees .
In the field of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lakes of concern in the field of tourism .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .

Looking at the sight of the left hand falls on the light redness emerging in the sky at the peak in the middle of the mountain ranges covered with snow .
A good specialty in air is cold .
Along with the cooling cooling in the air there is also a feeling of moisture .
The layer of baked palanquin is seen on the floor of wood by the sound of raw raw material below feet .
There is moisture in the air and there is nothing more visible because of the bright shade of the sun before sunrise .
Views remain on the redness of the east .
There is a heart of sitting on the bench lying in balcony .
On applying the hand the smooth layer of the palanquin gets stuck with the sound of a slightly crushing and the hands get separated from the feeling of coolness .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village settled amidst these mountains buried with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third residence in Swiss .
Prior to this maximum time spent around Geneva or it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both sides of the thin bul Khati river is spread very high on light slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland , the valley of Roan -LRB- Hone -RRB- , on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .

From there the lake again moves towards the west by forming the river .
On the right side there are mountain ranges of dust , sky touching -LRB- Alps -RRB- across the lake .
Crossing the city from a beautiful city named Leuk -LRB- Deuk -RRB- we leave this highway from the left side , come on the hilly path towards the north .
Due to the slope of the mountain being towards the south the sun of the evening is giving full sunshine to the whole corner .
In comparison to the valley the amount of snow is less here , almost not equal .
As they move towards height , the amount of snow starts increasing .
There is no special cold in the air because of the clean sky and shining sun on both sides of the road despite being a good snow frozen .
The journey of about 20 kms on this roaming hilly road reaches a small village named Thal -LRB- Hel -RRB- by spending half an hour .
There are many storied bungalows made of wood completely with shade - slope roof .
In the basement made of cement concrete of this bungalow of three storeys there are rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , laundry along with parking of vehicles .
Wildlife is famous for cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making the alcohol of grapes .
Grapes are cultivated on the 37 -LRB- ground part of the whole cantonment -RRB- .
In the villages settled on both sides of the Roon valley gardens of grapes provide a unique gift to the beauty there .
Going to the gardens of grapes -LRB- winards -RRB- , taking them to the village there is an incomplete part of the tourist beauty here .
There is a very big museum of ingori alcohol in a 12th century built in a small town named Agel , which has to be done by foreign tourists first to see .
Once again we pass through the middle of the jungle frozen with Davanal .
Until three-four kilometres the mind becomes even more deteriorated by the questions of all the children .
Suddenly dramatic and charming changes come from the scene on a turn .
Right in front , on the slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are doing skiing -LRB- skiing -RRB- in the snow on the slopes of the village .
The dense forest of Deodar is spread from skiing slope to the peak of upper mountain .
Ghanghar snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the town are shining due to the direct sun rays .
In five minutes we reach Us village .
Here also the same fate has been shadowed .
On all four sides from the peak of the mountain to the valley is the rule of dust snow .
Inside the next five minutes we reach the middle of this town on a big round square .
The name of the town is Leukarbad -LRB- Deukerbad -RRB- .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Leukarbad is about 1500 .

It was told in Darjeeling that the taxis of surf Sikkim can be done in Sikkim , therefore checking is not done .
The journey is going on , the state is second , but the mountain is the same , the trees are the same , the surprising airways are the same .
The moisture on the whole body is the same .
During the rainy season Surmai is the same .
As soon as the program of Darjeeling journey was picked up , the first decision was taken to take a glimpse of Kurseong .
Kurseong is a small city of Darjeeling .
Filled with tea gardens , full of sunshine forests .
Famous for production of high tea .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then in the beginning only tea gardens welcome the mosquitoes awake towards themselves .
Between tea gardens passing through the road enjoys heart in the first time itself .
On one side the green mountain filled with forests , on the other side deep green treasure .
Sometimes forests and sometimes tea gardens were seen here .
On the four sides there was the reign of greenery .
Once again I was grown , look at these natural jungles or planted tea plants by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
As beautiful forest was Utna itself , the gardens of tea spread till a beautiful distance .
If you look at the roads of the roads then the situation looks unique .
The walk of the snake was going narrow and narrow ways .
The time was also passing .
If it was not passing , then forest and tea gardens .
Sometimes small towns were seen .
A mountainous house - houses etc . were seen very densely from a distance .
This was Karsang .
After staying here at a place we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
After taking a vehicle we got out on the roaming of Cursing .
First of all deer parks .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles on the four sides .
Upper was climbing i . . to reach Deer Park the vehicle had to leave very low .
Despite being luxurious with the beauty of Kurseong even now developed as a tourist spot has not been found to be famous .
Although the city is quite high and clean .
Despite being silent the way was giving us the pleasure of climbing the way between the redness and sunshine trees to reach the deer park surrounded by forests .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that the British used to know that during age lovers used to kiss from here .
At present , this is decorated with a park and restaurant .
There is a stair-like dome here , on seeing the whole of the city from its height a beautiful view comes in front .
In nearby tea gardens women were busy breaking the tea - leaves running hands with a lot of speed on the back .
There is a museum outside Kurseong city , but that day we could not go there , because it was more important to roam the pleasant atmosphere of tea gardens .
The next day it was decided to roam Darjeeling .
It was a charming experience in itself , but there was a lot of concern that if it was raining then how would we roam
But it was very interesting that after reaching the rock garden we roamed enjoying the sports sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The road to reach here is even more charming than that .
On moving a little and down from here Ghera Gangamya was found from the mountains .
The magnificence of waterfalls is worth seeing here amidst rocks .
In the rock garden we found that there are waterfalls in the government of rocks and rocks then the luxury of waterfalls in Gangamaya is decorated with stones the world .
Both of these places are situated very below the hills of Darjeeling .
After lifting up on the basis of the vehicle we saw Batsia Loop in Darjeeling .
From here one can see the whole hill and city of Darjeeling with the help of Durbin .
The nature of the weather was still straight .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , from where to decreasing we came and shivered .
In the evening there was a program of walking and shopping on the Mall Road .
In the tour of Darjeeling Toy Trains implant Char Chand in the journey .
The journey of tour from Darjeeling to Darjeeling and from Dham to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
There is a little rest in boating and gardens in Marik lake here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where sweaters etc . made of hand of Nepali artisans are found .
There is also the facility of going to Kalmpung from Darjeeling city .
Although Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its form is different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but also the arrival of forests and waterfalls is going .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Lava and Lole village , which is filled with forest waterfalls .
But in deficiency of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
If we had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to Darjeeling in winters , then the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling took me from ourselves .
My recent journey was very interesting and amazing .
This journey was not of the country nor of the outside of Rajasthan but of very close proximity to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting topic in itself , in which sometimes travels towards itself , sometimes some special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like rose city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come to draw .
The place where I am going to talk about is that bus has been prepared about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation this place has come there , it has actually managed in the jungle .
Not only for the people going there but also for the people living there .
In my ears my guides embrace the words of Rambabumina , before this we could not even think that we can stay in the forest like this .
50 percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work in the heritage hotel .
Rambabu used to work in Jaipur before this and now in the magnificent peace garden of this unique royal style .
He has driven himself to speak in a new color .
Prince is the style of peace garden .
There nobody calls you English .
Peace garden is a tourist spot of peace , peace and all Sikh facilities .
The history of this garden is also its history and the biggest thing is that it also makes you familiar with the area nearby .
How many of the people who spend holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have roamed Bhangad of Bhoots  Why should it be far away , some of the people of Jaipur would probably have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of peace garden big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night as well when the Prime Minister had called me from the heart there but I did not go .
This thing is different that he himself had reached Mangadh by cutting off the road .
This time suddenly I reached there on the invitation of my foreign guests , it felt that those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time , they should definitely go to peace garden .
This garden is the only garden saved from these seven gardens where the king of Alor used to hunt .
Its construction was done in Ayurveda .
Its old wall is a witness of those days .
The first glimpse of peace garden in the shade of mountains surrounded and dense trees draws you .
As soon as you come inside the way in which you are welcomed , it feels that a lot of attention has been paid here on spiritual peace .
Along with tying the root in Kalai the life of Mangalacharya mantra is done .
We had reached the evening slope and we decided to set up a circular garden .
My guest Jaykey who is a decoration specialist , suddenly speaking this is interesting .
All havelis and palaces are affected .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . No wonder that Peace Bagh has got a prize recently .
The manager decided our program in the morning .
First of all roaming on foot with Rambabu and then the journey of the jeep of Bhangad .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Kingdomgarh on which gradually the sunlight was spreading .
Seeing the dry lake in which farmers were harvesting .
This year the rains did not occur but the first time the cultivation of tobacco was seen .
For J . . such a glimpse of the life of the village was a unique experience .
After this we reached Bhanggarh from jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable bridge of million dollars .
The method of saying the illusion of peace garden is also traditional thagad and curd they taught us .
Now I came to know why tourist comes here by spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show tribe life .
Is this right
Friends and this happens not one but in many states and tourist also show special interest in them .
These tours are generally prepared for time from four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
Staying there , food etc . are also included in it .
This way efforts are made to explore such places , where there has not been much development and where there has not been any special effect on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this where old tourist sites etc are also present .
Besides this attention is also given only on doing triditional cosine .
In fact the aim of such a tour is to make tourists rose by the way of living and traditions of this place .
Although it feels a little difficult in thinking , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
Despite being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time while distributing .
Yes , it is definitely so much that along with giving a lot of less expensive and peaceful time these tours definitely enjoy the courage of you .
This is the reason that to enjoy them it is important to take care of some things , especially when you are watching any foreign destination bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking the ticket .
If students , senior people of military , children etc get discount on them , then there is an arrangement for two people also .
However , it is cheap to buy tickets in Adwans , therefore it is better to plan bus tour in the last bridges that planning should be done a little before .
Instead of To Wee Ticket know about Round Trop .
It is comfortable .
Regulations taking bags are very hard , therefore ask about the size and weight of the goods .
It should not be such anywhere that you have to leave some goods on terminal or have to pay a different fee .
Also know the law of insurance or compensation of loss from tour company .
Kerry on bags are right , walk with it .
Because it gets cured in the rake above the seat .
Keep in mind this thing also that while changing during the tour the responsibility of the goods will be yourself .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the mixed season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will have such a good seat choice with you .
While selecting the seat keep in mind comfortable .
If there will be more shocks on the previous seat , then on the seats of the ahead there is no comfort .
If you have to go back again and again , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be more troubled , then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now there is a talk of walking .
If you are in the forefront of both the hands then first sit on the corner seat and keep your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus , then planning will be successful .
If there is convenience of vasuram in the bus , then keep in mind this thing while choosing the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make the identification of bus drive and conditioner .
This way you will get a lot of necessary information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus everyone is called to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because the buses do not take the responsibility of it on getting lost .
Wherever the bus stop , come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then you can get a new traveller at your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
It is said that if I have not seen rooms in Europe then nothing has been seen .
The capital of Italy is Rome ancient city of Europe and is famous for all its things .
The capital Rome of Italy is among those old cities of the world from where civilizations have been developed .
This is the reason that its impression is seen on western swelling .
Rome settled on Taiber river is a sacred place for the followers of Romanketholic religion , because the residence of the great Pop of this religion is in Rome itself .
The ancient room was settled on seven hills .
In the fourth century on all four sides of it a wall , surveillance was built .
The ruins of this can be seen even today nearby Rome .
Rome is famous all over the world for ancient buildings and their remains .
The magnificent palace , magnificent church , beautiful fountains , domes and museums keep you a magic of charming in the first sight .
This huge and unparalleled building of white marble was started in 1885 by the ruler of Italy Victim Valdom and this was completed in 1911 .
In front of it a statue riding on the horse of Sultan Eminoyal has been built , which took twenty years in building .
Here in the first World Jong the martyrs of the martyrs were buried .
The carvings of this memorial and the signs of victory made on it are worth seeing .
There is also a museum here .
If you are interested in art works , then definitely see it .
Along with the memorial not only of Rome but also the famous and grand chowk of Italy is ' Pija Venzia ' .
Built in the middle of Rome this chowk is famous as Vijay Chauk of Delhi .
Besides this  Pyatsadi Spagana ' is also very popular in the tourists and where people come to meet each other in the evening .
After enjoying the  Pijaonizia ' you must also go to the famous road of Rome i . . Viadilkursu ' .
Large shops made here , church and palaces put Charchand in the magnificent way of this road .
It is thought that this is the road route of Rome .
This unparalleled building is built on Capotalian Hill and is located at a height .
Micle Angelo had built the stairs of climbing on it in 1536 .
The idol of Sultan Markes and Yales brass riding on the horse in front of Capetroline , which had ruled on Rome till 160 - 180 AD .
This magnificent idol will give you amazing .
Besides this the tower built on the captoline is also a different identity of this building .
A church museum and ancient temples are also built in Capetoline Complex .
The symptom of Rome is colosium .
The construction of this huge akhara was done in 80 AD and 50 thousand viewers could sit together .
In Kalosim the guideer i . . Talbaz used to show his crazyness .
They used to compete not only among themselves but also with wild animals .
These fights that give heart torture , whether it is from other swords or from animals , till then one of the fighters did not die .
A lot of forums were held in ancient rooms .
Let 's say that places of getting burnt are called forum in Rome .
Here all the social , religious , economic , political activities of the city used to be done .
Among them the most famous forum was Romanum and at that place even today the remains of royal palaces , temples and pillars are present .
On seeing them the estimation of the magnificence of ancient rooms becomes alright .
Pethyan : This unique ancient temple was built in 27 AD .
There is an open place of 30 feet in the middle of its huge dome .
Because of this place devotees felt like this , as if their worships are reaching the goddesses directly .
Inside the temple idols of goddesses are made all around .
However , in 601 AD this temple was made a church .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Valaburgus is unique .
Therefore do not forget to see it on going to the room .
Definitely go to the museum built here , because on touching it you will give the opportunity to get rid of the best art gallery .
The idols made here are unparalleled and so many creatures seem to be as if they still speak .
Here the sister of Napolenaool Poleon , whose marriage was done in the Borge royal family , a idol lying on the plunge looks so alive that you will not be able to see it a piece of a moment .
The special attraction of Rome is in its fountains .
There are approximately 300 buildings here , in which magnificent fountains are made .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trivi Pountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come back to Rome then he should put it in a single fountain with his wish .
It is believed that by doing this this desire is definitely fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city will not be fulfilled until you can see ' Vetkan City ' .
From the sixth century this place has been the residence of the most religious people of Roman Catholic religion according to the acceptance of ' Pope ' .
Although this is in the room itself , but since 1926 it was given the status of a free city .
Definitely see the famous St . Patter Church , St . Patter Square , Fountains , Museum etc . of Vietnam City .
Undoubtedly this will show you a different view of the world and will give you an experience of always remembering .

The journey of Pune is incomplete without seeing the famous Ushva Ashram of Shaniwarwara and Lord Jnesh living in the palace of Peshwa rulers .
There are two hotels of Jinjar in Pune , Jopmpari and Vikad .
In the middle of the Pumpry industrial area and situated on the Pune Bangalore highway the two hotels of Janjar built at the place named Vikad are all the latest facilities .
The neighbouring state of Maharashtra is lased with its beautiful sea shores and different water sports which is like a heaven for tourists where the glory of ancient times gets a lot of sight from the tour of ancient churches .
Located in Pinji the capital of Goa , Janjar Hotel makes this journey of the western coast very excellent .
On the roads of Goa , Cycling , Rever Cross , Cold Sea winds and the enjoyment of world famous Goon foods is the best option to spend comfortable days here .
If you see in today 's history then for Maldives the cheapest person to return to Delhi is of 28 thousand rupees .
After this if you stay in Male then hotels can be found in some less rent but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then jeb will be small .
Cecroses prove to be beneficial here .

And if there are two elders then children of less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
And what should be done .
In the fare of cruise tea , breakfast , food are included .
I am with the entertainment of every time .
Reaching the capital Male you can enjoy entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pockets - from sepline riding to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly a sepline will be standing in front of you then you will feel like playing .
But with 12 - 15 seats this is excellent for roaming around the Town Treplin Maldives like Orchipelego -LRB- Progressive Jayar -RRB- .
On the level of water while running like a speed boat it gets up in the air , it does not know .
In Puri flight you do not have the estimation of flights of normal airplanes .
Every time your sights keep looking at the windows - the blue water of different Sheds of Maldives watching the islands and Koral islands .
Everything looks clear .
There are only two sepline companies in Maldives .
Trans-Maldevian is one of them which has 20 seplines .
If you want then you can roam around a thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour -LRB- if you want then you can take the entire sepulchre for the entertainment of your whole day -RRB- -LRB- pocket is deep -RRB- .
If you go to any island away from Male Island then the journey of Seleen will be necessary because this is the source of journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey of which the mind of ending may never do you .
From 12 k . . to 183 k . . -LRB- best in Mavelivara -RRB- journey takes place in islands of Maldives .
We were in the capital ' s largest Antic and Shuvaneer shop in the Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All the Cellsman Maldives were listening to the speech given by the President Mohammad Nashed a day before in Copenhagen in Ajmanbroy Almighty Fazha .
With honesty I did not see any Indian listening to the speech of the President or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a question of the existence of a rare creation of this land , then such a seriousness was necessary .
Many people may have understood the sitting inside the water through the cabinet of Maldives in October , but it seems that if the natural calamity takes it from us then how poor the world will be .
This is something special in the beauty there .
In this small country as if so much beauty is not absorbed .
To go back to his cruise back from this tour of the market , when eyes suddenly went into the water of the sea walking along the road then it was felt that the people here understand the price of this beauty to the extent .
The water was so clear that swimming fishes were seen with all their colors in many metres deep below the lymphost light .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
If you can see some centimetres in the water of sea or river connected to any city of India then you will be able to get yourself lucky .
While returning to M . . . the evening spent in Malay was roaming in mind for two hours .
Coural Rif -LRB- Monga Chatans -RRB- is the life here .
Until here you will also get fountains on the stones laid on the tombs .
We were standing outside their official residence for some time before listening to the speech of President Nashad .
It was not sure that we were not a security worker far away from the residence of the highest personality of any country .
With enjoyment we were pulling the gardens and exports only 50 metres away by enhancing the hands inside the gate of its bungalow .
Can you think about the house of any other guide of India
It was also known that the President sometimes crossing the road on foot reaches his office two blocks ahead .
Every thing about Maldives was surprising .
That is why I was waiting for the next day unconsciously .
It was Allahabad that it was going to be a special day .
In the morning one boat from Cruise brought us to Airport Island .
From there we reached Trans Maldives by cutting the chakra of the runway .
Last evening when Cross Male was reaching near then we immediately identified the syphilins passing from above .
Such pictures which were seen , of it .
But then there was no room that the next day there would be a chance of riding .
We were going to go to Rangali Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the syphilis of Trans-Maldevian .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and Koral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea flying seas till a height of approximately one thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a romantic and emotional flight to breathe .
But on the Rangali Islands we started reaching the Corridor Resort of Hilton Hotels as if we had reached any other world .
In such a world , whose external identity was not from any world .
There was no such way that the beauty like there was difficult to meet outside .
Travelling can also be done on Konrad on foot or from the vehicle running from the battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the special island was unique .
Now we could not even take care of ourselves with the nature of the surroundings , that such a place had reached , was unsuccessful .
While descending down several metres from the stairs in the water of the sea we reached such a glass room which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all sides we could see small variety of fishes , corals , snorekling and scuba diving humans .
The thought of eating while sitting on the decorated tables there was very surprising in itself .
On coming to this island from Male to Sepline it is a rent of 47 thousand rupees for one person to see it and interwater lunch .
There was no mind to return from there .
We were ready to flow in our passport water .
But they knew , it was not possible .
With heavy mind we returned with this expectation that sometimes , sometimes we will definitely come here .
From many days the plan to go out of Delhi was being made but due to the busyness of work it was not possible .
If there was a fun of wildlife from childhood then why did not you think that this time jammer beat should be done .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after biking till Tagang lake ahead of Khardungungla near Ladakh .
In the morning of 27 December we departed from Delhi to Jim Corbett , but the excitement which came out of jealousy , the buffalo drowned our speed .
The journey between Gajraula from Hapur was really tired .
Damage road from Upper to Khira and in front of them .
Many times it felt that now it fell .
In some way reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Welcome we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our Resort Park was in Dhakili , whose booking we had done beforehand .
This day there was no special program but we went to roam on the banks of Kosi even before getting cold .
After spending two - three hours there we left the Corbett Museum , which was near Dhangadi Gate 2 kilometres away from difficulty .
From there we went down to Ramnagar roaming .
Returning late in the evening .
If the lion roaming open in the jungle had come out from Delhi then it would definitely be seen that the lion kept looking at me all night in dreams .
In the midst of the depths of the night suddenly I heard a loud noise and after that when the dogs started blossoming then they did not stop for two hours .
Therefore first advice came to be taken to roam Kaladhangi and Corbett Fall .
Kaladhungi is 30 kilometres away while Corbett Fall falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kaladhongi , where some important things related to their life have been kept .
Returning , 12 and a half o'clock .
Kaladhangi is an extremely beautiful place , jam Corbett was settled in this village .
On reaching the resort the safari jupsi was enjoying us .
It has been told that he has made a arrangement of sighting in the number one site Bajrani there .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more grassland and Tigers come towards this direction to escape from cold during this time .
On reaching Bajrani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half rupees for roaming around four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we had two tied elephants , whose long teeth were .
I jamkar photography .
This beach guide started trekking Tiger .
Guide told that there are almost 150 tigers in the park , out of which some have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but due to lack of vision of Tiger it was an exhibition .
Third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain there was a fountain ride of Tiger .
That is why Muzhe Haldwani remembered his old friend .
I put such a phone .
I told him that I had come to carbot .
He did not see the Tiger asking .
Its words were kissed like swimming .
I said gradually , not .
In the park there was no permission to take Baik Baik .
Somebody advised us to take a ride inside.
