The tourism department considered to be the main foundation of the economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad governance at this time .
Increasing terrible accidents in the Vishwik Mandir and South Asia there is a huge obstacle in the tourism industry .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in combination with the major countries of the country is particularly less in these days .
The new figures made by the Rajasthan government in recent times have been estimated that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 was less than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
On getting connected the number of tourists of the country decreased by 98 . percent and the number of foreign tourists decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came together in Rajasthan , out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 are included in the country and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists , whereas between 2009 two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand and 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 countries and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with the tourism region think about this situation very well .
Sanjay Kaushik , the editor of Rajputana Holiday Mekers , said that the horrific incidents like Vaishik Mandir affect the tourism industry in a bad way .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we do not develop the strength and basic structure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Most of the foreign tourists coming to India travellers come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The attention of tourism is increasing throughout the year towards Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that the number of travellers decreased in Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism nothing is new .
Desert , big palaces , forts , wells , forests all are old , for surprising travellers .
In the tourist spot for the work of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism all the governments get down and climbed , but in this direction nothing is done .
Facilities of tourists coming to Rajasthan are available very little .
At the same time foreigners along with women tourist in Rajasthan in recent times and in the rage events the picture of this country has been engraved at the international level .
Years before the government of Rajasthan the tourism department got disturbed in the country but it remained narrow in newspapers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of the Rajasthan government in terms of tourism .
With the aim of developing tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic structure of tourism the Rajasthan government established RTDC in 1979 .
The facility of stay , food , pockets , boating etc . is available for this corporation .
The houses of this corporation are 75 units .
Out of these 39 hotels , 22 hotels , 8 kaphatiria , three lanes , one pocket alone and two train palaces on hills , Royal Rajasthan on hills , but the condition of this pocket office has been deteriorating for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 is 185 lakh and next year it will be 63 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this hospital is that in the last five years the rooms of its hotels are not filled with 40 square metres .
Along with the hotels the other units of the city also cause huge loss to it .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Hills .
Travellers do not have any attraction to this train .
Because of less rent it does not attract tourists .
In such a situation the favour of the travellers is also seen to be less on the Pushkar Mela .
In 2007 - 08 this fair was organised by RTDC in the tourist village there 398 foreign tourists stayed and this year the number of tourists was reduced to 217 .
The joyful thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth of the attraction of the travellers of Palace on Hills and Shahi train .
This train continues to benefit .
Last year RTDC got a profit of nine crore rupees from this train .

While passing through the road between tea gardens the heart charms for the first time , is one of the places which are protected in the form of wealth .
On one side the green mountain full of jungles on the other side is a dense green gate .
If there is forest in the middle then tea gardens can be seen in the middle .
There is a kingdom of greenery all around .
Once I was conscious of these natural jungles or tea plants drowned by humans .
Both attract themselves .
The more beautiful forests the more beautiful the tea garden is spread .
If the eyes go on the roads of the road then the creation marvellously marvellous .
In the shape of snakes we crossed the narrow and circular path .
Time also passes .
Forests and tea gardens are not finished .
Sometimes small dresses are seen .
One can see a lot of concentration by houses and buildings on a mountain from a distance .
This is Carsyang .
After staying here at one place we prepared a program of roaming throughout the day .
That is , taking a train you can go to Karsiyang .
First of all Deer Park.
A small garden is surrounded by wide jungles all around .
To climb up , to reach the deer park the train is very low .
Due to being filled with the beauty of Karsiyang it has not yet been developed in the form of a tourist spot .
Because the city is so good and clean .
The desire to reach the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the way between the trees of sunshine gives us adventure .
The next place is Igal Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
This is called Suicide point .
During the time of the British the cameras used to roam from here .
Hilhal is connected with a park and a restaurant .
There is a staircase fort here , from above which a beautiful view can be seen by reviewing the entire city .
In the nearby tea garden the women are filled with tea leaves with hands very soon after taking a foam out of the large intestine .
There is a museum outside Karsiyang city but on that day we did not go there because it was more important to travel through the open environment of tea gardens .
The next day we decided to roam in Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience for me , but if it was raining then it was more thought about how we would roam around .
But it was very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed around enjoying the joy of the sun .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The way to reach here is more beautiful than this .
On descending down a little from here the Ganges is surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst rocks one can see the magnificence of waterfalls .
In Rock Garden if we are shining waterfalls in the rocky empire , then in Gangamaiya the marvellous world of waterfalls is spectacular .

Tourists go to Pashupatinath Bazar through this way , where Nepalese artisans get sweater etc . made of hands .
There is an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape and color are different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here because there is a residence of forests , waterfalls and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot of Kalimpog is Lava and Lolegram which is full of forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we did not go to Kalimpong this time .
If we come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to Darjeeling then to roam around Darjeeling in the shadow of cold , but here the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling have connected me towards itself .
In my condition a small journey is very fun and thrilling .
This journey is not abroad but outside Rajasthan because it is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting thing for me , in which some travel attracts me , but sometimes some specific places like water ship , some royal train or some city like Gulabi city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people are attracted .
The place where he went to do was prepared about four and a half years ago , but along with those preparations this place came there , he really feels fun .
It is not only for those who go there because for the people living there .
In my ears the sound of Raman Babumina , my guide , we did not think before this how we lived in the jungle .
Thirty percent of the workers are also in this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many people do not work at the Heritage Hotel .
Raman Baba , a resident of Ajabgarh , had worked in Jaipur before this , now in this strange amber garden .
He himself is saying that he has changed into a new color .
The priest ' Aman ' garden is the feature of the garden .
There no one will call you in English dominance .
Aman Garden is actually a center of comfort and comfortable comfort .
That garden has its own history , the biggest thing is that it is introducing itself through the nearby territory .
How many people from the people spending holidays in Ambra Prauri of Rajasthan traveled to Danag of the messengers , why should you go far , some people from Jaipur sometimes spend night in this territory .
After opening the Amal National Park big people of the country and abroad come there .
Shabana Asmi called me very lovely there but I remember that night that I didn't go .
Its beauty is different which has reached Dangarh by its own way .
This time I came here in the invitation of our foreign guests unexpectedly , but those people felt like spending a miraculous holiday in some time , where they should definitely go to Aman garden .
This garden is a single garden saved from those seven gardens where the king of Alwar had made a camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in ten and twenty .
Its old walls are witnesses of those days .
Surrounded with mountains and witnesses of strong trees .
As you come in , welcome you in such a way , from which it feels that you have taken care of the unnatural peace here .
Together with tied rocks in Manibandhan the mantra of Mangalacharya should be celebrated actively .
We reached La in the evening , we plan to roam around in this garden .
My guest Jackie is a decoration lover and awakening .
Everything is unique with big palaces and palaces .
The most beautiful is its lighting .
Everything new and artistic is not surprising .
The manager prepared our program for the morning .
First of all along with Raman Baba on foot and then the jeep journey of Dangarh .
On walking through the road of Sankari we saw the fort of Ajabgarh , in which the rays of the sun gradually spread .
On seeing the dry lake the farmers are harvesting in it .
This year there was no rain but for the first time tobacco cultivation was seen .
The beauty of the rural life of Jackak is a unique experience .
After that we reached Dangarh by jeep .
In the morning I kept watching a tourist of Holland very careful .
This is the moment that milanium dollars are not worth .
The journey of Aman Garden is traditional and traditional , and he told us to give jaggery and curd .
Now it seems that why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard that tourism is also there to see the life of tribals .
What's this right
Besh is not such a thing , in many countries and tourists are specially interesting in it .
This tour is usually prepared from four days to two weeks and in between this tourists are included in different places .
Wherever it stops , food and food are included from there .
In such a situation efforts are made to explore such places where there is not much development and there is no effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time there are old sports and sports .
Besides this it is also focused on distributing traditional pockets .
In fact the meaning of such a tourism is to understand the ways and traditions of living in that area .
Although it is a little difficult to think , but such a tourism is a beautiful and different kind of experience .
Going to the bus is a fun for us .
Because of being with many people in it you get the joy of roaming alone .
Not only this , if you take a favorite book in this journey then you will get more time when you get disturbed .
Yes , it is so important that along with giving less and less comfortable moments this tour is definitely necessary for you tolerance .
To enjoy this one should take care of some things specially if you see any foreign destination bus tour .
Before taking a ticket you should look for a good deal .
Students , big people of the army , children etc . get benefit from this , but other people also get relief .
Otherwise there is an arrangement for tickets in Advanced , hence in the last minute it is very good to plan a tour in the bus but the plan is to be done somewhat before .
Otherwise there is an arrangement for tickets in Advanced , hence in the last minute it is very good to plan a tour in the bus but the plan is to be done somewhat before .
This is cheap .
The routine to take the bag is especially hard , so tell about the size and weight of the goods .
Sometimes it is not like this that you have to leave some of your things in the terminal or then you have to stop more money .
Along with this you should also know the law of paying the entire amount of insurance or loss from the tour company .
Carry on bags should be kept fine and take it out .
Because there is stiffness in the rake on the top of the hips .
It should also be kept in mind that while busing in the middle of the tour the responsibility of the goods is to be done .
From wherever you want to reach the bus you will have to reach there one hour ago .
At the time of smelling you should take special care of this thing .
In fact , as soon as you reach , it will be with you to choose as good hips .
Keep in mind whether there is cough while selecting the hips .
In the back hips there is more stiffness , but it is not a coffer table to study sitting on the front hips .
If you want warm wind many times then you can take a hip on the sides but if you do not like to disturb more then the hips on the side will be very good for you .
Then it is a matter of intelligence skill .
But if you both are in anxiety of handling then sit on the buttocks on the first side and keep a bag on the buttocks .
But if you both are in anxiety of handling then sit on the buttocks on the first side and keep a bag on the buttocks .
But if there is a lot of bus then the plan will be successful .
Introduce a bus driver and a consultant .
In this way you will get enough information from them .
While cleaning the bus everyone wants to go out .
At this time do not leave your luggage at all , because if it is lost then the buses do not take the responsibility of it .
Whenever you stop the bus then come back on time .
If you do not come in time then your place will be available to some new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

In the first week of December Louis Cruise is the only ship from Kochi to Maldives Colombo .
Louis Cruise is not an European institution but it is important for cruise and hotel business .
But due to some problems Louis cruise has stopped their services but there is a chance of resumption from October .
At the lowest rate of the ship of Louis Cruise you can go to the end of Maldives for three days including at least 5850 rupees per person every night .
That is for three days the cost of one person is less than 18,000 rupees .
Otherwise if you are two people then the entire child of the age of 15 years is extraordinary .
What else do you want
In the expense of cruise tea and breakfast are included .
And the whole time sports.
On reaching the capital Mala you can enjoy the joyment of the joys and activities available in Maldives from sea plane to lunch beneath water .
If there is a flight coming in front of you suddenly after roaming on big planes then you will feel as if you are playing .
But twelve-fifteen-fifteen-seat twelve-fifteen seats is the best for touring the islands like Maldives .
When it flys in the air like a speedboat running on the surface of water , it can not be known .
In all the flights you do not feel like normal flights .
Your policies will always be below the window - different sides of Maldives look at the resort islands and Koral islands in blue water .
Everything looks very clear.
There are two airlines in Maldives .
One of them is Trans Maldives , which has 20 C flights .
If you want then you can travel for an hour in about Rs . 4000 -LRB- every person -RRB- or you can rent the entire C plane throughout the day -LRB- if you want to pay the money -RRB- .
If you are going from Maldives to any other island then it is the best way to travel between different islands .
This journey will never stop you .
The flight of C - Airways from 12 k . . to 183 k . . is done in Maldives .
We were in the biggest ancient and magnificent market of Ahmadi Bazar of Mala .
Everybody who was able to take the goods in the market tried very carefully the language done by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nashid in the World Climate Conference held in Rapangun a day before .
In fact , I have not seen a Hindustani listening to the language of President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But because of the question of the existence of a creature that remains a carelessness of this earth it is better to imagine silence .
Many people call the convention of water inside the Maldives through the cantonment of October , but while going to Maldives it feels as if it is a natural anger then the earth will be so poor .
There is also a speciality in the beauty there .
In that small country such beauty can not be lost .
To go back to your cruise from that corner of the market , only if you turn towards the jetty , then you can know how much people understand this beauty .
Because of the water being so clean the fish swimming deeply under the light of the blanket can be seen with all their colors .
This is a part of the sea connected with the city .
If you are able to see some kilometres of clean water in the sea or river water related to any city of India then it will be devoted .
After returning to M . . . Aqua Marine there was nothing clear for two hours in the evening spent in Mala .
The petals are the life here .
Here you will find petals till the stones above the tombs .
We stayed out of his office some time before listening to the language of President Nasheed .
We could not believe that one country was before the house of the best person .
With very interest we took pictures of the gardens and anganisations around 50 metres .
You can think this before the house of any leader in India .
It has been found that the President sometimes walking on foot , both the blocks go to his office on the road .
All the things related to Maldives were changing towards one side .
That is why I am waiting for the next day .
I knew it would be a special day.
In the morning we reached the airport by cruise .
From there we reached the place named Trams Maldives roaming through the ropeway .
Last evening when we reached the cruise mall then we returned to the C-flight .
Many of its pictures were seen .
But I didn't know that the next time we could roam in it .
We had to go to Rangoli island at a distance of 105 kms through Transmall TV .
Approximately 100 metres high C-flight is a sight of forgetting to see hundreds of resorts and islands spread on the sea of Maldives .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
With adventurous thrill , adventurous journey of breathing stops .
But in Rangoli Resort of the Hillton Hotels of Rangoli Island we felt that we had reached another world .
There is another world without any relationship with the outside world.
There was also anxiety that such beauty , jewellery and jewellery would be found somewhere outside .
The journey of Kornad is possible on foot and on the car running on the battery .
On both the sides of the bridge going from Jatti to the main island the view of water life was marvellous .
Now we came to the place where we were tolerating ourselves from the neighbouring nature , which was far away from thinking .
We descended in water a few metres below the sea with the help of stairs reached a glass room under the water .
That room was actually a bedroom.
On all sides small and big fishes , petals , snorkelling , scuba diving etc . were seen .
We feel thrilled by thinking about eating food sitting in decorated tables there .
Approximately 47 , 000 rupees are spent on seeing here and drinking lunch beneath the water .
I didn't want to return from there.
We were ready to throw our passport in water .
But it was known that it was not possible .
If we decide with a heavy mind then we returned to the belief that somebody would come here again .
For a few days the plan to go out of Delhi was being prepared but it was not possible because of the busy work .
Since childhood the wildlife was a zeal , why didn ' t you go to Jim Corbett this time
This is the second bike tour after cycling till Pegong Lake in front of Kardungla Pass in Ladakh in 2006 .
In the morning of 27 December we left from Delhi with a goal of Jim Corbett , but from which Joshkhadesh we left , the slope of snow stopped our journey .
The journey between Hapud and Gajuda was pleasant .
Snow from the top, snow and rose in front.
It seemed as if it had fallen several times .
In a way we reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kms ahead of Ramnagar .
We were in Dikuli near our resort park , whose booking was done before us .
There was no special program but even after the cold we went on walking on the banks of Kosi .
After spending 2 . hours there we went to the Corbett Museum .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
On coming back Ratri was very late .
While coming from Delhi it was decided that the lions roaming in the jungle surely were lions around me in the dreams of the whole night .
In the midst of the intensity of the night I suddenly heard a sort of garden , after that till 2 o'clock in the night the pupils were drowned .
The first opinion was to visit Kalabhangi or Corbett waterfall .
Kalbhangi is 30 kms away , but Corbett waterfall was on the way to go .
In the museum of Corbett Sahib in Kalabhungi many things related to his life have been kept .
It's 12.30 night when it came back.
Kalbhangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett started to reach this village .
When we reached the resort , the safari jeepsy knew us .
He used to make arrangements for sighting in the prior Bijarani there .
Asked about the first number , the leopard had come here to protect from cold because of the excess of grass .
As soon as we reached Bijarani, we gave us a way.
We were ready for the jungles inside .
We were ready for the jungles inside .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants, their snakes were very big.
I took a lot of steps.
He started looking for the trail of the tiger.
The guide said that in the park there are only 150 tigers in front of which some of them died here .
At some places we saw the nails of their nails but we were sorry because they could not see them .
On the third day we had to stay in Delhi .
There was a whole tiger ride in my thoughts .
Then I remembered my old friend in Haldani .
I just called him.
I told you I was in Corbett.
He asked me whether I could see the tiger or not.
These words of him were ashamed.
I said slowly, no
There was no permission to bring a bike in the park.
Somebody advised me to ride inside.
