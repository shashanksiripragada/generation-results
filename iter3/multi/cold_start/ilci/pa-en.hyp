Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it's different .
On one side of Kutch , Sindhi and on the other side Gujarat is also a mixture of both in languages .
It is called ' turtle ' .
As such it is ' Boli ' , it does not have its own script .
If you have to write turtles then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj itself is that Anjar city where earthquake has occurred many times and the whole city has been destroyed .
Near Ajanar is the tomb of Jaisal-Toral .
The story of Jaisal Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the same path from which we had come then we will have to take a whole month 's holiday and there will be schools open in Mumbai .
So what to do  Now we will travel in the train by calling the fast buses of Gujarat toa .
The small train of metergage from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there a small train towards the meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and a big train from Ahmedabad will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main basis of the economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad times these days .
Due to the increasing terror threats in trade recession and South Asia the tourism business has reached a deep shock .
With the point of view of tourism in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the major states of the country cough deficiency has been recorded these days .
Statistics released recently by the Rajasthan government show that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to statistics the number of domestic tourists has decreased by 9 . 7 percent and the number of foreign tourists decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
A total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in 2008 out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 countries and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included in these .
People associated with the tourism sector are specially concerned about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Holde Makers , says that Vaishivak Mandi and terror incidents have affected tourism business badly .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we can not even develop a strong based infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decrease of 3 . percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
Due to tourism the recent years for Rajasthan are excellent .
After 2008 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism something new is happening .
Desert , havelis , forts , ponds , forests everything is the same older for tourists .
In the tourism sector the matter of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism is done by all the governments very much but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get facilities very less .
At the same time along with foreign palaces tourists in Rajasthan in recent years the incidents of balancing and shadows have also made the image of this state marked at the international level .
Years ago the Rajasthan government had given the status of development to tourism in the state but it has remained limited to papers only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
To invite tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the basic infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides the facilities of housing , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motor , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one transport unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has also remained thin for many years .
The deficiency of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in the year 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years even forty percent rooms of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with the hotels other units of the corporation are also reaching it a big deficit .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not become attractive towards this rail .
Despite reducing the rent it could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a reduction in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Mela .
In the year 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists had stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC in this fair this number was reduced to 217 .
The satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there has been no dearth in the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . royal train .
This rail is continuously benefiting .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of Rs . 9 . crore from this rail .
With this deficiency in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lakes of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is a desire to do something in the heart of man then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrat Rai has shown it true by setting up modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain ranges of Sahadir of Maharashtra .
The smell that he had seen , he feels happy in his eyes while pushing day by day .
This joy of them was also visible during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has become successful in making its place in the form of a better city .
In this city spread over 10 thousand acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been built only on 9 percent of the land .
On 91 percent of the land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been provided .
Several industrialists come forward to build their houses in this city built only for crores of patriots and today almost families are living in this city .
First of all industrialists and residents bought their Asians here in the form of Hollyday Home but now they have made it their first house and travel to Mumbai for work from here .
Behind Ambe Valley is Korigarh fort which provides beauty to this area .
The ruins of Leekawali are very important in the western Siang district .
The ruins of a large temple are found in the excavation .
On the pillars of stones of this temple the idols of Kamla and goddesses have been excavated enough which is mostly in a ruined state .

At this place a idol of Goddess Durga is found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpali are still singing the glorious story of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamareshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the mention of the glory of Tamreshwari Devi is found .
During the time of Chetia kings this goddess was recognised till far off in the north - eastern hills .
The people of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
Here the sacrifice of humans used to be climbed which later King Gaurinath Singh had closed .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which are located in the middle of Dibang and Divang rivers here .
According to the stories prevailing here this place is old Vidarbha , where once the king used to do the kingdom of Bhishmak .
Brahmakund is located in the lower part of Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
The tribes of Digaru , Mishami etc . here guide the tourists .
These people themselves also have great faith in this pond .
Near Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins mentioned in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of roying in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The ruins of brick pond near Roing are still telling their story .
To get the ruins of bathing , rough stairs and other ponds surrounded by rocks and wide roads all around I am still singing the silence of my ancient grand stories .
We reach ero for four hours by jeep from North Lakhimpur city of Upper Assam .
This place is the main center of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotises the hearts of the audience .
This is the same charming place where Apatani lives .
It takes several days to reach here before the road of jeep is formed .
On reaching here the views of trees of tall deodar , beautiful primrose , vollet , wild curtains , strawberries and rosberries enjoy the people coming here .
Apple and potatoes are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of Apatani people .
With its incomplete hard work we have made it its heaven .
There is a lot of rice farming here .
This place is the store of rice ' .
This ten miles long plateau is a living example of their hard work and the efficiency of agriculture .
The necessity of irrigation gets fulfilled from the Kali river .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
Looking at the sight in the middle of the sequences laden with the snow of the left hand a slight redness emerging in the sky on the white .
Excellent cough in air is cold .
Along with the cooling coolness in the environment one also feels moisture .
With the sound of garbage below the feet it is seen on the layer of the wooden layer .
There is no moisture in the environment and due to the depression of the sunrise before sunrise there is nothing more visible .
Tablets remain on the redness of the eyes before .
One feels like sitting on a batch lying in balcony .
On applying the hand the smooth layer of the palm gets stuck with the smoke of a light kirch and the hand gets separated from getting stuck with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in living in this small village settled amidst these hills buried with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this spent most of the time in Geneba or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both the sides of the thin Balkhandi river is spread till very high on light slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland Ron ' s valley on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
Equivalent highways of the Ron river and the noise cars on it have begun to be cleared .
At a distance of 300 kms and half an hour from car the journey of half an hour then along with Geneva lake simultaneously and half the Ron river coming from the eastern direction near the city named Montro , Jeneva lake which is called Lake Lake -LRB- Lake Lake Lake -RRB- is found in the middle .
Geneva city is settled on the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake goes forward towards the west by forming a river again .
On the right side there are mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps across the lake .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke from the left side we leave this highway towards the north on the mountainous road .
Due to the slope of the mountain being southeast the sun of crime is giving full sunshine to all the slopes .
The quantity of snow compared to the valley is less here - approximately not equal .
As we move towards height , denseness of snow has started increasing .
Despite the accumulation of good cough snow on both the sides of the road there is no special cold in the air because of clean sky and shining sun .
Crossing the journey of approximately 20 kms on this rocky hill road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thel .
The rocks are full of slopes , large multi-storeyed bungalows made of wood .
In the basement made of cement concrete tons of this three storeyed bungalow there are rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , ladder along with parking of trains .
Wallai is famous for the farming of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making alcohol of grapes .
37  of the entire cantonment is cultivated by grapes on the ground .
In the villages settled on both sides of the Ron Valley grapes gardens of grapes provide a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Take the grapes gardens of grapes , roaming around them , resting in the villages there and chewing alcohol by taking them in the carvings of grapes is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Aghe there is a huge collection of grapes in a pit made in the 12th century , to see which foreign tourists have to get fire booking .
Once again we go through the jungle of that jungle which was ruined from Dawanal .
Till three-four k . . the heart becomes even more narrow with the shouting questions of children throughout the way .
The dramatic and charming changes come from the scene on a fold .
Right in front , on the slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in snow on sloping from the top of the village .
On the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope the dense forest of  Mak Deodar ' is spread .
There is dense snow on all four sides .
The roofs of the houses of the colony are shining due to the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same silence is shadowed .
From the peak of the mountain to the valley on all four sides the empire of Dhawal Himalayas .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round chakra in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Lukarbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Lukarbad is approximately 1500 .
Tourists , players and health workers coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments capable of 6900 beds and 28 hotels , camping sites of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants for staying here .

40 lakh litres coming out of these everyday in the whole town of water till 510 , about 30 small and big thermal pools built at places , some pools are inside five star hotels and are according to the pockets of people of different classes .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of warmth .
The thick floor of snow is swimming above the roof of the houses in the bright sunlight .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the places conserved in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that Sikkim can only go taxis of Sikkim hence checking is not done .
The journey is going on , the state is the second , but the mountain is the same , the trees are the same , Sarasarati winds are the same .
The sweet moisture on the whole body is the same .
In the season of rains the beauty brightness is the same .
The plan for Darjeeling journey is comfortable , first of all the decisions of Karsiyang have been taken .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunshine forests .
Famous for production of excellent tea .
If you move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then in the beginning itself the tea garden welcomes those who move towards themselves while entering Muscurahat .
In the middle of tea gardens luxury from one road charms the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with forests , on the other side Hagiri is trenched .
Sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen here .
All around was the empire of greenery .
Once I got hit , see these natural jungles or plants of tea planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful forests were , the more beautiful tea gardens spread far away .
If you look at the road of the road then it seems very marvellous .
Like the walk of the snake , the crooked and vasul road was passing .
The time was also spent .
If it was not spent , then forest and tea gardens .
Sometimes small towns are seen .
From far off a hilly house - house etc . was seen very dense .
This was Karsiyang .
After staying here at one place we made a program of roaming all day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we got out on a tour of Karsiyang .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach the deer park i . . the car had to be left very low .
Despite being luxurious with the beauty of Karsiyang , it has not been able to develop as a tourist spot .
Although the city is very good and clean .
Despite the path being deserted the desire to reach the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the road between dust trees was giving us adventure .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Susoid Point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to give life by slaughtering here .
Nowadays , this is contained with a park and restaurant .
There is a stair like dome here from the height of which a beautiful view is present on observing the whole city .
In tea gardens nearby women were busy breaking the tea leaf driven by rolling hands at extreme speed .
There is a museum outside Karsiyang city , but on that day we could not go there , because touring the unforgettable environment of tea gardens felt more important .
The next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but there was a lot of concern with this that if there was such a rain then how would we roam around
But the combination was very good that after reaching the rock garden we roamed enjoying the sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
On moving a little further down from here Gangamaya surrounded by hills was found .
The magnificence of waterfalls amidst rocks is worth seeing here .
In the Rock Garden we found that the waterfalls in the empire of rocks are spectacular then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Ganga Maa is engraved with stones .
Both of these places are present very below the Darjeeling hills .
Arising up on the help of a car we saw a loop in Darjeeling .
From here the whole hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telescope .
The mood of the weather was clean till now .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , knowing where we were present and started shouting .
In the evening there was a plan to walk and shopping on the Mall Road .
Tower trains in the tour of Darjeeling put four moons in the journey .
The journey of Towya train from Darjeeling to Dhum and Dhum to Darjeeling is special attraction for tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake and Alpaviram in Garden here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where handmade sweaters etc . of Nepalese artisans are found .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Although Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its form and color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens but the transport of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is Laha and Lolegaon , which is full of forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to visit Darjeeling the shadow of cold , then tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling tied me with us .
My recent journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not from abroad nor from outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting thing in itself in which sometimes travels towards itself , then sometimes be it a special place , a ship of water or any royal train or a city like a rose city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of this one special attraction people come dragging .
The place where I am going to talk about this bus has been prepared about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation of which this place has come there he has actually turned into a jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
In my ears my guide Ram Babu swings the words of Meena , Saheb , before this we could not even think that we could live in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff is of this very area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work even in the heritage hotel .
Ram Babu , a resident of Ajabgarh , used to work in Jaipur first and now in this unique royal style Aman Bagh .
He has driven himself to speak in a new color .
Saheb ' is the estimation of Amman Bagh .
There nobody calls you with English language .
Aman Bagh is actually a tourist spot with immense peace and all the conveniences .
The history of that garden is also its own and the biggest thing is that it makes you know about the areas nearby .
In the royal style of Rajasthan how many people would have toured Bhangarh of Bhutan , why should you go away , even among the people of Jaipur , Kuchek would have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad reach there .
I remember that night as well when Shabana Azmi had called me there with Tahedil but I could not go .
It is a different thing that he himself had reached Bhangarh by wandering on the way .
This time suddenly I reached there on the dawn of my foreign guest , then it seemed as if those people who want to spend a grand holiday in a short time , they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is a single garden saved from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to prey for hunting .
Its construction was done in Unni , 100 twenty .
Its old wall is a witness of those days .
In the shade of dense trees surrounded by mountains the first glimpse of Aman Bagh hypnotises you .
As soon as you come inside , as you are welcomed , it feels that attention has been given to divine peace here .
Along with binding Mauli in Kalai the mantra of Mangalacharan is pronounced alive .
We reached Dharamshala in the evening we intended to put a cycle of that garden .
Like my table which is enjoying , sympathetic words have risen ' this is interesting ' .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new and artistic no wonder that Aman Bagh has recently got awards .
Manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all roaming on foot with Ram Babu and then jeep journey of Bhangarh .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the sunlight was spreading gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the farmers were farming .
This year when there was no rain then first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
If for this then such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is a million dollars invaluable moment .
The method of calling the Alvida of Aman Bagh was also traditional and by feeding jaggery and curd they distributed to us .
Now it was understood that why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show travel life .
Is this right
Of course this happens not one but in many states and tourists also show cough interest in them .
These tours are usually prepared for time from four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this staying there , eating etc are also included .
This way an attempt is made to explore such places where there has not been much development and where time has not had a special effect on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this where old tourist sites etc are also present .
Besides this , attention is also given to survey triditional cogen .
In fact , the purpose of such tours is to make tourists rubble with the ways and traditions of living in that place .
Although it looks a little difficult in thinking , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
Despite being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time without distressed .
Yes , it is definitely so much that along with giving a lot of time full of less expenditure and peace these tours definitely keep the demands of Sabar with you .
This is the reason that for enjoying them it is necessary to take care of some things , especially when you are watching through a foreign destination bus tour .
Take the best deal before taking the ticket .
Students , senior people of military , children etc . get discount on them , then there is an arrangement of discount for two people also .
However , it is cheap to buy tickets in Advanced , hence it is better to plan a bus tour in the last moment that planning should be done a little before .
Recognize about round trip instead of tower ticket .
It is cheap .
Regulations about bagge are very hard , hence ask about the size and weight of the goods .
There is no such thing that you have to leave some of your goods on the terminal or get an extra percent filled .
Also know the rules of compensation of insurance or loss with tour companions .
Carry on bags are right , go on lake .
Because they get fit in the rake above the seat .
Keep in mind this thing also that during the tour you will have your own responsibility of luggage while chaining the bus .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the business season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better seat operation will be with you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the confert .
If you feel too much on the previous seat , then studying on the front seat does not remain conferred .
If you have to go to Lu repeatedly , then take a seat with a corner and if you do not like to be too distressed then the seat with a window will be better for you .
Now the matter of a walk .
If you are in the forefront of both the armies then first sit on the corner seat and put your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus , then planning will remain .
If there is facility of lodging room in the bus then keep in mind this thing while choosing the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identification with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus all are asked to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its loss the buses do not take its responsibility .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time then some new traveller can get your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

Both the hotels of Jinjar built at the place named Vakad situated on the central and Pune - Bangalore highway of the Pimpri industrial area are consistent with maximum facilities .
The neighbouring state of Maharashtra Goa is contiguous with its beautiful sea shores and variety of water creams which is a heaven like for the tourists where with the tour of ancient churches the beauty of ancient ages can be seen easily .
The Jinjar Hotel situated in the capital of Goa is excellent for the journey of the western coast .
Cycling , rever cruise , cold sea winds and world famous Goan cuisines on the roads of Goa are excellent options here .
If you look at today 's date then for Maldives the rate of return of the cheapest person from Delhi is 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Male then also you can get hotels in some less rent but enjoying the real beauty of Maldives go to any island nearby then the pocket will be small .
Cy cruise proves to be beneficial here itself .
In the first week of December Lui Cruise from Kochi started India 's only Cruise Cruise for Maldives and Colombo .
Loui Cruise is a European company and there is a lot of popularity in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Louis Cruise has now made its services available , but it is expected to get dry again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a cruise of three days at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per person at the ship of Lui Cruise Emvie Aquarine .
That is for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
If there are two elders then children of less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
What else should be done .
In the rent of cruise tea - breakfast , food are included .
Entertainment of every time gather together .
Reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainments , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane rode to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airways suddenly if a single plane stands in front of you then you will feel like playing .
But this twelve overplane of 12 - 15 seats is excellent in the form of archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- to roam around like Maldives .
While running like a speed boat on the surface of water it gets up in the air , it does not know .
You do not have the experience of flying ordinary airplanes in the entire flight .
Every time your eyes keep on seeing the blue water of different sheds of Maldives watching the Resort Islands and Coral Islands .
How clear everything is seen .
There are only two plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these which has twenty sea planes .
If you want you can roam around a thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or the entire sea plane can take on rent for the journey of your day long -LRB- condition is full of pockets -RRB- .
Although if you go beyond Male Island on any island then the journey of the sea plane will be necessary because this is the way of journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey that the mind of ending may never do you .
The sea plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- at the best Mavilevaru -RRB- in Maldives .
We were in the capital 's largest antique and Sovenier shop in the Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All the cellsmen were listening to the speech given in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before the President of Maldives Mohammed Nashid .
If you say honestly then no Hindustan was seen listening to the speeches of President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a question of the existence of an unprecedented creation of this earth then such a seriousness was necessarily impossible .
Many people may have considered the meeting made inside the water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October , but Maldives seems to be going and feeling that if the anger of nature is lost from it then the world will become so distinct .
Something like this is special in the beauty of there .
As if there is no such beauty in that small country .
Returning from that tour of the market towards Jetty to go on its cruise , when the sight went to the water of the sea walking along with Burbus circus then it was felt that the people here understand the price of this beauty to the extent .
The water was so clear that the fish floating in the depth of several metres below the lamppost were clearly visible with all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can also see some centimetres in the water of sea or river connected with any city of India then you will consider yourself luxurious .
While returning to M . . Aquamarine two hours of the evening spent in the mask were roaming in the brain .
Coral Rif -LRB- peanut rocks -RRB- are the life here .
Even on the stones laid on the tombs you will get rocks of mustard rocks .
Some time before listening to President Nasheed 's speech we stood outside his official residence .
It was not sure that we were ahead of the residence of the best personality of any country , there was no security worker till far off .
With enjoyment we were pulling photographs of gardens and barrenness only fifty metres away by enhancing hands inside the gate of its bungalow .
That you can think about such a leader 's house in India .
It was also known that the President sometimes crossing the road on foot reaches two blocks ahead in his office .
Everything about Maldives was amazing .
That is why I was waiting for the next day with the website .
It seemed that that day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat from Cruise brought us to Airport Island .
From there we reached Trans Maldives base while cutting the rounds of the runway .
Last evening when Cruise was reaching near Male then we were passing from above , immediately identified the plane .
Such pictures which were seen were of them .
But then it was not known that the next day he would get the opportunity to ride in it .
From the sea plane of Trans Maldives we were going to go to Rangali island one hundred and five kilometres away .
It was unique to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying up to a height of about a thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a flight to stop breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Kornad Resort of Hilton Hotels on Rangali Island it felt as if we reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no residence with any outside world .
The architecture was not as such that it was difficult to meet the beauty or villaita outside there .
Tour on Kornad can also be done on foot or from a battery driven vehicle also .
While going from Jetty to the main island the view of water life on both sides of the bridge was unique .
Now we could not even make ourselves comfortable with the nature of the surroundings , that we reached such a place , it was Kalpanic .
While descending down in the water of the sea several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all sides we could see a unique kind of small fish , corals , snow rockling and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of eating sitting on decorated tables there was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of seeing and lunching it on coming to this island in the sea plane from Male is only Rs . 47 thousand for a man .
There was no mind to return from there .
We were ready to flow in our passport water .
But he knew it was not possible .
With heavy mind we returned with this expectation that sometimes we will definitely take a fist on some fold .
For many days plans were being made to go out of Delhi but due to the arrangement of evening it was not possible .
Since childhood there was a sleep of wildlife then I thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
This was the second bike tour after biking till Pagong Lake ahead of Khardungala pass in Ladakh in 2006 .
On the morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the zeal that had come out of which the coordinator had made our rapid rapture .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Kora from above and bad roads in front .
Many times it felt that now we fell .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at eight o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett National Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dikuli near Park , which we had already booked .
On that day there was some special program , but despite being cold we first went to tour the banks of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there Corbett museum went out , which was near Dhangadi gate two kilometres very difficult .
From there we went down to Ramnagar roaming .
It was quite evening while returning .
It had come out from Delhi that while roaming freely in the jungle , lions would definitely see , then all night I would see lions in dreams .
In the midst of the depths of the night suddenly I heard a loud voice and after that the dogs who started crushing then they did not quiet for two hours .
Therefore first suggestion of touring Kaladungi and Corbett Falls came .
Kaladungi is thirty kilometres away , while Corbett Fall falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kaladungi , where some special things related to his personal life are kept .
Going back at twelve o'clock .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled in this village .
On reaching the resort safari Jeepsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they have made arrangements for sighting in the number one site business there .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more grassland and Tigers come on that side to escape from cold during this time .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half hundred rupees for roaming around four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tuskers of elephants , which had long teeth .
I rotated photography .
In the midst of this the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide told that there are tigers around 150 in the park , some of which have recently died .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was sad because of not seeing the tiger .
The third day we had to return to Delhi .
There was a fatur safari of Tiger in my brain .
That is why I remembered a old friend of Haldwani .
I brought him a phone like this .
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
Whether he saw a tiger asking or not .
Its words were kissed like a tired .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a journey inside .
During the journey it was found that due to being busy highway near the park animals often get wounded or die by hiding with vehicles .
