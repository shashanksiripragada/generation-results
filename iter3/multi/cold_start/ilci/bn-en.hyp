They feel different from Gujarati .
Yes, it's different.
On one side of Kutch Sind and on the other side Gujarat is also a mixture of both in languages .
This language is called Kutchi .
Although there is no script of this language .
If you have to write a kachhi then you have to write it in Gujarati lips .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where earthquake occurred many times and the whole city was destroyed .

From Bhuj the small train of meter gauge reaches Rajkot .
From there the second train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and the big train from Ahmedabad will reach Bombay .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going on in a very bad condition today .
Due to the danger of increasing terror in recession and South Asia there has been a deep impact on tourism business .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to tour Rajasthan counted in the major states of the country has been seen very less .
According to the number published recently by the Rajasthan government the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 is less than ten percent less than 2008 .
According to the number the number of native tourists is 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists is 27 . 36 percent less .
A total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in 2008 , out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 were natives and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 were foreign tourists in comparison to them in 2009 the total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 natives and 73 lakh 414 foreign tourists were among them .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried about this situation .
Rajputana Holiday Director of Macers Sanjay Kaushik said that due to the occurrence of business depression and terror tourism business has been very badly affected .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop strong base structures in our country .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India is 3 . 29 percent less than last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists coming from France is the highest .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism this year has been very good .
After 2000 this first time the number of tourists of Rajasthan decreased .
Nothing is happening from the point of view of tourism .
For desert , palaces , forts , ponds , forests everything has been kept in ancient state .
To work on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , thrilling tourism in the tourism sector all the governments have increased but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less opportunity .
In the last few years in Rajasthan along with the women of foreign tourists the incidents of destruction and distress have also made the pictures of this state bad at the international level .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry in the state several years ago but it was limited to paper only .
One example of the success of the Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
To increase tourism and to develop the infrastructure of tourism in Rajasthan the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1997 .
This corporation provides facilities like accommodation , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are 75 only in this corporation .
Among which 39 hotels , 22 motorals , eight caphatia , three travellers , one journey and two trains Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the situation of this corporation has become bad for a few years .
The loss of RTDC was 185 lakh rupees in 2008 - 99 which was estimated to be 632 lakhs in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of hotels of this corporation is such that in the last five years even forty percent houses of this hotel have not been filled .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation have also faced greater losses than this .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
The attraction of tourists towards this railway has not been created .
Even after reducing the fare it could not attract tourists .
In such a situation the interest of tourists towards Pushkar fair has been seen less .
In the year 2007 - 08 the number of foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC where this year the number has decreased to 217 .
The satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there has been some dearth in the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Rajiki trains .
Due to this railway there is uncomfortable benefit .
In the last year RTDC has received nine and a half crore rupees from this railway .
Due to this destruction of tourism in Rajasthan is natural .
Tourism is the biggest source of Rajasthan economy .
If there is a desire to do something in the mind of man then he can make gold from the earth .

The sight also falls in the midst of the snowy mountain ranges of the left side towards the light lalima emerging in the sky in hungry .
The wind is very cold .
In the weather Kankan also feels moisture along with cold .
Listening to the sound of kachar kachar below the tree looks at the palanquin bed on the floor of the wood .
Nothing is seen more in the weather due to narrowness and bitterness before sunrise .
Looking gets stuck on the lalima of the east .
He wants to sit on the bunch kept in Baranda .
On applying hands the shiny sound of the shiny level of the palm gets shiny and hands are removed as soon as they feel cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village in the midst of these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Switzer .
Before this Geneva has been cut more than this .
Situated on both sides of the valleys of the Saru river the dense tribe is spread up to a great extent above the light slope .
This is the main river of Switzerland Ronne Valley on both sides of which many small and big cities are located .
Trains are clearly visible on the highways and roads along the Ron river .
At a distance of 300 k . . and the journey of one and a half hours through a car , parallel to the Geneva lake and near the city named Ron river Montro coming from the east along with half the Ron river , the Geneva lake which is called French lake mixes with it .
Geneva city is 100 km long and 10 km wide on the western side of this lake .
The lake here goes towards the west by river again .
The mountain ranges of Dhabal , Gaganchumbi Alps are responsible and lakes .
Reaching a beautiful small city named Luke on the left side exit we leave the highway and reach the mountainous roads towards the north .
Due to the slope of the mountains being south - direction the sun gives full sunshine all over the afternoon .
In comparison to the valleys the quantity of snow is not almost like that .
As much as the height goes , the density of snow increases .
Despite the accumulation of good snow on both the sides of the road there is no special cold in the air because of clean sky and shining sun .
After finishing the journey of about 20 kms on this roaming hilly road we reached a small village named Thel .
Shail . This is a slopey slope made of wood , large multi-storied bungalow .
In the basement made of cement concrete of this three storeyed bungalow there is also a room to control the necessary services like cart , water , laundry .
Switzerland is famous for cultivation of grapes .
It is the main center of making wine - finger alcohol .
The total cultivation of grapes is done on 37  land of Canton .
The gardens of grapes in the village situated on both the sides of the Ron Valley give a unique direction to the beauty there .
Going to the gardens of grapes , roaming , resting in the villages there and taking them to the factory of making alcohol of grapes is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named before there is a large museum of grapes in a palanquin built in the 12th century , which is kept by foreign tourists for seeing .
Once again we are going through the desolate jungles of Daban .
The road up to three - four k . . was getting worse in the question of the children .
At that time the dramatic and charming changes of views come in a fold .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road there are many houses .
People are skiing on the slope above the village .
On the skiing slopes the dense forests of deodar trees spread till the head of the mountains .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining by the sun rays .
We reached the village in five minutes .
That nirvata is spread here too .
From the peak of the mountains to the valleys all around the kingdom of white snow .
In the next five minutes we reached a big round square in the middle of that town .
The name of Kasbar is leukarabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Liukarabad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and administrators coming here can be estimated from the 6900 beds capable of accommodating 1700 apartments and shawls , 28 hotels for accommodation of 1500 , camping site for bamboo leaves , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants .

The thick level of snow is shining on the roofs of the house in the shiny sunlight .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the places conserved in the form of the record of ' National Majesty ' in Switzerland .
It was said in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to the taxi of Sikkim therefore there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the state is other , but the hills are the same , the trees are also one , the wind is the same .
The humidity of the veins in the whole body is also one .
The brightness of the weather is also one in the rainy season .
As soon as the plan of Darjeeling journey is packed , it is decided to take the swing of Karsiyang .
Karsiang is a small city of Darjeeling .
The tea gardens are full of dust jungles .
Excellent tea is famous for production .
If you move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then first tea gardens welcome you in a joyous way .
In the middle of tea gardens the heart has become pleased to go through the road for the first time .
On one side green mountains full of jungles and on the other side deep green valleys .
Sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens are seen here .
The empire of greenery all around .
Once I had fallen in difficulty - I will not see these natural jungles but trees of this tea planted by humans .
Both were moving towards themselves .
The beauty of the jungle was as beautiful the gardens of tea spread .
It seems marvellous to be seen on the road .
Like snake rice , taras and mountainous roads were going on .
The time was also flowing .
Whatever was not cut is the gardens of jungles and tea .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
Several dense forests like a hilly house etc . were seen from a distance .
This was Karsiang .
Staying here at one place we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
That is why we took a car and moved to Karsiang .
First of all deer parks .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
It was in front that to reach the deer park one had to leave the car below a lot .
Despite being filled with the beauty of Karsiyang it has not yet been developed or famous in the form of tourist spots .
Although the city is very clean .
Despite the destruction of the road we were enjoying the joy of climbing the road between the love and dust trees to reach the deer park surrounded by forests .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
There is a point situated at a height on the other side of this city .
It is called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to commit suicide by slaughtering from here .
Nowadays it is connected to a park and restaurant .
There is a dome here from above which a beautiful view can be seen from the whole of the city .
At the same time in tea gardens women are capable of carrying a toker on the back with a very fast pace with tea leaves .
There is an exhibition museum outside Karsiang city , but on that day we could not go there because the tour of open weather in tea gardens seems to be more important .
The next day it was decided that Darjeeling would roam .
It was very thrilling at this place but it was feeling bigger than this that if there is such a rain then how to roam around .
But the connectivity was very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we could get the benefit of sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The road to reach here is more charming than this .
Going a little down from here one can get Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
The magnificence of the flames amidst stones is worth seeing here .
We found in Rock Garden that the waterfalls are decorated here in the empire of stones and the magnificent world of the waterfalls in Gangamaya is covered with stones .
Both these places are standing very below the mountains of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of a car we saw the air loop in Darjeeling .
From here the whole of the mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of binoculars .
The taste of the weather was still good .
But as we moved towards the monastery , who knows where the clouds came and started shining .
In the evening plans of roaming and shopping in Malrod were made .
Toy train journey in Darjeeling makes it even more attractive .
Toy train journey from Darjeeling to sleep and from sleep to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake and a little rest in the gardens here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar on this way , where sweater etc . are found in the hands of Nepalese technicians .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
In the same way Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its colorful form is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens but there is a sound of wild waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolehgaon , which are full of jungle waterfalls .
But due to the lack of time I could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in winters but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling tied me on their own .
My recent journey was very thrilling and charming .
This journey was not from foreign countries nor was it very close to Jaipur outside Rajasthan .
Tourism is a thrilling thing in which sometimes the journey attracts us , sometimes some special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people get attracted .
The place I am going to talk about it was built about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation of this place this place has really been made to enjoy the jungle .
Only those who go there for those who are not only for them but for those who stay there .
In my ears still speaking of my guide Ram Babu Mina , we could not even think of any day before Sahiba that we could stay like this in my jungle .
Fifty percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that even such local people did not get the job of heritage hotels .
The residents of Ajabgarh Ram Babu used to work in Jaipur before this and now this royal garden is grown .
He walked and said in a different thread .
Sahiba is the estimation of Aman Bagh .
There nobody feels you in English .
Aman Bagh is really a peaceful and comfortable place .
This garden has its own history and the biggest thing is to introduce the nearby places .
The royal vacations of Rajasthan , among those who have roamed around Bhangarh . There is no need to go away , even among the residents of Jaipur , very few people may have spent night in this area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh many big people of the country and abroad have come here .
I remember that night when Shabana had invited me there but I could not go .
It is different from the fact that he had lost his way and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there to invite my foreign guests , it seems as if those who want to spend a good holiday in less time should go to unmanned garden .
This garden is one of those seven gardens where the kings of Albar used to rest for hunting .
It was built in nineteen or twenty .
Its old walls are witnesses of those days .
Surrounded by mountains and on the shadow of dense trees the first sight of Aman Bagh will enjoy you .
The way you enter inside will be welcomed by the way you will feel that attention is paid to the divine peace here .
With the tie of Mauli in the hands the mantra of Mangalacharya is made alive .
We reached the evening and decided to put a square on the garden .
My table sister Jackie told me immediately that it was very charming ' .
Everything is inspired by Haveli and Palace .
The beauty here is the beauty of the beauty .
Everything new and artistic . It is not surprising that Aman Bagh has been awarded in recent times .
The administrator fixed our program for the morning .
First of all roamed on foot with Ram Babu and then roamed on the jeep of Bhangarh .
While walking on the road of thorns we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the sunlight was spread slowly .
I saw the Sukhi lake in which the farmers are harvesting .
This year there was no rain but for the first time I saw the cultivation of tobacco .
The opportunity to see rural life for Jackey was very pleasant .
After this we went to Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning we saw a tourist of Haland sitting in deep meditation .
This is a million dollar time .
While coming out of Aman Bagh they gave us jaggery and curd in a traditional way .
Now I got to know why tourists come here to spend so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also prepared to see the lives of tribals .
Is it right .
Certainly this is done in many states and tourists show special enthusiasm in this tour .
This tour is usually prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and this time tourists are taken to different places .
Among these , staying there , eating etc . are also interpreted .
This way an attempt is made to tour such places where there was not much development where there was no special effect on the lifestyle of nature and humans .
Along with this ancient tourist sites etc are also there .
Besides this attention is also given to feeding breastfeeding .
In fact , the aim of such a tour is to make tourists face the tradition of living and eating all these places .
Although it feels a little difficult to think but such a tour is really thrilling and a different kind of experience .
There is a different joy of touring by bus .
Despite staying with many in it you can enjoy staying alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can read without obstacles of books for a long time .
Yes , it is right that along with spending many times in less expensive and peace this tour claims to all of you .
To enjoy this tour one needs to keep in mind some things specially when you are watching a tour of any foreign place by bus .
Find the best deal before taking the ticket .
Students , senior militaries , children etc . get rid of this tour and there is a facility of leave for both .
However , if tickets are bought from before then it is cheaper therefore in the last direction it is better to do the bus tour before planning .
Instead of taking tickets on both sides take information about round trips .
It is cheap .
Regulations related to goods are done specially hence ask about the weight of the goods .
It does not happen that you have to leave your luggage in terminal itself or pay increase in rent .
Along with this take the rules of insurgency or compensation from the tour company .
Carry on bags take it properly for this tour .
Because it stops the upper seat .
Keep in mind this thing that while changing the bus during the tour you have the responsibility of the goods .
From where you get to the bus reach one hour before the scheduled time .
In the busy season you will keep in mind this thing specially .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will get a better seating place .
Keep in mind the rest while selecting the place of sitting .
Wrinkles are more towards the back and can not fall properly towards the front .
If you go to the bathroom again and again then take a place towards the corner , if you do not like to be too disturbed then it would be better if you take a seat towards the window .
This time it's a trick.
If you are both trying to walk then first put your bag in the nearby seat sitting in a corn seat .
If there is no crowd in the bus then this plan will be successful .
If there is facility of bathroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing while selecting the place of sitting because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Interact with bus driver or conductor .
By this you can know many important information .
While cleaning the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this time you will not leave your goods in place because on losing it the bushers do not take charge of it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back at the right time .
If you do not come time then you can take your place with a new traveller and you have to wait for other buses in the terminal .

You can visit Maldives for cruise for three days at the rate of at least Rs . 5850 per person in the ship Ambi Aquamerine of Lui Cruise .
That is for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
If he has two adults then he is free of cost for children of less age .
And what else you want .
The fare of cruise is tea - breakfast , food , etc .
Always with entertainment .
Reaching the capital Mall you can enjoy entertainment , activities according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming around the big airport suddenly you will feel like playing a sea plane in front of you .
But this twin overplane with a place of 12 - 15 sitting is excellent for touring the island group like Maldives .
One can not even know when suddenly the wind gets up while running like a speed boat on the water .
You feel to climb on normal airplanes on the entire flight .
Always your eyes will be below - seeing the reservoir islands and Prabal islands in different kinds of blue water of Maldives .
How clear all things are seen .
There are two sea plane companions in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these which has 20 C planes .
If you want then you can roam around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- in an hour or the entire sea plane for the whole day for tour -LRB- surely it should be the force of the taxi -RRB- .
If you go from Male Island to another island then the journey of sea plane will be necessary because that is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you will never want to end .
The journey of C plane from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Uttam Mavilevaru -RRB- is done on Maldives island .
We were in the shops of the capital 's largest antique and Suvenire in the Ahmadi Bazar of Mal .
All the Celsmans had heard the speech given by the President of Maldives at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before .
In fact , I did not see the speech of President or Prime Minister in any Hindustanic so much of my heart .
But when there is a question of creating a new existence on this soil then it is necessary to have such a seriousness .
Many people will also go to Maldives even after taking a meeting under the water of Maldives in October , if the nature ' s anger snatchs it from us then how poor the world will become .
There is a special thing in the beauty there .
It does not seem to be so beautiful in this small country .
While going towards Jetty to return to Cruise again from that tour of the market when we got to know how much the people here understand the value of this beauty .
Water is so clean that in the light of Lamppost colorful fish are seen in a few metres deep .
This is that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
You are fortunate to see some centimetres clean in the sea or river water connected with any city of India .
The evening spent in the luggage to come up on Ambie Aquareen has been remembered for two hours .
Koral Rif -LRB- Munga Chattan -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will get a fool on Crownbore .
Shortly before listening to the address of President Nashis we were standing outside his official residence .
It is not believed that we were in front of the house of the highest personality of any country , no protector was able to see till far off .
We were enjoying taking photographs of gardens only fifty metres away by enhancing the hands inside the door of his bungalow .
Can you think about the houses of any leader in India
It was also known that the President had sometimes crossed the road on foot and went to his office two blocks before .
We feel every thing about Maldives .
That is why we were waiting for Brussberry the next day .
It seems that this day would be special .
In the morning we took a boat from Cruise to the airport island .
From there we reached the bus of Trans Maldives by cutting the square of the highway .
The next day in the evening when the cruise was reaching near the luggage then we were able to know the airways going up immediately .
I saw a lot of pictures .
But then did you know that the next day I would get the opportunity to climb on this plane .
On the sea plane of Trans Maldives we were going to Rangoli Island five kilometres away .
Spreading at a height of approximately thousands of resorts and Koral islands spread on the sea plane of Maldives were unforgettable .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
In thrill and excitement there was a flight to stop breathing .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of Hillton Hotel on Rangoli Island we felt that we had come to any other world .
In such a world which has no relation with the outside world .
There was no such relation that the beauty and luxury available here is difficult to get out .
The tour of Konarad can be done on foot or on a battery-driven car .
From Jetty to the main island that on both the sides of the bridge the view of water life was unique .
Till now we could not get up with the nature of the surroundings , we reached such a place which was imaginable .
We reached such a house of glass after descending on the water of the sea several metres below the stairs which was under the water .
This room was actually the food room .
On all sides on the occasion of glass small fish , coral , snorkelling and scuba diving people were seen .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated floor there is very thrilling .
On coming to this island on the plane from Male and the fare of lunching underwater is 47 thousand rupees per person .
I didn't want to return from there .
We were ready to wet our passport in water .
But I knew that it was not possible .
With sad mind I returned with this hope that once again , sometimes fate will definitely come here .
I had been planning to go out of Delhi for a long time but it was not possible for the busy work .
Wildlife had a lot of interest in childhood , so I thought that this time we go to Jim Corbett .
This was the second bike tour after biking till Peng Lake before Khardungla pass in Ladakh in 2006 .
On 27 December we came out from Delhi for Jim Corbett but with the enthusiasm that we had come out the hustle-bustle had reduced our speed .
The road between Hapur to Gajrola was very tired .
Again on him the worst and bad road .
Many times it was felt that I would fall .
In some way we reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park was 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Near our resort park itself was in the table , whose booking we had already done .
On that day there was no special program , despite being cold we first went to tour Kosi .
After staying there for two - three hours we left for Corbett museum which was near Ghangari Gate two kilometres away .
From there we went to Ramnagar below .
We got back in the evening .
I had come out firmly from Delhi that I would definitely see the tiger roaming in the jungle but all night I saw the tiger in dreams .
Suddenly I could hear the sound of the night and then the dog which started screaming it started walking for two hours .
Initially the advice of touring Kaladungi and Corbett fruits came .
Kaladungi is situated at a distance of thirty kilometres , falls on the Corbett Falls Road itself .
Jim Corbett Saheb 's exhibition hall is in Kaladungi , where some special things related to his life are kept .
Twelve and twelve o'clock to return .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village itself .
After reaching the resort safari jeepsy was waiting for us .
It is said that they made arrangements for sighting in the number one site Vijrani .
It is said to ask about number one that there is more grass and tigers come to this direction to save from cold this time .
On reaching Bijrani we are given a guidance that for four hours we will take two and a half hundred rupees .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw the elephants of both the teeth , which had long teeth .
I photographed on the ground .
In the midst of this the guide started trekking tigers .
The guide told that there are approximately 150 tigers in the park , of which many of them died in a few days .
At many places we got to see the footprints of the tiger , but due to lack of sight of the tiger the heart was bad .
On the third day we were returning to Delhi .
The ghost of the tiger was pressed on my head .
That is why I remember an old friend of Haldwani .
I called him like this.
I told him that I came to Corbett .
He asked if I saw the tiger or not .
This thing of him was like a shore .
I gradually said that I didn't see it .
There was no permission to take bikes in the park .
One of us told us to take a safari to roam inside .
