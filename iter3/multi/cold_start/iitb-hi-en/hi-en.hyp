Black box in your car
While America's road planners are battling the lack of money to improve the highway system, while many people are looking at the solution in a small black box, which fits on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every milestone run by a motor driver and communicates that information to the officers, has now become the issue of a controversial effort for Washington and the State Planning Office to revive the old system to fund the major roads of the US.
Generally, booming work like highway planning has also suddenly become an issue of deep debate and surviving alliances.
You have met with the Liberaterian Environmental Groups to support the government in favour of allowing them to use these black boxes to keep the miles drive, and possibly the drive space details - and then use this information to prepare a tax bill.
Tea party is a fool.
The US Citizen Freedom Association is also very worried raising various types of secrecy issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can go to such a system in the next decade, in which the driver will pay for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken black boxes for test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is actually a compulsory thing for our country.
"This is not a matter of choice or not being elected by us, it is to say that Hassan Ikhrata, who is the executive director of the South California government association, is planning to start tracking every milestone set by motor drivers in California by 2025.
We are going to change the way we pay taxes.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund has become almost bankrupt, which is funded by the payment of taxes on gas pumps by American citizens.
American people do not buy as much gas before.
Now in a gallon gas, the car runs more than ever before.
There was no increase in Federal Tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Due to high prices of gas, politicians avoid increasing one money in tax.
Transport Policy expert Lee Munikh at Minesota University says, "Gas tax is not communicable at all.
Their state has recently set up a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run, it will work as the most logical option."
Wonx is called mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea seems to be good for urban liberals, because for example, taxes can be changed to change the modalities of running cars, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gas.
California's planners are eager to this system while they are developing strategies to fulfill the target set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip Bill Shuster (A-PA) also considers Black Box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors in the Region Foundation are also in favor of paying per miles by the driver.
The Vice President of the Policy in the Region, Adrian Moor said, "This is not the only thing that is going to the blind well."
People are paying more directly for what they are receiving.
This campaign has also been supported by two former US Transport Secretaries, who had graceed to move forward in the year 2011 towards paying per mile to the Congress.
US Senate had sanctioned a 90 million dollar test project last year, which included 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing such persons who have to go to work daily or go to the city, the leadership of the House ended the proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving forward in this direction themselves.
It has the most interested oragon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of gas tax to the state.
Newada has already completed the preliminary test.
New York city is also moving forward in this direction.
Elinois is examining with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along with the Eastern Cebord, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support at all places.
In Nevada, where this device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers shortly ago, the driver was very supposed to think that the government could monitor every step of them.
Alauddin Khan, who directed the strategic and performance management management in the Navada Transport Department, says "Big Brother and other things of the same kind" were a major problem.
This is not a thing that people wanted.
With the proceeding of the test, ACLU of Newada had warned on its website: "It would be very easy to convert these devices into full trekking device."
There is no need to develop a vast, uncontrollable technology infrastructure, which must be spreading in an individual's daily record of visits.
Nevada is one of the many states that are making every effort to achieve affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how many miles the car is going on every day, but not where and when it is going on.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to the small California Start-up called Tru Miles.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the device that it is testing is good for highway planners, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modem at a fixed time interval.
Chief Executive of True Miles Ryan Maurison said, "If you do not track the speed and place of the people, then they will be more interested in adopting this method.
There have been some big mistakes in these initial programs of the state.
There are very less expensive and less interfering methods to do so.
In Organ, the planners are using different options to the drivers.
They can select the device of GPS or without GPS.
Or you can not choose any device again, but you can choose to pay the prescribed fee on the basis of average miles fixed by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this concept can be sold to the concerned citizens by providing more facilities rather than less in the device.
In New York City, Transport Officers are trying to develop a taxing device that will also facilitate payment of parking meter fees, "According to your drive, payment insurance will be provided, and a collection of actual time data from other drivers, which can be used to avoid motor-driven traffic."
The City Planning Document has been mentioned, "Moter operators will be attracted for participation due to the benefits received from this."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all the discussions on payment according to miles are a big deal.
In the San Francisco Gulf region, the Metropolitan Transport Commission has said that Congress can deal with the problem of bankruptcy highway trust fund by increasing gas tax.
The drivers of hybrid or other cars can also be charged with additional one time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use much gas so that they pay their proper share.
Randy Rentsheller, Director of the Legislature and Public Affairs of the Commission said, "When the aspirin can work, then what is the need for rough surgery for him.
If we do this, then millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died due to drowning.
Of course, his friend has been detained by the police for hiding the departed goods with him.
The police has submitted the final report of the investigation of death in the court.
It is known that on August 26, the police had recovered the body of ahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Darya.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his mobile and other belongings were missing.
In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and it was found that his phone is being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman told in the inquiry that she has given this phone to her relative Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in Padshahi Bagh and he was a friend of late ahid.
Ruhail went to Jhelum with ahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
ahid opened his clothes and kept all the goods on the edge, while Ruhal went on the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, ahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhail searched ahid, but he did not get it.
On this, he picked up his mobile phone, clock and other items and kept it for his use.
He did not tell anyone that ahid was drowned.
Police told the court that ahid's death was drowned and it was also confirmed in the post-mortem.
Of course, Ruhail has been taken into custody under Section 404 to hide the facts and the luggage of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister 77-year-old Silvio Berlusconi, popularly known for Bunga-Bunga parties, has married a 28-year-old girl in a very intelligence manner.
This is revealed by his family friend Marthel Polanko.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been the Prime Minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francisco Pascal in his personal chapel.

This was not a public function.
This marriage took place in the private chapel located in the former Prime Minister's house.
Apart from this, no one can tell anything.
However, he did not go to this marriage.
He has sent his congratulations to Navjode.
Both of them married about three weeks ago ie 8 or 9 October.
About 8 months ago, a 28-year-old woman from her 50-year-old Francisco Pascal was engaged.
To avoid Kirkiri, Berlusconi had made the basis of loneliness behind his decision.
In the lower areas, the rain continued in the middle of the sun's eye-michauli.

Asaram, who was lodged in jail for sexual harassment, was once again disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being presented as a drakula of children's blood, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop the news about Asaram and said that he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere in it.
When they are getting information from the police and others, how can we stop them
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media that he was showing news about them.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They should file a case against whom they should file, but the bench was not affected by these arguments and refused to intervene in the matter and said that they have more options.
Even before this, the court has rejected Asaram's demand for a ban on media coverage.
Officials of the department claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case so far.
The group operator of the mall cut the TDS and paid to the related financial institutions, but did not pay it in the government treasury.
By doing so, the money of TDS kept depositing itself.
On October 17, the search team from Mumbai on this group took action in collaboration with the Jaipur Exploration Team.
In the investigation of this link, it was found that this trader has cut TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team started the action of the Income Tax Survey on this group on Thursday.
The risk of sealing the account was raided and survey action was taken on the group of the mall operator about 15 days ago.
Angered by this action, this merchant has clearly told the Income Tax Department officials that they are not ready to pay TDS rupees to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is continuously targeting them and taking action.
Officials investigating in this case have clarified that in case of non-payment, the recovery action will be taken by sealing the account.
Given Deepawali, demand for sweets increases.
In view of this, the sale of poor and fake cattle increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more shiny, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Department of Food and Pharmaceutical Administration has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemical sweets.
The department seized a spoon of 5 thousand from Mawa and uetta Colony of 70 thousand from Madhya Pradesh.
With the increase in the demand for sweets in the market, the demand for poor flesh from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The information department got the information to bring the poor mave kept in dirt from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
Nagpur is being consigned with the transport garage.
The department took possession of this cattle, which was valued at Rs 70 thousand.
The fear of action did not give any right to the cattle.
The department destroyed it as an undeclared property.
The department raided Jitendra Caters located in uetta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand spoons.
The chemical named Sodium Hydrosulphate was used to shine and stay for more days.
Its sample will be sent to the laboratory.
SS Deshmukh, co-chairperson of the department said that the campaign for chemical sweets and poor and fake mawa will continue.
In the next few days, information has been given by the department to speed up this campaign.
Consumption of these sweets can also be disturbed.
The department asked sweet businessmen to make sweets from good milk, flesh.
People have been appealed to be cautious of fake sweets and cattle.
Selected 42 senior leaders of the state BJP received a strong welcome at the airport.
It is notable that Modi has come on a tour of Bihar for the Satwana Yatra organized by the BJP.
The consolidation journey is the exercise of embarrassing the families of the people killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is notable that during the Hunkar rally of Narendra Modi on October 27 in Patna, there were seven blasts after one.
The intention of the terrorists of Indian Mujahideen, who were involved in the blasts, was to make a stampede during the rally, so that more and more people were casualties and there was an atmosphere of panic in the state.
The intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared a martyr by the BJP.
Party leaders have come out on a journey from Thursday with bones and bones from their village.
On November 5, the bones of all of them will be flown together in the Ganges in Patna.
Satwana Yatra is organised as part of this journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of people killed in the blasts from seven o'clock on Saturday morning and meet their families.
During this meeting, they will also provide a check of five to five rupees to the families of the dead.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
The Indian team, excited by the blasting victory in the last match, will have to capture the series with the victory of the seventh and last one day against Australia at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
After two consecutive one-day matches were washed due to the rain, India had to win Nagpur ODI in any case to remain in the series and its batsmen gave a record victory while performing a blast, so that the team got equal to 2-2 in the series.
Team India has achieved the goal of more than 350 runs twice in the series and once again the responsibility of crossing the team will be on the batsman.
Indian batting is at the peak at this time and the biggest goal is also proving to be in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have great expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, the team has got such a salute pair in the form of Rohit and the summit which is making the work of the rest of the batsman easier with concrete partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he gave Virat an opportunity to play without any pressure while making a grand partner in the opening.
On the third number, Kohli has performed so far, he is considered to be Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
Rather, many cricket Pandits have termed them better than Sachin.
Virat, who is going to be 25 years old next week, has set up 17 ODF centuries, out of which India has won 16.
Following the goal, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can be harmful for the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were floping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even opened accounts in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, for them, Bangalore can work as a good innings 'lifeline' in One Day.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially Captain George Beli, have influenced everyone with his performance.
They are also demanding to be taken to the test team for domestic access series against England.
Australia has good batsman up to number ninth.
Apart from Beli, Shen Watson, Glen Maxwell, Adam Vogs and James Fockner have done good batting in the series.
However, Fil Hunge and Aron Finch have not left any effect in opening.
The lack of Michelle Johnson in bowling can be huge for Australia.
Johnson, who has so far performed a magnificent performance in the series, has been sent home for preparations for the Ashage series.
BJP National Executive member and Chief Spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this pretense peace.
Referring to the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing the heel peak to infiltrate around 2000 terrorists prepared in its training camps.
For this, he will never let peace on the border.
After the failure of the separatists to spoil the situation on a large scale by provoking people in Kashmir, Pakistan has worsened even more.
Referring to the Pakistani tour of separatists last year, the BJP leader said that the ISI Chief Lt Gen ahir ul Islam, Lashkar, Hizbul gangster Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be given air in 2014.
Pakistan is engaged in fulfilling this promise seriously.
Suicide attacks in the killing of soldiers on the border, Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for ending the privileges of the army in such a situation as fatal, the BJP leader said that it is also anti-people to do such things till there is a permanent peace in the state.
These help anti-national elements.
He emphasized that the statements of the leaders, the morale of the security forces should be banned.
Snow Dan ready to collaborate with Germany on American vigilance
American intelligence informer Edward Snow Den has declared that Germany is ready to visit Berlin to give evidence to Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its Director Kith Alexander fail to answer their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stro Belley met Mr Snow Den Seguruwar in Russia, where he has been sheltered to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter presented by Mr Snow Den before the media in Berlin on Friday: "However, the results of my efforts are positive, my government believes in disagreement as a party change, and does not provide any rescue, which is an attempt to criminalize political speech with allegations of pandalism.
However, speaking the truth isn't a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snow Den said that he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US Justice Department include theft of the intelligence and the government's property.
Hans Peter Friedrick, German Interior Affairs Minister told Online Jeit: Mr Snow Den is ready to talk to German officials, we have to find ways to make it possible.
The relationship between the US and Germany has come under pressure because the NSA has bugged the phone of Chancellor Angela Markel.
Thomas Operman, MP who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, supervises intelligence information. He said that if Mr. Snow Den had the opportunity to cry as a witness, "Indeed, it should be taken without completely ruining relations with the United States and bringing them in danger."
A Green Party MP from Mr. Snow Beley, Germany published a picture of himself with Mr. Snow Den on Twitter feed.
He said that two German journalists were on their trip to Russia.
Mr. Belene said that, according to former NSA contractor lawyer, if he left Russia, Snow Den is not able to return to Russia.
If Snow Den gives testimony in Germany, he will be safe there which will need assurances, the MP said.
Mr. Snow Den said in his letter that he had to face a fearless and sustainable campaign, he had to be forced to leave home.
However, he said that the world is happy and overwhelmed by widespread reactions to his work of political expression.
In addition to the United States - world citizens as well as high officials have estimated the revelation of a responsible system of comprehensive monitoring of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to collaborate with German officials , When problems of humanity have been resolved .
Rontier Airlines will charge Carry - On Baggage
Rontier Airlines plans to charge 100 to store the goods for the passengers on their aircraft board.
Rontier Airlines plans to start charge for 100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge 2 for coffee or soda, although on Wednesday it announced that the passengers can keep the entire box.
New Carry - On fee is for bags in overhead bin, so, small bags under the seat will still be charged free.
Rontier said that  25 will charge if paid in advance, 100 will have to wait if the passengers wait to pay until they are on the gate.
Rontier Spokesperson Kate O'Mailie said that 100 fees have to be obtained to take care of the charge in the advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him, he said.
Airlines started charge for the first and second check bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid passenger fees as much as they can do in the carry-on baggage, which is stashed in overhead box, means that this box is often less space.
There's a way to bring less to the passengers on the fee board.
O'Mally said that it's not really about mobilizing new charge money.
It's for the most loyal customers about Rontier that looking for overhead bin's place has become very difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets in their website of the airline do not have to give it.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay  100 for the same bag, while a passenger in the line on a frontier gate can get a bag free.
O'Mailly said that the processes of Rontier's website and check-in are being changed to ensure that passengers know about fees before getting the gate.
Rontier's new carriage - On fees will not start till summer, though a date has not been fixed.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction over baggage fees and other fees, but the airlines like them.
They argue that money is spent to handle the baggage, and those who want the passenger service should pay for it.
Many are looking at the baggage fees on the Wall Street as a sign that many airlines are charged enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of deficit.
Most of them, however, don't even touch the carry-on bag fee.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the Carry on fee for the first time three years ago, and the companion discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with one such fee, the other airline is Hungary's i Air, which Airline Adviser J Sorensen said, and who tracks the Ad-on-Fees.
He said that Spirit's Carry-on Feed brings  50 million in a year, which was estimated in the report of December 2011.
A former official of Sorensen, Midwayste Airlines recently flew in Spirit and the passengers had to face the carry-on abnormal bag fees on the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was simple, he said.
I hoped to roast teeth and look out on a fight gate.
"The glory was filled and they said that this licketty-split was offered.
Rontier is also following 2 fees for coffee, tea, soda, or spirit for juice.
Rontier said that those travellers who take soda, or juice can keep the entire box, and this free coffee will give only once.
It'll still remove the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge the drinks in 2008, but after the complaint of the passengers, they retreated after seven months and followed any other main airline after being there.
If Trantier's passengers don't buy directly from the airline, this step of Rontier to charge the fee on the carry-on is its latest attempt to operate customers towards their own website.
Airlines pays online travel vendor rbit for such 10 to 25 each sold ticket.
This is the reason why all the airlines have been given an incentive to operate the passengers to buy directly from those people instead of going through an online travel agency.
Drontier, however, has gone ahead in this area.
Several times in September the flight started giving half a miles away for the customers who bought from these individuals from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 percent of the trip miles.
So, a 1000 miles rantier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It also allows them to choose their seat in advance for the only passengers when they buy directly from the Rontier website.
In Denver of Rontier, there is a loyal base of customers in his hometown, but its business is decreasing and it's losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and its flight capacity has decreased by approximately 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results released by the Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to decide the financing of Rontier as part of the sale of airlines.
NSA accused the "internal error" instead of hackers to be a website crash
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical shortage, our website was closed for a few hours, not due to hackers, as some people claimed online.
In an email statement sent by the intelligence agency, "NSA.gov was not in touch for several hours this night, which was due to internal error during the pre-determined update.
This problem will be solved this evening.
This claim is not true that this obstacle came due to the distributed denial of service [DDOS].
On the evening, the online server trackers had found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site for some users is still not available.
NSA spokesman told ABC News that "There was no coordination" with the internal, sensitive network of the agency.
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hectic group has online claimed that they are responsible for interrupting the website of NSA by the DDOS attack.
DDOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent so much on the target website till the site is closed due to the server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively undefined and the aim of the attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of the system.
The former highly mysterious NSA, which was never named "No such agency", has become a subject of discussions and bitter criticism among the common people in the last months with a large number of incidents of foreign and domestic espionage programmes, which was collectively disappeared by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, secreted NSA files from the agency and after revelation.
Due to such a growing controversy about the agency, after the night incident, such speculations were made that this incident was the result of targeted cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the story of 'One and Dronacharya' showing harmony in the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's perspective, in which fleets the hostage is forced to walk on the wrong path.
The drama was jointly inaugurated by Chief Guest MLA Prabdiyal Valmiki, Vice President of the Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
The drama showed the similarity of Dronacharya of the Dwapar era and presently the circumstances of a professor Arvind.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bitan, Hemant Goyal, Border Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. performed a grand presentation with the characters.
The light system in the drama was designed by young colorer Jitendra C. Raj and set by Hemant Kumar.
Subsequently, a variety of awards were given to the legends of literary, cultural contributors on behalf of Apta.
In this, Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Head of Urdu Department of Charan Singh University, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and colorful Jitendra C. Raj were given.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. contributed to the executive officials in making the event successful.
Bombardier's profit declining as a delivery of aircraft, declining orders
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a declining of 15 per cent in the net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter of its train unit and on contract issues, less than the aircraft order and pressure by delivery.
Montrial based Bomberdier also released any flight test data for his brand new Ceries aircraft or his ambitious program to go to commercial service from next September did not present an update on issues.
After the first flight of the test aircraft, approximately half a month ago, it has been flying just three times, the question has been raised whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result has fallen less than forecast and shares have been sent to Toronto stock exchange for more than 8 percent sliding.
Analyst share with Camroon Dorsen, National Bank Financial on Thursday reduced its rating for 'regional exhibition' on Thursday, the stock is limited to one or two quarters.
"The heavy aircraft delivery was mostly accredited, we are clearly disappointed with marginal performance in transportation," Doressen said in a client note.
We will get a new order for the Bombardier Cerries as the progress of the flight testing programme.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, there is doubt that the market program will be doubted.
Bombardier hopes that the aircraft families can now cut it down at the low end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and the flight was carried out for the first time in September after the delay.
Potential buyers wait for the result of the flight testing to accept the company's claims about new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings, but as the permanent order for CCERIS is between 177.
403 total orders and commitments are available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Bodoin believed that Bombardier would complete his 300 firm order target since the first jet in commercial use.
Officials assured the analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was going on according to the schedule.
"The testing aircraft had lived on the ground for a long time as predictable," Bodoin said in a conference call, adding it was also fixed during the interval of land testing and software update aircraft.
Every manufacturer makes a different schedule.
We decided to take a first flight and a update period and said what we did.
That's the reason that the flight will be all through the program.
The second remaining part of five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks with the following:
Yet, analysts believe that customers are doubting that after their first flight in the first 12 months, a Ceriz aircraft can start operations.
Bombardier has said that this service schedule has been evaluated in the entrance and will provide an update in the next few months.
This slow speed of the flight test - although in line with the Internal Schedule of the Bombardier - reinforces our views , the service will be pushed into 115 , Dorsen said .
For the third quarter ending on September 30, the net benefits of the Bombardier fell up to 9 cents a year ago,  147 million, or per share 8 cents, 172 million, or per share.
Per share adjusted income was unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue  4.2 billion to  4.1 billion minor drowned.
According to analysts Thomson Roytors IBS, the revenue of 10 per share cent and 4.56 billion was expected.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said that one year ago, 45 aircraft were handed over during the quarter below 57.
The pure order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
Backlog in the Aerospace Division was 32.9 billion on September 30, no change since December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the consumption of the following sequences and the market situation was totally disappointed, Bodoin said.
Aerospace revenue declined by 13 percent in  2 billion.
Bombardier said that the world's largest train manufacturer, revenue in the division increased by about 11 per cent for 2.1 billion.
Orders in the Transport Unit were backlogs about 32.6 billion from September 30, above a minor December 31.
Some major contracts in the margin of the transport division were also affected by the issues of execution.

The new research has shown that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
Do not lie to anyone and think of stealing or cheating.
But as soon as the evening, our mind changes and we keep the ideal on one side and start walking against the rule.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of Harvard University and David Eclass School of Business of YouTO.
According to researchers, in the morning, we prefer ethical values while not being stressed, but in the evening, honesty decreases due to tiredness or more pressure.
Researchers used two experiments for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For instance, people had to tell that the point is more on the left or on the right side.
Those who took part were told that if they give wrong answers instead of the correct answer, they will be given money.
It was seen in this experiment that those who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, while experimenting people from 12 pm to 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their Osools in mind.
With this, researchers managed to prove that the greed of money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but as soon as the evening, we stop paying attention to ethics.
This research has been published in the latest issue of psychological science.

Mr. Big was imprisoned by Koken's Addi lawyer who gave secret information about police investigations
42-year-old Basharat Ditta used to inform the infamous criminal Neel Scarboro
The advocate felt that people could know about his confidential drug addiction .
He was sentenced to three years by the Liverpool Crown Court
The defendant's top lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid, people will know about his secret addiction of drugs, three years of imprisonment.
After compromising with the addiction of his cocaine, the 42-year-old Barashat Ditta provided sensitive confidential information about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities to the notorious criminal Neel Scarboro.
This advocate, who was given the fame of "bash", and whose criminals were praised as "Top Brief", was arrested in Scarboro after police monitoring operations in his house in 2011, which he represented in the previous Narcotics trial.
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarboro keeping three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lankashire, while he went out with his colleagues for a law society dinner.
After getting cocaine particles in the detta hair, its buttocks, and its credit card, it was found in the investigation that Detta was a regulatory user of drugs of A category.
During the period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to get illegal information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarboro and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the main investigation of heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Merceside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other persons who were sent to jail after the police seized more than 1.5 million pounds of heroin and cocaine, and more than 200,000 pounds during several raids.
The 42-year-old Ditta used to provide information to the criminals, because he feared that people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
After being found guilty in two cases of interrupting the path of justice after the trial lasted for three weeks in the Detta, Liverpool Crown Court, working in the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackband, today Liverpool was facing disappointment in the Crown Court.
He had admitted about keeping cocaine in the previous hearing.
The worst time of the lawyer started when while investigating Scarboro, the police came to know that he was regularly in touch with Ditta from February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and keeping a drug with more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer's bin in Black Golf Glove.
After the drug was kept, Scarboro was in regular contact with Ditta, who went out for dinner at Blackner Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching the house, the lawyer came to know that there was a drug and there was a communication between them nine times.
It was heard in the court that when the clues of A category drugs were found on the hair, butts and credit cards of the detta, it was found to be a regulated user of cocaine in the test.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said that he was talking to the suspect dealer, because he was his client and said that his discussion was a matter of "different privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove a lot of credit cards by taking out his batua, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run his office along with his workplace, and his clients used to call at his house for legal matters.
After telling the main persons arrested what the detective knew about them, it was said in the court hearing that Detta used to call the main people of the drug supply chain, some of which he had earlier presented the case.
On behalf of the prosecution, Anny White said, "The criminal advocate should know the best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his post as a criminal advocate, adding a lot to his specific client.
We are not talking about the normal drug dealer, but also about the dealer who is providing drugs to our lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly have been legal without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went ahead of his border of lawyer-client relationship.
As much as he was possible, he interrupted the investigation of the police so that he would be able to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not honouring his profession but insulting.
He made very close proximity to certain clients, especially from Scarboro, and he allowed the agreement with his independence.
Ditta refused to do any wrong work and claimed that "If I was a corrupt lawyer, whom I am not, and if I want to provide information to Mr. Scarboro, I do not wait for 15 hours, but I immediately do this work."
But after the hearing, Superintendant Lee Helstead of the Lancashire Police said that at the time when Mr. Ditta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, at the same time he converted himself to criminal advocate.
Due to the addiction of his cocaine, he compromised excessively and became very weak to the objectives of the leading members of the organised crime groups who used it to get important information related to police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of faith and confidence in the people.
Shri Ditta has deceived this belief and tried to avoid his profession.
The critical and organized crime unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta, in which he was found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and now interrupting the path of justice, showing our commitment to bring criminals to court.
This matter should be warned for criminals that no person is away from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarboro was awarded 14 years of imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and bee.
Twenty-five other members involved in the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself, in which he said that his fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for the death penalty client in the US, Mohammed Ali's dinner guest and inequality should be inspired for his work.
Kenya's press upset over disputed media law
Challenging the bill as unconstitutional, the newspaper said that "This is a horrific place, and it is valid to ask: What is it to prevent the independence of the judiciary from snatching the independence of the judiciary in the coming days"

The theme of Mozambique ' s security concerns increases as a powerful confrontation .
With a idol of Mozambique founder President Samora, who was staring down on him, thousands of people gathered in central maputo for slogans of peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back, we want stability, Venesa D Susa, Chief Executive Officer of an investment company said.

The conflict between government forces and Ray Namo for two weeks has been reported almost every day, since 20 years before a peace agreement.
Ray Namo was once again a part of the efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country, then there was an infamous revolt of the movement supported by the White-ruled Rodesia and the Rang-Beed Government of South Africa.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that there is no possibility of returning to the country's entirely developed struggle, but recent incidents have encouraged foreign investors and local people.
The stake has been high for the fast growing economy. Some of the companies, including Rio Tinto, Brazil Well, Ni, can be brought out of the investment of more than 50 billion in the next year.
Since the ruling Relimo Party, 1975, the main political power, and Ray Namo blames each other for tension.
Ray Namo says that the government started the latest struggle by starting attacks on its members in Sofa La province, traditional one Ray Namo Garh on October 17.
The attack on the former rebels and the government forces attacked the Renmo bases and told the Financial Times to try to kill the spokesman of Afonso Dhaka Maa, group leader, Fernando Majang, Re Namo.
Accusing the government of attacking the soldiers, the confrontation is considered guilty of Ray Namo for the trigger.
President Armando ibuzhan has asked for absurd concerns about instability.
Mr. ibuzhan told the AFP, French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a favourite, "Wherever he is, he has been trying to prove his forces that he can implement his own decision on the government.
Both Free Lemo and Re Namo insist that they want to avoid war .
Mr . Majhang was quoted as saying , Ray Namo had canceled the 1992 Peace Agreement , but later became a matter of concern .
He told HT that means that the agreement is not being honored by free limo
Our vision is to come back to the agreement talks, but seriously, Mr. Majhane said.
The last talks between the two sides did nothing special to reduce the tension of a series of this year's struggle.
"This is about two big men (Jibuzhan and Dhakama) fighting together, Yusuf Han, a lecturer and mozambique expert said at the London Open University.
Neither are good negotiators nor are they ready to make concessions types.
Ray Namo, insisting on election reforms, had already said about the boycott of municipal elections to be held in November.
The President and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an effort to win concessions and economic robbery from the government.
Ray Namo's share in voting has been declining since 1992, while a new party was created by a former Ray Namo member, in which the democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM) is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Majhang, says Shri Jibujhanko, who has left the post at the end of his second term next year, wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He does not want a multilateral democracy, he does not want to leave Presidentship because he does not want peace, he does not want a transparent election, Shri Majhang said. "
What kind of capacity has not been cleared by Ray Namo, but he has done a major visit to the police stations and vehicles on the North South Highway to interrupt hit and run ..
Most of the clashes are in La province, at a distance of several hundred kilometres in the north of Jomaputo, in which the host is Bira Port, who rely on exporting minerals, coal including Rio Tinto and the valley.
After threatening to attack the Ray Namo Line, Rio suspended his experiment for nearly a week in June.
Whether Ray Namo could repeat this danger or not, Mr. Majhangwineet was almost asked.
Ray Namo Cheese was not going well in Mozambique who wanted to warn the international community, Mr. Majhang said.
The government of instability further enhanced the throats, Fernando Leema, Media Cop, says, who is the head of an independent media company, many people are also worried about corruption, slow pace of development and recent floods of abductions.
"People are the government and the President responsible for the future of the country, and it seems that they should be one to find solutions for problems, "We say."
Omar Sultanate, a displayer, people still need stability.
"No one cares about Ray Namo and Free Lemo, they just want peace again, they want to reach free for roads, they said.
Children should be taught friends and legends as models for a way of living writer.
Thor's stories can show the microscopic forces have no combination of all the moves, while the significance of a dream in the Arthurian stories shows.
In order to teach many of the myths, it would not be appropriate to teach this in obscene and schools even far away from the wildlife and in some cases, Cross Lee Holland advocated a "social selection" from the appropriate works of the age.
"I think it seems surprising, in America, myth and folk songs are already a part of the field of education, he said.
I'm advising it as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers more encouraging  and this is a new turn for children , as well as messages are being presented in entertaining stories .
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated BioWulf from Anglo Saxon, along with writing Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk stories, he said, "Your intentions can be a lot but it will be better to keep it out of view.
Perhaps an adult writer for a child and adult writer requires some meanings of hope for a big difference between an adult.

The appeal court heard the arguments on Tuesday on the request migration.
The appeal court has said that because he compromised the need for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in part of a series of media interviews and differentiate the code of conduct for the American judges by the public, so the case of the judge should be removed, publicly to criticize the statements of the court should be answered.

Colson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
The former editor of the News of the World, Endy Colson, has been accused that he used phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about Charles Clark's home secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Adis C told Old Bailley that News of the World had heard a wrong rumor in May 2005 that Clark was meeting with his "Advisor Special Adviser Hannah Polbi".
It was said in the court that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glen Mussoorie to hack Polbi's voicemail and keep that male nurse, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Adis said that "Employment side's suggestion is that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside the people's house and keep an eye on them, but he keeps an article before the people, see what people reaction to it. "
He said that NOTW used three ways to examine cases: phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face.
In the third, the editor himself was involved.
It is obvious that he knew about other methods i.e. Nigarni, he definitely knew.
What about the first one
Did he know about phone hacking
He says, no, we say that "Yes, he knew absolutely."
Rumor about Clark's contemporary relations was presented by Feature Desk of AOTW for the first time when a sex interested source in Ms. Polbi had said: "Do not waste your time, it is with Charles.
In August 2006, the tape of Woysmail was seized at least three times from the house of Ms. Polbi, Ms. Polbi.
Investigators also found such entries in the computer of the private investigator on which Ms. Polbi and his sister were named "Project".
During the period where he was being investigated, the information was sought by calling anonymity to Ms. Polbi's grandmother and grandmother.
During this time, former Chief Reporter Navili Thurlbek and former reporter James Weatherup looked at the visit of Ms. Polbi.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him through a voicemail: "I have got a story, which we are planning to run tomorrow, about which I would definitely like to talk to Charles. "
Mr. Adis said that the inclusion of the callson in this case is in the parton with other important persons, such as former Home Secretary David Blonket.
The judiciary heard on Thursday that, Colson talked to Mr. Blonket about Pranya relations with a married woman, while at that time she was watching the case of co-protective Rebekha Brooks, who was married at that time.
Colson and Brooks refused to do misconduct with other people to hack the phone between October 3, 200. and August 9, 2006.
Mussoorie, Thurlbek and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.
NSA revelations on State Monitoring promote corporate fears .
In August, late on a quiet day, a German police helicopter called on the US Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Office (B) to protect the Constitution, the mission of German domestic intelligence agency was to take a picture of the roof of the US post, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundisbank.
The German media asked the BB to express hope to identify the presence of Lisoning Antenna and indicated an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper, director of American National Intelligence stressed that the US should use its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trading mystery of foreign companies and increase the international competitiveness of American companies or increase the line below them.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has made a whistleblover, the treasure of his mysteries started to tell the American surveillance, the leaders of the European governments and the business world are no longer sure that the director does not follow his promise.
The American National Security Agency spies on Brazil ' s oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers , Google and Yahoo , and Yahoo , expressed fear of state monitoring .
The last thing came when it came to know that Chancellor Angela Markel's phone was bug, perhaps a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful persons can be targeted, then certainly the leaders of the business world are also making possible targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between American intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be viable to use these data for mutual benefit .
Germany should be awakened, says the President of Oliver Grn, BITMI, who represents small and medium size German IT companies.
According to a survey published by the Consultancy of German companies in July, the US has now become almost a big risk like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data to steal.
In all the articles, there is no evidence leaked by Mr Snowden, however, that the US has visited the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union and should try to reduce their dependence on the United States.
The leaders of the business world are doubting this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and gradually open them again...
Hasso Platner, Chairman of German Business Software Company SAP, said, "This is no way."
If a strong European IT industry wanted, then it was not allowed to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is concessional, from coal to car, farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Revelations highlighted by Snowden about American technical discovery and espionage access have proved to be a trauma for some companies who had earlier believed that the biggest surveillance threat is China .
There is a major change in the cloud computing segment where the European officials are more aware that the data collected in the United States is under the jurisdiction and therefore have become possible sensitivity .
According to a survey excluded by Cloud Security Alliance, a business organization, some 10 percent of non-US members canceled the plan to use a US-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, Co-Chief Executive Officer of SAP says, "We have seen a new question that did not come to the customers a year ago. He is - Where is my data collected" and can you guarantee that it will be physically in that jurisdiction
Many German officials argue that the latest report is just confirming what they already knew: that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable mysteries and data and therefore they should be guarded at every cost.
That is economic espionage, it is not a surprise.
This is always happening.
"This is a subject for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing changed, Cart Bock, chemical manufacturer BAS is called the Chief Executive.
American espionages on us at the commercial and industrial level and we also do , because it is in national interest to protect our business .
Corporate leaders are usually not interested in the defense system and it is a benefit for the attacker.
For big companies, it has been recording messengers for a long time, even if it is unable to leave one in the business from home with Usb Stick, or leaving a laptop in a hotel room, it is impossible to say at least.
Members of the Board of Car Manufacturer Audi, Elrich Hackenberg says that it is a year old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote listening devices.
The BB executive of Germany, while smart phones are compromising due to risks on foreign tours, advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile.
Prepaid mobile phones were then thrown later.
However, small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring, it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, many companies are the top in the global market in a special place.
Small and medium size companies often warn in a report to protect corporate secrets effectively against lack of experience, personnel and financial resources unauthorized access.
The US has warned other countries about the economic espionage of their own companies.
According to the French The Washington Post, the name of American national intelligence in February is named in another tear of criminals involved in hacking for economic information behind China with Russia and Israel.
According to a board member of a German Blue Chip Company, when the matter comes to economic espionage, French is the worst
In an interview, former head of the Bernard Sourcini French Internal Intelligence Agency URI, explains: "Services well know that even though all the countries cooperate in non-terrorist battles, spy on their colleagues.
American espionages on us at the commercial and industrial level and we also do , because it is in national interest to protect our business .
No fools made.
"The parents of Georgia's teenager killed in an unprecedented accident believe that his son was murdered"
A teenager from Georgia, whose dead body was found wrapped in his high school gym, believes that his son was murdered, the family's advocate said on Thursday.
Valdosta, GA K K. K. K. K. K. K. Johnson was found trapped in a straight standing mat behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators of Londess County Sheriff concluded that Johnson died in a "nough accident", but the family of 17-year-old boy denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Rangp, who presented Kenneth and Jackline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "He fully believes that his son has been murdered."
They do not believe in death in the manner told by Sheriff.
The order said that "He believes that this thing is beyond the logic of physical rules and general intelligence."
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of a person or people responsible for the death of his son.
He said that he sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag
US Advocate General Michael Mulere said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation about Johnson's death, seeing that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the reason for death
Did his murder happen due to any crime
Mure said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will comply with the facts, wherever they take us.
My purpose is to bring the truth forward.
He said that "I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation."
Moore told the reporter that the initial corpse test indicates that Johnson's death resulted in static respiratory respiratory.
According to Moore, there was a different reason for death in a second body test.
He said that "There are many questions, which should be answered or confirmed."
Moore also said that if he gets enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, then he will ask F.B.I. to do it.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not available immediately for comments from the Londage County Sheriff's office.
On Wednesday, the judge of South Georgia ordered the officers to issue all the monitoring videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say that they hope that the video footage will get some indications that how he died.
CDC releases allergy guidelines for children for schools
On Wednesday, the Disease Control and Prevention Center issued guidelines to control the food allergy of children in the school.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the US Government as the number of children going to school is increasing due to food allergy.
Now in the US, one of the 20 children has food allergy.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, the cases of food allergy in children have increased by 18 percent.
In this direction, schools have been informed how teachers and employees should be informed about the food allergy of children and how to handle it in case of any allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to keep an epinephrine stock to face prospectively deadly hypertension (Anafilexis) - which is the auto-injectioner of the APPAN Brand, which is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, so that the schools can easily keep the stock of epinephrine in large quantities.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It seems that something is kissing in my tongue, "It seems that there is hair on my tongue, or "My tongue is swinging."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose sex of their children undefined
Germany has become the first country of the European Union, which has recognized the third sex for the children born with vague genitals.
Now newborn children will not be specified in an orthodox manner.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare sex for such children, this law allows them to declare sex "undefinite or "definite" on the birth certificate of the child.
The objective of the new law is to reduce pressure on parents who can take quick decisions related to gender-definition surgery for newborn children, and to fight against discrimination against intersex children.
According to BBC, an intersex person had said years later, "No I am a male, neither a woman.
I will remain a wounded, stained patent made by the doctors.
According to estimates, one of the 2,000 children every year is such a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which comes under the investigation of gender development disorders, is a collective word used for abnormal chromosome, genital glands or abnormally developed sex.
It may be that Valis Simpson is intersex.
Gender identification is still not understood properly, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender is not determined, it is better to use the best information to specify gender and get surgery, if such a child comes, inspect the psychological and physical development of the child.
Dr. Jack Dresher, a psychologist of New York City, who is a specialist in sex-recognition affairs, said that the new law of Germany seems to be "good".
Intersex generates moral confusion.
He said, "Some people are in a state of life-consciousness, for which surgery is needed, but it does not happen with most children.
You can specify the sex without surgery, and then see how the identification develops.
The science of knowing how a sex will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No person can give a proper answer about this why this happens.
It is a kind of puzzle that why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, Intersex people have been described as transsexual or transgender people, because their position is not related to sex, but related to its biological composition, which is neither obviously male nor female, but either jointly or none of the two is clearly defined.
These features can display themselves secondary gender characteristics such as the weight of muscles, distribution of hair, breast and length primary gender characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or chromosome structure and hormone.
The report also provides symposium of discrimination faced by Intersex and Transgenders in the field of jobs, as well as oppression, violence and bias crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-favourable sex.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark adults, women or third gender on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norry Me-Welby became the world's first recognised sexless person after winning the legal appeal to keep life-to-day "definite sex status".
According to the internal ministry, in addition to M or F in German passport, there will be a third specification in the form of  for Intersex persons.
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring countries France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed a petition to withdraw sex theory from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed this law of Germany, "When the world is going to such a state where the sex is an option to be elected, but not sexual activity, we are taking two more columns of civilization in the opposite direction. "
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told Baby one that she would like to see the children specified sex at the time of birth.
He said on the website about the upbringing, "The upbringing is very tense without the extra limits, especially if you do not even know what your child's sex is.
Children need stability and determination.
Historically, children born with both male and female reproductive organs were called Hermafrodetes (Ubhyalingi), who was in the name of beautiful Greek God who was biling.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world had considered the linga as a slate, which could be erased and written again.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they understand that sex and precaution is a complicated work, and sometimes there can be a mistake with doctors, who do not know what the children will feel about their sex specification when they grow up.
The dresser says, "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "monopolic emergency".
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgeries.
The current theory about the treatment of children with distinct reproductive genitals was presented by Dr. John Money, University of John Hepkins, who considered the sex as a golden manufacturing.
He composed the word sex identification and argued how social and environmental indicators - parents raise the child - interact with the genes and hormones of the child and determine that it should be identified as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, which is known as "Jonjoan", their principles became disputed.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex went accidentally into sex during the sex generation (circumcision) that they should completely bind the child and remove his ovary and take care of him like a girl.
The dresser said, "Mani presented that matter as a successful case of the postponement, but it did not happen.
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
The dresser said that some doctors are still following the same pattern.
But in the years after 1990, with the arrival of internet, the people passing through these sex surgeries started coming out, "The result is not happy."
The same case was with Montana's 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with .Y. Purusha chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
Doctors did not understand clearly that his sex was small, or his fugitive was big, but he was sure that he could never live a comfortable life as a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, the external organs of the bruce and the ovary were removed by surgery and his upbringing was done like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
He told ABNews.com, "I knew I am not a girl.
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, he was going to have vaginoplasty with him.
But while feeling depressed and some disturbances, he demanded medical records.
This showed him the terrible truth.
At the time of birth, I was bound up - and no one told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from making adequate testosterones, due to which his genitals could not be properly developed.
After knowing the truth, he became a man back, he took the dose of testosterone and removed his breasts.
Due to surgery, he became barren.
Today, he explains to the people about intersex persons in an organization called Interface Project to normalize their perception.
However, Anny Tammer-Mattis, Executive Director of the legal group of California-based Advocates for Informed Chauis, expresses concern that the law of Germany invites "chippy and stigma".
They say, "Somely active people feel that the law of Germany will inspire parents to make quick decisions and to make the child "undefinite."
We fear that it will encourage interference.
We feel that instead of waiting, it is a better process to specify male or female sex.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamar-Mattis said that his organization supports Australian law because it allows adults to be identified in the third sex.
He said, "Adults should be able to make their own decision about legitimate sex."
The law of Germany is related to specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a war fought by newborn children at this time.
If they grow up, they can take decisions related to their body.
But Pittsburg's Breast Radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter has sexual development disorders, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that Germany's law will provide empowerment to both parents and children.
Baratji's daughter Kati was born with male chromosomes, but she was a D.S.D. named full endrogen insensitivity conservation.
Since his endrogen was a fault in the grassroots, women's characteristics were developed in the cattle.
There is a vagina in his body but there is no uterus or ovary.
Now 29-year-old Kati is married and is a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at Pennsylvania University.
Although she is barren, she expects to be a mother through adoption or guest surrogacy.
Baratz said, "This law facilitates parents that they do not take any decision on their own in haste.
It gives them a proper understanding and time by some tests before writing men or women.
In this way, you are okay - raise the child, love the child.
You have a loved child and enjoy him.
We do not need to get such surgery in haste, which can not be returned.
He said, "This brings children in the process of taking decisions and frees parents from the evils that inspire parents because they do not believe that they are correct."
Finally, the child will determine what gender she is more simple - and it will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for their own.

In which students and others were given information about the rights of education and the law for economically backward people.

Report: Consider the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times , close advisers of President Barack Obama quietly considered Hillary Clinton instead of Biden for the post of Vice President for Ticket 2012 .
The most remarkable explosion in the revelation is that heavy recognition by Mark Halperine and John Helemon 2012 Campaign Tom, double down: Change Games 2012.
Times received a copy of the upcoming book and told Thursday evening that in order to get the top advisers of the President 's 'Vyasak Groups-Satresses' and to get the polling organized in late 2011, what can dumping Biden help in Obama's falling hope for the elections again .
According to Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book shows full information that the Chief Officers tried in the campaign and put the head of the former White House Staff for the name, to know what effects the changes from the Vice President of the former state.
Possible switch was a very safe mystery within the infrastructure of the Chicago campaign and within the Oval Office .
Only half a dozen President's close advisories, including former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxalrod and David Paluffa, were aware of the changes.
Double down claims that Dale tried to change Biden , despite his personal synergy , ultimately deciding when his information was telling him that Clinton ' s ticket would not improve Obama ' s situation .
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered the place of Clinton with Biden.
"I kept the whole sight in mind, and one of them, it was Dale told the newspaper.
You remember that at that time the presidential post was in danger, so we were in such a situation that "Pavitra Christ, what else will we do"
While Dale told the research as a precaution, Martin had told the Enderson Cooper of the UNN that again the election campaign invested significantly, how much benefit will this claim be given in search of the poll.
 The campaign does not spend on voting and focused groups like money until they are seriously considering something, Martin said on AC360.
It is obvious, although, did Obama know that his team is looking for change.
Martin told the CNN that he asked him whether his boss knew about possible reshuffle
While Dale said that he did not think the President knew about possible changes , the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was possible that Obama knew .
"Double down will definitely not answer whether Obama reached the desk by conducting a political inquiry" Martin told more.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought that Obama Biden did not know about dumping ticket research.
"Perhaps, Martin said.
Glo-in-The-Dark Ice Cream prefers
A British entrepreneur has made the world's first Glo-in-The-Dark Ice Cream - Jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken a lot of advantage of the maritime animal to develop the best breakfast.
This idea came to him after reading a research paper on the jailfish and China's convinced scientists used chemical brightness to shine the protein again.
Ice cream will increase the PH level of protein by reacting to the tongue of the eater and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that ice cream brightens with reacting to the heat of the mouth, i.e. wining will be more shining, as much as it will be shining.
Lick My IM Delicius Icecream Company founder Charlie said, "This is unbelievable, but initial days production me will get about 200 grams of goods.
The protein we're using in ice cream will react to the neutral PH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot, the protein will increase the PH level and the ice cream will be shiny.
We have been examining for the past few months and it seems to be absolutely right to share it on helovin because it gives a wonderful effect .
This is perhaps the most expensive ice cream that has made mane because the glimpse of jailfish is four times more expensive than gold .
So every scup costs me around 140 pounds .
Although Iska taste is very good.
Apne is famous for abnormal taste, including experimental company, beer, paneer, meat and gold leaves based in Charlie's bristle.
But his next composition is going to prove even more ambitious.
He said, "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.
It is naturally impossible that due to ice crystal, which makes a modification over the ice cream, but I think we will get a way to do it.
Ice Cream is the utility of a reflected qualities of a prisonfish which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists
The whole market was stuck with the customers in Rani Bagh Market.
It was a situation that people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.

Some similar views were also seen at Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town's Sarrafa shops.
Here too people bought gold and silver jewelry and coins.
For this reason, there was also a jam in other markets including the external ring road.
However, people coming out of the office had to spend hours in the jam to reach the house.

I hope for men that many zombis, and thanks will make our Instagram Feeds this year for the misery of the dead.
According to Google, the most searched dresses will be zombies, buttons, robbers and chicken.
I guess that there is no evil in being traditional.
Last year, we wore dogs and we were not alone with surprise.

According to the American power, in fact, there are 1200 officially sanctioned ghosts in the United States, which generates 500 million revenues and those terrible pictures that put your friend on Facebook and the man who looks like you and comments nice face.
Finally, talk about Kaddu.
Charlie Brown presented the great kaddu when we were children, and a Jack-o-Lalten carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - this is something we have done since we were small.
Fortunately, "Baby in a pampkin trend" started last year due to the pinterest, so many of us grew up by carving these guards and not being slept with them.
According to the US Census Bureau, this year, the US will spend around  106 million on the junk.
Jack-o-Gradually swimming lanterns might have grown from Ilinois on its front porch, which has increased from 542 million pounds this year.

Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time, we have been warned that independent Scottland will be required to join the entire Europe as a condition of EU membership.
Passport control on Barwick and indicates stories about the border of thorny wire on the walls of the hedrian.
It is true that the StrathClide Paper describes the potential economic benefits of independent movement with the rest of Europe, although it was not described in the forecast - Headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time in changing their formal rules according to their requirements.
Since Scotland is no longer the Shangen region, Brussels will actually get cheaper rebate for continuous non-compliance Brussels instead of getting whatsoever wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Kahani.
And the thing that has been stuck for such a long time has got stuck. First of all, I have heard "Independence" means passport control baseless news about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point was lost in rehearsing this interesting old story again.
Anyway, why should you expect the bidding of Europe from independent Scotland
Why should London's Yoke be bought for Brussels, especially now
Here is the real European news: The great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has been officially dead.
In the entire EU, dedicated parties are strengthening to oppose EU or to shut down Euro as the same currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroscopy Alternative for Germany Party - which has been established this year - suddenly came and obtained about fifty lakh votes in the federal elections of September, and thus free Democrats (the equivalent of our Lib Demes) effectively excluded the Bundestag.
The plan to build federal Europe has always been domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be a radical changer.
With the harsh rules imposed by Berlin and European Central Bank, due to the obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency, many people have to think that the project Europe has gone very far.
Euro's crisis did not play a very much role in the excessive budget deficit of national governments - it was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the Euro system stabilised the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency evaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in a state of underlying loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deep European productivity illness far ahead of the current budget and currency problems.
In order to exempt French and German energy firms on the expenditure of consumers - as a result of the green energy policies set up by Brussels, the European Industry doubles electricity for the United Nations and four times for gas.
This is a paralysis cost loss, which we have already seen in the Grangmouth.
To free all the wages in the world, the European Petrochemicals industry can not be saved from being affected by cheap US shell gas.
As a result, there is a feeling of revolt among the people, especially in France, which was once the main fan of the EU.
After the war, top French politicians had seen the EU as a means to control Germany, and to provide Paris equal billing to Washington in the world.
But Berlin does not need Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, due to which the economy of France is stagnating.
Result: Marine Lee Pen's right-wing EU anti-National Front has won the ruling socialist in third place in the recent bye-election.
At present, the Front in France is the most popular party with 24 percent of the votes - it is a precise warning for the British Labor that they can not follow assumption that disintegration for the left will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Le Pen doing with his new fame in the middle of French Goras, working class
This party wants to use the EU elections to be held next year to create anti-EU, anti-substantial anti-currency group in the European Parliament.
If, as much as possible, anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, such a group can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is that soon the confluence of anti-EU and anti-substantial anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will eliminate Euro.
Euro will not be completely finished, but it will return to Footkar (Suprabhu) nations in any form like Europe, which will be supported by General De Gaul.
Germany and some of its prosperous economies can maintain Euro, but France and Southern Europe will resume their currency.
I hope that the UK will keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing close proximity with the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington in Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in cold Atlantic.
After all, what will happen to Scotland
We can choose to remain the area of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to be separated at the right time.
I think Scottland can do better in the relaxed European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easy to work together with non-UN countries with other similar thinking countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think of maintaining our economic freedom while walking on the path of Norway.
The S.N.P. Government in Scotland - remarkablely - the most successful anti-profile political campaign in Europe, which won a surprising majority in 2011 on the basis of the deductions proposed by the Chancellor Elistair Darling of Labour and then the Tory-Lib Dam alliance.
Voting for freedom at this time for Scotland will be an absurd thing, because in that situation it will have to accept the rules of liability imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Young before time: hurry to grow
Research shows that African-American and Hispainic girls get younger than their age-old girls.
Physical change does not mean that youth is near .
There is no evidence that hormone or any other chemical can be blamed .
Experts believe that obesity outbreak can be a cause of youth at a young age.
The case of youth before time is not as effective in boys .
Former CNN correspondent PAT Ethris is a specialist journalist in the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried, if her daughter starts developing breasts and genitals at the age of 7 or 8
In the annual conference of the American Children's Medical Academy at Orlando, Florida this week, Dr. Paul Caplovitz, a Children's Medical Academy, clarified that this initial physical change is common in American girls, this new trend shows.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time to assure parents that it usually does not show rapid progress towards full youth.
Direct symptoms of development like breasts being scratched, hair of genitals and arms and physical smell are seen before time in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very simple change in the age of menstruation.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
"When the breasts start developing, it takes at least two to three years in the first menstruation, Caplovitz points out, "Time-time youth in girls: The guide required to deal with this common problem" is also the author of the writer.
The most accurate test time for youth development.
What is the beginning of the youth, there is a debate about this, but when there is an increase in the breast development before the age of 8 years, two are called 'Bal-Adult'.
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop - whose child doctors can inspect nearby.
In case of more rapid progress, andocrinologist may need to check so that the possibility of serious problems like tumors or syst can be overcome.
There are treatments to delay premature menstrual cycle and other consequences: premature age growth of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and drama as adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate and emotional adultry.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovites are cautious about medicines but acknowledge, "Suppressing youth can increase practical issues, and girls can feel different from their companions."
The second big problem can be understood: Parents do not just want their younger daughter to have menstruation.
Caplovites said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain cleanliness.
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, remembers, "This was a shock."
Although there were symptoms of this and we also talked about menstruation, but it was not emotionally prepared.
He was scared of his school and got upset that he had started menstrual cycle first in his friends.
There are many well-known principles about the reasons for untimely youth.
Nevertheless, there is no continuous evidence that hormones in milk or other food items, chemicals in the environment or sex-oriented messages in the media can be accused.
Boys - Like girls - are getting young from time to time.
Caplovites determine the rules that its main reason is the outbreak of obesity.
He helped in conducting a study on girls of 6 to 9 years in 2001, which connects the fat of the body with the time of youth.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispainic girls have a tendency to achieve youth before their age-old girls.
There are many explanations of this thing.
At the global level, the reflection of premature youth, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzles: although the boys are getting the hair of the face and genitals at a young age, but the practice of the youth is not as clear as the girls in them.
Other doctors present at the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even infants and children, it has become common to see the hair of lips and genitals.
Child Doctor Andocrinologist, Dr. Lawrence Silverman, at Gorib Childrens Hospital in Mauristown, New Jersey, says, "We need to be careful about how we identify the actual beginning of the youth. "
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child doctor to take opinion about how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "It means to negotiate before the expected time."
If you are calm then your child will normally answer properly.
It is necessary to assure the girls who develop prematurely that even though it is happening before time, it is a part of normal life.

The big orders of the jet manufacturers are at stake with controversy for seat width .
There has been a rivalry for this month's Dubai Arsho for a quarrel between leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long distance flights
The dispute is focused on the width of the economy class seat in long flights, not always given by airlines, but whose allotted location efficiency has been claimed by the Latest Jet Arbus SAS and Boeing Company.
This week Erbus has expected such industry standard by giving a detailed seat of at least 18 inches -LRB- semi -RRB- in the economy cubin this week but it should be decided by airlines , its chief opponent Boeing says .
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when there was a rivalry of selling the big version of the twin engine of the long distance Ercraft from the possible orders registered after the 17-21 incident .
How the previous department of the aircraft has been created - especially whether the seating is 9 or 10 is equal, keeping in mind the claims of more capacity, the design of Mini Jambo Jets is being prepared
Boeing says that it has been made 777  which will keep 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 people in one row in an anaemic department .
Airbus says that while competing with A350, it will take 350 people to the seat which left 18 inches and kept 9 in equal seats.
Air veterans often strike trade on technical matters through advertising in the business press .
Now, Airbus 777 is expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai Arsho, this is further appealing to the public.
Recently, it is being seen that the beginning of the wigship war has been anything, showing it to Finsero, will you accept it together in a restaurant
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said that "Boing Regional Turbo" is also presenting a long distance flight in narcotics."
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way to sit on the plane is not changed.
According to American Health Department data , between the 1970s when Boeing 747 Jambo ne defined the modern long - term ki yatra Ko , and the average weight of 40 - 49 year old American male ke me increased by 10 percent .
According to the US Health Statistics, the average American man's waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says that its rivals are stuck with a seat concept of 1950 when the new name was the average periphery of the jet set .
Airbus says that he has set up a Research Commission, which suggests improvement in the quality of 53 per cent sleep in an additional inch in the width of the seat.
Boeing disputed the airbus seat measurement data, and said that it is not dependent on the decision of the manufacturers how the airlines are balanced between rent and facilities..
It also says that research shows that more than the width of a seat depends on the experience of cabin.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver said that this actually tells about the flexibility of airlines and those things which believe that what they need to do to succeed .
 They do not want to tell us who they have the benefits.
They know better of their business than anyone else.
It is about the Kohni room for the flyers, but for the suppliers it is a fast issue that it can affect income.
Behind this dispute, the trade of at least  700 billion is sufficient in the coming decades to tip the US and European exports of the aircraft order.
The reporter said that for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually a matter of fighting between new jet aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that per seat has been 20 per cent efficiency, in their new twin engine design, the leader of the section, 365-seat Boeing 77-300 ar.
The claim of Boeing ' s performance depends on the comparison of 777  forest original 9 with 777 designs .
Comparison is now used with 10 equals of profits in unit cost.
Kevin Keniston, Head of Airbus Passenger Facility of Europe says, "This Boeing's aircraft is doing to capture more seats to make more competitive with our products.
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat per row cabin is suggested for the current 777 SC that many passengers are in favor of denser layout, which can also go along with cheap rent.
Cabin Internal Expert My Carbie, Founder and Editor's Runway Girl Network said that the eighteen-inch seat width will be very good for the passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is operated by the threat of 777
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list to select suppliers for airlines.
Jet vendors from all over the world also take precautionary measures to check this layout competition.
While resting, all the builders are also providing high density layouts for low-cost air services and regional travel.
The airbus is giving a 10 equal A350 but it says it is not sold yet.
But recently, Airbus stressed some of its jets on comprehensive cabin seats to need more cabin facility.
Modern jet planes are not likely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturer, but it can distract from the wave of 777  sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine can end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate fun from smoking.
The same dose of vaccine was capable of keeping rats safe from the addiction of nicotine for the whole life.
Before the beginning of the test on man, there is a need for further testing, which may take many years, but Professor Ronald Christle of Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that the initial signals are positive.
Professor Cornel said that "We are very hopeful that the strategy of such vaccine can finally help millions of smoking people, who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods present in the market today, but they found that their addiction of nicotine is more powerful than these existing methods. "
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which has been prepared to provide genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus infects the liver cell in a select manner, which then starts forming a permanent stream of antibodys.
Antibodys discover any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevents them from raising the summons of nicotine inside the smoker by neutralizing them before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccine given rats which were later given nicotines continued to do their normal activity.
Researchers say that but the rat which was not given vaccine, it looked good, it was a sign that nicotine reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a magazine called Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to give a dose at regular intervals, so that the level of antibodies remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of new vaccine is expected to be very high, because the liver cell will make the antibody factory.
Professor Christal said that if the human vaccine of the future is completely safe, then it can be given to the children before the greed of trying cigarettes, so that they can be saved from the addiction of nicotine.
But perhaps it will be used by smoking persons to quit smoking.
He said, "He will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get any joy from smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which can help in relieving their habit."
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned the need to be very researched.
Even after the post-mortem, the curtain could not arise due to the actual reason of the death of the tiger.
The Forest Department is giving a round answer to this, in the first sight, the death of the tiger is natural.

Tripodi denies us being influenced by Obide.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi will be examined by State Cropson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to refute the policy of sea lease on the request of his political guru AD Obide, former AD Obide, the patron of New South Wales, whose government-controlled three lands were hiding selfish.
The Independent Commission (IA) on Friday detailed the investigation on Friday that whether Mr. Obidd for violating the circulars of lobbying lease policy from several State Ministers where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obid, without renewing tenders were renewed in August 2005 after the expiry of their time.
After the evidence given by Lin Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, it was alleged that Shri Tripodi knew the hidden interests of Shri Obid
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressurized the public tender for lease.
The leasemen were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the circular enterprises for lease, from which Obid earned  2.5 million annually, were renewed without lease tender.
Shri Tripodi, who was Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he refused to change on Mr . Obide ' s request , Mr . Tripodi urged changes in government lease policy .
A copy of a phone calls presented in the IAF in August and September 2007, Mr. Obid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dun, a senior official who came to the Department of Fisheries, Mr. Obid after working in the Ministry of Ports.
Asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Healthy, Shri Tripodi. Did the telephone conversation of the development of commercial lease policy be discussed
"No, Mr. Tripodi answered.
I can not remember what was discussed, but it was not definitely.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obide.
Officials say that Israeli fighters attacked Syria .
Israeli fighters targeted Syrian port city Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative officer confirmed the Fox News.

Israel has missed air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice in this year.
Foreign employees can pass through authenticity test on 457 visas
The Government is considering a authenticity test for foreign employees on 457 visas as it aims to extend a harsh action.
If adopted, this test will be implemented through a criteria framed for filling of unskilled posts in Australia or for preventing 457 of the use of family and friends in a voluntary manner.
A Government Discussion Certificate was issued today, while condemning the termination of the government about foreign employees, the former Labor MP Maxine McCu said today that it can cruelly neighbouring countries of Australia.
He told the US India Institute today that "Foreigners are reaching the end of the queue and "Australia people are strongly rhetoric about jobs before" at a time when unions have demanded a safe labor market.
Historically, it meant that the White workers should have been provided security - and if some people in the area have seen the reflection of that historical evidence, I would not be surprised.
The Discussion Letter shows the framework of 12 measures, which was earlier considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Boven.
Immigration Minister Brandon Ocanner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, met officials about smuggling people, has implemented five recommendable changes, while the remaining are under consideration.
If authenticity criteria is adopted, the visa applicant can be examined about whether the nomination is true in such circumstances, in which the nominee is concerned or personal partner of the person who has a visa sponsor.
Businessmen may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders as the first businessman who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees kept hundreds of people on work.
During this, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee, died from a suspected heart attack after a refugee boat on Christmas Iceland this week.
The nine-year-old son of that person had come to Australia on a journey with him, and on Wednesday, after his father's death, one of his adult cousins have tied Dhandas, who was on the same vessel.
Australian officials transported the person to Christmas Iceland Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of Scotland from the FS2 Rail Project.
Work by FS2 indicates high speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barrones Cremor said that this project will make Britain one.
Scotland Transport Minister Keeth Brown said that he is very excited by working with the UK government on this project.
In the first phase, the new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands will be included.
On completion of the second phase, lines will reach Manchester and Leaders.
In June, the government revised the cost of construction of high speed links between London and North England to 42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, directed S2 Limited to consider the possibilities of improving rail capabilities and travel time for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glasgo and Edinburg to London for three hours.
According to Barones Cramer: Our goal for US2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.
We are moving forward with CS2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities of Britain, including Glasgo and Adinburg, which will be well added due to US2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elistair Carmicle: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
For the Scottish Government, Kyth Brown appealed to Mr. Carmickle to make a clear return to Scottland in the CS2 network.
Scotland is likely to have huge economic benefits from high speed rail, but it will also increase economic weight on Scotland in the entire case of high speed rail in UK.
Therefore, we are excited to work in the partnership of the British Government so that we can examine the options for bringing high speed rail in Scotland, generating benefits for all and fulfilling the glassgo-Adinburg line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I am ready to review the investigation report with the ministers of the British Government next year and take a decision together on further action.
Aircraft Electricity Equipment Rules will still be effective in Australia
In the US, the steps to be softened in equipment regulations, Australian aviation passengers will continue to shut down their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
US Federal Aviation Administration has left the option to change American aviation services companies to change their procedures so that travelers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during the important phases of the flight, provided they are in the air mode.
Passengers can just do this during many flights, but many people do not like to be unable to fly and reach their e-book etc. while landing the aircraft.
Australian Aircraft Services Companies are considering this decision, according to which US Aircraft Service Companies will have to work a lot to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Security Authority also said that it is contemplating the announcement, but stressed that the ban on the use of power equipment in the important phases of flight in Australia is still effective.
Currently, CASA has no specific regulation to control the use of power equipment in the aircraft, the Authority said, "This issue comes under regulations, according to which the airline operations have to ensure that the security system is always completely maintained, and the passengers have to comply with the security instructions given by the crew members. "
Virgin, who is already negotiating with DASA about expanding the use of his in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he asked to take further action on the instructions of the regulator.
The spokesman said that "We will welcome the review by DASA in the matter of allowing the use of power equipment, because we really feel that it will provide better experience to the customers, because now we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our planes."
uantas said that it will now follow the existing rules.
It said that "According to our current policy, electricity devices can not be used while flying and landing, and we have no immediate plan to change it."
LDAA decisions are applicable to American airlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit the passengers and we will certainly consider the decisions of the CAAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each US Aircraft Service Company and depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft services companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio utilization from mobile devices, as well as amend their rules books, training materials, care-on bagge programmes and brief details to the passengers.
CAA said that after verifying the tolerance of their aircraft by airlines, it will allow the passengers to use light weight electrical devices such as tablets, e-riders and smartphones.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to stop their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy devices safely under the seat or keep them in the upper boxes while flying and landing.
Ponbrokers silver due to the difficulty of the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash by paying his gold bangle, rings and swings to pay his daughter's school fee in Ponshop in Bandamier Shopping Centre in Singapore.
Smt Amirthalinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought the house, so our entire money is trapped in it.
He says that although he earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 US dollars) as an administrator, and his husband also works, but the monthly income of the family remains inadequate.
In fact, there is such a demand in parts of South-East Asia where domestic loans are increasing - Valuemax where they are doing their transactions, this week Singapore has become the third ponshop to be listed on stock exchanges.
Ornament mortgage is not the only way to get cash - Ms. Amirthalinga's case is 1,300 Singapore dollars - but almost unsafe bank loans are cheaper.
Normally, Ponbroker takes interest of 17 per cent per year in Singapore, which is slightly more than 15.4 per cent presented by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender whose branch in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have the benefit of enquiry of credit or lack of proof of salary, and they can provide faster loans than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are facing ponshops due to the increasing costs of livelihood by families and the increase in domestic and consumer loans.
After the global financial calamity, strong growth for five years, and simplified monetary policy in developed economies, the families with lower and medium income are turning on a ponshop to meet their requirements due to the slowdown of their economy.
This week, the Rating Agency, Standards and Purses mainly described the increasing domestic benefits due to increasing mortgage, as a risk factor for the lending of Asian banks.
It said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic loan in the proportion of GDP.
Malaysia is at the highest place in this list with 80 percent of GDP, while in 2008 it was 60 percent.
Economists are worried about the high levels of consumer loans in Thailand, which has emerged slightly from technology recession this week.
On Thursday, data has shown a decrease in continuous export recession and consumer demand.
In the Malaysian Bank, C.I.M.B., Economist Song Seng Won said, "The decisive point is that with rising prices, [in the middle class] people coming to the lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way.
In the last two years, historically high values in gold prices have inspired people to pledge personal assets as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the values of their family ornaments.
70 percent of the items mortgaged in 200 pon outlets of City-State in Singapore are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of sleeping seems good, let's keep grandmother's gold chain mortgage, and take it back next month."
Thailand's largest ponshop operator, Ezimani, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is so much increase in the mortgage business that outlet operator Valumax in Bendimeer and 15 others like it in Singapore are planning to expand not only in their neighborhood, Malaysia, where there are four shops, but also outside Asia, the executive director of Valumax Yah Lee Ching says.
The company will financing it with a 60 percent use of 66 million Singapore dollars in the listing this week on Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount creditors (lenders) have been criticized due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that the mortgage is not only cheaper than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the loan.
They say, consumers pledge such goods which they already have, and redeeming personal assets does not increase domestic debt.
Ponbroking's social acceptance is increasing to get short-term and safe financial assistance.
It is not that only financially weak persons use Ponbrokers.
In Singapore, wealthy persons also use valuemax outlets, they pledge gold bars or rollex clocks, which can get cash payments up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers of all sections of the society.
Ms. Yah says, "There are rich individuals who need loans for business enterprise or investment for a short time, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements.
Sometimes they need money in just very short time.
India's largest businessman Mukesh Ambani is celebrating his 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Neeta is celebrating her birthday in Mumbai but not in Jodhpur.
He organized a very big party on this occasion.
To attend this party, many Bollywood stars reached Jodhpur and on the late evening of October 31, many big stars were seen catching Jodhpur's flight at Mumbai Airport.
These stars include Karishma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his Wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose etc.
Clearly, when such big names are included in the party, you can guess how big it will be.
Rescue package of  325 million for TAGI health
The Union Government has insisted that strict conditions are also linked to the rescue package of  325 million for the health system of Tasmania, which will ensure that the state government can not waste the fund.
Union Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth, Islands are taking immediate action to resolve the current crisis due to the old population of the state, the high rate of deadly diseases and the boundaries of the system.
The decision to financing during four years was taken after the consultation of the Government with independent MP Andrew Wilki of Tasmania.
Ms. Plibersek said, "The government has brought an emergency rescue package, we believe that it will address the special challenges faced by the State.
The package of  325 million includes an alternative surgery scheme of  31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving the previous accumulated cases.
It also includes funds for walk-in-clinic in Hobart and Lonsestation, better care after going from hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health record system in local hospitals.
Ms. Plibersek said, "These investments are in line with the best ways to improve the health system of Tasmania by leading physicians.
The Minister emphasized that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability governance.
The state has to maintain the current financing level to get Commonwealth, and report every month where additional fund is being spent.
The Commission of three Members will be constituted to ensure that the State provides services in an effective and efficient manner.
Mr. Wilki said that the meaning of  325 million will not be very high unless actual improvements are made to further reach the public health system of Tasmania.
Yet, he praised the government for reacting to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought to the Prime Minister in the beginning of May.
Mr. Wilki said, "I hope the Federal Assistance Package will prove to be very helpful in separating the State Registrar Public Health System from the crisis-hit list.
According to the State Government, these additional alternative procedures will primarily revive the recent deductions.
But Federal Opposition Health Spokesperson Peter Datton believes that today's announcement is "band-ed solution".
He told ABC TV, "We are here because the Labor State Government has taken  430 million in its health system."
You cannot consider taking about half billion dollars by the state government and giving 300 million dollars by the Commonwealth as a good news day.
Shri Datton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that one of the rescue packages will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.

The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons capability.
The group monitoring on Thursday said that Syria has destroyed important equipment to make chemical weapons and poisonous gas war materials, while in the northern part of Syria, a fierce conflict emerged, which is very close to the place where poisonous agents are considered to be kept.
At the same time, on Thursday, the Syrian movement group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of Syria's civil war, which started almost three years ago.
This announcement of the Chemical Weapons Organisation has taken place a day before the last date of 1st November .
Which was decided by the Heg-based organization to destroy the machinery used to mix chemicals in all chemical weapons manufacturing units and toxic gases and to fill the war material.
Primary completion of the initial phase of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious development which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Dumscus by the mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can not now create new chemical weapons.
However, Dumscus still has to destroy the weapons and collections present.
It is believed that Syria now has 1000 metric tonnes of chemicals and weapons, which includes mastard gas and nerve agent Sarin.
The UK status Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that this announcement took place when the struggle in Safira city increased on Thursday, experts believe that it is a chemical weapon manufacturing unit as well as a storage center.
The movement group, which has details of the number of dead through the network of movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that out of this, 61,067 common citizens including 6,365 children are included.
It has been said on behalf of the government that 29,954 President Bashar Assad is a member of the military army, 18,678 fighters fighting in favor of the government and 187 Lebanese Hizbullah are militants.
It also said that there are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters in the dead, out of which many are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the ongoing conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Due to this struggle, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Asad's military team continued to fight against rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of whom were related to al-aeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said that people have been casualties on both sides, but clearly did not say anything.
This war reflects the danger faced by the inspectors of chemical weapons who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
A statement from OPCW, who worked in collaboration with the United Nations, said that its team is still satisfied and has confirmed - and all the declared important production and mixing equipments of Syria have been seen in destruction.
It also said, "No inspection activity is being planned next."
In the beginning of this week, the inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres declared by Dumscus.
Inspectors said that they were not able to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers have been sacrificed and ... the chemical weapons products kept there were transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira is one of the two centers, where OPC was not able to go to W.
Syria has presented a plan for the entire destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
Director General of the Group monitoring the comments issued by OPCW said, "I salute the determination and courage shown by you people in fulfilling the most challenging mission so far by this organization."
This home war, which has been going on for three years, is mainly a struggle between the government of Assad and its security forces, which have emerged from Shia Islam, including members of the Eit creed, and the rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Observatory chief Rami Abdur Rahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in the Air Defence Center in Latakia, the coastal area of Syria.
He said that the reason for this blast is not known yet.
Police have recovered photographs of fake registry, fake seals, laptops and fake registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused include Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar located in Haboval, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) has escaped from the spot.
According to the police, the accused used to come out of the records of empty and old lands in collaboration with the clerk and recordkeeper of the Registrar office and after that they used to buy new stamp papers and prepare fake registry on them.
Not only that, after disappearing the real registry, they used to offer fake registry records.
After this the accused used to sell the land for crores of rupees on fake papers.
At the same time, these fake papers used to take loans.
After this, the real owner of the land was a push account of police and administration.
The accused who prepared the fake registry kept a special eye on the land of NRIG.
Because there is no one to oversee the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell the fake registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused told in the inquiry that they have so far prepared fake registry near 150.
According to the police, cases of fraud and theft have already been registered against gangster Rajiv.
Resent on the punishment of a bomb blast in Bali
Families and relatives of 202 people killed in the bomb blast in 2002, expressing resentment over the punishment given to the conspirators of the bomb blast, Omar Patek should face the firing team.
Patech, who was running as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years for his role in building explosive devices used in the bomb blast.
If parole is given, it can be released in 15 years.
45-year-old Omar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in Kuta's famous tourist area, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many people were injured.
He was also found guilty in many other allegations related to terrorism, including a series of bomb blasts in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, although they could also demand that this person, who is called the infamous "demolitional person" as a master person who made a bomb, was a death penalty.
This decision refreshed the painful memories of the women living in Parth, June Cortin, who had lost their 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patech and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stoping his tears, he said that Patek should have been given a death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtin told AAP, "He should be put in front of the firing team."
I have to live without my grandmother and my daughters every day.
On October 12, 2002, after 11 o'clock in the night, the name of this club was deleted after the explosion of the bomb loaded in the van outside the entire club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddies bar at the time of exploding 20 seconds of the bagpack filled with explosive material by suicide attackers.
As a result of the incident of this bomb blast, he went to coma a month long and died three times while living on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Huges says that Patech should have got the same punishment, which was responsible for this massacre, three other members of the Jemmah Islamist terrorist group - Amroji, Mukhlas and Imam Sea - who were given death penalty four years ago.
In fact, this person should be given death penalty before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, look at him.
It is not enough to get 20 years of punishment after killing 202 people and wounding innumerable people.
Patek is the last person to be punished from the Bali bomb blasters.
He was avoiding being caught for nearly a decade, but finally in January 2011, the US army had killed former Al aeda chief Osama bin Laden after less than four months.
During the trial, F.B.I. Agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to re-establish contact between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-aeda.
Ms. Courtin says, "He did not surrender."
Even today, it is not really the grief of bringing mental pain to so many people.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by festivals in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Courtin said, "There will be a lot of tears this year.
Still, Patek can appeal against his sentence.
FAA: Aircraft travellers can now use gazettes in the aircraft (by calling cell phones)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, movies, listen to music from entering the gate to descend from the gate - but can not talk to their cellphone - This is under the highly predicted new guidelines issued by the federal aviation administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
In a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Hurta said that how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
The airlines will have to show how their aircraft complete new guidelines and how to update the rules to collect the training books and devices of their crew members to show the guidelines.
FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and Jetbulu are among the airlines who have already submitted plans.
FAA said in a statement, "On the basis of the situation of the plan, we can approve the extensive use of electronic device very soon.
At present, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets and other devices when the door of the aircraft is closed.
They are expected to not move them till they reach the height of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and are allowed by Captain.
Passengers are expected to stop their device again while landing the aircraft, and do not start it until the aircraft is completely landed.
The FAA said, under the new guidelines, such airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic interference can allow their passengers to fly by aircraft, while landing aircraft and use the device at the time of taxiing.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft which have been revised in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at a higher height, they are expected to fulfill these criteria.
The Chairman of the Association of Professional Flight Attendant, Laura Glading has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work together with airlines companies to do this - then it will be a victory for both sides. "
When this issue comes, we have been bored by feeling like "Hall Monitors".
The agency said that but it will still be restricted to surf by connecting internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet, exchange of emails, send or receive messages, or downloading data.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in the airplane mode.
So, there will still be no conversation with friends, an online scrabble-like game, the famous incident related to it is that when the actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while living at the airport in 2011, and when he refused to stop the device, the American airlines had landed him from the plane.
And heavy devices such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected as their boom will be worried about the injury to the other person in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will continue to be restricted during the flight.
The Regulatory Rights related to the phone call is with the Federal Communications Commission, not with the FAA.
FAA can remove restrictions on some electronic devices while flying and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenkan of the National Transport Security Board, who is the National Transport Security Expert of CBS News, said that cell phone is still considered risky.
Rosenkar said, "Cell phones are actually a serious issue, but not because they can probablely interfere in navigation-related devices, but also because they are in the air because cell phones can create disruptions in towers.
Industry Consultation Committee constituted by FAAA to investigate this issue has recommended last month that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has been increasing in recent years to reduce the ban by their use.
Critics such as Sen. Clair McCalic, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for the prohibition.
It is becoming even more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of the device is universal.
Some studies also indicate that about a third of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
FAA started restricting the use of electronic devices by the passengers in the year 1996 when the passengers received a report of interference in navigation and communication devices due to carrying FM radio and high tech gadgets at that time.
New airlines are more dependent on the electrical system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by FAA to resist electronic interventions.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at the cruise altitude from the passengers for many years.
The revised aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interference.
Hurta said that most airlines should meet eligibility norms for more use of electronic devices under new guidelines.
Electronic devices of today emission radio transmissions of very less power than the previous generation electronic devices.
For instance, e-riders are transmission of very nominees while reversing the page.
But transmissions are strong while downloading or sending data by the device.
Amaon.com is also among those who favor to reduce the restrictions on the use of the device by the passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew it to test the problems but no such problem was found.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Aircraft Passenger Association said that he believes that the interruption from the device is real, even if the risk is only of the name.
Other members of the committee said that in support of interference by the device in the aircraft system, there are reports only described by the pilot, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee recommended that the FAA pilot should be allowed to order the passengers to stop the device at the time of landing in less visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them a common knowledge facility for people traveling in the latest phase of technology.
CEO Roger Do of the US Travel Association said that we are happy that the FAA has recognized that the traveler traveling with joy is not inconsistent with safety, rescue and security.

Birds were left back to the forest by air transport to protect from North C Rig
The bird found on the North Sea Oil Rig has been left back from the shore by air transport.

Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with Britain
In April, the Business for Britain was launched and it was decided to bring together the business and determine the changes in our relations with the UK Employment and Prosperity Producer EU.
For this, we organized the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they have about Britain's business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1000 business leaders who are representatives of UK's business size, areas and locations.
The conclusions of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large part of the business now wants to export out of Europe, and want to focus on countries that are becoming modern and increasing, while EU members are becoming dynamic.
They want the government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not to the long-term and evil process of improving the mysterious institutions of EU.
When asked his ideas about specific policy areas like monopoly regulations to product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to the Westminster.
Common dissatisfaction over the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels is more than the benefits of being a part of Europe's business sector - even the vast businessmen who were traditionally favored by European companies, 40 of them agreed on this.
Finally and obviously, our survey of professional leaders found that a large part clearly wants Britain to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with EU.
This conclusion, which was observed at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are motivating towards a "realistic change" which will give back its lost power to the UK.
It has a very high price - the issue of Treaty Change for the UK and a better deal has changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of sustaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: This survey shows that Britain's businessmen support their plan to negotiate on the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen look forward to renewing a meaningful change to the current power balance in favor of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses and it is becoming very fast as Eurozone is stepping forward in the direction of affiliated economy and a fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey concludes that it means a new focused focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulation of Brussels.

Prior to allegations against Jonathan Lord, two employees of YMCA accused of sexual offenses, Royal Commission heard
Before being charged against Karingbah Child Care employee Jonathan Lord in 2011, two employees of YMCANSW have been accused of sexual offences.
But in his statement before the commission, it said that it never came to the notice of child sexual harassment within its organization, the commission was told this.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the matter, in which an employee of YMCA was accused of child pornography offenses, and another case in which YMCA Karingbah Jim Instructor was accused of child sexual offenses against children living in his care in the year 1991.
Mr. Hare from the advocate Gel Fernance, who assisted the commission, said that he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the other matter.
He also acknowledged that the statement of YMCA before the Commission that the external investigation of the YMCA has been done and he has found YMCA at the forefront in the case of child safety is not correct.
It is evidence before the Commission that the YMCA was notified and received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community uality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with YMCA at the age of 21, acknowledged that while appointing the Lord, the management along with me has failed, and failed to ensure that the employees were clearly aware of their obligations related to the information of child security policy violations.
In the beginning of this year, Lord was convicted for sexual offences with 12 children during a two-year tenure in YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which the employees did not report the violation of child security by the Lord.
What the employees saw about the violation, gave to the evidence in which Lord spent the time alone with the children, making them bebisitating personally, sitting in the lap, telling them that he loves them and they should play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Ockwell, who was under the supervision of Lord and had asked for child safety training, because he was worried about his behavior, testified that YMCA, who supervised the Lord, was very intimidating and difficult to get most of the time.
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that he was not easy to give information above his manager.
He said that, but his friendship with Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his view to the YMCA NSW Mandal that "Jonathan Lord was about not giving the text to the organization" from the incident.
Mr. Hare said that immediately after the allegations were revealed, the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees was made by YMCA Child Service General Manager Liam Whiteley.
He said that its purpose was to avoid mixing of evidence, but it was not executed "excitement and correctly."
Stephen Smalbon, a special professor of child sexual abuse of Grifith University, said that during the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011, YMCANSW was not a safe organization.
He said that there were serious problems in the appointment, examination, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed till December 20.
Blair says they want to return to Britain
Tony Blair said that he would like to become the Prime Minister of Britain again - but he believes that there is no possibility of return.
In an interview held at night on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving the post in June 2007 after a decade as a leader, Mr. Blair avoided discussions on British politics, keeping most of his comments confined to the role of representatives of foreign affairs and peace architects of the Middle East.
Asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair was presented by the London Evenging Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, sure, but there is no possibility of this happening, so ...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When there was a crowd of experts performing horse for the year's best horse in Cardiff, they knew that it would be a challenging competition.
But no person was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even went to the school and a few months away from taking his first step, this little child and his ancestor Shetland's Tattu Tafi completed three phases very easily and received the top prize - he left his 30 adult rivals behind.
In the Annual Competition organized by the Suniback Equestrian Centre in Rudri near Cardiff, the pair that cannot be distinguished - which is length of the skin - was praised for the show, behavior and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful baller hats, he snatched his SPAT cap on the Alhad angle and made his two-year-old toffee rotate the ring.
Decisors praised Fenton for their natural skills to control, which is far ahead of his age.
And Tophy gets the highest mark for his show and personality.
Fenton was given the toffee as a gift on his third birthday in March last year, and he has practiced with this tattu of Shetland daily since then.
His 30-year-old mother Dona said: "Fenton and Toffee are a spectacular pair.
They had to face the challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won gold cups and rosets.
This was the second time when he participated in a competition with Toffee, and we all are very happy about his victory.
The most different in this colorland, he felt so wonderful that he wanted to photograph with him.
This younger child of Nantiglo village near Ab Well, South Wells is running on the footprints of his Anti Sharon Havels, which have been performing horses for more than 10 years.

He was running on the sand in the entire colorland, and despite looking so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is a crazy of animals - he loves horse, tractor and farm, and he has two chickens whom he cares.
The way he has started, he will be in the best horse exhibition of the year long ago and I am confident that he will perform very well.
A spokesperson of the annual horse exhibition said, "Fenton's age is only three years, but he comes to control his tattu.
They are very good pairs.
Decisors gave marks in view of the methods of performance of Fenton and Toffee and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw a good team work between Tattu and his rider - in this case, Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am confident that Fenton's loved clothes have helped him, he was actually very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues will be revised
A press regulator said that a Chinese newspaper who had made an appeal on the mouthpiece to leave a reporter convicted of defamation, would be revised.
Guangjau's newspaper New Express gave a rare public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongjau.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken bribe to write a frank news about the partial-owned company of the state.
The regulator said that now the New Express has to go through complete improvement.
"Sudhar's order came from Gwangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration."
"A primary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Ivaning News Group had printed a lot of false news about the listed company umloyan in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that the editorial management of the New Express was unorganized.
It said that it had decided to impose an administrative punishment by canceling the license of 'Chen Yongjau' reporter.
It had directed Yangcheng Evanging News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, in the New Express, it was recommended to examine people responsible for it and revise the leadership team of New Express immediately.
Mr. Chen wrote many articles in the New Express, which blamed financial irregularities in a construction-production company named Jumloyn.
After being opposed, his newspaper published two mouthpiece appeals for his release, and said that he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came to the state television, accepted writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told State Broadcaster CCTV that in this case, I have damaged Jumloyn as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the confidence of the people.
I did this mainly because I was greed for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After the forgiveness of Mr. Chen, the New Express issued a mouthpiece forgiveness, which said that it failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have accepted the TV disseminated blame.
Experts say that from time to time blame is made, despite this, a law in the latter half of this year banned officials from binding any person to blame himself.

U.S.-Mexico Drug tunnel found its own railway
The most complex drug trafficking tunnels between USA and Mexico have been found, in which it has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
US officials have described the tunnel of four feet three feet as one of the most complex secret routes discovered so far.
The tunnel is almost six football length of the pitch, which connects the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Digo, USA.

Tax on foreign assets will end the artificial situation of London
The Department of Finance has provisionally calculated CGT measures, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osborn, who presented stamp duty at the rate of 7 for houses worth more than 2 million pounds in the budget of 2012, and those who prefer to keep houses in a company instead of a separate person.
In the year 201213, the stamp duty obtained from residential assets in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelesa was 708 million, which is already more than the combination of Northern Ireland, Wells, Scotland and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Hamber.
Shri Cook said, "After the increase in stamp duty of high value houses and the introduction of Associated Anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a proper tax on high value property, which is not related to the effect of the old council tax system.
He added , But this step is silent in buying some foreign investors in London and can make the current owners unwilling to sell .
As per the price of primary property, Dhanadya South-West London, the top 5 to 10 percent of the housing market, which is spread from Phulham to Wimbledon, has increased by 11.
According to the research of Saviles, the Central London prices continued to increase by 5.6 per cent every year, but the growing domestic market seemed to be slightly less as the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent).
Scientists have further highlighted what is the relationship between the dog's tail and his mood.
Last researches have shown that the happy dogs shake their dumb more towards the right (from the dog), while the restless dogs shake their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that companions dogs can recognize this micro distinction of tail and express their reaction to it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
neuroscientist Professor Georgia Vellertigra from the University of Trainto said, "In men, all of them know well that the left and right part of the brain are included in the excitement in different ways which produces positive or negative sentiments.
Here we have tried to see it in other species too.
He said that like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the acts of the left hand and the opposite order in dogs, and two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To know more about how dogs react to shaking a one-sided dog by other dogs, researchers looked at animals watching other dog films.
He measured the heartbeats of the pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably not take much time to understand why their dumb sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Prof. Vellartigra said, "We presented dogs with the films of dogs - in the shadow picture to deal with the realistic editions or other issues in confusion, and we could see the act of tail and could present the tail more left or right.
When the animals saw any emotional dog shaking their tail (from the dog) towards the right, they were completely comfortable.
But when he saw the tail changing the direction mainly towards the left (from the dog) then his heart beat increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, he does not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these acts.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their experience that they should be worried about what action and not on whom.
He said, "If you have met many times with other dogs, and if they constantly shake their tail on one side, then it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of the same experience. "
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about the feelings of animals to the owners, animal doctors and trainers.
John Breadshaw, a specialist in the behaviour of dogs at the University of Bristal's School of Veterinary Sciences, said that this is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs or not.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when the dog looks at an aggressive dog, his head turns to the left and seeing the happy dog turns his head to the right.
In other researches of the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "On contrary to the Italian study - when the tail of the robot dog was shaken to the left, instead of being restless, there was more likely to reach it. "
He said that this difference was because in various studies dogs did not understand animals or robot dogs completely in films.
He clarified that it can help the study of the way dogs react to the real dogs.
"When there is a lot of evidence from various mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is yet to be received - and in this case dogs are not exceptional, he said.
However, in view of the ease of registering their behavior, it seems that we will probably not take much time to understand why their dumb sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.

Pope Francis to announce the name of the first cardinal in February
Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, Catholic Church consists of the highest categories, whose post is below the pope, and these people select the pope, so the French will apply to the first group of their individuals who will ultimately help in choosing their successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals right now.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the Cardinal is not allowed to participate in the Pope election - it comes to the 120 Cardinal Electoral Group.
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lambardy said that before the ceremony of promotion of new cardinals, all existing cardinals will be held, which is called Pope-Sabha.
Lombardy said, "Pop Francis has decided to tell its decision to organize the Pope Council of February, so that it is easy to plan other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different countries of the world."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, there was a possibility of a decrease in the number of cardinal electors.
He said that Pope usually declares the names of cardinals, which are less than 120, as cardinals and cardinals of more than 80 years of age, as per their desire.
Valero said that the next year's Pope-Sabha will be important because it will be the first Pope-Sabha after the French election in March this year.
Presently there is a kind of prejudice towards Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It would be interesting to see whether the new pope to restore the balance, the cardinals also nominate from the rest of the world."
In South America, forty percent is Roman Catholics, but their number in cardinals is very low.
These will also be the first cardinals to be selected after the formation of the Cardinals Council by France - which is a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to find ways to improve the church.
Earlier, Pope used to decide all things on its own.
Wellero said, "Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said that it is possible that French cardinals ask for advice.
But we have not been earlier in this situation - it is absolutely new.
Valero said that usually Pope gives the post of cardinal to the bishops of big places, but French people were surprisingly surprised - so we do not know whom they will declare their name.
To correct the seatback, GM called back the pickup trucks in the US
According to an information on behalf of the US Auto Safety Regulatory Regulators on Friday, General Motors Company, its new 2014 Sheverley Silveredo and GMC Seera Pickup trucks have called about 19,000 trucks back to correct a reduction in the seatback.
In some trucks, there may be a reduction in the front seat rotating system.
Consequently, the Sangh failed to comply with auto security standards regarding Seatback, Head Restraint.
According to an information put on the website of the National Highway Transport Security Administration, "If the vehicle is trapped from behind, it is possible that the head restraint can not protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury."
Models to be called back were built between August 1 and September 10.
The GM trucks started to be sent in June and after the insolvency renewal of the year 2009, it reflects the most important vehicle launch for the top US Automaker.
GM had told the truck owners about this fault in the latter half of October.
NSTMA 16-day government captive, which interrupted the increase in auto sales in October, could not review the notification letter.
GM said on Friday that sales of Silverado and Sera trucks which were re-designed for the year 2014 model year were 20 increase in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 silveredo and 16,503 sera pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, the GM share in the New York Stock Exchange was 1.4 percent.
Obama's frustration of voters
I voted twice to Obama instead of change
He says that Obama's great efforts have been interrupted due to the policy of GOP's barrier.
The policy of the barrier can not excuse the problems of the Obamacare website, the drone attacks
Obama reminds of the 2008 Campaign reminds of what could have happened
Nathanial P. Moris is a second year student in Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books nowadays.
This is a book about which I think this second year will enhance my zeal during the menace of medical school and awaken the hopeful ray in me.
Its name is the courage to win, and it is the memorial of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I am able to pursue my patients in the night and go to bed, this book takes me to a stage in which politics inspired millions of people and speeches could stop your breath.
Elections proved unilaterally, and news speakers took a break to show the historical significance of that time.
My companions had the tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved every news paper.
A team of young visionary persons was going to the White House, and the entire country was ready to change.
During Obama becoming President in 2008, he had 82 percent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a long remembered, a tragic remembrance of lost opportunities.
It was actually a change after I had first voted.
If you say simplely, none of this could imagine.
I credit Obama for a lot of achievements, from the Afordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, "No ask, till the end of Osama bin Laden was killed."
Besides, I believe that the policy of bias opposition has prevented many efforts to move ahead of our country: including immigrant reforms, public options for healthcare, stopping the base on Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But innumerable times in which I took myself in favor of the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, the answer is over, which I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
Republican's opposition policy is not an answer to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to the drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It can not answer the National Security Agency to collect data about the personal life of common American citizens, nor can the government answer to prosecute people who expose the wrong acts.
It can not tell the reason for the murder of American citizen Anwar L Avalaki without any trial, nor the public funds and expenditure limits reduced during President Campen.
It can not answer the conclusions of the report, which says that efforts to silence the media by the White House have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even after three years of the Affordable Care Act signed.
I do not know whether I had expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system could segregate the political campaign that brings it forward.
It is obvious that the elected office is not a predictable route, because the opposition political parties and memorable events such as the NewTown murder case will shape our public discussion.
Yet, the examples I have given above are mostly selected by the administration.
This thing troubles you most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidature.
Mite Romani presented a confusing and an uncertain option that did not seem to determine his policies or his post.
I felt that another term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes that we have been listening for a long time.
Yet, while Obama's permission rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return in 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I remember his missing promises.
In this week, a part of the book was read, describing how Clinton had a huge loss due to Obama in the Pennsylvania Primary.
In a post-martum camp meeting, he told his subordinate employees that they need to return back to track, and need to remain verified on their objectives.
He said, "I want to get my mozzo back."
We should remember who we are.
Today, five years later, I cannot agree with you much more.
The ideas expressed in this comment are of Nathanial Moris.
Clive Pamar claimed that the interest of PM Tony Abbott about the ancestral holiday scheme is a conflict
billionaire MP Clive Pamar has said that the interest of Prime Minister Tony Abbott about the ancestral leave scheme is a struggle because his daughters can be pregnant, and can take advantage of it.

Why can not we have such a system in which we fill our details on the computer, vote immediately and we have results at 6:30 in the evening
Mr. Pamar also criticized the use of pencil to mark the ballot papers.
This is because if a person does not like him, then can he erase the promise

RBIS suspensions two Foreign Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its Foreign Exchange Department, the information received from two people from the case is another indication that the global investigation by the regulators in the suspicious manipulation of the currency market is moving forward at a fast pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including BSF Barclege, Dush Bank and RBI, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the regulators in the investigations in the world's largest financial market in which 5.3 trillion each day is exchanged.
These two traders will be the first employee of RBS, who have been suspended with the investigation and investigation of the case recurrence of the Libor Interbank Loan manipulation case.
The bank has refused to comment on the suspension and confirmed that the bank has received a request from the regulators this month for information.
Two weeks ago, the bank had said that "Our investigation is going on in this case, and we are fully cooperating with CA and other regulators."
Last month, the people of the case had said that the RBI has sent the records of the email and speedy messages received from them to the CK Regulatory, Financial Ethics Authority.
This trader named Richard Yusher had left RBS in 2010, and it is believed that it has been discharged from its current post of European Head of Forex Spot Trading in J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in City, went on vacation last week, while former senior currency trader in Barclase and BSF was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
No of these traders have been accused of any wrong work.
Knowledgeable people from the matter said that the quick message group of Mr. Yusher includes the barclege and the bankers of the Citizens.
The BSF said that after being told by the Swiss regulator, Finma, he is investigating the suspected manipulation of the foreign currency market in many Swiss banks this week, he has taken action against some of his employees.
At least six authority at the global level - Competition Authorities of European Commission, Finma, Switzerland are examining allegations of misconduct to make its favorable fluctuations in the currency market on VCO, CA, US and Hog Paper monetary Authority - Bankers.
The people familiar with the matter said that the CSB, City Group, JP Morgan and Credit Suice have also examined internal investigations, or received request for information on behalf of the regulators.
Banks are closely investigating the quick message and email equal to many years in search of clues of any wrong activity.
Regarding the investigation, the news has created a stir in the traders of the sector who have been among the leading individuals who have earned the highest profit in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they have to face the challenge this year because due to less fluctuations in the currency, the opportunities for the betting have come down.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate very large and excessive liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessary that it is true.
Senior trader said that despite the overwhelming measure of foreign exchange purchases, the denouncing of liquidity between different trading platforms and increasing use of its own platform by banks means that "You can start affecting the market on a little less ticket price."
This news came on the same day, on the day when Credit Suice had announced the serving of the trader from his Exchange Trade Funds desk in London this week, which lost approximately 6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and collaborated with its regulators.
Credit Suice said that "We believe that the trader had worked alone, and it has been controlled."

It is true that our work can not be done without money.
Money for living is one of the biggest needs, but it is not in our interest to accept everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras on Krishna Triyodshi of the month of Kartik.
Dhanteras is worshiped as the god of money, Kuber and death god Yamraj.
Money is an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good.
We have a good sense of money.
The money that comes to the welfare of humanity can not be more valuable than that, but the money which becomes the cause of ego does not mean.
We earn money for the sacred purpose and spend only for the sacred purpose.
Money commanding is the duty of every person for the maintenance of the family.
It should also have a feeling of spending some part of the society, but the tendency to earn unaccounted storage or yen-ken-project money destroys our discretion, personality.
The feeling of donation should always be in mind.
A part of the money given by you can also be the basis for someone's life.
Many people in the society are living in a terrible absence, all of us should think for them.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the males of life.
All people wish wealth and jealousy and they also get money and jealousy according to their males.
The same wealth and property is sustainable, with which respect is related.
No matter how rich a criminal can be, he can neither consume it properly nor can any other work come.
If someone else has money then do not believe it.
The true wealthy is the same who makes the way to flow in the innumerable hands of money.
Nobody else can be able to use the money more than the creation of employment for others.
Another thing, money is not in the form of currency only.
It is also in the form of love for your health, character and others.
Try to become the owner of this money.

After the general elections, if the new government continued the policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration, then half a dozen states will not get kerosene on these shops.
In the states where the sale of kerosene is to be stopped, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand are included.
Apart from these, in some states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Northeast, there is a preparation to stop the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, it will be decided to stop sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two basiss.
The first basis is that fast electricity connections are being built in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most of the rural families have been given LPG connections.
The Petroleum Ministry has made strong preparations about this.
The sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already been closed since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been reduced to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
The quota of Punjab was reduced from 2.72 lakh kg to one lakh kg.
70 percent of the allocation of Uttarakhand, Haryana's kerosene quota was reduced by about 40 percent.
Despite this cut, the news of kerosene shortage has not been reported from these states.
The Ministry is convinced that it is clear from this that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price of PDS kerosene and diesel is currently a difference of Rs 37.
This promotes those who adulterate.
In states where sales will be closed through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at the whole cost in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per liter on kerosene.
In the year 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31 thousand crore.

Its main accused Amit Soni has been detained by Cyber Cell from Jodhpur, while six other colleagues have been caught from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Double, it is necessary for any share trading company to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only then can the company make share trading to the investors through it.

This company had bought a server for itself by citing trading on September 24, 2012 in the name of Wintrade.
Since then, people are being blamed in the name of investment through this company.
At present, eight traders of Indore have come out complaining in cyber cell.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profits, their amount was not transferred to the account.

Modi said on this occasion, "The coalition government was formed in many states and centers of the country, sometimes the Congress, sometimes the government of the Communists and sometimes the BJP government.

I call upon political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What party did it
If the comparative result comes, then there will be no question in front of the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever the BJP government is formed, efforts have been made to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country is a witness to the inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man got food twice.
But when the Congress or its supported government was formed, the poor man was not fortunate to eat.
A single Congress leader, a single UPA leader is not answering what he did in nine and a half years.
The media of our country can not even reach them.
Congress has become egoistic.
They do not even answer the media.
Elections are from the Lok Sabha, you answer the public.

Congress friends, we have already given exams 10 months ago.
In democracy, the public takes a test.
In the case of Nortel Patent, there is a financial case filed on Google, Samang, Huwai.

In Egypt the first elected President believed
Mohammed Morsi has sworn in assumed his post, but his Vijay Diwas could hardly end the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi, while taking oath as the first independently elected President of the country, who replaced Hosni Mubarak, removed 16 months ago, promised "New Egypt".
On its formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become the fifth President of Egypt after the independently elected first Islamist President of the Arab world, and almost 60 years ago the monarchy was removed.
He sworn in front of 18 judges of the court on his chair on the banks of the Nil river, which looked like ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal function shown in the live broadcast on national television, Morsi said that "We are aspirations of better future, new Egypt and other Republic."
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, who has spent 84 years as an illegally declared organization since its establishment, and who has been on the target of the previous governments, 60-year-old Morsi, trained in the US of the party, said that "Today the people of Egypt have laid the foundation of new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and police personnel protected the building and according to the local time, at 11 o'clock in the morning, Morsi came in the small convoy of cars.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to give a new President apart from the fury of the President, the traffic was also stopped for a while so that their motor carfile should come out of the normal busy road, which connects the city's center to its southern suburbs.
Morsi, who was ridiculed as a non-industrial tire of Brotherhood, had a lot of increase in his personal dignity, and on Friday, his speech presented him not only as Islamist but also as the candidate of all who wanted to complete the work of the 2011 revolution against dictatorship Mubarak.
Taking oath of office before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, wearing blue business suit and red tie, Morsi said that "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
After that, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he had to give his inaugural speech.
The military band was officially welcomed by playing a national tune, while they were standing in the posture of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantavy was also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university welcomed with the slogan that "The army and people are one hand."
Established as the stronghold of secular education in 1908, Cairo University later became the stronghold of Islamist students groups in the year 1970.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic swearing in Tahrir Square, which is the origin of the revolution, which ended the dictatorial rule of Mubarak last year, and took oath to withdraw the President's powers snatched from his post by the military council last year.
But instead of accepting the competent oath of Parliament, instead of agreeing to take official oath before the court, they bowed before the will of the army, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic popular currency.

After passing both the Houses of Representative and Senate of the Congress, this bill will become law.
Committee Chairman and Senator Diane Festin said that the program to record NSA's phone is under the law and I believe that it has contributed significantly to the security of the country.
But in spite of this, more transparency should be brought in.
Not only this, the security of the public's privacy should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, angry Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have supported this bill due to the disclosure of the NSA Internet Monitoring Program.
In a letter to the Senators, these companies have said that we welcome this proposal of MPs who curb the record of the phone on a large scale of NSA.

He said that although the corporation had no constitutional right to raise this issue in the House, but he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said that as far as development work is concerned, the opposition will be given a list of 15-year development works.
The way Chandigarh is developing or going to happen, these people can not even think there.
In the Cabinet meeting, there was a exchange of greetings between the two.
When the meeting ended, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for a counter-attack on Narendra Modi in Chintan camp.
Regarding his speech, he also said that there is no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges should be tackled.
It was also the feeling of the Chief Minister that he took Singh's speech positively.
It is known that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to honor the workers in Chintan camp and save them from alleged harassment of officers.
However, he was also told that he was ready to dismiss from the Cabinet to keep his point of view.
By the way, after the opinion emerged in the Chintan camp, there is a hope of renewed view in the matter of laying workers on government posts.
State JD (U) President Vashisht Narayan Singh had said in the camp that the announcement of the nomination of workers in 20 point committees will be announced soon.
His sign was also that the list is almost ready.
The news is coming that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will inspect the list from his own level.
They will also investigate whether the opinion of legislators and MPs has been taken in making the list.
If needed, a large scale reshuffle will be made in the list to give place to old and committed workers.
MLAs and MPs are generally accused that the opinion of those people was not taken in making a list of nominations.
The names of people who came after a long time from other parties have been recorded in the list, while many important workers active since the days of Samata Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal with their hard work and people inspire them.
In such persons, a name comes to Self-Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, who was posted as a teacher in a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on December 28, 1932.
Dhirubhai was third in five brothers and sisters.
Five children of the family include Ranikalal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumti.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to leave studies only after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the house in childhood itself.
At this time, he used to set up a shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, at the age of 17 in 1949, he reached the Aden city of Yemen from a ship named Kabota.
Here his elder brother Ramaniklal had made all arrangements for him, so he did not have any problem getting a job abroad.
But there was something else in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954, they returned to Vatan.
In 1955, he reached Mumbai to try luck by keeping 500 rupees in the pocket.
And his business journey started from here.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani stepped up such a step that never looked back.
His name was not only famous in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
At present, his son Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling their Sultanate.
Like father, today the name of these two brothers is also one of the international businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

Jagaran bureau, Srinagar: The security of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the People's Democratic Party, has been allegedly removed by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this and said that his security has been removed for political reasons.
It is known that Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, who won the election in 2002 on PDP ticket from Shopian, was involved in his Cabinet while being the Chief Minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said that I have got security cover since 1996.
I live in Shopian, who is called the stronghold of terrorists.
A security team of CRPF at my house was posted under the leadership of Sub Inspector.
There are also bodyguards with me, but all my security on Thursday was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security team was going from my house, I talked to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he will investigate this matter.
Of course, in this context, when IGP Abdul Ghani Mir of Kashmir was contacted, he denied the information about this matter and said that this is a sensitive matter.
I will investigate myself how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
State Congress chief Prof. Saifuddin Soz said that there is nothing like this in my information.
If Hassan Khan's security has been compromised, then it is a very serious matter.
I am in Jammu at this time, I am coming to Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to this report, during the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Rather, in contrast to Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004) Atal Vihari Vajpayee's PM, a round came when no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
Keeping the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182 meters high 'Statu of Unity' statue in Kevadia, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "After this, there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
While the DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakhs in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari was asked about Modi's claims, he said that BJP's PM candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this happened due to economic recession that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of the members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru on print advertisements.
When asked about this difference with Manish Tewari, he said, "It should not be seen from the perspective of expenditure on advertisement.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including advertising size or advertising rates for that year etc.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, the people who oppose it are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without going to it.

Proceeding through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Well is providing free healthcare to the rural areas of Camroon
Well and their team see hundreds of patients around every weekend .
West African countries do not have much physicians , there is only one physician for 5000 people .
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for them or for someone in other top 10 to make C.N. Year hero.
The winner will receive  250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father in consciousness and being unconscious, going to the hospital, which was not properly convenient to help him.
Jamal Well, in the year 1981, was injured in a car accident near Kameron's capital Yonde.
Initially, his only hand was broken, but an infection increased, which spread to his brain, and made blood vessels, which affected his remaining life.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgeon in the camera."
If we had money, we would take our father out of the camera.
Instead, Well continued to roam around the crowded clinics and hospitals about his father and obtain whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "It is not easy.
You come out of the house at 5 o'clock in the morning that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but it does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait in the mouth of death while waiting.
Since the death of Well's father in 2002, there was not much change in the situation.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5000 person in the camera.
If you compare, then there is a doctor for every 413 persons in the United States.
And even if there are physicians there, many residents of cameras can not bear their expense.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in healthcare in the country is from the private sector.
Well says, "His only problem is poverty.
And because of being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well took a firm pledge to resolve it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have done 700 free surgery last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon in Yonde's Centre Hospital.
And he started the non-profit organisation escowime, which goes to rural areas at weekend to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped about 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday, they sit in the van, tied medical supply to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to move forward more than one time by pushing the vehicle from rivers and soil.
But when they reach, they really get respect for heroes: the best housing that can be presented by the feast, singing and dance, and the community.
Free medical services in these villages are actually the reason for celebrating, and wealth - along with its big smile and endless energy - are happy and happy.
The next morning, his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We are meeting 500 people in every journey.
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekly clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get specific, donated glass or free birth certificate - this document is required in the school but many poor families can not spend it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local communications.
Operations are usually done at school buildings, town halls or houses, after the process, the patient walks to the recovery place, and makes a place for the next person.
The generator of the group publishes and sanitizing equipment in the room with operations, and Well and their volunteers work on Sunday morning.
This is a lot of speed, but the musicians of the village usually help in motivating the party.
Well said, "They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work."
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group, which includes Cameron physicians and foreign medical students, has 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their help can change the world of those whom they help.
One person said that due to getting free hernia surgery, he will be able to go to work again.
The person said, "This will change the future of my and my family."
Apart from running weekly clinics and working as a surgeries in the hospital, Well also works in private medical clinics around Yonde at night.
He said that this is his second job which funds 60 of his non-profit work, the remaining part is completed by personal donation.
A second year medical student of Draxel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the group of Well said, "I do not know when they are sleeping."
They are always in the hospital, or are trying to earn money for their organization so that they continue to run these campaigns.
This is an experimental opportunity for students of medical and nursing such as O'Mally who come from United States and Europe to join the Vell campaign, which they can never get in their country.
O'Mailly said, "In the surgery, we are able to get experimental experiences in Dr. Well, tools for Dr. Well or clean blood stains."
You will never get the opportunity to do so as a second year medical student in the US.
Volunteer students usually spend from themselves to reach the camera, and they often come with the medical supply of donations.
But after reaching Yonde, they come to live, and spend the instructions.
O'Mally says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their life for this organization, and their desire to help the people of the camera is never going to end.
For Well, the burden of almost the same work is not difficult.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that provide them very enjoyment.
Well says, "I am very happy while doing this work."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to laugh people, reduce their pain.
See the website of Escovime and find out how to help.
You must not be sure but this is true.

In fact, Jharkhand Vikas Yuva Morcha has named this name to express its displeasure over some bad roads in the city.
This program was done under the leadership of JMM Union Secretary Sachchidanand Pandey.
Addressing a rally, Modi said, "You see the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they do not talk about what they have done."
He said, "Congress has become so egoistic that it does not answer the questions of the media."
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he should answer Modi.
Replying to the public is your duty.
Clearly Modi was answering Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants his controlled environment where he gives his speech and does not talk to reporters to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to debate in front of him.
Modi said, "I promise the people of the country that when the BJP will form the government in 2014, we will present the report before the people every year."

He has become the first high-class member of the US government, who has admitted that US espionage has crossed its border, but has emphasized that nobody's rights have been misused.

And the President is determined to make it clear to the people and is still reviewing intensively so that no person has any sense of misuse.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.

So if you are capable of stopping it before it happens, then what is the problem
We have actually saved the plane from falling down, collapse of buildings, and killing people because we have already been able to know about the plans of others.
