Bosnians protest against the Croatian nuclear reactor project
Hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia on Friday, protesting against savings from Bosnia's neighbor, Croatia, from the only nuclear reactor in the region, to its border with Bosnia, and to the well-known river for its natural beauty.
Demonstrators at Bosnian Down Novigrate insisted on Croatia to abandon its plans to save its old military settlement in Dkoska Kora and pledged to fight the plan.
Disposals of the Chrusco nuclear reactor will be placed at the site.
Bosons with banners saying, I need a healthy future and stop - we need the Una River will sink our nuclear waste and 250,000 people in the area will be at risk.
No, that's what we say.
This was stated by Mr. Miroslav Darelzaka, President, Navi Great Municipal Corporation.
We must fight to protect our lifestyle and our Una.
The 1980s plant in Slovenia belonged to Croatia.
The officials of the two countries will meet in the next week to discuss additional waste storages.
Croatia's national HRD television announced Friday that it is not yet decided whether Croatia will be able to secure its own savings or save its share in Slovenia's savings company.
Croatian minister for environmental protection and energy, Domislav Gorek, told the broadcaster that Croatia had problems in removing corporate wastes from schools, hospitals and prisons and seeking a holistic solution.
The activists, officials and residents from all regions of Bosnia, who came from different races, urged Croatia to select the region near the nuclear plant.
"Why was Dkoska Cora selected as part of Bosnia, leaving all parts of Croatia?" said Dr.
They must not humiliate us!

What is the Politician in Netflax's bag of manchhansen?
In such a situation, those who take care of the child or their parents are ill-treated like that of their child.

It tells the story of Beton Hobard, who wants to be the president of the United States, but he wants to be the chairman of the school's student house.
Ryan Murphi, who produced the American Horse Story and Glue, has been involved in the production of Weinet Baltro, Ben Plat and Lucy Feinton.
The event, which has not been mentioned much by those who have not seen it, indicates a story about how a person who is taken care of is really good, but is acting like a physical or mental disorder.
There are many ways in which the person pretends that he is not healthy.
However, a person who takes care of manchhen's bag is pretending to be healthy.
It is also known as created or induced deprivation and classified as child abuse.
It is hardly a situation where parents tend to override symptoms or develop symptoms to make their child look ill.
What are the symptoms of manchhansen 's bag ?
The symptoms may vary from one person to the other, but NHS states that awareness about the following situation should be maintained.
Even if your child is healthy, it is good to adapt to medical experts.
Encouraging or lying about symptoms.
Changing the results to show that the child is not healthy, for example, glucose in urinary samples to show that they have diabetes.
Igniting the symptoms of ill-health, e.g., giving them unnecessary medicines or other things.
Can we see the bag of Manchhasan more
It is difficult to understand the extent to which this situation has spread.
In a survey published in 2000, it was estimated that 89 of the 100,000 population had these symptoms in two years.
If you think a child is in danger then what should you do ?
You can contact your local service department or contact the Child Protection Assistance Centre of NSPCC at 0808 800 5000.

Parents have signed a form before they are enrolled in the school.
Parents are regularly bringing food to their children and are also aware of their status.
We were surprised when the police came and removed the children before the closure of the school and removed the food for the children brought by the parents of the children.
This is unfair because we have parents to testify that their children have been kept in a bad situation as the police say.
Earlier, Commissioner of Police, Abdurrahman, said that he had no complaint at the time of school visiting the school to see how children are being maintained.
The children did not read anything other than Kuran.
But when a public relations officer of the police, Yakub Sabo, said that the children will be brought back to their parents after being handed over to the state government.
They have been kept in an un-humanized environment in the name of Quran.
Many of them have pricks on their backs, indicating that they have fallen.
So we are asking in school to find out who the owner of the school is.

Over the past few days, whatsapp has been spreading a message under the title 'We need to beware of dogs'.
If a dog bites or scratches his nails, it was immediately asked to inform the child's parents.
Also, a video was attached, saying that the dog did not tell his parents that the virus had affected more than 90 percent of the virus to a child.
The boy who is undergoing treatment at the hospital is a dog-like scene on the video.
We asked an animal doctor, Anantapath, whether the drunken man behaves like a tongue or whether the information on what's spreading is true.
If a dog bites into a rabies virus, it will definitely affect the infected person.
However, due to the biting of the nails on the body, the rabies would not spread.
If the napkin is affected by rabies then the disease can spread by touching it.
If there is an injury and wound in the body of the injured person, then the disease can also spread if the nasal spit is affected by rabies in that place.
Therefore, it is better to have a Rabies vaccine in front of a dog breeder at home.
He said that as we need to provide treatment to dogs, we are also taking vaccinations once a year.

The Paris Police Monitoring System has been recommended on the issue of friendship with the woman entrepreneur Jennifer Arguri.
The independent office of the police is now assessing whether the prime minister should be tried for a criminal offence committed to government when he was mayor of London.
In a statement, the Vigilance Officer of The Greater London Authority (GLA) has registered a case relating to conduct, as to the allegation that Ms. Arguri was preferred by a friend of the Prime Minister.
It said, "When there is a report indicating that a criminal offence was committed, there is a matter of conduct," it said.
It does not mean that this has been proven in any way.
Now the IOPC will consider whether the matter should be investigated.
The matter has now been referred to the IOPC which is handling complaints against police in UK and Wales.
Shri Johnson was recommended to the Monitoring System as Shri Johnson was in the rank of Commissioner of Police and Criminal Justice.
Shri Johnson has denied any misapprehension to his friendship with Smt.
While insisting that they have been accused of the wrong person, he had earlier agreed to the London Assembly order to give details of his contacts with Ms. Arguerian.
This was after the statement made by the Sunday Times that Ms. Arguri, a London-based American, was given 126,000 from public funds seven years ago and was granted concession on three foreign travel visits led by Mr. Johnson as Mayor.
After that, the government has stopped after the re-assessment of the decision to grant 100,000 subsidy to Ms. Arguri's company, Hacker House.
It is also facing serious questions about the pre-payment verification process.
Digital Minister Mr. Matt Warner said that his department has done the necessary routine procedure and that the company had a British telephone number.
However, there are several reports indicating that the calls made by Ms. Arguri, 34 have been transferred to a California office presently.
The Prime Minister's friendship with a woman entrepreneur is a secret that everyone knows.
This move of GLA, which recommends the Prime Minister to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, has provoked anger in N-10.
This is a politically motivated attack and at a time when the Conservative Party Conference is going to be held, a senior government news source says that it is transparent politics.
"No evidence has been provided by the monitoring officer regarding any allegations and no opportunity has been given to the Prime Minister to respond to the monitoring officer before the press release on Friday night."
The public and the media will be well aware that this was openly fabricated with political motives.
Mr Johnson's close association with the California Industry Association with the help of London's Tourism Development Agency was earlier told to the Standby, earlier today.
Former officials of the London Partners (LB) agency, Smt. Arguri recalled how Smt. Arguri was given a place in the last foreign business visits led by Mr. Johnson as Mayor while some of her companies were called "non-profits" at that time.
In McMiller's death one third was accused of having drugs.
Los Angeles (AB): Last year, a third person was arrested and charged with drug abuse in connection with the death of rubber-meggler.
Last September, according to court documents, Stephen Walter suspected that Stephen Walter had sold counterfeit oxygoton tablets in Feinton, Miller, before he accidentally overthrew Goeine, Madhu and the mightiest of thousands of lives in the United States of America, and Feinton, the mightiest of them.
Walter was charged that another person, Cameron Bett, had given tablets sold for Miller.
A court document published Tuesday reported that he had received Petty drugs from Walter since August.
Earlier this week, Ryan Revis, arrested in Lake Hawasa City, Arizona, has been accused of being a 'Runner' for carrying tablets.
None of them have been directly charged with Miller's death, and none of them have appealed.
Walter, who was released under surveillance in a drug case in 2005, has already been ordered to undergo a five-month imprisonment for breaching the conditions of her release.
Lawyers dealing with the case, first revealed by the popular website TMED on Thursday, told Walter to remain in jail until the trial.
There was no immediate response to the phone call sent to his lawyer.
On September 4, Betty was charged in the Federal Court, and his lawyer refused to comment.
Miller's response consists of an open talk on stress and drug abuse, which has made some of the largest people in the hip-hap as fans.
Malcolm James Mercermic, a native of Pittsburgh, was in a two-year relationship with singer Haryana Grand, which concluded in early 2018.
After his death, the singer shared a loving video about him on his Instagram page and released the song 'Thank you Next', in which he was affectionately mentioned.
Miller's death was one of the deaths of music artists associated with the use of Apioid in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, a Dutch artist in the 3 Dors Down Group, died in 2016 when he was in Fenton and Hydrocon.
The article was amended to show that Walter's first name was Stephen, not Steven.
Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Shri Trivendra Singh Rawat, has said that 650 grams of paracetamol is sufficient for people suffering from dengue and there is no need to take it seriously.
This indifference of the Chief Minister has created a lot of controversy in the state.
So far, more than 1,000 people have been cured of dengue in the state of Uttarakhand.
Opposition parties, including the Congress, are accusing the government of not taking proper precautions.
The Chief Minister said that the Government took adequate precautions and asked people to go for treatment in Government hospitals due to dengue.
If he had come, it would have been better if he had come, but he had also suggested something.
Instead of taking a 650 gm paracetamal pill in response to a 500 gm paracetamal pill, he said that dengue fever could run on even after taking a rest.
He said this while health officials have asked people suffering from dengue to come to the proper treatment without taking the medicines themselves.
Just a few months ago, the same Chief Minister had suggested that breathing would be smooth if he had breathed his last from Pashumata.
A nine year old Nigerian boy has made more than 30 mobile phones .
The 9-year-old boy is making a spectacle game using Scratch 2, an app free of cost.
Scratch 2 allows users to develop games, animations and stories online or online.
So far, more than 30 mobile phones have been used in hunger.
The boy has been forced to hide a fountain in the game.
Every time he takes a bowl from his hiding place, the player gets a point.
I learnt in a boot camp how to create a game.
"Now, while fighting for me, I am actively involved in creating sports," said Pasil to CNN.
In March, his father added him to a five-day boot camp for children aged 5 to 15 years.
Organized by CodFest International, the Camp was provided with opportunities to access emerging technologies such as Child Robotics, Virtual Reality etc.
His father Bazil Okbara senior says that he has played a lot of cell phone games regularly during the fast growing season.
When he was 4 years old, I got one tablet for him.
He played a great role in the Centricrish and Temple Run, he told his father CNN.
But after his father had asked him to spend all his time in sports, he was hungry at the age of seven.
As usual, his father said, "I was angry that he was playing mummer in his tablet.
I asked him, "Do you ever think of making a sport so that others can play your game?"
I was angry when I said that, but I do not know that he took it seriously.
Since then, he has been very eager to learn how to make sports himself, so his parents have given him a bowl of money and invited him to learn the basis for making sports.
The hunger he wants to become a scientist in the future is based on what his games are about.
One of his games is 'Masquito Mesh' which is available in Google Play Store.
Africa has the largest number of youth in the world and when it comes to innovation, the hungry people of this continent are at the forefront.
Two Nigerian boys, 12, were recently praised for making robots agendas to do their home work.
In May 2019, Team Acrobat, a team of all women high school teams from Kana, created a roadmap for rolling out robots and won the 2019 Robotics competition.
Large tech companies like Google and Microsoft are increasingly investing in Africa, and hungry and their colleagues are becoming future indicators.
Former leader of the North Carolina Republican Party is going to confess to lying in the bribery investigation .
The court documents submitted Friday that the former president of the Carolina Republican Party will agree to the court that he had lied to federal officials who conducted a probe into the principal political donor.
The Federal Court's claim that Rabin Hayes is going to confess the crime next Wednesday.
It is stated that Hayes was aware of the fact that he had told the FBI agents who had filed the case in 2018 in a document based on the fact that the lawyer of Hayes had signed as part of the Criminal Procedure Treaty.
The criminal sanction agreement has been stamped, not on the ground, on which charges he admits.
He was initially charged with charges of plotting, bribery and unverified information.
Lawyers charged with the involvement of former MP Hayes in the insurance officer's plan to receive special concessions in response to the election campaign donation by the state's principal insurance regulator.
The official, Greg Lindberg and his associates, were charged with attempting to bribe State Insurance Commissioner Mike Kaze.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment company, who has been one of the principal political donors of the state in recent years, and has donated more than $5 million from 2016 to state and federal candidates.
He donated to the Democrats, although he was provoking Republican policies and its politicians.
His lawyer did not respond to the email sent to him on Friday.
Charles Davis, a lawyer for Hayes, did not respond to an email sent for further comments on Friday.
In August 2018, when the FBI told the agents that they had never spoken to Cachet of the employee of the State Insurance Sector, the court documents submitted Friday that Hayes had lied.
But Hayes had really spoken to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's demand for the transfer of staff within the regulatory agency.
Lawyers say that when Lindberg asked for a meeting with Cachet, Hayes had directly consulted the regulator about the bribe.
The charge issued in April accuses Lindberg of seeking special concessions to his insurance industry, and of offering up to $2 million for the Gaza re-election campaign of 2020.
The allegation that the plan also included a request for transfer of a department officer reviewing a Litberg Institute.
The Republican leader, Gaze Federal, told intelligence officials about the attempt to bribe them and helped them to file a lawsuit.
There's no charge against him.
In a conversation between Lindberg and Cachet, a partner from Lindberg told Hayes to send $250,000 to the Gaza re-election campaign.
Heys, who initially denied sending such a large amount of money, said it would be looked after, but at the end of the conversation, was critical.
Heys said, We will do whatever you want and we will do it.
All right, let him do this.
The information officer of the Federal Prosecutor's Office did not respond to an email seeking further information on the Criminal Procedure Agreement.
The Facebook page will hide the number of aspirations as a test effort to improve the health of the users.
Some Facebook users will no longer be able to see responses, responses, and video messages for registration as the worlds first experiment in improving the health of the users.
On the contrary, in the month of July in Instagram, Australia, these wishes will be personal and will be seen only by those who have filed it.
The trial will begin on Friday, and will begin in Australia.
This change is also based on the opinion of psychologists that the number of health research and desires compares each other to the society, according to Mia Carlik, director of Australian Facebook.
"There are really positive comments from many anti-crime groups and mental companies working with us," Carlik said.
This is to focus on the quality of their interaction and the quality of their records, in response to the fact that the numbers are over-emphasised and are actually focusing on the number of aspirations or responses.
He said that it is not considered a competition, but it is expected that people will feel more comfortable sharing on this platform.
Carlik promised that the face-to-face-based industries would continue to receive the same scales and the same perspectives they had previously approached.
He said that as early as possible, the test would not be done in other countries like Instagram, Canada, Brazil, New ealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
There is no reference to when the test can be done or whether the change will be made permanent, as is available on the Instagram's owner.
We have just received some initial comments from the public about this experience (in Instagram), but at this stage we are still learning and observing, he said.
Speaking about the world being a testing hub, Carlik said that Australia has one of the most active technology-enabled users in Facebook and Instagram.
We believe that this will be the best country to really get the best ideas on whether it is a valuable experience or not to the people who use our services.
Every person is grateful to the parents who have nurtured him.
The sacrifices made by the parents to raise a child are not enough.
Sastry says that it is important to continue with this kind of gratitude even after their lives, as it is necessary to provide all the necessary help to them in their lifetime.
For that, they set up a bifurcation unit.
It is said in many names, Darpanam, Pedoria, Preorkagan.
With gratitude, they will call it 'Sirthartham' because it is necessary to do it with diligence on the day of the last month.
The goddess Thiruvalluvar Tiruvalluvar, the god of South Tamils is a guest house, he is the head of the 1500-600 years old," says Thirukkural.
The so-called 'Thenpular' is a sign of the late perspective.
As the world of the ancestors is south, they call the world they live as 'the island'.
Although it has been said for several days to make a pilgrimage, it is important to visit every month at least every month.
Some people give only ti, ti and ti.
If the Father had not yet performed his vision, and had begun it on the new moon, it would have been very special.
On this occasion, our ancestors are coming to Earth as a whole.
They will use butter, water, bread, rice, banana, and food during the darshan.
The scriptures say that the latter angels will bring them to the ancestors.
The father who came to see his children to the world is returning to the world again today.
On this day, bathing on the banks of the Tirthankaras, offering prayers and sending them along the way, will help the family to live happily, live and live.

The Madras High Court asked the Tamil Nadu Government not to grant any separate reservation to government medical colleges for students studying in government schools.
In Tamil Nadu, 207 seats are not filled in reserved seats for overseas Indian nationals in private medical colleges and they are given to the respective colleges as administrative accommodation.
Thirun from Coimbatore filed a case in the High Court in Chennai demanding that these places be properly consulted.
The case came to trial in a sitting of judges such as Kribakaran and Velmurugan.
The case will be filed by Shri V.P. Raman, appearing for the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on the basis of a list of 10 students in case of vacant seats in Indian nationals residing abroad after a three-stage consultation.
The list should be filled by the College under the relevant provisions of the Rules.
But I don't know if the list was filled in the base.
The list of vacant seats will be forwarded to the concerned college for further consideration by Additional Chief Prosecutor Arvind Pandian on behalf of the Tamil Nadu Government.
Only as far as the merit is concerned, the empty spaces should be filled.
But I don't know how colleges are filling up.
The Supreme Court has not issued any order in this regard.
Hence, he advocated the appropriate order of the Adjudicating Authority for filling up of reservation accommodation for overseas Indians.
The petitioner's lawyer Velmurugan argued that the 207 vacant seats were sold to those with lower marks.
Why should not the judges intervene, who go to private schools for school, who want government medical colleges only for medical education, why should not the government school students be given a separate reservation in government medical colleges, if they send a list of vacant seats, then what is the basis for filling up?
Here the government doctors are being paid less than the teachers and why they are being paid less than the assistants.
We consider this as an injustice done to doctors.
We order 10 separate Medical Colleges in Tamil Nadu to join the case as counter-respondents.
The students enrolled in the reserved seats for overseas Indian nationals were directed to submit their marks as a report by 15th October, 2018.
Pakistan's social media figure, Guantil Baloch, has been sentenced to life imprisonment for his brother.
Guantil Baloch, popularly known as his social media photo, was murdered in July 2016.
His brother was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment last Friday for killing Kuvindal Baloch, a Pakistani social media figure in the high-level murder of Aradika.
Felicitated by Western civilization, but deeply hated women, Baloch, famous for his attractive cell phones in Pakistan, was strangled to death in July.
His brother Mohammad Wasim was arrested.
A few days later, he said at a press conference that he had not felt sorry for what he had done and said yes, I have murdered my sister and sister's behavior is very provocative.
In a long-awaited ruling, the court in the eastern city of Muldan had convicted his client and sentenced him to life imprisonment, according to his lawyer, Sardar Mohammed AFF.
In Asia, he will be released in the High Court, he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai told the AFP that she believed that her son would be released.
He's innocent.
She is my daughter, she is my son, he said.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister reiterated his appeal to one person, who was regularly involved in the killing of a woman, to take action against the pandemic, such as murder of a woman, in order to break the social restrictions of the spiritual community.
Women have been burned, shot, locked up and tied to their necks to bring shame to their family on account of crimes like their own husbands choosing their husbands or - having their wife like Baloch.
The killings were usually carried out by a close relative.
According to Pakistan's Quices (Revenue Money) and Diyat (Repayment) Act, they can apologize to relatives of the victims.
Three months after the assassination of Baluch, the Parliament passed a new law making life imprisonment mandatory for honorable killings.
However, the judge's own decision was whether a murder would be treated as a murder, so that the killers could be pardoned by presenting a different cause of the murder.
In the murder of Baloch, his parents initially insisted that their son should not be forgiven and released.
But they were inclined to lose their son too, so they changed their minds and asked him to apologize.
However, due to international hatred of the killing, the Pakistani government took a rare step to declare itself as a heir with the parents and made progress in the case.
The wear of Pakistan's cricket team and the wearing of attractive skirts on a lover's day are some of the familiar activities of Baloch.
This led to protests and threats, but it was seen as a bold and political measure of women's empowerment as a country that saw itself as figures of figures such as Kim Cordassin, which was seen as a completely new thing, including the young community.
The roots of the "Gaurav" killings are rooted in tribal social restraints, widespread throughout South Asia, and may be affected by men, but command the conduct of women.
Today we are losing ground water in a very small way.
Just now we have started to feel the need for palm trees.
The Pan Seed Festival across Tamil Nadu is now popular among social activists and youth.

I am familiar with the youth who are uniting the Prabhakaran Revolution Seeds Movement.
Edison, one of them, told me about their work.

The scheme has been implemented to enable pregnant women to grow their children healthy.
This scheme was very beneficial for middle and poor pregnant women.
Over the last one year, maternity benefit to pregnant women has been stopped from being regularized.
Social activists said, 'The 18,000 maternity donations made by the Department of Public Health and Family Welfare to pregnant women have not been paid for more than 13 months.
This has affected the safety of the mother and the child during childbirth.
There has been a situation of borrowing and spending for child care.
Only the nutritional component has been provided, so far, the subsidy has not been kept in the bank account.
In this regard, in consultation with the State Health Department officials, the first instalment of the central government will not be released.
2,000 after the first instalment of the Government, the next instalment of Rs. 16,000 will be credited.
However, it is said that the Tamil Nadu government has formally registered the requests for maternity benefits.
Therefore, the government has to make an instant payment of maternity allowance which has not been paid for more than a year.'

Law disobedience doubled the number of displaced persons from northwest Nigeria to 40,000: UNHR
The United Nations reported Friday that the worsening violence has doubled the number of immigrants from northwest Nigeria to more than 40,000 in the last four months.
UN refugee agency said that the turmoil had created a new humanitarian emergency, requiring an effort to finance $35.5 million within the agency by the end of this year.
UNHCR spokesman Babbar Baloch said that the Islamic organization, Boko Haram, which has been agitating for UNHR for more than ten years in the northern part of the country, was not responsible for the recent attacks.
On the contrary, violence in the last 10 states has increased due to the activities of armed groups in the Nigerian states of Sokodo, Samfera and Kesina.
He told the press on Friday that this law shows a bad situation of disobedience and insecurity.
News of smuggling, atrocities, money laundering, murder and sexual violence often engages, destroys homes and steals property.
Army and Police have been deployed to deal with the criminal groups in the area.
However, the Army, Bogawoh Haram and the Islamic State, which had split from the group in 2016, lost its strength in combating the West African branch.
Refugees do not come and name the groups, he said.
They say it's terrible stories.
The survivors often go to the nearest Niger.
In a report, the UNHR claimed that in the coming months, more would be expected to flee to Niger when the security situation is worsening, especially in the state of Sokoto.

According to the documents, the District Court of Bok County has alleged in three sections that Marvin Escobar-Arlana, 31, was deliberately murdered, and was originally named after Marvin Escobar-Lobus, who had given the police personnel.
He denied the crime.
On July 16, police claimed he had shot a 29-year-old Rosiebeth Flores-Rotrix at a house in De Myin, threatening to kill her 11-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son.
The court documents show that January 27, the date of the new trial, would give more time for both parties to prepare.
The US immigration and customs authorities have claimed that Escobar-Arlana is in contravention of law in the United States and that the fire threat has been violated twice in the US.
He was convicted in 2010 for entering the United States on an extra-legal basis.

There is growing fear among top officials around the prime minister that the time for major concessions is declining, just three weeks after the European heads of state for the multi-examination summit.
Ministers rebelled against Boris Johnson for a compromise agreement with the European Union to reduce the frequency demands.

A minister termed the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday as "Time to Resolve" to end the postponement of Parliament, adding: Now we have only one contract for October 31.
We can never get the numbers in the lower house and they are against us as well.
Now the prime minister should be able to bend and get what he can.
Comming's plan has clearly failed.
We cannot fight everywhere.
Shri Johnson was informed that the Cabinet Minister is committed to trying to implement the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May, if everything else fails.
The senior minister added: "If required, I would tell Boris to put the agreement down."
Now there is enough number for it, and everyone is trying hard to finish it.
When we were urged to continue this thing, all this happened to Paris and all of us were able to do it.
Sir John Major accused Boris of not giving importance to the talks.
In a talk of humor, the former Tory leader said: "The Prime Minister wants us to sign an agreement with Europe.
But we could not find a deal by sitting with Brussels.
On the other hand, we have seen in Scotland the bullocks, the eggs in Wales, and the public debate on the streets - as if an election campaign is already being held in full swing.
The Prime Minister's spokesperson admitted that the agreement is far away from the agreement, saying, "No one can imagine, we have to go a long way to reach the agreement.
The Ben Law, which imposes a three-month delay, in the absence of a contract, strongly undermines our dialogue process in Brussels, said the speaker.
There is no doubt that it hinders our dialogue process, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues continue to strive for its progress due to this Act, he said.
Frequent Secretary Stephen Bargle is going back to Brussels today for further talks with Michael Barney of the European Union.
They will discuss a document on how all Ireland can be made possible for food and livestock.

Laurence Kelly: I was told that I could never enter the television with Glasgow.
He said that TV owners have told him that they can never be made a part of the program because of their Glasgow proclamation.
Looking back for 35 years in the broadcasting sector, he recalled that Kelly had felt a very good film before he first appeared on the screen.
When I was 25, I was very filmed, he said.
I was a researcher at BBC Scotland and my employer said that he would never be able to enter television because of the clarion call of Glasgow.
Before I took over in Glasgow's office, I went to London to watch TV crew and telecast the program.
I will never forget that on that morning, both On Times and Mike Maurice had spoken to the famous Beat Davis.
I could not believe that I was in the same room as one of the greatest figures.
I realized that this is the place I wanted to be.
Kelly started his life as a local daily journalist in East Gilbrid in Scotland, and became a Scottish reporter for AM television in 1984.
He began by summing up events such as GMTV, ITV, Breakfast and Tabrek and then inaugurated the morning function named Lorene.
He will celebrate his 35th anniversary with a special occasion to remember his unforgettable moments and interviews.
He said that passion, enthusiasm and zeal are the secret to stay on television and you should give us the necessary hard work.
You have to be honest and true.
Make preparations, be more eager, and be interested in you.
While recalling that he had been mentally ill, Kelly had said that the announcement of the Donble massacre was "very difficult".
I do not know that the day after the brutal killing of sixteen children and their teacher, many families of the dead or injured children were watching the incident.

Since then, Ba and I have been friends since I have gone to Jonah's funeral to pursue our relationship.
When her daughter lost her daughter in 2007, she interacted with Kate and Kerry McKen, who had done a great job and truly appreciated their grit and courage, he said.

I was very sorry for them.

Zimbabwe: Sivaganga feared being trapped
A senior government official said that former President Robert Mugabe had given the opportunity to become president at the height of the revolution, when he refused to accept Tunana-President Konstantino Chivenga, who feared that it might be a trap in November 2017 to impose power on the military to seize power.
Last week, according to imbabwe Independent, he told Chivenga to accept the presidency following talks between himself and the military during the revolution.
However, a senior government official told the social media that he could not deny the opportunity due to fear, and that he was able to understand the plans of Mugabe, which he could use to prove to world leaders and the leaders of the African Union (AU) that he had actually lost office in the revolution.
Zimbabwe's 37-year-old ruler was prepared to hand over power to Sri Lanka, but Jamvada 2, confirmed by government officials that Chancellor Emerson was a senior government official in the presidential office and cabinet office, not with Nangaw.
Government officials said that he had approached Siwanga through one of his envoys, who felt that power had fallen from his hands.
According to the senior government official, there were three persons in the arbitration between the head of the military occupation and the late former president.
Among those involved would be the president's spokesman, George Sarba, Aaron Nebra, then president of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Roman Catholic Bishop Glory Fidelis Muconori.
He was another person involved in the discussions after being sent separately by former Governor of imbabwe Reserve Bank of India, Gideon Gono Mugabe, who was the General of the imbabwe Defence Force (ESTF) to give him the presidency.
He was described as the symbol of Africa after the death of more than the living and sought the intervention of other African leaders, while attempting to waste the African Union's recognition of the military's operations.
The deceased (Mugabe) then CDF (General of the Security Forces, Siwanga) did not elect him as president.
The official (Jamwanda) wrote: It was a desperate attempt to repair the rapidly growing situation in danger and to wipe out a part of the late Presidential family.
But there was little political manoeuvre, which the late chancellor hoped, at least on a diplomatic basis, would correct the situation.
To recall the generals' pledge not to disrupt and disrupt the constitutional order, this shift would have confronted them with the attitude of the African Union of Revolutions.
The late president (Mugabe) hoped that the then CDF would fall into a trap and ensure the words of the generals that they did not disrupt the constitution.
In view of the whole situation and on the basis of its theoretical approach to revolutions, the African Union, which had been so confused about how to take it, would have had no other way to call it a revolution, so that it could have been believed that there was a need for military intervention.
That was an opportunity to reckon with.
More than that, when the security forces realized that they were not prepared to save themselves, the authorities said that the operation was being carried out by Mugabe.
They said that the camp was compelled to write a letter of resignation as the army warned him of the danger of being killed as Gadabi.
Army chiefs told him that they would not protect him if civilians marched to his Floo Rope settlement.
He had two wishes to protect his family at that time and prove that the army had captured the regime.'
The CDF and the Commanders then understood the idea well.
The senior government official said that we were not politicians or those in political competition - through a powerful eloquence - Visu Triri vamekwapa-makwapa (which we did not show, i.e., the military).
Government officials say that through their own men in imbabwe, the army officers have shown that the army has no intention of evacuating the camp but to take care of the 'crimes' around him.
In order to consider the revolution and the continuity of rule, Mugabe also sought to use the same strategy to deceive Nangagwa, who had been a little asylum in South Africa.
Apart from negotiating with the military, Mugabe also sought assistance from the region.
South Africa, which was the principal source of this process - not only because of its economic and regional strength, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the then President of the SATC - refused to intervene, but made it clear that the South African forces would immediately arrive at Harare if the army had entered the camp as a continuous threat from the latter.
The news source told the Independent that the leaders of New and African countries did not want it to happen.
Education Minister Akhil Viraj Karyavasam has said that all students who have studied at higher levels in national schools will be given a tape.
This was stated by the Minister during a media briefing in Ministry of Education yesterday.

China needs a strong leadership, otherwise the 'depressive' policy framework.
In a policy release issued Friday on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples Republic, the government declared that if China does not need a strong and united leadership of the Communist Party.
The Chinese cabinet news office said in a white statement that the country's victory was dependent on the party's leadership since the Communists took power 70 years ago.
China is the largest, its national conditions are complex and its administrative difficulties are scarce.
In the absence of a unified and strong leadership, China will move towards separatism, break down and bring about a catastrophe for the world.
As in 1989, Chinese authorities have long justified the need for national stability to suppress the problems with iron and iron.
The powerful leader who will preside over the anniversary celebrations of the world's second largest economy Tuesday, Jean-Zinging, has further strengthened the party's rule, and has controlled those who can challenge his power since he took office in late 2012.
The Army Modernization Programme under G supervision has created tension in the region.
China does not expect to export its model of development or import any other foreign model, the policy document states. The country's request is not just peace, it is not 'adversarial'.
The Chinese genealogy is not about to invade others or dominate the world.
China is being threatened by the great powers of modern times, and the impact of war and turmoil has created a profound shock, and China will never experience the difficulties it has experienced.
China is celebrating this year's anniversary as it confronts a falling economy and protests against the state in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, as it confronts a fierce trade war with the US.
It said that the country would never give up China's interests and would never compromise its security and sovereignty.
The threat of trade war and the ever-growing tax regime is not conducive to resolving the issue, it referred to the trade issues with Washington.
China is a thriving economy with a holistic industrial system, a complete industrial tie-up, a wider market and a strong economic power.
Business wars will never weaken, the note added.
China is confident that it will be able to face difficulties, turn barriers into lessons, and create a new world.
It added that the US should prudently look at China's progress as China has no intention of challenging the US or an alternative to the US.
The US cannot control China, and there is no chance of stopping China's growth.
The US will not be able to prevent, suppress, and carry out domestic issues abroad.
On the first day of dengue there will be general symptoms like cold, fever, headache and body pain.
If there is dengue fever then the fever will be severe for the next two days.
There is unbearable pain behind the eyes, and body ache.
As if the bone has broken, it will freeze as a whole.
Like a mirror on the face, dengue will be affected.
The face is swollen.
The emergence of red spots in the body is a major symptom of dengue.
There is also a need to carry out blood tests including 'Dengue IGM' and 'Dengue IgG' across the country.
The number of blood vessels in a healthy person should be around 3 lakh.
With dengue fever, the number of tapas could fall below 20,000.
Hence, a screening of the number of Blood Penetration Resistance Test is required.
There is no specific treatment for dengue fever and only symptoms will be treated.
That's why it's best to prevent dengue fever.
Today is the start of Navratri fast.
Navaratri, one of the main Hindu festivals, will begin today.

It is a great day for the Prime Minister to be able to see a star in Tithi.
On that day, the goddess will offer whatever he wants to worship him.

For the next three days, Mahalakshmi will have to worship her for wealth.
In the last three days, we must worship the art of learning, knowledge and all art wisdom.
On these days, the women will be taken home, using them as force multipliers, and will be offered turmeric, henchmen, cotton, naan and tambool.
During the Navaratri period, oil has been coated off completely.
Do not wear needles and needles.
When it comes on this Navaratri day, one can take a bath without oil.
They can be burnt and worshipped.
Those who want to observe Navratri regularly should make a shower of milk and strength on the first day of the day, after the day's prayers are over without food, at 10:30 a.m. on Vijayadashami with a fast in Navami.
Those who cannot afford it can have one meal on the first day and only milk on the last day.
Puranas say that Navaratri is like a ratha but there is no other source of much benefit as it is .
It is a festival of Navratri that gives everything to a man like grain, grain, stable happiness, long life, health, heaven and love.
For those who do not have childbirth, it is a good thing for them.
The drudgery of the course can achieve a higher level of excellence by following this spirit.
If those who are unable to worship for nine days on Ashtami were to lead the way and wake up that night, then Durgadevi would have saved their lives.
Similarly, on the day of the original star or on November, we should definitely use it on the occasion of Vijayadashami and not use it that day by day.
The purpose of the festival is to worship the three elements - Saraswati, Lakshmi and Durga - for the purpose of education, wealth and bravery of the human being who speaks of the power of Navaratri worship.
After the election of Zinking as Chinese president for the second time, the grip of the communist state on Muslims was further intensified.

Tourist places are found to be extremely polluted .
The biggest contribution to the Sydney tourism sector, which is valued at $21.9 billion a year for the Australian economy, is the Sydney port surrounded by Oberoi House, Circular Kwe, Luna Bars and the symbolic port bridge.
But being below that bridge is a bitter truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, with 15 Olympic Swimming ponds being added every year.
This dramatic figure makes it one of the most attractive destinations for tourists.
As per a new video titled Sydney Port further and downward, the water in Australia's most famous city is filled with cigarette pieces, plastic bags and bottles, long distance footwear and clothes, and dead animals, all of which are entering the port by rain water.
But plastic plays a major role in blocking our waterways.
In a video release similar to the World Tourism Day on 27th September, Dr. Katherine Day, Deputy Director of the Sydney Port Research Project, said, I call this a "Murney".
It looks beautiful to see, but it is one of the most transformed and polluted toilets in our seas.
Every hour, about 1560 kilometres of plastic comes under our waterways, most of which are entering the port through rain water harvesting.
Dr. Tafran said, The port is in a very bad state, following a few incidents of heavy rainfall.
One-third of these effluents are affected by rain water harvesting.
However, as 70 of the plastics in the sea reaches the sea level, the problem of Sydney port is as big below the surface as an ice sheet.
Richard Nicolas, owner of the Manley Dive Centre, said that he and his team personally take out 500 kg of plastic every year and said, "What is there really, only if you go under the water and spend time."
If most people come to know about this (what is inside the water) they will be shocked.
Most... almost half of everything we find is plastic bags.
The remaining 50 will be made of plastic at least.
If you look at the port then it will look very beautiful but people do not believe that all these plastics and garbage are available from below its surface.
Jeremiah, Deputy Controller and Management, Ocean Protected, said that both local and tourist have the same means of helping to reduce the plastic and waste to reach our waterways.
It has to start from the source, he said.
There should be greater awareness about reducing the size of plastic we use and recycling and lastly reaching the ocean that our cells reach the sea.
If we destroy the sea, we will destroy ourselves because 50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the sea.
It absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and food resources.
But we can fix this port and bring it to its old level, which is very easy.
If we destroy the sea, we destroy ourselves.
As part of its broader efforts to sensitize the Australians about the importance of protecting the environment and minimising the effect of drinking water supply, the video released by the recycling company, DOMRA, is in line with a survey on plastic and mental health released this month.
An opinion poll conducted with 546 children between the ages of 12 to 18 showed that 82 percent of plastic waste is unbelievable and 25 percent have accused adults of the problem of single use plastic.
The study also found that there is a growing concern about the size of plastic in the oceans and 93 percent of the 551 parents in the 551 parents who were asked to use plastics for the fourth time on issues of concern for parents.
Many of the participants in the study said that we want to do something about plastic waste, but we do not know how to make a difference, it causes environmental disturbance.
The archaeologists have discovered the Pandian era of the 13th century BC in the Uruni Ghat area of Govanur near Sivaganga.

Six ancient inscriptions were found at the Baruni Ghat at Govanur.
After reading all these, the inscription analyst V. Rajaguru said:
On the east bank of the fountain at the mouth of Gonorrhoea, there is a ghatta in the north and a canal in the north.
There are six fragments of ancient inscriptions containing different information in the bow ghat.
In addition to the other inscriptions, the first Marvarman who ruled Madurai as the capital of 1216 to 1244, is one of the nine lines.
In this, information has been recorded including the burning of Tanjavur, Urandha and Chandala, the building and the hall.
The deductions cover the names of the officers of the department managing the tax accounts of the government as well as those of Uzhakudi Muthan, Dashanurun, Veerapanjan, Tirthankaraiyan, Sundaravanavan, Vijayarayan and Vandrayan.
In the middle of the sayings, the following is the mention of the Kalukuthu, Maduradayya, Keeranur, Kanzurhai, the same cities as Tanchur, Pullurukkudi, Madhurodiya, Udukkudi, Kalkuchikudi and Uzhakudi are also mentioned in the rock cuttings.
Indices have been used in the Kalpetta to determine the extent of land mass such as barley and dhama.
The writings on the net do not come mostly in the rocks.
But the word that one of the stones is to be removed is straight and the other is to stand up.
In addition to this, there is a large number of black and red pans of the association in this area.

Dosmines can be the guide for treatment of cancer .
The Dosmanian towers can lead to cancer cure - researchers have found a turning point in bringing revolution in the treatment of patients.
Physicians have found out how many cancer cells hide themselves .
Researchers have found out that the same procedure is going on with the desmanians and humans .
This discovery is expected to give new options for the treatment of cancer patients .
What's common with the Tasmanian towers and humans?
Eyeless cancer cells.
Researchers, including those from the Peter McCallam Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have come up with an invention that will help revolutionise the treatment if some cancers do not respond to the immune system.
It may be a key factor in fixing dangerous masks that threaten the future of the devastated Tasmanian towers.
The study has found that a group of proteins called BRCC2 have concealed themselves from being a target of attacking the immune system cancer and some cancer cells in humans and in the organism can hide themselves.
This can be a major challenge in the treatment of small-cell lung cancer, neurobllastoma and a type of cancer called Merkel cell.
The biggest advantage of this action is that we can take the process back to the patients who are at risk of catching the disease in a short span of time, said Mr Mark Dasson, a Peter Mac researcher.
The objective of the existing treatment can be changed and the immune system can detect the cancer cells from the cells of the cancer cells, which are indicative of the MCH (proteins).
It is possible for cancer patients to have long-term benefits, said Professor Dasan.
This is one of the highest number of diseases in the world.
We can treat this in an even better way.
Researchers believe that this discovery can be ultimately used in facial tumors of dosmanian towers that prevent cancer cells being detected in a similar way.
It is noteworthy to point out that precisely the same process (with humans and dosmanian death cancer) takes place.
Till date, it has been very difficult to treat the cancerous tumors of the dosmenium.
But if human-powered medicines can be used even in the Dasmanian towers, this can help in the control of the disease, he said.

Scientists have confused on seeing big planets roaming around small stars .
Scientists are astonished to find a solar family, 30-years away from Earth, a mass planet that revolves around a small star Red Tower, that challenges the current understanding of planet formation.
GJ 3512 B is the art form of GJ 3512 B, the largest gas planet that surrounds its tiny nutrient-rich Red Dwarf released on September 26, 2019.
Stars are generally larger than the largest planets around them.
But in this event, researchers said on Thursday that the star does not make a big difference in size and size.
While the star GJ 3512 is 12 of our Sun, the size of the planet that revolves around it will be at least half the size of the huge planet that our Sun family has.
Chairing a research published in the journal Science, Mr Carlos Morales, an aeronautic of the California Space Research Organization, Space Science Institute, Spain, said, Yes, it is a matter of great surprise.
The discovery was a surprise when the theoretical models suggest that the low mass stars, such as Earth and Small Neptune, usually have small planets.
In this, we have discovered a big gas planet that revolves around a small star like Thursday, Morales added.
The planet, which was heavily airborne like Thursday, was discovered using a telescope at the Cailer Alto Astronomy lab in Spain.
It revolves around its 204-day long circumference.
Red-dwarves are small and have low temperatures on the surface.
The GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than our Sun, but it is slightly larger than just 35 percent more than Thursday, compared to a big planet.
They are less energy-efficient and more flexible than the sun and their surface temperature is slightly cold at 3800 (degree) and 3880 degree Fahrenheit 3,527 Celsius.
That's why they have red colour, said Morales.
Morales said that while the source of the second planet is that the third planet might have fallen from the family of the star in the past, this explains the long orbit of a planet like Thursday.
The planets are formed from the same layer of gas and dust within the layers that make the star around them.
As the primary model for planet formation, known as the 'My Growth Growth' model, initially means a substance derived from solid particles in the layer, leading to the formation of an atmosphere from the surrounding gas.
This is an offshoot of this pattern of unstable gravity.
In this event, Proto Planetarium, around a young star, could be slightly bigger and colder than expected, said Morales.
This makes the layer unstable, causing some thick regions to appear.
These dots can flourish to a great extent, thus creating a planet.
The order of the High Court of Tripura which prohibits the sacrifice of sheep and goat in temples has become a controversy.
The state government told the court that Tripura's promise to join India in 1949 was in contravention.
1355 years and 184 kings of Tripura signed the MoU with India on 15th October, 1949.

The main feature of the Agreement is that it will continue to provide financial assistance to the Tripura Government for traditional worship of 14 temples including the famous Tripura Sundari Temple.
We usually sacrifice sheep in Tripura Sundari temple.
The government is also providing financial assistance for this.
This should not be changed is the key element of the Connectivity Agreement with India.
Against this, Subhash Chatterjee, a member of the Tripura High Court, continued the welfare case in the Tripura High Court, saying that the sacrifice of sheep and goats with the help of the government.
Judges of the Division Bench, Sanjay Carol and Aritham Lotha, who investigated the case, banned the sacrifice of sheep goats in religious shrines in Tripura.
The court also ordered that the government should not help the goats sacrifice.
The Court has also sent a notice to all the District Magistrates and Superintendents of Police to reply to the matter.
The court has also ordered the CCTV cameras to be installed and monitored in all the temples, except for the use of sheep and goats.
Now the state government is going to appeal to the Supreme Court against this order of the Tripura High Court.
The state government is seeking an appeal in the Supreme Court, pointing out that the Tripura High Court has rejected its plea not to violate its promise to join India in 1949.

Royal Family Secrets: Exclamation of surprise guests visiting the Royal Airplane.
As part of their official duties, the royal family should undertake hundreds of visits around the world in their lifetime.
Normally making it easier - Royal flight - a private flight carrying royal family around the world to carry important events and pre-existing events.
It is no surprise that there are personal concessions due to private aircraft alone.
It seems that there is no need to wait in the long security lines and with the restriction of the number of bags, the royal family seems to be carrying any guest of their interest - including some unexpected travellers.
According to the recently released Channel 5 document, there are no queens and Prince Philips who travel frequently in the Royal Air Force.
On the occasion of 'Rail Aircraft Secrets', the former aircraft carrying the Rani's aircraft, she said that many animals would often be guests with family members.
Bob Schellts said, Some of the important family dogs along with our important family members can also come as travellers from time to time.
It is not surprising that the queen, known for her deep love for the carkis type dogs, was invited to travel with her lover.
It is said that Elizabeth Rani loved four animals since her youth, who had more than 30 carkis breed dogs since she had a hair cut.
It is believed that in 2007, he had five carkis dogs - Mandi, Emma, Linnet, Willo and Holly.
These included five cakar Spanish dogs - Bisto, Oxo, flash, speck and span, in addition four dashant-carki dogs - Sitter, Ferry, Walgan and Candy.
The personnel at the Royal Air Force will get comfortable work.
Sheelts further said that before the dogs are on board, members of the staff will be able to gather dogs to the buttocks and try to stop them.
I am happy to say that there was never an accident.
The event also touched upon the shocking condition of the materials which were known to be carrying the queen while working.
According to the address, Rani had acquired 12 tonnes of possession during her 44,000-mile visit to the Commonwealth in 1953.

Michelangelo of the praise of Magan Markeel as "Anektavul" is an Instagram registration of Obama .
In his Instagram address on Thursday, Sasex was very much appreciated by His Highness the Crown Prince as a thinker for breaking down superstitions and for that he is doing good to the world.
Earlier this week, the Crown Prince and Prince Harry, who accompanied their son and son Archie Harison Mountbatten to South Africa, met with the leaders of the Obama Trust, for a state visit.
The wife of the former President, in her reply, expressed her deep appreciation for the visionary leader who is breaking the shackles of superstitions, and for that my dear friend, whose august presence gives us a better world.
Whatever the way our Obama administration meets leaders or helps women from all over the world to get their education, he inspires many, Obama added, adding that he had also written a photo of Megan's humming with the leaders of the trust.
Megan had interviewed Obama for the British Voc, and the former 'Suits' actress was the publisher.
In their explicit speech, the former president's wife spoke of her motherhood and how she changed herself.
In his interview, Obama said, Your Majesty was the best thing to allow.
Motherhood taught me that most of the time it was my job to give them a place to discover and to allow them to grow as they want.
At that age, I dont think about who they want to come or who they are within them.
Obama, who was directly aware of the difficulty of being one of the best in the world, gave some suggestions to the Crown Prince in an interview on home care.
The pressure that you feel from yourself and others may sometimes be too high, he said.
Therefore, my biggest suggestion is that take some time and do not rush to do anything.
Before doing anything more than the mission in the first few months of the White House, I was always concerned about the good start in my daughter's school and ensuring that my friends get the opportunity.
It was like this - I think it is right and good.

In spite of complaints related to behavior also tramp hotel keeps a wine license .
Washington (AB) - The Washington Madhuban Control Board rejected the demand for a review of the alcohol licence due to the behaviour of local tramp international hotel owners.
On Wednesday, the organisation dismissed the complaint as most of the three ministers, two ex-officio judges and two rabbis were living in the province or having no property in the province.
The Washington Post claims that this is the second time that the complainants are demanding the cancellation of the hotel's liquor licence in accordance with the provincial law, which essentially means 'good conduct'.
Referring to the attacks charges and fraud methods, the initial report of President Donald Trump's breach of the law was made in an initial report last summer.
The licence was already granted and the same was cancelled.
The second complaint was given after the license was renewed.

A statement that the corrupt Cliveland police have been labeled the worst: The Sun
Investigators have labeled the corrupt police as the worst police force in Britain.
It is estimated in a report that the Gliveland Police is incapable of all matters.
Fil Komle, the constable of HM, says that the clueland police is considerably degraded.
There are new requests for the dissolution of the force, which has seen five chief guards in six years.
The report claims that it fails in attempts to prevent crime, arrest suspects and defend the victims.
There is a significant disruption after our previous study, said Phil Komle, a consultant researcher at H.M.
The chief watchman, Mike Weiley, left in January for a year in response to 'serious' but unsubstantiated allegations of his conduct.
Assistant Chief of Staff Adrian Roberts was dismissed after being arrested on suspicion of the worst behaviour.
Last year, deputy analyst Simon Harut appeared before a committee on misbehavior to prepare his colleagues for child marriage.
He left the army.
Pen Hoochen, Tory Mayor of Desville said: This is an official proof that the force has been dissolved.
Now the time has come for the Home Ministry to intervene.
Principal Guardian Richard Louise said, Progress has been made and I am fully responsible for the change.
Nancy Peloshi: William Bar has become a 'Pokkiri' and the arrest proceedings should be conducted without interruption.
You never know where we're going next.

They will do the work they have done while following the time they find the truth and the truth, he said.
Former Vice President Joe Biden stated this week's White House written a letter to the Ukrainian President Volodimer Celenski asking him to examine one of the 2020 candidates and the son of Biden.
In this regard, a written copy of the phone call issued by Trump to Celenski to work with Bar and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
Trump denied that he had done nothing wrong.
The CNN reported Thursday that the Justice Department's National Security Lawyers were first warned about the complaint of a secret report about the behaviour of the Ukrainian tramp a week before formally recommending them.
After receiving the complaint as a recommendation from the intelligence service officials, the Justice Department decided that there was no need to conduct a propaganda financial criminal investigation for the phone call of Trump.
When asked if Bar wanted to testify, Beloshi said the intelligence committee would decide on Friday to call for witnesses.
He added that he believes that look has become a 'traitor'.
He has been like this for a long time now.
Citing Trumps statement on his attorney general's call in July with the Ukrainian President, Feloci said, This is why he has referred to all these (Seeds).
He is keen to take decisions on how the complaint will be handled.
Felosi said he was very concerned about the sources of his secret story and spoke of them as spies on Thursday and presented them in a different way during that time.
I think the words of the President have violated sense of responsibility and it is dangerous.
He said that the Hon'ble President strongly suspects the integrity of the government, saying that it is about those who can inform a secret person.
On Tuesday, Beloshi carried out a historic act of declaring a formal dismissal inquiry into allegations that he sought to pressure a foreign leader for political gain.
The phone call had been made public on Thursday, accusing one of the misappropriation of powers of the Trump in the forthcoming 2020 elections.
The White House attorneys accused the authorities of sending a secret phone call to the cabinet officials to remove the written copy of the phone call from the computer and place it in a private system for secret information.

Kana: Coffee Manu expresses concern over the organisation of the committee for the study.
Shri Kofi Mano, a football executive and Czechoslovakia, expressed concern over the organisation of the Study Group for the upcoming Kana Football Association (GFA).
The chairman of the committee, Mr. Frank Davis, was questioned and he was not happy about his involvement.
In an interview with GNA Sports, he said that he had doubts about whether the chairman of the committee would be just because the outcome of the study process could be beneficial to him.
The Review Committee should have independent persons coming from outside without contact with any member and should be non-profit.
For example, Mr. Davids was awarded the 10 fee lawyer for writing to Mr. Osai Vagumalar.
He is a well-known Olympic supporter.
He should not be allowed to continue for these two reasons, he argued.
Shri Manu said that if he appeared before the Olympic Director, Mr. Fred Bobo, he would have a conflict of choice because of his association with the club, and suggested that there would be discrimination and discrimination if Mr.

Rupa Gurunath has been elected president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association and the son of former DMK minister Ponmudi has also attempted that post.
Various reforms are being undertaken on the recommendation of the Lodha Committee in the Indian Cricket Board and State Cricket Associations.
The recommendations of the Lodha Committee are that one of the cricket associations cannot continue to hold office more than two times and those above 70 years of age are not allowed to come to office.
Accordingly, those already in power in the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association could not continue to come to power.
There was an environment to choose new ones.
Digha, the son of former minister Ponmudi, Ashok Sikamani, moved to take over the post of president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, but is said to have been beaten by India Cements Srinivasan.
So Ashok Sikamani did not accept the post of vice president in any other way.
He is the youngest son of Ponnu, who runs a child health hospital in KK Nagar, Chennai.
Since his school age, Ashok Sikamani has a keen interest in cricket.
At one point, he made every effort to take part in the Indian contingent.
This is the reason why India Cements Srinivasan has been elected as the non-competitive leader and executive of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.
If it had been a contest, the son Ashok Sikamani Srinivasan would have given a duet to his daughter Rupa to get the post of president.
May Ashok Sikamani be the vice president of the Tamilnadu Cricket Association. After the peace talks were made on Srinivasan's side, he is said to be peaceful.
A case has been filed for handing over the Tamil inscriptions from the Mysore Sculpture Department to the Archaeological Department of Tamilnadu.
The Central Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has directed the High Court of Madurai, Chennai to reply on Wednesday about the steps being taken by the Central Department to conserve and revive the monuments and the steps taken from 27 inscriptions in Tamil Nadu.
Mani Maran, of Madurai, filed the petition: The State is located in Mysuru under the control of Archaeological Survey of India.
There, ancient inscriptions and historical values of India are being preserved.
The fossil records contained in the Tamil inscriptions are a source of scientific confirmation of the history of Tamils.
Further, the inscriptions of Tamil Nadu have been documented.
However, when the inscription office in Mysuru was shifted from the old building to the new building, most of the remains of the old Tamil inscriptions were damaged.
The e-books should be duly preserved and documented in the form of e-books.
But the documents related to Tamilnadu that had been stamped in Mysore were not properly preserved.
Thus, the history and heritage of Tamils is unknown to the generations to come.
Therefore, Mysore has asked to issue orders to hand over the Tamil edicts to the Archaeological Survey of India of Tamil Nadu.
On Wednesday, Visa came on a sitting of Sivagnanam and R. Tharani.
On 22nd October, 2019, the Judges gave an order to the Central Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to reply to a question on the steps taken by the Central Department for the conservation of monuments and heritage monuments obtained from the inscriptions of Tamilnadu.
An appeal for a competition against Australia
Justin D'Purich says, "It's time to show strength in the fight against the Australian team that can determine the fate of the Wells team in the World Cup."
The anti-Australian victory will ensure the possibility of a collision with France or Argentina by making them the most likely line to win the T-Section.
But if the Australian team wins the Wells team for the 14th time in their last 15 meetings, it will push Tippery and the contingent into a confrontation with the UK team for the last eight seats.
There is nothing to hide in this, both the teams will win and try to win the first place in the division, said Dipurich, member of the Wells team.
In the past, some decisions were difficult, but in the last fall a victory against them (Australia) was sweet.
I think they are serious about winning us again but we want to ensure another victory.
We know that this is going to be an important competition even before coming here.
Now that we have come here, it's time to show real talent.
The Wells team against Australia, New ealand or South Africa has won only one victory in the history of the World Cup - a victory that won Australians in the third position 32 years ago.
In all, 41 out of the 41 initiatives against three South Asian champions have been awarded only 7.
Wells stopped last November's defeat in the 13-test race against Australia, with the remainder of that 9-6 victory, Tritrich was one of the many who participated in the race at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
When asked if there was any psychological block before that victory, it is difficult to say that, he added.
Those competitions were very difficult, perhaps... people might think that there was a mindset, I don't know.
In the last contest, we have left almost 15 points to look at the points and it will be more difficult than it was really.
In order to win Wells, the battle of Tirichin with Australia's famous back-line twins Michael Hooper and David Foke will be crucial.
D.Purich, who has played 67 times, has fought these two men in several previous competitions and knows exactly what is going to happen.
The seven are world class men, he added.
You always know that competition is difficult when you fight with the world class backdoors.
Both of them are the best in the world in a row.
You know what kind of competition you are going to face.
One of the best players in the world to save the ball is a boxer, Michael, who has the right place at the right time, Rakpi.
You have to challenge yourself by fighting with the best of the world in comparison with the best of the world in the field of sports.
You would like to play against the best and you should be very good at playing against these two players.
I will not call Sunday's competition a final match, but this is an important competition for us in this world cup.
The team's motivation is an important part of it.
You will find it difficult to win if you continue to play well and perform well.
Due to the high level of sea water, the danger of sinking into the sea of Chennai is high.
The Inter-Governmental Commission on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that four Indian coastal cities of Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai are prone to seafarers due to rising water levels of 27 seas.
A study on climate change by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) of the Government of India has been published by the Bureau of Investigation (CBIC).
By the end of this century, seawater will rapidly melt and increase rapidly.
It is very likely to intensify into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm over Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai.
At the same time, many parts of northern India will face severe water shortages.
The sea level is rising faster than ever before.
This will affect the global population of 1.4 billion by 2100.
At Indian level, there are not only 4 coastal cities but also 45 port cities around the world with a sea level of 50 cm and there is a risk of flooding.
With the increase in the risk situation every year, the low-lying coastal rivers and small islands are in dire straits.
If there is no urgent action to reduce global warming, the temperature of the sea will rise and the loss of marine life.
There will be global shortages of sea foods.
It is very likely to cause storm surges.
The temperature of the sea has doubled from 1982 to 2016.
This has been indicated in the Survey.
Astenders Spilleres: Ben kisses Calamity after Vitney's shock.
The tensions between Calam Hayway (Tony Glue) and Ben Mitzsel are going to explode once again in Easters, as the shocks given by Vitni Dean (Shona McCarthy) throw away the doll and reconnect to his lover.
But will both of them be concerned about the relationship or the angry situation?
Calam had helped save Ben's life and offered to help Baby Beal, and he and Ben were associated with the idea of going to the dating, although they had slowly dealt with things, Calam recently told Ben that it was sweet enough to see his weak and soft side.
Today, Vitni is returning from a better state of mind than when he left.
It is clear to him that he had left Vefort after knowing that his marriage and the man who came to be his husband had deceived him.
When he comes home, his mind connects with Kallam.
But soon, a fact that he reveals disrupts the infallible heart.
Since the call is getting worse, J.M. Barthwick is worried over the fact that he started drinking again in the Queen's Victor.
Having been drunk and emotional, Calamum goes to Ben and fights against him for everything he has ever done.
Calamine's frustration becomes an uncontrollable sentiment, because Ben is calm, accepts Calamum's anger, and kissed him long before.
But after that, what will they look at?
The couple will try to go to dating next week, but Ben's sharp thinking of his earlier relationship threatens to malign everything he wants to do.
But after proving the same to his homophobic father, Calame, who has gained a new self-confidence, is determined to fight for one's own accord.
The kiss is to be shown in the BBC on-line Easter series at 8.30 pm on September 27.
There is complete panic in the situation of the White House because of the difficulties in finding out the reasons for holding the post .
On Thursday, White House officials were staggering to decide how to respond to the renewed drive of the Democrats to the holding of office, one who was aware of the situation that 'all panic' had been taking place over the past week as there was no solution to the new problem.
A person close to the White House said that the allegations of secrecy could adversely affect the President and the people around him, and it seemed like an increase in the 'crime, indignation and anxiety' of the West.
There is an incredible situation where there is nothing, said the person.
Since there are White House officials who are not sure what to do, not because there is no open plan for the situation, but because the usual methods used by the President in the past to avoid controversies, do not appear to be a thing of extinction as soon as the next news arrives, he added.
Another person, who is aware of these suggestions, said that the White House is deeply shocked and, if the hearing goes on, the President said that the opportunity to go back to the irreversible situation is increasing.
While the President is expected to intensify his pressure on the President in the course of his assumption of office, another person expressed the same concern as he was expecting some people around him.
It provokes concern that the behavior of Trotsky could become more unimaginable and potentially counterattacks - in both presidential and political spheres - in the election year.
Faced with the unprecedented threat to his presidency, Robert Muller's revival of the strategic strategy he saw during the Russian investigation has shifted from the Trump offensive style to defense.
While noting the actions of the Democrats and presidential candidate Joe Biden, he sought to lose significance of his demand to help the Ukrainian president investigate his political opponents through a breach of trust in the one-sided person.
But while many in the White House have experienced the experience of Muller Intelligence, assistants and consultants have said that this time has begun to feel differently.
One of those who knew about the situation was that a press conference on Wednesday had created a failed impression when the name of the President was considered a strong one.
Delighted by the question of Russian intelligence, Trump said he was not in a mood to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the chancellor's partners believe that they are not aware of the fact that they are not directly aware of the controversial phone call between the secret publisher Trump and Ukrainian President Volodimer Sélenski - which will reduce his credibility.
Moreover, the fact that the president has been under siege, as often as happens, inspires the believers to defend him.
But a mercenary close to the White House, he said that the president's basic authorization points were already high, and new people's approval would not be easy to take office.
In the next four months, there is no point in paying attention to the assumption of charge of the post of President, especially if it breaks down its proceedings and makes its headlines.
On the other hand, those advocating the dismissal of the chancellor could not fully understand how his answer would be.
Worried White House officials are looking for consultants to help in countering the occupation.
As the efforts are still in the initial stage, the person described the plans as to whether a war room attempt would benefit or in what form it would be.
The man said it was clear that there was a general opposition to the public's support for the publication of a report by the author of the secret, and the release of the statement that there was a need for integrated legal and information strategies in response to the momentum of the Democratic Party's drive to seize office.
According to one of the sources, Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo and Finance Minister Steve Nuchin, who are not going to release a memo explaining Trump's call with the President of Ukraine, said that the situation felt that there was no other way except to release the document after 48 hours and that the long-term vision strategy was plain.
Robert Muller, who spoke only through his accusations, is expected to be more pressure now than at the time when the trial took place - a person who is expected to be involved in creating an answer to the dismissal - said Trotsky, former propaganda manager, and Gore Leventsky.
Levantowski told the NPC News that it was not true that he thought he was leading such an effort.
I have done everything I can to support the President and his plan for the last five years but I have not made any suggestions with the President on joining a team to oppose the fraudulent withdrawal.
J. Sekhlo, an external lawyer by Trotsky from the Muller investigation, is also unconnected in his efforts to seize office.
When contacted by NPC News about his comments, Czechoslov said, We will deal with real time issues.
As Emmett Flott, who had worked during Clinton's dismissal, who guided the Muller trial until the end of the trial, had no such experience with the current White House counsel, the lawyer who has had experience in the dismissal trial is no longer in the White House.
A familiar figure on the strategy of the White House said that there was no official nearer to the integration of all or even the setting up of war rooms - but agreed that a unified, unified answer would be needed and one who can carry forward the political struggle.

The other restaurants onboard will include Saps Grill, American Stickhouses, Polaros Latin Bar, Scanner Bar and Johnny Rockets Express.
The vessel is scheduled to depart from Rome in May 2020, with a planned embarkation of seven nights and nine nights.

Dave News accuses the Democrats of hearing 'Trum's nude films.'
It is obvious that the trial of President Donald Trump could not be carried out by the Parliamentarian Dave News (R-Caliph).
He accused the Democrats of seeking the president's naked pictures to protect him on Thursday.
The chairman of the Parliamentary Intelligence Committee, Nuns, accused the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son of making a preliminary statement on allegations that Trump had sought Ukrainian aid to assist in the investigation.
Stating that the Democrats wanted to see the naked pictures of the president, he was a member of the American Parliament, who described Ukraine as a "shameful image" created by the left and their "media assets".
The Democrats in this group had discussions with those who thought they were from Ukraine to get the naked pictures of Trump, said Nuns.
People can justly ask why they are determined to sack the President even if they have an opportunity in just one year.
After News concluded his speech, the Huffpost senior political reporter Jennifer Bendry decided to find out if the Democratic politicians wanted to know the matter in depth.
So far, only the Connected Representative Jim Hyms (D) has responded, but we suspect many of his colleagues will believe his word is true.
News: Mediaite.com suspects that the comments on the cover-up refers to the 'detente and unverified excess data' found in controversial steel documents.
It is a collection of allegations against Trombay compiled by former British spy Christopher Steel, in which he claims that there is a possibility of 'snoring' by sex workers at a hotel room in Moscow.
There has been a stir in the wake of the change in the statement made by Udith Surya, a student who has been arrested for his alleged fraud in the NEET examination by Rajendran, Chief Minister of Theni Medical College, CBCID, to the police.
Venkateshan from Tandayarpet, Chennai.
He is a doctor at Stanley Hospital in Chennai.
His son, Udit Surya, filed a complaint that he had cheated on the NEET exam.
The police arrested Uddh Surya and his father Dr. Venkateshan in the interrogation.
In the interrogation, Udhi's father Venkateshan paid Rs 20 lakhs to a student and cheated and admitted his son to medical college.
After this, Udit Surya and his father were arrested in court and imprisoned.
The CBCID police had earlier questioned the Chief Minister of the Honey Government Medical College, Rajendran about the NEET exam.
There is a difference between his explanation and the statement made by Udit Surya to the CBCID police.
Rajendran, Chief Minister of Theni Medical College said that he was a part of the Hollywood industry during his student admission.
It is said that the admission was done on the basis of that.
It was stated by the College Chief Minister that all those who wrote NEET took part in the counselling and admission in the course of the college.
However, he said that he was directly involved in counselling and student admission in the vote given by Udit Surya.
How did he get into a Hollywood ticket with a photo of a man who has done his job?
Why failed to pay attention to counselling and student admission?
The questions arose.
During the course of the course of the course, it is now known that Uddh Surya, who is a student, is providing a list of self-declaration along with his photograph at the Medical College, is now available.
The photo in it and the photo in the hall ticket are different.
The statement given by the student Ustad Suryah and the statement made by the Chief Minister of the state medical college Rajendran to the CBCID authorities is very different.
The CBCID police have therefore started investigations with top officials.
Only after the results are released will the repairs be removed.
You know who's in touch with.
He said he would appear before the implementation department tomorrow in the case of co-operative bank abuse and urged him not to bow down to the central government.
25,000 crore has been lost to the Government exchequer due to abuses at the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank in the past year 2007.
The loss is reported to have been caused due to diversion of loans to sugar mills and molasses plants over and above the norms.
Last month, according to the Bombay High Court's order on the abuses, the Mumbai police had filed a case against senior Nationalist Congress Party chief, former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and 70 others.
This includes political leaders, former executives and officials of the cooperative bank.
In a sudden turn, the prosecution has been based on the case filed by the police on the basis of the prosecution of Ajith and the Nationalist Congress Party leader Sarath Pawar.
He was a former Chief Minister of Marathi and also a minister in the Congress-led government at the centre.
This has created a stir in the implementation of the election to the Maratha Legislative Assembly on October 21, 2019.
In this situation, NCP leader Sarath Pawar in Mumbai spoke to the press.
I am grateful to the implementation department for joining me in this case even if I am not a member of the concerned cooperative bank or the place where I decide.
I don't have to be surprised at this move.
I am mostly outside Mumbai for the legislative election campaign.
So the implementation department should not misunderstand me.
I will go to the Implementation Office on Friday (morrow).
And I will give them the information they want.
It is their right to inquire about the case.
I believe in the Constitution.
I will therefore extend full cooperation to the investigation.
The Marathi film follows the philosophy of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
We don't know how to bow down before the Delhi Accord.
The chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, has denied the allegation of political involvement in the matter.
In this context, he said:
The High Court had directed the police to file a case in this case and if there is a fraud of up to Rs 100 crore, the case will be investigated by the enforcement department.
In this regard, the enforcement department has taken up the case.
It is wrong to say that this action has been taken for political reasons.
Research on renewable potential biofuels can help reduce emissions.
As electric cars and Desla semi-trolleys have been listed as headlines in recent years, it seems that renewable energy is flying without coming under limits:
But a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that can lead to the use of renewable biofuel as air fuel.
Dr. David Fresler, professor of agriculture, life and environmental science at the University of Alberta, began the project in 2003.
His research lab develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipids such as edible oils, animal residues and canola oil.
This technology will be able to use low-cost oil in the form of ethanol and other bio-fuels, which will reduce carbon emissions of about 85 percent more than the emission of petrol based fuels and also allow other industries to utilize the same during this process.
This technology is used to replace hydrocarbons in petroleum-based fuels.
Our technology has been done in the first generation and it produces the same hydrocarbons which are the molecules of Diesel., he said.
As it provides a new dimension to the use of biofuels, the former biofuel technologies lose stability in low temperatures, causing a serious problem to the flying at high altitudes.
The problem of air-to-air refuelling is similar to the question of heat-22, he said.
In fact, its value is less than that of diesel, but its demand is high.
Fresler's laboratory is now focusing on two choices to produce air biofuels.
Their Hydrocarbon Biofuels in the 1st South are yet another promising, low-risk approach to induct hydrogen.
The second choice is to continue the work in the pedagogy, which has already been partially developed, to stabilise the fuel even at lower temperatures.
"We will be able to play some games with the chemicals in our reactors to try a little bit to change skills," said the Brasler on the second selection.
It's too dangerous.
Since both airlines and Canada and the US military are making more investments for innovative selection, the University of Alberta's subsidiary company, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working to make it commercially.
He said, "In the future, someone expects to impose a carbon tax on them.
In that situation, they are looking for an alternative.
Forge is currently operating a laboratory near Edmund's Waste Management Centre and recently received a US $US4 million investment from Lockheed Martin to assist in the construction of a $25 million plant at Sombra in Antonio.
The plant is expected to produce 19 million litres of biofuels every year.
While it is estimated that carbon emissions will be reduced by 85 percent, the reasons for carbon emissions are such as fuel transport and how it is produced.
"As a technology driven person", the Prime Minister said.
A variety of opportunities are also being created for selection and selection as a means to make informed decisions, he added.
The High Court yesterday decided to review the basic rights petition filed by Segu Shehfdeen Mohammed Shaby, a paediatric doctor of the Gurukul Bodhana Hospital.
The petition is due to be taken by the High Court on January 24.
It is noteworthy that the doctor, Shapi, has filed a basic human rights petition in protest of his arrest by the criminal wing under various charges, including illegal abortion surgery and illicit financial mobilization.
In response to the prime minister's request for peace, the coalitions of Boris Johnson warned that Britain could face riots such as Los Angeles, if the brakes were withdrawn.
Last night, a senior Cabinet Minister said that there is a danger of a tremendous and peoples uprising in the country due to the change in the 2nd poll.
The prime minister's senior coalition parties warned that the UK was facing domestic unrest as much as the yellow-horned protests in France over economic inequalities and the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Shri Johnson said, in the political language, anger should be lessened on this issue of anger, but I will not stop using the word surrender.
Though he made a request for peace, a Cabinet Minister told the Times: "We have not seen in this country such as the Giltz Jones [Manjal Shat] struggle or the Los Angeles Riot [in 1992].
People dont think that this is possible in this country because this has not happened before.
Now they have modern phones to coordinate the yellow coating as a model, and only two popular leaders are needed to motivate the people.
The riots broke out in Los Angeles in 1992, following the court's release of four white police officers in a case involving black auto driver Rodney King.
Earlier this year, the French revolutionaries in Paris over six weeks of devastation and destruction on the streets of Paris against the well-known yellow robed government of Gilet Jones.
Mr Johnson warned in the House that if Britain fails to withdraw from the European Union, the loss of confidence in our political system would be of great consequence.
The Minister said, If 66 percent of us say that 30 million people have joined the vote, 10 million people are still unsatisfactory.
While 99 percent of them ignored, another 100,000 were really angry, who wrote to their parliamentarians and blocked it.
There is no need for that, and soon thousands of people will be in the streets.
A senior Cabinet Minister further said that there is a danger of rapid and people-to-people uprising in the country due to the change in the second ballot.
Shri Johnson has called for a general election to resolve the Frequency issue.
He is reportedly confronted with a revolt of ministers seeking a compromise with the European Union in return for reducing his Frequency's demands.
His brother, who murdered Pakistan's social media fame, was sentenced to life imprisonment.
Women rights experts say that most of the cases are not strictly enforced, and sometimes the procedures are framed, where the accused killers are released on bail and the cases are being investigated.
Farsan Berry, a female freedom fighter and the first gender research institute in Pakistan at a university, said, "It took three years to find a solution even in the most important Baloch case.
While rights groups claim it is difficult to establish reliable data, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has faced at least 300 cases of holocaust in 2018.
Many advocates say that the real figure will be high, with one fifth of the world's 5,000 honor killings every year taking place in Pakistan based on the honorable violence awareness network.
Sustainable monsoons have caused floods and chaos in many parts of India.
The monsoon season in India has increased by almost a month. This unprecedented rains have resulted in loss of lives due to collapse of buildings and many crops have started to rot.
Rainfall in North India generally starts in the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month is 37 higher than normal.
India Meteorological Department (IMD) has stated that if the same trend continues in the remaining days, it is likely that the rainfall is likely to continue in the last few decades.
In many parts of the country, unprecedented rains are still continuing and the city of Pune, a city in the western part of India, where incessant rains on Wednesday and Thursdays have caused many casualties and buildings to collapse.
As a result, people walked along the streets with floods, usually walking on the edges of monsoons.
Rainfall at many places with heavy falls at isolated places very likely over Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad.
The houses in the northern state of Uttarakhand have suffered heavy losses due to continuous rains.
The monsoon has started late.
There was a water shortage in many places and the farmers were prepared to look for drought.
Thus, the farmers do not want the monsoon to continue.
During this period of the year, it is not normal to receive such rains.
It pollutes my vegetables, beans, peas and tomatoes, said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer from Bhimtal in the state of Uttarakhand.
Lately, the ongoing monsoon has resulted in price rise for consumers and the price rise of essential commodities in Indian food has increased.
Onion is sold at Rs 20 per kilogram (23 pounds) for 80 rupees (about 1) in cities like Delhi and Mumbai.
The festivities are also in danger.
The next big festival, Dussehra, is due on October 8, when the Hindus will install the horrors of Ravana, the hero of the Ramayana, who laughs cruelly with great moustaches.
Burning the Ravana symbolizes the victory of good over evil.
However, these atrocities are being committed on paper and if the monsoon continues, the night can be won by the end.
If a government hospital will be used for various facilities such as bus stops, free parking, public spaces and public meetings of political parties, how will the situation be?
This is the condition of Uthankarai Government Hospital in Krishnagiri district.
This is an important government hospital where 1000 to 1200 patients get treatment on a daily basis.
There should not be much noise around the hospital and many guidelines should be followed in hospitals where there is a need to ensure that there is no dirtiness.
It is unfortunate that the surrounding people do not follow any such thing and the hospital is suffering from the pain of Uthankar.
Public and private buses are stopped at the entrance of the hospital.
Even though the bus stop is near the hospital, the entrance is closed in front of the gate.
The noise of these lips becomes a noise.
The bus driver's google sound for the deficit.
Private ambulances have also been sheltered at the entrance to the government hospital.
This leads to congestion at any point of time in the hospital.
R.P. Udayakumar, Minister of Revenue and Disaster Management said that Tamil Nadu is in a state of readiness to face the Northeast monsoon.
R.P. Udayakumar, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, who was present at the function in Tiruchirapalli, spoke to the media.
Southwest Monsoon is being observed in other states except Tamil Nadu.
It is very likely to increase gradually during next 3 months.
It is very likely to intensify further into a Severe Cyclonic Storm during next 12 hours.
Tamil Nadu is in a state of readiness to face the Northeast monsoon in the coming year in view of the cyclonic storms that have affected the past.
The total number of confirmed cases is now 4,393.
Out of this, 5 feet water stressed areas have been put on the most dangerous list.
12 coastal districts of the State are likely to be affected.
In these districts, 121 special centres have been set up to ensure safety of citizens.
In addition, marriage halls, schools and community halls are to be kept in readiness in other districts.
148 crore has been earmarked for the rescue work.
State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) is also on standby in these districts.
It is due to the Tamil Nadu government's pre-emptive action that not a single fisherman died during the Gaja cyclone.
On the contrary, the wall collapsed and lightning struck down.
Adequate precautions have been taken to prevent such deaths this year.
Relief and rehabilitation and reconstruction work is in progress to ensure that relief is not confined to the rescue operations.
In the districts of Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Nagapattinam and Thiruvarur affected by cyclone Gaja, 1.10 lakh people lost their homes and construction of houses has also been done.
This was stated by Shri Uday Kumar.
The Murugan temple pond is full of heavy rain for some days at Titrani.
There is a Saravana falsifying pond on the hill steps to go to the Tirutrani Murugan hill temple.
On this kull, devotees go through the hills and worship the master after taking a holy dip.
Apart from this, a three-day festival of Deepavali is also being held in this festival every year.
During last month's Adarikudi festival, water was brought from the temple management, volunteers and devotees through tractor as there was no water in the trikull.
Then, the festival of Tepeth took place.
In the meantime, due to heavy rains in the city of Tiruchirapalli over the past few days, the entire pond is flooded with water and now surplus water is released.
Four years later, the Thirukkural is now full.
District Collector P Ponnaiya has said that farmers can benefit more by selecting the fastest growing Thalpia fish.
In a press release, he said:
Farmers who cultivate fish in the fields will be able to get more profit by growing faster than other fish if they choose the genetic improvement of the thaliphia fish.
Thalpia fish can be grown in large quantities in less area than other fishes.
They are highly resistant and can grow faster than other fishes.
Moreover, the more the consumer likes, the more this kind of fish.
Hence, farmers are requested to optimize the genetic merit of the fish by selecting them in their paddy fields.
The government is ready to sell the Tilapia fishing cages near Krishnagiri dam throughout the year.
Farmers can take advantage of this by buying and selling it.
Farmers who cultivate these fishes should set up a safety fence around their fish farm, so that they do not spread to the nearby water bodies.
In Kancheepuram district, fish farming should be registered at the Fisheries Development Camp and only then fish should be grown in their fields.
For further details, Directorate of Fisheries (DoF) can also contact the East Coast Guard Road, Nilangir, Kancheepuram District on the phone number 044-24492719.
A tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed to conduct DNA testing of the human bones at the bottom.
The Department of Archaeology, Madurai Kamaraj University and Harvard Medical School have signed a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to conduct DNA testing of ancient human bones excavated from its lower, Kondhai and Adichalur sites in Tamil Nadu.
Principal Secretary and Commissioner, Archaeological Survey of India, Dr.
A tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will be signed between the Archaeological Survey of Madurai, Kamaraj University of Madurai and the David Research Laboratory of Harvard School.
We believe that in our future discoveries, we will find more ancient human bones in the thicket, lower and Adichalur.
These samples will be sent for DNA testing.
This is a major demonstration of what kind of gene was found in the human bones dug in Tamil Nadu.
Increasing risk of heart disease and paralysis can be attributed to the presence of pesticides.
A new study has revealed that working with excessive pesticides can become a cause of heart disease later on.
This was the case in the group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii, which has been pursued for more than three decades.
The researchers observed that as compared to individuals who did not work with pesticides, the high risk of heart disease or paralysis was 45 per cent more.
The study emphasizes the importance of the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the period of insect pests and the importance of documenting the use of insecticides in medical records and controlling the risk factors of normal heart disease, said Dr Beatrice Rothricks, deputy researcher of the study.
He is an old-age medical professor at Hawaii University in Manova.
These findings have come from the data received from more than 6,000 people in Ohu, who participated in the Quaqueni Honolulu heart event.
Researchers found that these findings do not apply to women and other people as only men from Japanese origin participated.
Insecticides have a long half-life, and many years later, they may have their effects on health.
The maximum number of cases were reported within a period of 10 years.
"After 34 years of pursuit, there was no connection between heart disease and paralysis in the work, said Rodrix in a news release.
The importance of other age-related factors can also be gauged from the fact that there is a possibility of any possible link between the pest and the later heart disease.
The researchers found that there was no significant link between at least the mild to moderate insects and between heart disease or paralysis.
Gelenski-Trump phone call: Poroshenko's remarks.
This week Washington became increasingly politically tense after US President Donald Trump began his crackdown.
Less political experience, Volodimer Selenski would have wanted to avoid being dragged into a political fraud.
But what we have so far known about the Sélensky-Trump connection is that it has had a long-term impact on Sélenski?
According to Trump, the US is doing much more to Ukraine than any other European countries at the beginning of the phone call.
While the White House phone call has no word for word, the German president and other European leaders have simply spoken out of firm proposals - suggesting that German leader Angela Merkel is drumming up.
Sélenski's response, which claims to be 100 percent rather than 100 percent, is considered a problem.
Sélenski added that French President Macron and Merkel did not work enough to help Ukraine.
The conversation has made politicians, particularly the opposition parties inside Ukraine, comment on the social media.
The former Ukraine president, Petro Poshenko, in a tweet, said the EU's assistance is 'not so far'.
Poreshenko said he was grateful to the EU for its assistance, including sanctions and economic assistance, during the Russian invasion in other tweets.
Others expressed concern when Ukraine politician Victoria Vossika said, How can we talk to Germany and France again?
Trump, who is indirectly referring to military assistance, not only to the son of Joe Biden, but also to the TNC Server hecked, is seeking to investigate two things with Selenski, which indicates Ukraine's involvement in hacking Republicans' emails during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether this will hinder relations with Europe or break relations with the French and German chancellors.
I don't want to mistreat anyone...
Following the telephone call, Sellesski said at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, "We thank all those who help us.
Selenski will meet Russian, German and French leaders at the four Normandi meeting in October.
A black hole that was quiet, suddenly squirrels, and the stars that pass by were embittered.
If such a black hole turns into a luminous atom, it is called 'Kuvasar.'
Scientists have seen the light of six such kuvasars in the US's Palmer far-sightedness.
The scientists were surprised to know that it had happened within six months that it had to last for thousands of years.
In order to grow a lot of trees, they include carbon dioxide in the air and oxygen in the air.
But the 'bio reactor' device, 'Eos,' developed by the 'Hypergent Industries,' incorporates a multi-fold carbon-di-oxide that contains 1 acre of carbon-di-oxide.
The ios bio-reactor, similar to the refrigeration of a chlorella volgarris, has the potential to absorb carbon-dioxide.

Recently, there has been a ban on the use of harmful chemicals in e-cigarettes.
People do not have much awareness about this.
The youth should stay away from e-cigarettes.
E-cigarettes have created a misconception that there is no danger.
Warming of nicotine based liquids in e-cigarettes creates a kind of chemical smoke, not just ordinary cigarettes, but also harmful to health.

Caribbean Islands are located in the US region.
Some of these islands are surrounded by the Caribbean Sea.
Some islands are surrounded by the Caribbean Sea on one side and the North Atlantic on the other.
The islands are located in the southeast Gulf of Mexico, in the east of the United States and in the south of the United States.
This includes about 700 islands.
This is the island nearest to the US, but still remains economically backward.
The islands have a substantial population of Indian origin.
It is in this situation that India has extended this financial assistance to the Caribbean.
FEMA to be appointed as Chairperson: White House.
In the United States, on 3rd April, 2019, in the Capital Hill of Washington, the Senate Finance and Homeland Security Subcommittee on the FEMA 2020 budget request, Peter Keiner, Executive Officer (FEMA) is in charge of the Central Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
In a statement, the White House said that US President Donald Trump appointed Peter Cainner, President of the Washington (Reters) - Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Thursday.
Keyner, FEMA Deputy Executive, is the head of the agency who oversees the government's actions in disaster situations such as cyclones and forest fires.
Since the departure of Franck Lang from office in March, the organization has been without an executive authorized by the Senate.
Lang resigned after the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for FEMA, decided to abuse government vehicles to visit Washington and his home in North Carolina.
He withdrew from the competition earlier this month, after another appointment for the mission, Jeffrey Pearl, was accused of involvement in a fight at the bar during his background check.
The appointment of the Keyner to the post was expected.
When he starts working, his appointment will be approved by the majority Senate.
Before becoming the Deputy Executive Officer of FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he was a Naval Contingent in Emergency Management at Cainer Road Island.
Union Minister Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that he has not been able to speak to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka several times on the issue of Cauvery.
The 34th Convocation of V.I.D. University was held at Katpadi, Vellore yesterday.
Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari was the Chief Guest.
Speaking on the occasion, Shri Gadkari said that the wind and solar power plants in Tuticorin are in progress and projects for drinking water of seas are in progress.
We are also in the process of developing low-cost wind power from the ports of Tuticorin, Villa and Paradip.
If this scheme is implemented then one unit of electricity can be produced at a cost of Rs.2.50.
We have planned and executed a project worth Rs 6000 crore to stop 3000 TMC of water from Godavari in Andhra Pradesh.
But he spoke to Tamilnadu and Karnataka several times to implement water conservation projects but there was no benefit.
There will be no water problem between Tamilnadu and Karnataka if the Cauvery water is wasted.
Negotiations have so far made no progress on the Cauvery issue.
Shri Gadkari said this.
Shri Gadkari was also present at the foundation stone laying ceremony of Coir Committees in 13 States organized by the Coir Board.
When Gadkari left, the BJP shouted 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' as usual.
The supporters of DMK MP and Kadir Anand from Vellore announced that Periyar's blessings were on the spot.
Having noticed this, he left the place with a jerk.
Police have closed the illegal Marijuwana Vapi in the San Gabriel Valley - CPS Los Angeles -LRB- CBS -RRB- .
L . Mande -LRB- CPSL -RRB- - Police on Thursday closed an illegal marriage of Marjiwana in the San Gabriel Valley .
The police arrested in connection with the arrest of the suspect in the sale of illegal veneer  Web Pena at around 4:37 p.m. at 9600 p.m.
L.T. Christopher Cano of L. Mande police said that the authorities were also found to have a device which used to adapt to Web Cartridges.
Keno said, This is a very dangerous process.
Kano, who worked in the narcotics sector, said that the fire is likely to be consumed by the oil spill process for use in the weeds.
He said, as it is being enriched, the extraordinary power generated in our clothes makes it a firepower and an explosive phenomenon.
If there are many jadis and similar materials, then the stairwell may be torn to pieces, without an ordinary fire accident.
A group of Hasmats was called to the empty office to capture the illegal and dangerous object.
The value of the seized goods and equipment is not known immediately.
The detectives also said that they had found illegal activities when they were under arrest.
Investigators are still seeking to find out who is behind the illegal spying operation.
They said they believed that because the place was empty, the person responsible for it might have set up the office there.
In the course of the trial, they wanted to ensure that illegal neem coatings were not available to everyone, especially following recent reports on neeming.
This is really what they want and they dont even know if they get what they want, said Keno.
It can be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This is very bad for our society and children and we always warn them to stay away from such activities.
It will be displayed in the court hall of the court of the 1st Elizabeth of the dilapidated clothing Hampton .
It was made up of a fine symblet, woven with beaten silver pieces, and Embroidery in a perfect bungalow full of trees, animals and butterflies.
It is the only one that claims to Eleri Lincoln, who is responsible for the clothing collection in the historic royal family palaces.
A small village hanging on the wall of the Paris church, which was kept 100 years ago, could only be a garment that was lost from the first elisabet garment.
Alisab's lost garment is to be displayed next month at the Hampton court complex, next month, near the same room where the teacher Rani could wear it 450 years ago, after three years of the accident, when she saw Alder's costume in a church in Heirfordshire.
The importance of discovery is that in the entire architecture there is still one garment in the 16th century .
Three years of research has strengthened the opinion of experts that the garment would have been a part of the royal family's garment, even though there were no evidence that it was once worn by Elishabet Rani.
The value of the fabric made of silver is highly exquisite, provided by law to the highest number of members of the royal family, and high quality of embroidered plants and flowers, high quality of deer and dogs, butterflies and fishes and a bear show the highest status of the previous owner.
At the time of its formation, the Council may have the same value as that of a teacher.
Moreover, in the late 1950s, in the late 1950s, when other women in the government were competing with him, his opponents would not accept such a decent dress.
It is a big thing, so many critics came and saw it.
When they saw it, they were surprised to know that while leaving, they saw that it was only one of the royal family's clothes and it was always satisfying to visit it.
With a second long life in the garment basket, the altar of the dark-blooded St. Feith Church in Baxton could not have been rebuilt without any expectation.
Bactton was one of the most respected women who served in the long life of Elizabeth Rani and had her own village of Planch Berry, and the local stories have long been associated with the Textiles Department.
Although the garment belonged to the post-death period in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth might have given it to the Paris family or in memory of the island before she died in 1603.
After more than 1000 hours of preservation, more than 400 of them are specially decorated silk woven silk fabric and exquisite handmade jewellery. The next exhibition is the most famous of the Elysabs contemporary paintings by Reinbo Portriet, which shows that she is wearing one of these Councils, which provided a Hotfield House loan during the exhibition.
When you work with the traditional attires, there is a real respect for those who created them, said Libi Damson, who heads the security, said, Most of its security took place in the Pashu Tribals in the Hampton Court Grounds - the only place to place some of the priceless terraces of the palace.
On seeing the Embroidery in the past and the background, I had a great respect for those who had created it.
I have never worked in such a wealthy garment.
Elizabeth's lost garment is to be displayed at the Hampton court palace on October 12.
The incident took place at Theni Medical College, Udith Surya, after completing the NEET examination.
He has been arrested along with the family by CBIC.
The identification of students in all medical colleges has been intensified.
It was in this situation that an old photo and current image of Jyotika, a student of PSG Medical College, Coimbatore and Siva Ramachandran, appeared to be different.
An inquiry was conducted by the Department of Medical College.
Narayan Babu, director of Medical College, Chennai, told the press today:
On 23rd, we received a complaint that the pictures of the students were a bit strange.
We then formed a five-member inquiry committee.
We interrogated two students and their parents.
We compared our documents with their certificates, NEET exam hall ticket, identity card etc.
At the end of the study, it is certain that both the students are not bogus.
Even though there is a slight difference in the photographs, this kind of problem arises.
The Health Minister has, therefore, ordered the introduction of the biometric practice in the admission process from next year.
Biometric and Graph registration will be implemented in the coming days.
The details of the students concerned are open only if they register at the time of application, examination and student admission.
So no one can cheat on this.
The students, Siva Ramachandran and Jyotika, who were involved in the investigation, spoke to the press.
Jyotika said, 'I was in the image of a double coat in my photo.
It was a photo taken during school time.
Now I've changed my hair.
So, it's not like that now.
So, they brought me to the conclusion.
Now it's the problem of cutting the hair and there's nothing else.
Ramchandran said that the image that exists today is also different from the old image.
I had only one photo at that time.
It's an old photo.
So there was confusion and interrogation.
The Pondi Plastic Association requested PM Modi to save lives of lakhs of workers.
The Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
In India, plastic waste is being collected and recycled in the streets and in garbage dumps.
At present, plastics in some of the States across India are being recycled.
Due to poverty and unemployment, 60 to 70 of plastic waste is already being recycled in India.
Rest of the waste can also be used in a useful manner.
Plastic Tur Road 2. Manufacturing of Power 3. Manufacturing of Petrol Diesel 4. Manufacturing of concrete stones 4. Use of plastic waste in various ways.
Carriage bags which are considered important for pickers are given free of cost in the name of the compulsion of the public to pack them while buying goods in the shops.
There is a sound of plastic carry bags in all the water bodies.
Since the calorie bags are thick, all other wastes in the gutter, except plastic, are discharged from the effluents.
Unfortunately, plastics only float up.
There are 40,000 plastic manufacturing units in India.
Of these, 98 are small and marginal.
Similarly, there are thousands of shops selling plastics.
There are 2,000 companies exporting plastic products.
Nearly 50 lakh people are getting employment in both manufacturing and sales.
5 lakh crore and Rs. 50,000 crore of revenue to Central and State Governments.
As far as the plastic industry is concerned, there is no environmental problem in its production or use of its products.
Unfortunately, due to lack of awareness of environmental health among the public, the problem of environment is due to lack of awareness.
Therefore, on 2nd October, the Prime Minister has requested the Task Force to ensure strict and effective implementation of plastic waste without any restriction on plastics and to ensure that thousands of small and medium entrepreneurs and workers dependent on this industry continue to make announcements in order to save lives.
This is what they said in the press.
Speaking at the All India Haj 2018 conference in Mumbai, President Abubakar said that soon after landing in Saudi Arabia, efforts will be made to connect India with the Umra Visa regime.

One of the cars was caught in the bush this morning to suspect the next gold from the agricultural land in S.N. Palayam, Vellore district.
There's no one on its side.
The mirror behind the car was broken.
There were deadly weapons and sheep in the car, such as throwing and cutting.
In this regard, the villagers informed the police about the gold.
The police rushed to the scene and rescued the car trapped in the mud.
One third of America's drug addicts is responsible for the abduction of Mexico.
The CBS News saw a meeting in the western part of Chicago for drug use in a short span of time.
Brian McNinet, DEA, highlighted the day-to-day developments.
Last year, nearly 800 people died in Chicago due to excessive drug use.
McNaide said that about 90 of the drugs in Chicago are coming from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the nemissio servatase, which is being synergized with the help of el menchitis.
Matthew Tonahok, Chief Agent of DEA, Mexico said that he was the first open priority for the DEA and the State Law Enforcement Department in the US.
The prize money for El Menchov is up to $10 million.
He has helped in identifying dozens of El Mencho Drug Laboratories in the forest.
At least one third of all of the drugs entering the United States through the sea and land are responsible for Elmencheso's abductor, Jellysco Nuessian or CJNC Awan.
According to the Justice Department, the smuggler has kidnapped Gokein, Methambetamin and Harayan, who were abducted in the Pentagon.
A $10 million prize has been announced for El Mencho's head.
30 years ago, he lived in California, where he was arrested on drug charges and eventually exiled to Mexico.
That's where he began a terrible kidnapping.
He has a large number of weapons, RPGs and 50 caliber weapons.
He is based on his own self-sustaining swath groups, he said.
From the shooting of Mexico's military helicopter to the killing of six people in the summer, El Mencho has defended his empire without punishment.
Thousands of people have died in recent years due to the violence by abductors.
According to the Mexico government figures, there are about 94 murder cases per day.
Mexico's drugs captured in Chicago are highly toxic and can't be handled without a protective shield.
In the lab, the trademarks are being made in the cocaine boxes.
More than one third of the stamps of L-Manchso are available.
"He is the reason why he is actually sending the poison that kills innocent women and children," says Donahok.
Hence, there is a lot of potential for getting the medicines from the organization of El Mencho in case of death of a child.
More than 67,000 Americans died last year due to drug abuse.
Union Minister Dr Jitendra Singh has said that those who are not proud of calling Prime Minister Modi the Father of India should not call themselves Indians.
Everyone knows that the BJP leaders are constantly misrepresenting Gandhi and Nehru.
A few hours before the Haudi Modi incident in Houston, USA, Union minister Amit Shah claimed to be the direct cause of Pakistan's occupation of Kashmir.
A few days ago, many BJP leaders including Prayag Thakur have praised Gandhi for his contempt.
Prime Minister Modi reiterated US President Trumps support for the 'Howdy Modi' event in Houston.
In return, President Trump has praised Modi.
In his address, he said that there were strong divisions in the Hindi language and as the father of this country he had created unity by removing those divisions.
Usually, when Gandhiji was the father of India, it made many people feel shocked.
Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said, "Prime Minister Modi has used the Howdy Modi event he had attended to campaign for Trump.
This is a very wrong thing.
It is also wrong to replace Gandhi as the father of India.'
Union Minister of State Dr Jitendra Singh said, "US President Trump has praised our Prime Minister as the Father of India.
Some have expressed their opposition.
Those who are not proud of calling Prime Minister Modi the father of India should not call themselves Indians.'

In his address to the Ministerial level of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Ministerial Meeting in New York on September 26, 2019, as part of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary of State for External Affairs (MEA) Ravinath Singh underlined the relevance of the banding principles in the face of global multilateral mechanisms.
It is its moral duty to voice the voices of the southern world, especially the developing smaller countries, as the Non-Aligned Movement covers 55 percent of the world's population.
Sri Lanka reaffirmed its commitment to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) efforts to address current global challenges across national borders including conflict, migration, climate change and epidemics.
Untraditional security threats such as climate change not only pose an economic and social challenge but also pose a serious security threat to the communities and countries as a consequence of human disasters.
While welcoming the UN Secretary-Generals Climate Action Summit on 23 September 2019 at the UN Headquarters, Secretary Ariya Singh expressed his deep concern over the adverse effects of climate change in the island countries like Sri Lanka.
The Secretary of State expressed confidence that the upcoming COP25 in Chile will enhance its efforts to combat climate change through fulfilling the obligations enshrined in the Paris Agreement.
External Affairs Secretary Ariassinghe said that Sri Lanka was of utmost importance in combating all forms of racism, hatred and violent extremism and there was a need to focus on the new threats posed by the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka.
Such a global threat threatens the security of all countries, not only does one country deal with it alone, but also calls for joint efforts and called for a non-alignment movement to contribute positively and harmoniously to this global security threat.
While Sri Lanka believes in an independent society guaranteed freedom of expression, the Secretary of State for External Affairs said that the hate speech should be aware of the threat of abuse of internet and social media platforms.
The theme of the Ministerial Meeting was 'Standing the Policies of sovereignty and political independence as a means of preserving international peace and security and promoting inter-country friendship and cooperation' and the outcome document was accepted during the meeting.
Sri Lanka is co-ordinator of the Bandung Conference of 1955 and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement.
In the last six decades, the Committee has continued to improve and its membership amounts to 120 in the United Nations, i.e., two thirds of its membership.

In Tamil Nadu, former Chief Minister Jayalalitha announced a scheme called 'Amma Cement' at a very low price in order to improve the livelihood of the poor.
A bag of cement is sold for 190 rupees.
For this purpose, AADHAR Card, Family Card, Household Ration Card and Approved Building Map or Approval Certificate of Rural Administrative Officer, Amma Cement Sales Tax, Tamil Nadu Buyer are required to be handed over to the vendor.
The extent to which the cement is purchased, the 'DT' should be added to the application.
Cement covers will be issued within a week after recording the "DT" number on the website.
This is the process.
There is no proper practice of this in many places.
There are complaints all over Tamil Nadu that the corrupt officials have taken the money and sold the mother cement bundles in the black market.
Beneficiaries also try to avoid wavering, and try to buy cement bags quickly.

'Sri Lanka is experiencing strong bilateral relations with the Maldives, which is close neighbor and one of the South Asian countries, and is happy to state its intention to reconnect to the public interest, one of the first initiatives taken by the new administration of the Maldives last year,' he said.
In particular, a detailed assessment work carried out by the Directorate General of Public Grievances in the evening of January 2019 led to a positive resolution and the Secretary of State for External Affairs pointed out that any restriction on re-entry of any country from time to time should be treated as mere defects that affect all countries.
He stressed that additional barriers that lead to less incentives should not be put in their way.
Secretary of State also attended the 77 Foreign Ministers Meeting of the Group of Ministers (G77) held in New York on Friday, 27th September, 2019.
It was noted that G77 has been put in place as a unique global initiative to invite countries to respond to various requirements under special circumstances such as LWE, developing countries and developing countries in the emerging Small Island Developing States (SIDS).
These problems adversely affect economic and social growth and affect their ability to achieve sustainable development goals.
The organization should act as a joint voice to demand greater international support and support for vulnerable and marginalized countries, particularly in the area of finance and skill development.
In a statement issued during the Asia Cooperation Dialogue of the Foreign Ministers Meeting held in Sri Lanka as the co-chairs of the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation, Secretary of State for External Affairs, Acharyasinghe said that the Asia Cooperation Dialogue region plays an important role in sustainable social culture and economic development in the tourism sector.

Ronald Lee Haskel: In Texas, a person who killed his ex-wife's family was convicted.
Ronald Lee Haskeel was convicted in the spring of 39, 2014 for killing four of Stephen and Kathy Sta and their five children.
On 9th July, 2019, he entered the house of his wife Malani Haskeel to find out the place where he had separated.
There he was, but there was his sister Keith State and his family.
According to the office of the Harris County Sharif office, two boys aged 33, 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, were killed when Haskeel shot with a gun.
Only one member of the family survived when he was only 15 years old.
Officials said that even though he is recovering after some time, he was seriously injured in the infection.
The jury unanimously rejected Donald Lee Hoschell's claim that he had been arrested.
The court was adjourned until Monday for the sentence.

The result of a US military research has brought the Guantum Internet one step closer.
Such a web portal will provide the Army with security, detection and time-bound capabilities that are not possible in a routine network approach.
The Distributed uantum Data Centre of the Army Research Laboratory, DRDO developed counter-attack skill development of the US Army, which was funded and managed by the Army Research Office of the laboratory, saw a record of 50 km - using fiber optic cables between the materials and the light.
Background is a link between quantum steel products such as cubits.
The connection between the two cubits, if measured one, will affect the decision to measure the other, even if the second cubit is at its peak.
"This is a practical step to start the process of setting up of two orders size and intercity Guantum Networks in the near future [50 km] than earlier feasible," said Professor Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST. His findings have been published in the National General uantum Conference.
The inter-city uarantine networks have been built at the end of the long distance network of physical Queens, which have been kept far away, but are hassle-free.
The researchers said that this behind supply is essential for establishing the uantum Portal.
This is a major step forward in taking forward the massive expansion of the supply chain, said Sara Campbell, co-Member of the Army Programme supporting this research.
After traveling through the fiber route, the quality of the retreat at the other end and the extent to which the needs of some of the most difficult warehouse networks are met are high.
The research team began the test by using a calcium trapped in an iron trap.
While using laser light, researchers established a hemisphere over ion on ion, the hemisphere stimulated a collection of quantum data.
As a result, the hemisphere levels of the atom and the rays were retreated.
The challenge is to send a photo through fiber optic cables.
854 nanometers of photons coated with calcium ion are soon coated with optical fiber, said Lanyan.
So his team first sent the light drop to the path of an unspeakable lesson highlighted by the powerful lasers.
Button's transmission lines have been made more suitable for long distance travel - to the current level of 1550 nanometres for telecom.
After that, the researchers sent this 50-kilometer long fiber optic cable.
Even after the channel change and remote journey, their measurements showed that the nuclear and optical particles were still in the background.
Since the detection of calcium can be done in collaboration with a high quality clock cube, these decisions provide a direct way to make the network of silos possible for long distances.
The Army is very much required for large scale retrofitted clock networks, precision, guidance and time-use, said Dr Fredrik Fademi, Assistant Manager of the project.
