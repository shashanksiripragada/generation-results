The tourism department of Rajasthan considered to be the main source of economic development is going through bad governance at this time .
There is a grave danger to the cobra industry which is coming in the Vaisakh temple and South Asia .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan decreases by these days only .
According to a recent survey by the Rajasthan government the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 is less than 10 percent in comparison to 2008 .
The number of foreign tourists decreased by 98 . % in the country and 27 . 36 % in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 together in Rajasthan a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand and 564 tourists came , out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand and 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand and 646 foreign tourists were included , because in the middle of 2009 together 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand and 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with tourism think very well about this situation .
Director of Rajputana Holiday Makers Sanjay Kaushik has said that terrible events like Baisakhi are effect the tourism industry with a bad effect .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we do not develop the strength and basic structure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Most of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
The number of foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan is the maximum .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The attraction of tourism is increasing year by year in Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists .
From the point of view of tourism there is nothing new .
Deserts , big palaces , forts , wells , forests all are old , to surprise tourists .
Every government goes and works in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism , but does not do anything in this direction .
The facilities of the travellers coming to Rajasthan are available very little .
At the same time along with foreign tourists in Rajasthan the pictures of these countries have been depicted on the international level about rape and provocative incidents in recent times .
Years ago the tourism department of Rajasthan government had broken but it kept on contracting in the newspapers .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan Government in terms of tourism .
With the aim of promoting tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic structure of tourism , the Rajasthan government had prepared an RTDC in 1979 .
Facilities of lodging , food , lodging , boating etc . are available in this corporation .
The houses of this corporation are 75 units .
Of them 39 hotels , 22 motels , 8 kaphaitis , 3 bus bays , 3 bus bays , 2 train bridges on hill , Royal Rajasthan on Hill , but the condition of this municipal corporation remains intact for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 is estimated to be 185 lakh and that of next year 2009 - 10 is to be 63 lakh .
The condition of the hotels of this municipal corporation is this that in last five years even the rooms of 40 square kilometres of its hotels are not filled .
Along with the hotels the other units of the city are also making big losses .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Hills .
Travellers do not get attracted towards this train .
Because of less fare also this does not attract tourists .
In such a situation it seems that in the direction of Pushkar Fair also the favorites of the tourists have started coming .
In 2007 - 08 AD in this fair the construction of RTDC was done in that village where 398 foreign tourists had stayed , similarly this year its number has reduced to 217 .
In the midst of all this the most interesting thing for RTDC is this that there is no dearth of tourist attractions of tourists going to Palace on Hills and Royal trains .
This train keeps on running continuously .
Last year in this train a profit of 9 crore rupees was made for RTDC .
It is natural to see doubts in the tourist spots situated in the tourist spots of Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economic status of Rajasthan .

There is a huge collection of vineyards in a fort built in 12th century in a small town named Aizawl which is booked by foreign tourists for viewing .
Once the people of our country had crossed the forest with wild buffaloes .
The heart gets overwhelmed by the questions of the arrival of children from all the three - four kilometres road .
Suddenly a beautiful and artistic change is brought about by the spectacles of a circular shape .
In fact on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is standing in the upper part of the deep valley .
People take skiing on snow in the plains above the villages .
The dense forest of deodar is spread on the summits of the mountain above the skiing slop .
There is heavy fog on all four sides .
The roofs of the houses are illuminated by direct rays of the sun .
We reached the village in five minutes .
The same silence is there as well .
All around there is a mix of beautiful snow from the peak of the mountain to the valley .

It is said in Darjeeling that in Sikkim only Sikkim 's taxis are going on , so that there is no examination .
The journey continues , the land is different , but the mountain is the same .
It is the same cold which keeps the whole body shivering .
In the rainy season the black color also resonates in me .
When the plan for Darjeeling was fixed then at first decided to see Karsiyang .
Carsianing is a small town in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens and dense forests .
It is famous for producing excellent tea .
On getting to Darjeeling from Siligudi , after leaving the gardens of tea in the beginning welcome the people coming here .
When one passes through the road between the tea gardens then one gets the first attraction , which is one among the conserved places in the form of a wealth .
On one side the completely green mountain filled with jungles and on the other side is a deep green valley .
If there is forest in the middle here then the tea garden can be seen in the middle .
There is an empire of greenery all around .
Once upon a time I was wondering whether they could see these natural forests or the tea estates planted by humans .
Both attract themselves .
The more beautiful the forest is , the more beautiful the tea estates are spread .
On the roads on the way , construction is done with miracles .
We crossed the narrow and circular path of serpentine .
Time also passes .
Forest and tea estates are not over .
Sometimes tiny huts are visible .
From a distance on a mountain a very beautiful scene of houses and buildings can be seen .
This is Carsiank .
Staying here at one place we prepared a program to tour the whole day .
That is to take a car and take a ride to Karsiyang .
Deer Park at first .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
To climb up , to reach up to the Deer Park , the train has dropped below the park .
In the context of the beauty of Karsiyang even now it is not famous as if it has been developing in the form of tourism .
Because the city is so clean and clean .
The wish to reach the deer park surrounded by forests and the joy of reaching in the middle of the sun provides us with adventure .
The next place is ' Eagle Crag ' .
This is a point located at a height on the other side of the city .
This is called Suicide Point .
During the days of the English lovers used to get attracted towards this place .
Hilhal is connected with a park and a restaurant .
There is a fort with steps above which on reviewing the whole of the city beautiful scenery can be seen .
In the tea garden nearby women are made to sieve the leaves of tea with the hand quickly .
There is a museum outside the city of Karsiyang but that day we did not go there because it was more necessary to travel in the open environment of the tea plantations .
Next day decided to go to Darjeeling .
This was an exciting experience to me , but when it got rained we thought how we would roam .
But the coincidence was that when we reached the Rock Garden then we started roaming around with the enjoyment of the sun .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The way to reach here is more beautiful than this .
After descending from here a little ahead only Gangama surrounded by mountains was seen .
The magnificence of waterfalls can be seen between the rocks here .
In Rock Garden we get to see the rhythmic landscapes of rocks and stones here .
These two places are located very below the mountains of Darjeeling .
After climbing up and down with the help of the vehicle we saw an unforgettable sight in Darjeeling .
From here the whole of the mountain of Darjeeling is seen .
The weather has remained clear till today .
If we climb on the monastery then we can see the cloud resting .
Evening keeps on shining , being present anywhere in the evening .
In the journey to Darjeeling the toy train also gives the pleasure of traveling .
From Darjeeling to Dhum , Dhum , Darjeeling , the toy train journey from Tawai train especially attracts tourists .
Boating in the Mirik lake here and rest in the garden for a while .
Through this way tourists go to Pashupatinath market , where Nepal ' s artisans make - up and sweaters etc . are available .
There is an arrangement for going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling , but its shape and color are different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here because forests , waterfalls and springs stay here .
The most popular tourist spot of Kalimpong , Lava and Lolegram , are full of forest and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we did n't go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kalkata to tour Darjeeling under the shadow of winters but had connected us with the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling .
If it is my condition then a small trip would be very interesting and thrilling .
This journey is not foreign but foreign because it is very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject for me , in which there is a race to travel , but sometimes some specific place is the ship of water or some royal train or some city like Gulabi Nagar or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people get attracted to it .
The place where we went for work , that place was prepared about four and a half years back , but along with those preparations this place came where they really kept up .
Not only for those who go there , but also for those who stay there .
The sound of my guide Ram Babumina is echoing in my ears , we did n't even think about this before , how we lived in the jungle .
50 percent workers are also of this land .
Suddenly I felt that people from all over the place would not be able to work in the heritage hotel .
Ajababad residents Rambabu had worked in Jaipur before this , now in this unique Amber garden .
He told himself that he changed it to a new color .
Master 's ' is the speciality of the Aman Garden .
There no one will even call you English .
Aman park is in fact a center of attraction for tourists with special facilities besides regular peace and comfort .
That garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces itself to the nearby landmass .
How many people who spend holidays in Amber town of Rajasthan have traveled for Digha , why to go far , some people from Jaipur residents have to spend the night in this area .
The area of Amalgam Park is 100 square kilometres .
Shabana Azmi called me there lovingly but I didn't go there that night I remember.
It 's art is different that it has reached Daang in its own way .
This time I reached there at the invitation of our foreign guests , but those people who spent their holidays in less time seemed to be spending so much of the time that they must go to the Aman Park .
This garden is the only garden left from those seven gardens where the king of Alwar camped for hunting .
Its construction was done in 19th and 20th century .
Its old walls are witness to those days .
Surrounded by mountains , is the witness of tall trees .
The way you are coming in , that is why you are welcomed in such a way that it seems as if you have paid attention to the supernatural peace here .
Along with bandage in wrist the mantra of dosha is taken with each other .
When we reached Laila in the evening then we made a plan to roam around in this garden .
My guest ` Zakia ' is an ornamentation and loss of appetite .
All are inspired by big palaces and palaces .
The most beautiful is its lighting.
There is no wonder of everything new and artistically , which has received the award in the present times of the Amalgam Park .
The manager prepares our program for morning time .
First of all a foot journey with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey of Dandaag .
We saw the fort of Ajabgadh on the road of Sakri , in which the rays of the sun gradually spread .
We saw dry lake in which farmers were tilling .
This year it was not raining , but for the first time we saw tobacco .
The beauty of the rural life of Jakki is incomparable .
After that we reached Dandaag in Jeep .
In the morning I kept on watching a tourist from Holland , very carefully .
This is an unforgettable moment for us .
The journey of the Aman Park is traditional in the form of salutation and shrubs and they have been given from the point of view of freshness only to the tourists .
Now we got to know why tourists came here to spend so much money .
I have heard that picnics are also available to watch the life of tribals .
Is that right?
Buses are not of this type , are available in many countries and tourists find special interest in it .
This tour is generally organised from four days to two weeks and during this tourists get connected to other places .
Wherever you will stop you will also get food and other items from there .
They try to exploit such places where there is not much development and there does not affect daily life of nature and people .
Along with this there are old entertainment and other things .
Other than this it is also important to give traditional cuisines .
Actually the meaning of this type of tourism is to make the tourists understand the lifestyle and traditions of the region .
Although it may be a little difficult to imagine , but such tourism is a different kind of experience .
Touring in bus is a joy for us .
In this you can take the pleasure of roaming alone with the people because of its being with the people .
Not only this , on this journey if you take the book of your choice then you will get more time to pause only .
Yes it is extremely essential that along with giving less and more comfortable moments this tour will definitely take patience from you .
For its entertainment pay attention to some special things , especially if you are watching some foreign destination through a bus tour .
Check to find out if there is a good deal before ticketing .
Students , senior citizens and children etc . get benefit from this but other people also get relief .
Although in advance arrangement for ticket has been done so that in the last minute in planning tour in bus is appropriate but planning is done in less time .
Although in advance arrangement for ticket has been done so that in the last minute in planning tour in bus is appropriate but planning is done in less time .
This is cheap.
The routine of taking the baggage is very tough , therefore tell about the size and weight of the things .
Sometimes it does not happen that you have to leave some of your things in the terminal or else you have to pay more money later .
At the same time you should also know the rules of taking full charge of the insurance company from the tour company .
Keep the calorie on the bag finely and take it out .
Because there is pressure on the racks on the surface of the area .
Also keep in mind that while taking a bus between the tour the responsibility of goods is same .
From where you want to board the bus , reach there an hour before .
You should take special care of this thing at the interval of sneezing .
Actually the sooner you come you will choose the better place to choose .
While choosing the place at present keep in mind if there is a cure .
There is more movement in the back side , but reading is not possible in front of the back side .
But if you want that season of hot - cold even then take the space on the sides but if you do not like to be more careful then the place at the end will be better for you .
Then there is one more thing of intelligence .
If you are thinking of bringing both of them together then sit on the seat seated on the other side and hold the bag on the seat .
If you are thinking of bringing both of them together then sit on the seat seated on the other side and hold the bag on the seat .
If there is more crowd in the bus then the plan will be successful .
Meet the bus driver and the conductor .
This way you will get information as much as you want from them .
Everybody wants to go out while cleaning the bus .
At this time do not leave your things at the place where you are missing , because those on the bus will not take responsibility of this .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time then your place will be available to some new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .

According to the report of today 's conference Mandu Island was at a cost of Rs . 28 , 000 per person from Delhi .
After that if you live in the mountains then you will get the hotel at a lesser rate , but if you go to any island outside to enjoy the real beauty of the island then the pocket will be small .
The sea journey is fruitful here .
In the first week of December Louis cruise is the only ship between Kochi and Maldives Colombo .
Louis Cruz -LRB- European Institute -RRB- is at a distance of 100 kilometres from Delhi .
But due to some problems Louis cruise stops their services , but there remains a chance of resumption of business since October .
At least 5850 rupees per person per night you can go to the end of Maldives on three days at the least cost of the ship of Louis Cruise .
That is the cost of one person for three days is less than Rs . 18 , 000 .
And if you two are men then the child in the age of 15 years is completely free .
What else do you want?
The expense of cruises is also included in tea - snacks .
And the whole time is fun .
Reaching the capital Malana you can take the enjoyment of the holidays available to Maldives on the basis of pocket money - journey from sea plane to lunch in the middle of water .
If a flight comes in front of you on a big plane then you will feel as if it is a picnic spot .
But the twinkling airplane of 12 - 15 seats for going to and fro in a group of islands like Maldives is considered excellent in terms of controversy .
When it flies on the surface of water like speedboat then it can not be known from time to time .
In every flight you do not feel like ordinary plane .
Your policies are always under the window - on various sides of the island in blue water resort island and coral island .
It's all very clear.
There are two airlines for Maldives .
Trams is one of these in Maldives which has 20 airplanes .
If you want then you can take a flight of around 4000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- for an hour or the whole day on a plane you can rent -LRB- if you are in a pocket -RRB- .
If you are going from Maldives to some other island then C . . flight is necessary for a trip to different islands .
This journey will never stop you .
C - flight is of 12 kms to 183 kms from Maldives .
We were in the most ancient and famous shop of Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All the people taking goods in the market tried their best to speak the language at the World Water Conference organised in Repan Ganga one day before the Maldives President Mohammad Nasheed .
To tell the truth I did not see any Indian listening to the language of the President or the Prime Minister with so much attention .
But being a question of the existence of a creature remaining incomplete on this land it is better to suppress his silence .
Many people call the conference being organised in the waters of the Maldives in October , but if we go to Maldives then we feel that if our wrath is with us then how much less earth will be .
The beauty there is even more special .
There is not that much of beauty in that tiny country .
To go back from the end of the market towards your cruise -LRB- sea route -RRB- , boating on the roads , watering on the sea -LRB- sea route -RRB- can be seen how much people understand this beauty .
Because of the water being so clean fish can be seen swimming in the depths of coal lights with their own colors .
This is a part of the sea related to the city .
If you find some water of fresh water in the sea or river related to any city of India then you will be blessed .
After returning to M . . . Akawa Marine it was not clear in the evening two hours after spending a day in Mala .
The natives are true and honest .
Here you will get to see pugmarks from the top of the tomb .
We stayed outside his office for a while to hear the language of President Nasheed .
We could not believe that the house of the greatest man of any country was in front of us .
Along with a lot of interest we took pictures of the garden and angana built at a height of 50 metres by putting hand on the door of his bungalow .
You can imagine this before the house of any leader in India .
It has been learned that at times the presidents go to his office on a pedestrian street towards two blocks of the road .
Everything related to Maldives was moving towards one side .
Therefore I am waiting for the next day .
I knew it would be a special day.
In the morning cruises brought us to the airport .
From there we reached a place called ` Trams Maldives ' by walking on the runway .
Last evening while returning to Cruise we immediately returned to the C - plane passing from above .
We saw several pictures of it .
But we did n't know that the next moment could be ridden there .
We had to go to Rangoli island at a distance of 105 kilometres by Trams Mal TV .
Watching hundreds of resorts and island territories spread in the oceans of Maldives by the sea plane flying at a height of around 100 metres is a panoramic view .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
Due to thrill and curiosity breathing process used to be done .
But when we got to the Rangoli resort of the Hillton Hotels of Rangoli Island then we felt as if we have come to a different world .
There's another world that doesn't have any connection with the outside world.
There was a curiosity in the air about whether to get beauty and luxury or not .
Tour of Konark can be done by walking or in a car running in the battery .
On both the sides of the bridge that runs from Jati to the main island , the scene of water life was marvellous .
Now we had come to the nearest place to bear ourselves with the nature , which was beyond imagination .
After descending in the water a few metres down from the sea with the help of stairs we reached a mirror with water .
That room was actually a lunch room .
On every side we saw small - big fishes , whales , snow cocks , scuba diving and snorekelling .
The feeling of eating and drinking while sitting in the decorated tables made us wonder in itself .
The expense of going to this island from Mala to see and eating lunch under water is 47,000 rupees .
I had no intention of coming back from there .
We were ready to take our passport out in water .
But I knew it wasn't possible.
I returned with the belief that if I had a heavy heart, something could come back here again.
A few days back a plan was being prepared to go out of Delhi but due to busy work this was not possible .
Because of being an adventure in the life of the wilderness since childhood why should not we go to Jim Corbett this time ?
In 2006 after biking till Pegong lake in front of cardamgla pass this is the second bike ride .
On the morning of 27 December we left for Delhi in the direction of Jim Corbett , but from which Joshimath had left , the snow stopped our journey .
The journey between Hapurd and Gajud was difficult .
It's snow from the top and a rod from the front.
It seemed as if it had been falling several times .
In a way it reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ram Nagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was near Digli , which we booked earlier .
There was nothing special about this but in the cold also we left for a walk on the bank of Kosi .
After spending 2-3 hours there we went to Corbett museum .
From there we went down to Ramnager to take a walk .
It was very late when we returned .
While coming from Delhi definitely saw the lions roaming in the forest for sure and during the night there were lions all around me .
In the middle of the darkness of the night I heard a deep roar , after that till two o'clock the dogs filled it .
The first opinion was that of visiting Kalabhangi or Corbett waterfalls .
Kappukadu is located near Kattakada situated at a distance of 18 K . . from Thiruvananthapuram .
In the museum of ` Corbett National Park ' situated in the south - west of the Himalayas in east and north - west of the Himalayas is worth watching .
It's 12:30 p.m. when I came back.
Kalbhangi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett has started reaching this village .
When we reached the resort Safari gypsy was waiting for us .
He had arranged for the sight-seeing of the elders situated there .
When asked about number one then it was said that due to more grass there used to come here to save winters .
Just as we arrived at Bijrani, we were given a guide.
We prepared it for the forest inside .
We prepared it for the forest inside .
Inside we saw two Tuskar elephants, their horns were very big.
I took a lot of pictures .
In the meantime, the guide began to find the tiger's path.
Margot said that there are tigers in the park at least 150 - 150 , some of which have died recently .
We saw its nails on many places but we felt as if we are not able to see them .
On the third day we had to go to Delhi .
There was a tiger ride in my mind .
Then I remembered an old friend of mine in Haldi .
I just called him.
I told you I came to Corbett.
He asked me if I could see a tiger or not.
These words of his came to the fore as a weapon .
I said slowly, no!
There was no permission to bring a bike on the park .
Someone advised me to take a ride in.
