Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it ' s different .
Sind on one side of Kutch and Gujarat on the other , therefore , in language also , is a mixture of both .
This is called ' Kutchi ' .
It ' s a dialect , it ' s not its own script .
If you want to write Kutchi , you have to write it in Gujarati .
Near Bhuj is the Anjar city where many times there have been earthquakes and the whole city has been demolished .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisalmer .
The story of Jessal Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the same way as we had come then we will have to take a month 's leave and schools will open there in Bombay .
So what to do . Now we will travel by train calling the fast buses of Gujarat .
The small train of metre gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
A small train of 1 metre gauge from there will reach Ahmedabad and will reach Bombay through the broad gauge train from Ahmedabad .
The tourism industry , which is considered the main base of the economy of Rajasthan , is going through a bad phase these days .
Due to the global recession and the increasing terrorist threats in South Asia the tourism business has suffered a lot .
With the point of view of tourism there has been a considerable decrease in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included among the major states of the country these days .
The latest figures released by the Rajasthan Government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics the number of domestic tourists has decreased by 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists has decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 native and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 only 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 native and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Holiday Makers says that global recession and terrorist incidents have adversely affected tourism business .
Compared to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop strong tourism infrastructure here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India as well there has been a decline of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
The number of foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan is maximum .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy prefer Rajasthan .
Recent years have gone well for Rajasthan in terms of tourism .
This is the first time since 2002 that a decrease has occurred in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , fort , Bavaria , forest , everything is the same old fort to comfort the tourists .
The matter of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism , all the governments do it in a big way but nothing has happened in this direction .
Facilities are available for tourists coming to Rajasthan very rarely .
At the same time in recent years incidents of rape and molestation along with foreign women tourists have also taken place at the international level in this state .
Years before the Rajasthan government , tourism had given the status of industry to the state , but it has remained confined to paper only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited ( RTDC ) is an example of the success of the Rajasthan Government towards tourism .
To promote tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the infrastructure of tourism , the Rajasthan Government had formed RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides the facility of accommodation , food , traffic , boating etc . to tourists .
The Corporation has a total of 75 units .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motels , 8 Cafeteria , three Yatrikas , one Traffic Unit and two train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the condition of this corporation has remained very fine for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh , which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is this that in the last five years even forty percent of its hotels could not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of corporation are also making it a big loss .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There was no attraction of the tourists towards this train .
Even after reducing the fare it could not attract the tourists .
In the same way in recent years a reduction has been seen in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in the tourist villages made by RTDC there were 398 foreign tourists staying , this year this number has reduced to 217 .
Among all this the satisfactory point for RTDC is this that no reduction has been made in the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . royal train .
This rail line is continuously making use of .
Last year , RTDC received a benefit of Rs . 9 . 5 crore from this train .
Due to this decline in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see tension in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If man wants to do something in his heart , he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has made it true by settling the modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain range of the Sahyadri mountain range .
The dream he had dreamt of was a day - to - day progress and his eyes were filled with joy .

A Dussehra statue of Devi Durga is found at this place .
Behind the naming of this statue and place many sweet stories and old legends are popular among the people here .
The ruins of Devlapani are still singing the glorious saga of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamraeshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
One gets to know the magnificence of Tamraguri Devi in the ancient literature and mythological tales .
During the reign of Chetia kings , this goddess was recognized far and wide in the north - eastern hills .
People of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
The sacrifice of the humans was also done here , which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishma Nagar which are situated in the middle of the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the folk tales established here this place is ancient Vidarbha , where once king Bhishma used to reign .
Brahmkund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of the Lohit district .

On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far come here .
Apart from the above mentioned ruins mentioned in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal , the ruins of Roing in Dibang Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The relics of brick ponds near Roing are still telling their stories .
Bathing - ghat , concrete steps and another pond surrounded by concrete circumference in it and the relics of wide roads are still singing praises of their ancient grandeur .
From North Lakhimpur , the city of upper Assam , through jeep we reach Zero for four hours .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place captures the heart of tourists .
This is the same pleasant place where there is an emergency .
It used to take several days to reach here before becoming the road of jeep .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premarrys , whales , wild currents , strawberrys and Rasberries etc . attract the tourists a lot .
Apples and potatoes are born here much .
At a height of about 1524 metres there is a valley spread in 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the emergency people .
With their untiring efforts , the emergency people have made it their paradise .
Rice farming is done here in plenty .
This place is ' the store of rice ' .
Ten miles long , this plateau is a living example of their hard work and ability to cultivate .
Their irrigation needs are met by the Kali river .
The pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
Eyes falls on the light redness emerging in the sky on the horizon in between the snow laden mountain range of the left hand .
There is a lot of coolness in air .
Along with the shivering cold in the environment there is also a feeling of moisture .
The layer below the feet is visible on the wooden floor with the sound of garbage .
There is silence in the atmosphere and there is not much to be seen because of the shadow of mist before sunrise .
The eyes remain fixed on the redness of the east .
I feel like sitting on a bench in the balcony .
On touching , the smooth layer of the scalp may squirrel with the sound of a light jerk and the hand is separated from the shock by the feeling of cold .
This is the first experience of spending a night in this small village settled amidst these hills of Switzerland covered with snow thousands of miles away from our country .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this spent most of the time in Geneva or around him .
The dense population of the valley on both the sides of the thin , sandy river is spread very high on the slopes .
This is the valley of Ronne , the main river of Switzerland on which many small and big cities are settled .
The highway parallel to the Ron river and the cars crawling on it have started giving clear .
300 km away and 2 . hours journey by car , half a way , parallel to Geneva lake and half along with a river Ronti Monastery which comes from the east is found in Geneva lake which is called Deceon -LRB- Lake Lama -RRB- .
Geneva city is settled at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake becomes again river and goes towards the west .
On the right side near the lake are the mountain ranges of Dhaval , Gaganyaan , Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Leuk , from the exit gate on the left side we come to the mountainous path from the north , leaving this highway .
As the mountain slope is southward , the sun of the afternoon is giving full sunshine to the fan .
As compared to valley the amount of snow is less here - almost no .
As we move towards the height the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite heavy snowfall on both sides of the road , due to clear sky and shining sun there is no special coolness in the air .
After covering a journey of about 20 kms on this circular mountainous road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thalassery .
Halt -LRB- Halt -RRB- - those with slopy roof are major multi-storied bungalows made of wood completely .
The basement of cement concrete of this three - storey bungalow has control rooms for parking of trains as well as for essential services like electricity , water , lottery etc .
Valiya is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of the wine making of grapes .
Grapes are cultivated in about 37 % of the area of the whole canton .
In the villages settled on both the sides of the Ron valley the gardens of grapes give a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking wine -LRB- wine garden -RRB- of grapes -LRB- garden -RRB- , taking them on a tour , getting them at night rest in the villages there and drinking wine -LRB- wine testing -RRB- taking them in the factories of grapes is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Agelle , built in the 12th century in a cottage there is a huge museum of grape wine to see which foreign tourists have to get started booking .
We pass through the same forest once again after getting burnt with fire .
Mind becomes even worse with the pricking questions of children throughout the way up to three - four kms .
At a sudden turn , the scene brings dramatic and delightful change .
Right in front , on the slope above the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful herd of houses is settled .
People are skiing in the snow on flat slopes from above the village .
The dense forest of cedar is spread up to the summit of the mountain above the skiing slop .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlements are shining because of the direct rays of the sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also the same silence is spread .
The empire of Dhaval snow all around from the peak of the mountain to the valley .
Within next five minutes we reach a large round about in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Leukerabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Lukerabad is about 1500 .
The number of tourists , players and health workers coming here can be estimated with this fact that there are 1700 apartments with a capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels for a stay of 1500 , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
Sixty - five hot water beds have been found in Lukarbad so far .
Out of these 40 lakh litres ( daily ) heat ( up to 51 o ' clock ) is taken to the thermal pools of 30 big and small in place in the whole town of water , some pools are within five star hotels and other income group people according to their pockets .
A feeling of extreme heat by reaching the village .
In the scorching sun the thick layer of snow is shining above the roof of the house .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the places found in Switzerland as a heritage of ' national importance ' .
It was told in Darjeeling only that Sikkim can go for taxis only so that there is no checking .
The journey is on , the state is second , but the mountain is the same , the trees are the same , the waves are at the same time .
The moisture that touches the whole body is the same .
In the rainy season the sun shines .
As soon as the plan to visit Darjeeling was made , Kurseong was the first to take a look .
Kurseong is a small town in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunshine forests .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If you move from Siliguri to Darjeeling , then at the beginning tea plantations welcome the people moving towards it with smile .
Passing through the road in the midst of tea plantations hypnotise the mind for the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with forests and on the other deep green valleys .
Here , sometimes in the forest , sometimes tea - plantations were seen .
All around there was the empire of greenery .
Once I was stunned to see these natural forests or the tea plants planted by man .
Both of them were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful the forest was , the more beautiful the tea plantations spread far and wide .
On the roads on the way , when the sight went then the creation looked amazing .
The crooked path of the snake was passing through .
The time was also passing .
If not , then the forest and the tea - garden .
At times small settlements were seen .
From a distance , a hill house , etc . appeared to be very dense .
It was Kurseag .
Staying here at one place we made a program to roam all day .
Therefore taking a car we set out on a tour of Kurseong .
Deer Park at first .
A small garden is surrounded by vast forests .
It was above that to reach till Deer Park the train had to leave at a very low level .
Despite being endowed with beauty , Kurseong has not yet become well - known as a tourist destination .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite road being deserted . the greed to reach till deer park surrounded by forests and the joy of climbing path amidst sunshine was giving us the courage .
The next place was the Eagle Crag .
This is a point located at a height on the other side of the city .
This is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that in the times of the British lovers used to jump and die by jumping from here .
At present it is equipped with a park and a restaurant .
There is a stairwelling dome here , the view of the whole of the city from the height of which is spectacular .
In the tea gardens near the women were engaged in breaking tea leaves running at the speed of hand with baskets on their backs .
There is a museum outside Kursiang city but that day we could not go there because it seemed necessary to tour the uninhabited environment of tea plantations .
The next day was scheduled to visit Darjeeling .
It was an exciting experience in itself , but a big worry was that if it had rained then how would we roam .
But it was a good chance that by reaching the Rock Garden we roamed around taking enjoyment of the sunshine blooming .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming .
On moving a little ahead from here we found Gangamaya surrounded by hills .
The scene of the waterfall between the rocks here is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we found that the waterfalls here in the reign of stones and rocks are hypnotised .
Both these places are present in the middle of the hills of Darjeeling a lot .
We saw Dasia Loop rising above the vehicle in Darjeeling .
The whole of the hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here through binoculars .
The weather was still fine .
But as soon as we moved towards Monastery , where did the subtraction appear and started to shake .
In the evening there was a plan to walk and shop on the mall road .
In the tour of Darjeeling 2 trains put a stop on the journey .
Roaming from Darjeeling and traveling from Ghum to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in the Mirik lake here and a short break in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where hand made sweaters of Nepali artisans etc are available .
There is also an arrangement to go to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is the only city in Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
Here tea is not only the greenery of gardens but also the movement of forest - streams .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of forest and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come from Kolkata to Darjeeling in the shade of coolness , but the tea plantations spread over Siliguri to Darjeeling have captured me .
A small trip of my recent past was interesting and exciting .
This journey was not foreign or outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism in itself is an interesting subject in which sometimes journey takes towards itself , then at some special place , ship of water or some royal train or a city like pink city or lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come in pull .
The place I am going to talk about is ready about four and a half years ago , but the preparation that came to this place had really done well in forest .
not only for those who go there , but also for those who live there .
My guide echo the words of Ram Babu Meena in my ears . Sahiba , we could not even imagine that we can stay like this in the forest before this .
Fifty percent of the staff is from this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many locals did not even get work in the heritage hotel .
Ram Babu , a resident of Ajbgarh , used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal style Aman Bagh .
He has moulded his own speech into a new colour .
Sahiba ' is the style of Aman Bagh .
There is no one to call you in English .
Aman Bagh is really a place of peace and comfort .
This garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces you to the nearby area as well .
How many among the people spending holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan must have visited Bhangarh fort . Why should I go away , some of the people of Jaipur might have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of different countries have reached there .
I remember the night that Shabana Azmi had summoned me there , but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had gone astray and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there on the feast of my foreign guests , and it seemed that those who want to spend a good holiday in less time , they must go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left in those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stay for hunting .
It was built in nineteen hundred and twenty .
Its old wall is the witness of those days .
In the shadow of thick trees surrounded by hills and dense forests the first glimpse of Aman Bagh attracts you .
As soon as you come in , the way you are welcomed it seems as if attention is paid to the divine peace here .
In the wrist , the mantra of mangalachar is given lively pronunciation .
We arrived in the evening , and we intended to plant that garden .
My host , Jackie , who was an architect , suddenly said , It ' s interesting .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
It ' s all new but artistic ; it ' s not surprising that Aman Bagh has received the award recently .
The manager fixed our schedule for the morning .
First of all a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey of Bhangarh .
Walking on the Sakri road we saw the fort of Ajabgadh on which the sun was rising gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year it did not rain but for the first time we saw tobacco cultivation .
For Jackie , such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
Early morning I had seen a tourist in Holland sitting in deep meditation .
It ' s a million dollars a precious moment .
The method of saying good bye to Aman Bagh was also traditional , by feeding jaggery and curds , they sent us away .
Now we understood that why does tourists come here after spending so much money .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept for showing Tribal life .
Is that right ?
Of course , this does not happen in many states but tourists also show a lot of interest in it .
These tours are generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this tourists are taken to different places .
Staying there , eating etc . are also included in this .
This way there is an attempt to discover such places where there has not been much development and where there has not been any special effect of time on the life style of nature and people .
Along with that where old tourist sites etc . are also present .
Apart from this , attention is also paid to serving traditional keys .
In fact the purpose of such tour is to make the tourists acquainted with the ways of living and traditions of that place .
Although it seems a little difficult in thinking , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
The tour has its own fun .
With this despite being with many people you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time without disturbing your favorite book .
Yes , of course this is definitely such that along with giving you less expense and plenty of time these tours definitely keep the demands of patience .
This is the reason that to enjoy these it is important to keep in mind some things , especially when you are watching some foreign destination through bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
If the students , senior citizens of the military , children , etc get discounts on these then there is a provision of exemption for two people as well .
Though it is cheap to buy tickets in advance , therefore it is better to plan the tour in the last moment than just tour .
You should know about the round trip instead of the two tickets .
They are cheap .
Regarding the baggage the rules are very strict , therefore get the information regarding the size and weight of the luggage .
Either you have to leave some of your luggage at the terminal or you have to pay extra fees .
Also know the rules of compensation of insurance or loss from the tour company .
Carry on bags remain right , take them .
Because they fit in the rack above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus you will have your own responsibility of luggage .
From where you have to take the bus , reach there an hour before time .
During busy season take special care of this point .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat option will be with you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the comfort .
If there are more shocks on the back seat , then it is not possible to read in the next seats .
If you have to go to Lu again and again then take the corner seat and if you do not like to be more disturbed then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now it ' s a trick .
If both of you are in a hurry then sit on the corner seat and keep your bag on the other .
If there is not much crowd in the bus , then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washrooms in the bus , then take care of this matter as well while eating the seat because after a while sitting there becomes difficult .
Make the identity of the bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus , everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its disappearance the bus driver does not take responsibility .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time then you can get a new passenger in your place and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .
It is said that if Rome had not seen in Europe , it had not seen anything .
Italy 's capital Rome is a proud city of ancient Europe and is famous for its many things .
Italy 's capital Rome is among those old cities of the world from where civilizations have developed .

A church , museum and old temple are also built in ` Capital Complex ' .
The symbol of Rome is Colosseum .
The construction of this huge Akhara was done in 80 BC and 50 thousand visitors could sit here together .
In Colosseum , gladiators , i . . swordsmen , show their tricks .
They fought not only with each other but also with wild animals .
These heartbreaking battles , whether by swords or animals , continued until one of the fighters died .
In ancient Rome there used to be a lot of ' Forum ' .
Let ' s say that the place of union is called the forum in Rome .
Here all the social , religious , economic , political etc activities of the city used to take place .

Because of this place devotees felt such as if their prayers are reaching directly to the deities .
Inside the temple statues of deities are made all around .
In 601 AD this temple was made a church .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Villa Boris is unparalleled .
Therefore do not forget to see it on going to Rome .
Definitely go to the museum built here , because on missing it you will miss the opportunity of being face to face with the best sculpture .
The idols built here are unique and they seem so lively that they will just speak .
Here on the bed of Napoleon ' s first sister Paulin who was married to Borges royal family a statue lying there seems to be so alive that you will not be able to live without looking at it for a moment .
The special attractions of Rome are its fountains .
There are approximately 300 such buildings here in which excellent fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trevi fountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come back to Rome , he should put a coin in the fountain with this wish .
It is believed that by doing so this desire is fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city will not be complete until you see ' Vatican City ' .
Since sixth century this place has been the residence of the supreme religious chief Pope of the followers of the Roman Catholic religion .
Although it is in Rome itself , but since 1926 it has been given the status of an independent city .
You must see the famous St . Peter 's Church , St . Peter 's Square , Flowers , Museum etc . of Vatican City .
Definitely this will show you the views of a different world and will give you a memorable experience .

The neighbor state of Maharashtra Goa is rich with its beautiful sea shores and various water sports , which is like a heaven for tourists , where tourists can easily see the grandness of ancient times by touring the ancient churches .
Located in the capital Panajim of Goa the Ginger Hotel makes this journey of the western coast excellent .
Enjoying fully the facilities of cycling , river cruise , cold sea winds and world famous cuisines on the roads of Goa , the Ginger Hotel located here is an excellent option for spending a day .
If you look at the date of today then the cheapest return from Delhi for Maldives is of 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stop at the mall then also you can get a hotel in less rent but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then pocket will be small .
Sea cruises prove beneficial here only .
In the first week of December , Louis Cruise from Kochi started India ' s only cruise for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very popular in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Louis cruise has stopped his service now but is expected to resume from October .
On the ship of Louis cruise at least 5850 rupees per person per night you can go for a tour of Maldives for a three day cruise .
That is the rent for one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are adults , children under the age of 15 are completely free .
And what else .
The fare of cruise includes tea , snacks , food .
The entertainment of every time together .
After reaching the capital Male you can take enjoyment of the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes if a plane has come standing in front of you then you will feel like a toy .
But this toy plane with 12 - 15 seats is the best for touring of archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- like Maldives .
When it gets up in the air running like a speed boat on the surface of the water , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flying of ordinary airplanes .
At every moment your eyes are fixed below the window - watching resort , island and coral island in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
It ' s all so clear .
There are only two plane companies in Maldives .
Tros is one of those who have twenty sea planes .
If you want you can take a flight of around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or else you can take the whole plane for a ride -LRB- if the pocket is deep -RRB- .
By the way , if you go beyond Manali island then the journey of Sea plane will be necessary because this is the way of traveling between different islands .
And it ' s a journey that ' s never going to end .
Sea plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in Uttrakhand -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the capital ' s biggest antique and souvenir shop in the Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All the salesmen were listening very carefully the speech given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before .
To be honest , I have not seen any Indian listen so carefully to the speeches of the Presidents or the Prime Minister .
But when it was a question of the very existence of an unsurpassed piece of the earth , such seriousness was inevitable .
Many people may have understood the internal meeting of the Maldives cabinet in October , but going to Maldives seems to be how poor the world will be if we take away the wrath of nature from us .
There is something special about the beauty there .
In that small country it is not as beautiful as it is .
Returning from that tour of market to go towards its cruise , while returning the eyes went towards Barbas Road as well along the sea water then realized that the extent to which people here understood the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that the fish floating in the depths of several metres under the light of the lamppost were visible with all their colours .
It was that part of the sea which was very close to the city .
If you can see some centimeters clearly in the sea or river water adjacent to any city of India then you will find yourself lucky .
While returning to M . . Aquamarine the evening while spending two hours in the evening were moving around in Jhanan .
coral reef is the life here .
Until you will find coral rocks on the tombs .
Just before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not sure that we were in front of the residence of the supreme person of any country , there was no security guard till far .
We were joking with the photographs of the gardens and verandahs merely fifty metres away by lifting our hands inside the door of his bungalow .
Can you think of a leader ' s house in India by any payment ?
It was also known that at times the President would cross the roads on foot and reach his office two blocks ahead .
Everything about the Maldives was to be overwhelm .
That is why I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
The day was about to be special .
Early morning we brought a boat from the cruise to the airport island .
From there we reached walking around the runway on the base of Trans Maldives .
Last evening , when the cruise was reaching near Male , we immediately recognized the sea plane passing above .
of the pictures that he had seen .
But then it was not expected that he would get a ride the next day .
From the sea plane of Tros Maldives we were about to go to Rangali island a hundred and five kilometres away .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the seashore of Maldives by the sea plane flying about 1000 metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was an adventurous and exciting breath taking flight .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of Hillton Hotel on Rangali island we felt as if we have reached some other world .
In a world that had nothing to do with the outside world .
It was not even so that it was difficult to get out of the beauty or luxury like there .
Tour can also be done on Conrad or battery operated car .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge was marvellous while going from Jetti to the main island .
We were not able to make ourselves comfortable with the nature nearby , we reached at such a place which was unimaginable .
Several metres down from the stairs descending into the sea we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
The room was actually a dining room .
We could see rare species of fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving from all around .
The imagination of food was with you by sitting on the decorated tables there was in itself very exciting .
On coming to this island from Male to sea plane the rent for seeing it and lunching underwater is only 47 thousand rupees for a man .
I had no intention of returning from there .
We were ready to deliver our passports in water .
But he knew it was not possible .
With a heavy heart they returned with the hope that at some point a fate will certainly come here .
He had been planning to go out of Delhi for several days , but it was not possible because of the busyness of work .
Since childhood he was fond of wildlife , so thought why should n't we go to Jim Corbett this time ?
This was the second bike tour after a trekking of 2006 from Khardungla pass to Pegang lake in Ladakh .
Early morning of 27 December we left for Delhi for Jim Corbett but due to the thrill in which fog engulfed us .
The journey from Hapur to Gajraula was really tiring .
Fog from the top and bad roads in front .
Many a times it seemed that it had fallen .
Somehow reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near Park , which we had booked earlier .
That day there was no special program , we went to the shore of Kosi despite the cold .
After spending two - three hours there we left for the Carbet Museum , which was near the Dhangari gate , hardly 2 km .
From there we went to tour Ramnagar down .
It was late in the evening .
I had come out of Delhi determined that if I see a lion roaming around in the forest then I could see lions in the dream all night .
In the midst of the depths of the night , I heard a tremendous roar , and after that the dogs who started barking did not stop for two hours .
Therefore the suggestion to go for a walk in the Kaladhungi and Carbet fall first came .
Kaladungi is 30 km away , while Carbet fall falls on the way .
In Kaladhungi is the museum of Jim Corbett , where some important things related to his personal life are kept .
It was half past twelve while returning .
Kaladhungi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled in this very region .
On reaching the resort Safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that he has arranged for the sighting of one site , Bijarani .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more grassland and during this time tigers come towards the same side to escape from cold .
Just as we reached Bijrani a guide was given , which takes two and a half hundred rupees to roam around for four hours .
We left for the forest inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two taskar elephants , which had long teeth .
I did a lot of photography .
In the meanwhile the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide told that around 150 tigers are in the park , some of them have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was sad on not getting the view of Tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
I had a tiger ride in my mind .
Then I remembered one of Haldwani ' s old friends .
I called him like this .
I told him that I had come to Carbet .
He asked if he saw the tiger .
His words were pricked like an arrow .
I said gently , No .
Bikes were not allowed in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a ride inside .
