Its language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other side there is a mixture of both in language as well .
This is called Kutchi .
As such this is a dialect , it does not have its own script .
If Kutch has to write then it has to be written in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is the Anjar city where many times there have been an earthquake and the entire city has been devastated .
The tomb of Jaisalmer - Toral is near Anjar .
The point of Jaisalmer is very charming .
If you come to Magh via that route then you will still have to take a holiday of one month and schools will start there in Mumbai .
So what to do . Now let us travel by train with the speed of the trains of Gujarat .
A small train of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there one more small train of metre gauge will reach Ahmedabad and broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry believed to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through a bad situation these days .
Due to the danger of global slowdown and the increasing danger of South Asia the business of tourism is getting a serious blow .
With regard to tourism special deficiency has been registered in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country these days .
According to the recently announced data by the Rajasthan government in 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has reduced by more than 10 percent compared to the year 2008 .
According to numbers there has been a decrease of 9 . 77 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 26 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas in 2009 only 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 619 domestic and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included in this .
People associated with tourism are very worried regarding this situation .
The director of holiday makers from Rajputana Sanjay Kaushik has said that global recession and terrorist incidents have adversely affected tourism business .
Compared to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop strong base for tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has decreased by 3 . 29 percent in the last year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
The number of foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan is maximum .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy prefer Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism the last few years have been better for Rajasthan .
This is the first time after 2002 that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists .
Nothing new has been happening from the point of view of tourism .
Desert -LRB- wilderness -RRB- , havelis , forts , havelis , forests -LRB- havelis -RRB- all are old for tourists to see .
In the area of tourism in rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism all the governments do a lot of work , but nothing is done in this regard .
Facilities for tourists coming to Rajasthan are also available very less .
This state has also been impressed with the international level by the incidents of violence and harassment of foreign women tourists .
Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in this state a long time ago but it had remained confined to papers .
One example of the success of Rajasthan Government in relation to tourism is that of Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the basic nature of tourism , the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
This institute provides the facility of residence , food , communication , boating etc . to the tourists .
This institute has a total of 75 divisions .
In which 29 hotels , 22 models , 8 cafes , 3 trips , one unit of communication and 2 train packages and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels are available , but for a few years the situation of this institution is getting worse .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is this that in the last five years even forty percent of its hotels have not been filled .
Along with hotels other components of the institute are also harming it .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There could not be any attraction of the tourists about this train .
Even after reducing the fare it could not attract the tourists .
Similarly in the recent years in Pushkar Fair has been held for the tourists .
In the year 2007 - 08 in this fair the tourist villages made by RTDC had stayed where 398 foreign tourists had stayed , this year there was a dearth of that number and this year it is 217 .
One more interesting thing about this was that there was no dearth of tourist attractions of Palace on Wheels i . . royal train .
This train is proving beneficial .
Last year by this train RTDC has achieved a profit of nine and a half crores .
This slowdown in the tourism sector in Rajasthan is natural for concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the mind of man then he can take out the gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has exhibited this reality on the basis of the modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
Those dreams which he had dreamt , they would see the progress happening everyday , they would be happy in their eyes .
This joy of theirs was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Amby Valley .
The work of Amby Valley started and today Amby Valley has been successful in making its place in the form of a unique city .
In this city spread in more than 10 , 000 acres there are only 9 percent of the ground hotels , houses and other facilities .
91 % land has been provided with trees , lakes , ponds and other facilities .
Several industrialists came forward to make their houses in this city made for crores of people and today about 800 families are living in this city .
Initially businessmen and rich people bought Asia here in the form of holiday home but now they have made it their home and after working they go to Mumbai .
Behind the Amby Valley is Korigarh fort which enhances the beauty of this premise .
The remains of Likawali in West Siang district are very important .
Remains of a huge temple have been found while digging .
The engraving of the idols of lotus and Goddesses is done on the stone pillars of this temple which is mostly in the dilapidated condition .
Malini Than is an important place in this area .
On this spot a desolate idol of Durga Devi is found .
Behind the naming of this statue and place many sweet stories and ancient legends are prevalent here .
The ruins of Devlapani are still there in the glorious saga of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamrueshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
The description of the magnificence of Tamrueshwari Devi is found in the ancient literature and ancient legends .
During the reign of Chetia kings far and wide recognition of this goddess was done in the mountains of the North - East .
People of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
Here the human sacrifice was also given , which was later stopped by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other relics have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishma city which is situated in the circumference between Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the folk tales established here this place is old Vidarbha , where once king Bhishma used to reign .
Brahmkund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of the Lohit district .
Diguru , Mishmi , etc . here are the guides to the tribes .
These people themselves have great faith in this Kunda .
The famous Parashuram Kund is just near the Brahmakunda .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far come here .
Apart from the above mentioned remains in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal , the remains of Roing in Dibang Valley district are also important from the historical point of view .
The ruins of the old ponds near Roing are still telling their stories .
Surrounded on all the four sides of bathing wharf , pucca houses and other ponds and the ruins of wide roads are still singing the silence of our ancient glorious sagas .
From North Lakhimpur , the city of upper Assam , through jeep we reach Zero in four hours .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this pleasant hill station attracts the attention of the tourists .
This is the same pleasant place where the people of your community stay .
It takes several days for the jeep to reach here before the road is made .
Just as one reaches here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful preservatives , volats , wild currents , strawberries and rasberrys can be enjoyed as well .
There is a lot of production of apples and acacia .
At a height of about 1524 metres there is a valley spread in 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of its own people .
With their untiring efforts their own people have made it their heaven .
There was a lot of paddy cultivation here .
This place is the store of rice .
Ten miles long this plateau is the living example of the hard work and skill of farming .
The requirement of irrigation of black river valleys is fulfilled .
Trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
The vision falls on the horizon in the middle of the snow laden mountain ranges of the left hand on the mild redness coming out of the sky .
It is cold properly in the air .
The feeling of warmth can also be experienced with the touch of the environment .
Under the feet a layer of wood is coated with the layer of wood with the sound of garbage .
There is silence in the environment and as the air spreads before sunrise nothing was visible .
The eyesight stays on the redness of the East .
There was a desire to sit in the bench that had fallen in the balcony .
As soon as the hands begin to fall the layer of the snow on the ground with a slight sound and the hand jerks at the edge of the cold .
This is the first experience in the life of spending a night in this small village settled amidst these mountains of Switzerland , thousands of miles away from our country .
This is my third trip to Switzerland .
Before this spent a long time in Geneva or around him .
The village based in the valley on both the sides of the shallow Balkhati river is spread up to very high on soft slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland ' Ronne ' valley on both the sides of which are settled many small and big cities .
The highway parallel to the Ron river and the trains running on it have become clearly visible .
The half way journey of 300 kms by car and half an hour by car and half a road in the east along with Geneva lake and along with half a river Montruux the city named Geneva lake which is called Lake Lemon .
Geneva city is settled at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake becomes again river and moves ahead west .
On the right side on the other side of the lake are the mountain ranges of Dhaval , skycraping and Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Leuk -LRB- EXT -RRB- on the left side we leave this highway on the northern hill road .
Because of the slope of the mountains being south - west the sun of the evening gives a lot of boost to all the wings .
The quantity of snow is less than the valley here - almost not equal .
As the height moves forward , the density of snow starts increasing .
On both sides of the road despite snow being frozen best it should not be cold in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
We reached a small village named Thalassery after completing a journey of 20 kms on this curved hill .
Shelley - There are big , multi-storied bungalows made of fully wooded roofs made of copper .
In the basement that is built of a cement concrete of this three storied bungalow there are rooms for controlling the essential services like electricity , water , laundry along with parking of cars .
Valapattanam is the most ancient industrial place in wood industry in the whole of Asia .
This wine is the main center of making wine in the grapes .
37 % land of the whole of the canton contains the cultivation of grapes .
The orchards of grapes in the villages settled on both the sides of Ron Valley provides a magnificent dimension to the beauty there .
Taking wine gardens to the base , beating them again and again , taking rest in the villages there in the night and taking them to the factories of grapes make them taste an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Agile there is a huge museum of liquor made from 12th century in a small fort made of grapes , to see which foreign tourists have to register early .
Once again we went through the same forest burnt with fire .
The mind becomes even more sad due to the questions of children walking up to three - four kms .
On a sudden , there is a dramatic and delightful change in the scenery .
Just in front , on the left side of the road on the top of the deep valley is a beautiful pool of houses .
People are skiing in the snow on the plain slopes situated in the upper part of the village .
The dense forest of deodar is spread from the skiing slopy to the summit of the mountain .
All around thick snow has fallen .
The roofs of the houses in the villages are sparkling like a mirror of sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Peace is spread here also .
On all four sides from the peak of the mountain to the valley is the empire of Dhauladhar mountain .
Within next five minutes you reach a big round hole in the middle of that town .
The name of Kasba is Leukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Lucknow is about 1500 .
The estimation of the number of tourists , players and health workers coming here can be done by this fact that 1700 beds with capacity of 6900 beds are available to stay here for 1500 28 hotels , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 hotels .
65 source of hot water has been found in Lakkarbad so far .
40 lac litres -LRB- everyday -RRB- of hot water that comes out of it -LRB- till 510 -RRB- is supplied to the thermal pools built at places around the whole of the town , some are inside the five star hotels and other income groups of people keep their economic status .
On reaching the village one feels extreme heat .
In the scorching heat of the sun a thick layer of snow is formed on the roof of the house .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the safest places in Switzerland in the form of a national heritage .
It was told in Darjeeling only that Sikkim can go by taxi only and therefore checking is not done .
The journey is on , the state is second , but the mountains are the same , the trees are the same , the wind is the same .
Shouting is the same on whole body .
In the season of the rains there is the hustle-bustle here .
As soon as the plan to travel to Darjeeling was confirmed it was decided to take a glimpse of Kurseong .
Kurseong is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of smoke .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If we move ahead from Siligudi to Darjeeling then the tea gardens spread in the beginning welcome the people coming towards us with laughter .
Going through the tea gardens attracts the mind for the first time .
On one side a green hill full of jungles , on the other a deep green valley is visible .
Here at times forests and at times tea estates were visible .
All around there was the empire of greenery .
Once I got scared and saw these natural forests , see the plants of tea mixed with humans .
Both used to attract towards themselves .
The more beautiful the forest was the tea gardens spread far and wide .
When the eyes fall on the roads then the whole creation looks magnificent .
The curved mountains , curved mountains , beautiful architecture of churches and houses and dense pine trees are found here .
It was going on for a long time .
If it does not end then it is forest and tea plantations .
At times small settlements were seen .
From a distance a hill looks much more dense than houses , houses , etc .
They were Kurseong .
Staying here at a place we made a program to tour the whole day .
Therefore taking a car we set out on a tour of Kurseong .
Deer Park was first run .
A small garden is surrounded by huge forests on all the four sides .
To reach up to Deer Park it was necessary to leave the vehicle very low .
Despite Kurseong being full of beauty now has not become famous as a tourist place .
While the city is very good and clean .
Despite there being no way out the joy of reaching till the deer park surrounded by forests and having joy in climbing paths through bushes of smoke gives us the pleasure .
The next place was the Eagle Crag .
On the other side of this city is a point located at a height .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to jump and live from here .
At present there is a park and hotel here .
There is a dome like dome here , from the height of which the whole city looks beautiful .
In the tea gardens nearby the women were made to cut tea leaves with a lot of speed , wearing caps on the back .
There is a museum outside Kurseong city but on that day we could not go there because it was very necessary to travel in the clear environment of tea plantations .
It was decided to visit Darjeeling the next day .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was a big worry that if such a rain continues , then how would we travel ?
But it was a good coincidence that after reaching Rock Garden we kept on enjoying the cool breeze .
This park is extremely attractive place with stones , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
On going a little ahead from here we got to see the Ganges surrounded by hills .
Here the beauty of the waterfalls located in the rocks is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we found that among the waterfalls of Stone - Stone strips here the waterfalls is very beautiful , while in Ganga Maiya the fairy earth is filled with rocks .
Both these places are situated very below the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw Batasia loop in Darjeeling rising up with the help of the train .
From here on the basis of binoculars the whole of Darjeeling and the city can be seen .
The climate was clear till now .
But as we turned towards the monastery , we did n't know where it was and started to look like a spoon .
In the evening a plan to tour and shop at the mall road was made .
In the tour of Darjeeling the toy train enhances the beauty of the train .
The toy train from Darjeeling to Ghum and from Dhum to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in the Mirik lake here and a little break in the park .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath market through the same route , where swatters made of hand by Nepali artists are found .
There is also an arrangement to go to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong though is a city of Darjeeling district but its color is different .
There is no greenery of tea estates here but forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot of Kalimpong is - Lavaan and Lolegaon , which are full of jungles and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to visit Darjeeling in the shadow of cold but had bound us with the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling .
A small journey of my present was very attractive and thrilling .
This journey was neither of foreign countries nor of Rajasthan , but very near to Jaipur .
Tourism in itself is an attractive subject in which sometimes journey attracts towards itself , sometimes some special place , ship of water or some royal train or some city like Pink City or Lake Palace in Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people get attracted to it .
The place I am talking about has been prepared only four and a half years ago but with the preparation that place has come here it has really done the welfare of the forest .
Not only for the people going there but also for the residents there .
My guide changes the words ' Ram Babu Minar ' in my ears . Saheb could not even imagine that we can stay in the jungle before this .
Fifty percent of staff is in this very region .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work in the heritage hotel .
The resident of Ajbgadh Rambabu used to work in Jaipur before this and now in this unique royal style in the Aman Bagh .
He brought a new color to walk on his own .
Sahiba is the style of Aman Bagh .
Nobody talks to you there in English .
Aman Bagh is in fact a picnic spot with peace loving and equal facilities .
The garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it will also introduce itself to the surrounding area .
In the royal style of Rajasthan many among the people spending holidays the tour of Bhandaard etc . go far and go to Kashi , some of the residents of Jaipur had spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi had called me there with her mind but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he had reached Bhangarh by his own step .
This time when suddenly I reached there with my foreign guests then I felt that if people want to spend a good holidays in less time then they must go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is one among those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in one hundred and twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Aman Bagh attracts you .
The way you come in , the way you are welcomed it seems as if attention is paid to the divine peace here .
Along with making malikholia in mangat it is said that with malikholia mantras are given live pronunciation .
We had reached after evening and decided to kill that garden once .
My zekiah is an architect , he said with ease , this is attractive ' .
All the havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
It is everything new but artistic . It was not surprising that Aman Bagh has got the award at present .
The manager made our program clear for morning .
First of all we took a walk with Rambabu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on a narrow street we saw a castle of Ajabgarh on which gradually the rays of the sun were spreading .
We saw dry lakes in which farmers were cultivating .
This year it did not rain but first we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
Such a glimpse of rural life was unique for Jackie .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist sitting in a hall , meditating .
These are innumerous moments .
The practice of leaving the Aman Bagh was also traditional , by giving the food of jaggery and curd , they gave us farewell .
Now we got to know why tourists come here spending so much money .
I have heard that to see the life of the tribes tourists are kept carefully .
Is this right ?
No doubt and not one but many states and tourists also show special interest in it .
This tour is prepared normally for a period of four days to two weeks and during this tourists are taken to different places .
Staying there , eating etc . are also included in it .
In the same way there is an attempt to find such a place where there has not been much development and where there has not been any special effect on the life style of the people and the nature .
That place where old tourist spots etc . are also present .
Apart from this , care is also taken on doing trident key .
Actually the goal of such a tour was to make tourists acquainted with the ways and traditions of that place .
Although this idea seems to be a bit difficult , but such tours are really interesting and gives a different kind of experience .
Just tour has its own fun .
With this despite being with many people you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give more time without interrupting the book of your choice .
Yes , it is important that along with giving less expense and free travel enough time these tours definitely keep the expectation of patience from you .
This is the reason why it is important to keep in mind some things to enjoy these , mainly when you are watching some foreign destinations by the means of a tour .
Look for the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior people of military staff , children etc get discounts on this , while there is an arrangement for giving discounts for both people .
Otherwise , buying a ticket is cheap , therefore in the last moment better than planning for bus tour , do plan a little faster .
In place of two way tickets get the information of round trips .
These are cheap .
Regarding the bags , the rules are very strict , therefore keep in mind the size and weight of the luggage .
Never do this that you will have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or else you will have to pay more fees .
Also get to know the rules of insurance or compensation from tour company .
Carry on bags are good , take them .
Because they sit together in the rock on the top of this seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus during the tour the responsibility of luggage is on its own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During busy season you should pay special attention to this point .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat option will be with you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind whether it is comfortable or not .
If we sit at the back seat in excess , then the commutation of next seat is not possible .
If you have to go to the toilet continuously then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like much obstruction then the seat of the window will be good for you .
Now is the matter of a quarter .
If both of you are in the mind to move then first sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other seat .
If there is not much crowd in the bus , then the plan will be successful .
If the facility of washrooms is available on the bus then while choosing the seat keep this in mind as if it is difficult to sit there after a while .
Make known to the bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus all were asked to go out .
During this do not leave your things on the seat , because they do not take the responsibility of the one who settles after losing .
Where the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time then your place can be met by another person and you will have to wait for the bus .
It is said that in Europe if you do not see Rome then nothing has been seen .

Both the hotels of the Ginger built at a place named Vakand located on the Pune - Bangalore highway are equipped with all the modern facilities .
The neighbor state of Maharashtra Goa is rich with its beautiful sea - shore and various water - sports , which is like a heaven for the tourists , where the tourism of ancient church is easily visible from the magnificence of ancient era .
Located in the capital Panaji of Goa the Ginger Hotel makes this journey of the western coast excellent .
Located here on the way to Goa enjoying cycling , horse - cruise , cool sea - air and the whole of the world famous cuisines the Ginger Hotel is an excellent option .
On seeing the date today the fare for returning from Delhi to Maldives is Rs . 28 thousand .
After this if you stay in Malana then you can get hotels done on a small rent but if you go to any nearby island to enjoy the beauty of Maldives then you will miss it .
C - cruise proves to be beneficial .
In the first week of December Louis cruise started the only sea cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very famous among cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Louis cruise has stopped its service now but there is a chance of its resumption from October .
At least 5850 rupees per person on the ship of Louis cruise you can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at the rate of every night .
That is the rent for one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two adults are old then completely for the child less than 15 years of age .
What more should we do ?
Tea , breakfast , lunch , all are included in the cruise .
With the entertainment of each time .
After reaching the capital Male , you can take enjoyment of the entertainment , activity of Maldives as much as possible - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If suddenly a sea plane is standing in front of you while flying in the big airplanes then you will feel like playing .
But this 12-15-seater aircraft is excellent in the tour of Maldives Ladakh island .
Walking like speed boat from the surface of water sometimes it does not even seem that he is flying in the air .
In the whole journey we can not feel the journey of the normal plane .
Our eyes are constantly looking at the blue water of different shades of Maldives , resorts , islands and coral reefs .
How clean does everyone look .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of them which has 20 planes .
If you want then you can take a flight of around 4 thousand rupees -LRB- every -RRB- for an hour or you can take the whole plane in your custody all day -LRB- just like that of a pocket -RRB- .
If we go to a different island than Male island then it is important to travel by sea plane because this is the only way to travel to different islands .
And this is such a journey that we do not have the desire to end .
Sea plane takes a journey of 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- 18 kilometres in north -RRB- from Maldives of Maldives .
We were in the most ancient and souvenir shop of the capital in the Ahmedabadi market of Male .
All the sellers were listening to the World Climate Conference held in Copenhagen one day before the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed .
To be honest I have not seen any Indian listening to the speeches of the President or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when this question came to the fore of the existence of an incomparable object on this earth then the seriousness of this problem was natural .
Although many people might well understand the meeting between the Cabinet of Maldives in October , but going to Maldives it feels such , if we take out from ourselves in the wrath of the nature then the world will be in awe .
There is something special about the beauty there .
There is not so much of beauty in that tiny country .
After that journey of the market if we return to the port to go back to the cruise , then how much fun is the beauty of the people here .
The water is so clean that in the leeches of the Lampsot fish swimming in the depths of their all colors are seen .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you are able to see clearly in the water of the sea or river near a city of India for some centimetres then you will consider yourself lucky .
The evening spent in Malana while returning from M . . Aquarius was spent two hours in the mind .
The life here is coral rocks -LRB- moong -RRB- .
So much so that on the stones of the tomb you will also find coral rocks .
After listening to the speeches of President Nasheed we were standing outside his reign for some time .
It did not seem like that we are standing outside the residence of one supreme handicraft in the country and there is no security guard at far off places .
We were thrilled after nearing the door of his bungalow , only 50 metres long gardens and fountains were taken out .
Can you think of a leader's house in India
It was also understood that President sometimes walking on foot and passing through the road two houses reach his office ahead .
Everything related to the Maldives was increasing with curiosity .
That is why I used to wait for the next day .
It seemed as if that day would be special .
In the morning a name from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we made a trip to the base of Trans Maldives .
Last evening when Cruise was reaching near Male , we immediately got to know the plane going from there .
We had seen so many pictures of them .
But then it was not known that the next day there would be a chance of roaming around in it .
We had to go to Rangali island a distance of one hundred and five kilometres by Tros Maldives .
The sea plane flying at a height of about 1000 metres was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread over the sea in Maldives .
Such a beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was like a flight stopping the breath from thrill and excitement .
But when we reached the Conrad Resort of Hillton Hotel in Rangali Island it felt as if we have reached in a different world .
In such a world whose relation is not with the outside world .
There was no such relation as to where it was not possible to get beauty and rest .
Can be traveled on foot also or by a battery operated train .
The scene of water from both the sides of the bridge to reach the main island from the port is marvellous .
Now if we are not able to separate ourselves from the surroundings then we have reached such a place which was unparalled .
Several metres down from the rocks while descending in the water below the sea we went to such a room of glass which was in water .
Our room was a dining room at that time .
Across the globe we were able to see rare small fish , coral reef , snorkeling and scuba diving from the sea .
The idea of eating there sitting on the tables was completely thrilling .
The expense to see the sea coming from Male on this island and taking lunch under the water is 47 thousand rupees .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to leave our passport in water .
But it was known that this was not possible .
With a heavy heart he returned back with this hope that he will come back to this place soon .
I have been trying to get away from Delhi for several days but due to busyness of work they are not able to .
From childhood was the interest of forest life , then thought that during this time Jim Corbett should not be visited .
This was the second biking expedition in Ladakh in 2006 after the trekking expedition to Pegong lake near Khardungla .
In the afternoon of 27 July we set out from Delhi for Jim Corbett but the enthusiasm with which we started , that too with thunderstorms .
The journey from Hapur to Gajraula was really tiring .
Wash from the top and bad paths in front .
Many a times it seemed as if it had fallen .
How to reach Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Anyway we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near the park which we had already registered .
That day there was no special program , despite cold we went to roam on the bank of Kosi first .
After spending two - three hours there we went to see the Corbett museum situated near the Dhangdi gate for a very long time .
From there we went out to roam Ramnagar down .
It was very late in the evening while returning .
While leaving Delhi it was decided that the lions roaming in the jungle will definitely be seen so that all night in my dream I got to see lions .
In the darkness of the night I suddenly got to hear the sound of a thunderbolt and after that the dogs began to roam which have not yet stopped for two hours .
Initially Kaldungi and Carbet waterfalls had become worth seeing .
Kalatungi is 30 kilometres away while Carbet fall is on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kalatung where some important items related to his personal life are kept .
It was half past twelve till return .
Kalatungi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village itself .
On reaching the resort Safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It is said that they have arranged for the sight-seeing in Bijrani at one number .
On being asked about one number it was said that there is more greenery and tigers come here for protection from cold .
On reaching Bijrani a guide was given which takes two and a half rupees to roam four hours .
We left for the forest inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
We saw two twig elephants inside which had long teeth .
I did a lot of photography .
During this time the guide started tracking the tiger .
The guide said that there are approximately 150 tigers in the park out of which some have died .
At some places we also saw the hoofs of his claws but I was grieved because of not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
The tail of a tiger was filled in my head .
Then I remembered one of my friends of Haldi .
I gave him a similar call .
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
He asked whether the tiger was seen or not .
That word of it hit like a arrow .
I spoke slowly , no .
There was no permission to take bike on the park .
Someone has told us that you have to take a ride to go inside .
