Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
Sindh on one side and Gujarat on the other side therefore there is also a mixture of both in language .
This is called Kutchi .
As such this is ' dialect ' , it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kutchi then you have to write Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where many times the earthquake has come and the entire city has been destroyed .
The monument of Jaisalmer near Anjar is near .
The story of Jaisalmer - Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the same route then we will have to take a full month 's leave and schools will open in Mumbai as well .
So what to do . Now we will travel by train to the fast buses of Gujarat .
A small train of metre gauge will reach Rajkot from Bhuj .
From there a small train will reach Ahmadabad towards metre gauge and will reach Mumbai through broad gauge train .
The tourism industry considered the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through a bad phase these days .
Due to commercial recession and the increasing terrorist threats in South Asia the tourism business has been deeply shocked .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country has decreased .
The statistics released by the Rajasthan Government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased to more than 10 percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to the statistics the number of national tourists has decreased by 9 . 87 percent and number of foreign tourists has decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried regarding this situation .
The director of Rajputana holiday maker Sanjay Kaushik says that terrorist incidents and terrorist incidents have adversely affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop a strong base of tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also come down by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
The number of foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan is maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The recent years have been excellent for Rajasthan with the point of tourism .
After 2008 this is the first time that a decrease has occurred in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
Something new is happening from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , havelis , forts , havelis , forests , everything is very old to cherish tourists .
In the tourism sector the matter of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism all the governments do a lot but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time the incidents of rape and molestation along with foreign tourists in Rajasthan have also taken place at the international level .
Years before Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism to the state but it has remained confined only on papers .
One example of the success of Rajasthan Government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
The Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 with the purpose of inviting tourism and developing the basic infrastructure of tourism .
This corporation provides the facility of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc . to tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight Cafeteria , three travellers , one Transport Unit , two Train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the condition of this corporation has remained very narrow since many years .
The loss of RTDC remained 185 lakh in 2008-09 which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009-10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is this that in the last five years even 40 percent of their hotels could not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also giving it big loss .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There was no attraction of the tourists towards this train .
Even after reducing the fare it was not able to attract the tourists .
Similarly in recent years a reduction has been seen in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in the tourist village formed by the RTDC there were 398 foreign tourists staying , at the same time this number had reduced to 217 .
The surprising thing about RTDC is that there is no dearth of attractions of tourists towards Palace on Wheels .
This train is continuously giving benefits .
Last year RTDC had received a benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this train .
With this decline in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If someone has the desire to do something in the heart then he can produce gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has proved it to be true while settling the modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain range of Sahyadri .
The one who had seen those dreams during the day one gets to see happiness in his eyes .
This joy of theirs was also seen while inaugurating the private airport of Amby Valley .
The work of Amby Valley started and today Amby Valley has become successful in making its place in the form of an excellent city .
In this city spread over 10 , 000 acres only 9 % land has been provided with hotels , houses and other facilities .
91 % land has been provided with trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities .

Initially industrialists and residents bought their residence here as a holiday home but now they have made it their first home and for working from here they travel to Mumbai .
Behind Amby Valley is Korigarh fort which provides beauty to this region .
In the western Siang district the ruins of Leikawali are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found in the excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple a lot of excavation of lotus and deities has taken place which is mostly in the dilapidated condition .
Malini Than is an important place in this area .
On this spot a Dussehra statue of Devi Durga has been found .
Behind the naming of this statue and place many sweet stories and old legends are popular among the people here .
The ruins of Devavali are still singing the legends of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamareshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and Puranas the description of the magnificence of Tamareshwari Devi is found .
During the reign of Chetiya kings this goddess was recognized far and wide in the north - eastern hills .
People of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
The sacrifice of the human beings used to be done here , which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins are found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishma city which is situated in the middle of the Dibang and Dibang rivers here .
According to the legends here this place is very old , where King Bhishma used to rule once .
Brahmkund is situated in the lower part of Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Tribals like Digha , Minakshi etc . here guide the tourists .
These people themselves have great faith in this Kund .
Near only to Brahmakund is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far come here .
Apart from the above mentioned ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal Pradesh the ruins of Roing in Dibang Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The relics of the ponds near Roing are still telling their stories .
Surrounded on all the four sides of the bathing ghat , concrete steps and a pond all around and the ruins of wide roads are still singing praises of their ancient grandeur .
We reach Zero in four hours through jeep from North Lakhimpur city of upper Assam .
This place is the main center of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place captures the heart of viewers .
This is the same pleasant place where there are waves .
It takes several days to reach here before the jeep arrives .
On reaching here the views of the high cedar trees , beautiful premoraj , volat , wild current , strawberry and rasberries enhance the joy of the people .
Apple and cardamom are grown here much .
There is a valley spread at a height of approximately 1524 metres till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the terrorists .
Due to its untiring hard work people have made it their heaven .
Rice farming is done here a lot .
This place is the store of rice .
This ten mile long plateau is the living example of their hard work and the skill of farming .
The requirement of irrigation is fulfilled with the Kali Nadi .
The trees of pine add a four folds to the beauty of this valley .
In the middle of the snow laden ranges of the left hand in the eyes , there is a light redness emerging from the sky on the white sky .
The good cough in the air is cold .
Along with the chill occurring in the environment also there is a feeling of humidity .
The sound of garbage from the beneath the feet is seen on the layers made on the wooden floor .
There is humidity in the environment and the darkness before sunrise is not visible much .
Tablets are left on the redness of the eyes in the east .
There is a desire to sit on a bench in the balcony .
On putting hand the smooth layer of the ribs shrivel with the sound of lightish -LRB- mild ray -RRB- and the hand separates from the sensation of cold .
Thousands of miles away from his country , in this small village based in the middle of these mountains laden with snow of the Switzerland this is the first experience in living .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this spent most of the time around Geneva or elsewhere .
The dense population settled in the valley on both the sides of the narrow Balkhand river is spread much above the slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland on both the sides of which are settled many small and big cities .
The parallel highway of Ron river and noise trains on it have begun to give clear .
The distance of 300 kms and the half way journey from car to half an hour is from car and along with the parallel to Geneva lake and half an hour along with the Ron river coming from the east is called the Geneva lake which is called France -LRB- Lake -RRB- .
Geneva city is settled at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake again becomes the river and goes towards the west .
On the right side near the lake are mountain ranges of Dhaval , skycraping and Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke we move from the left side on the mountainous way towards the north leaving this highway .
Because of the slope of the hill being south the sun of ascending is giving a lot of sunlight to all the wings .
The amount of snow equivalent to the valley is less here - almost equal to no .
As we move towards a height the density of snow starts increasing .
There is no special coolness in the air due to clear sky and shining sun despite snow depositing on both the sides of the road .
After covering a journey of about 20 kms on this circular mountainous road we reach a small village named Thalassery in an hour .
The sloping roofs of the rocks are large , sloping bungalows of wood in the entire way .
In the basement that is built with cement concrete of this bungalow is the room for controlling essential services like electricity , water , loads etc . along with parking of cars .
Well known for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of the wine making of grapes .
37 % land of the whole of Canton is cultivated in grapes .
In the villages settled on both the sides of the Ron valley the gardens of grapes give a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking orchards of grapes , making them roam around , taking rest in villages there at night and tasting wine brought in the factories of grape wine is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Agra in 12th century there is a very big museum of grape wine in which to see foreign tourists have to book in advance .
Once we crossed the same forest once again with dawanal .
The mind becomes even more convulsed with the pricking questions of the children throughout the way up to three - four kms .
At every turn dramatic and delightful change comes from the scene .
Right in front , on the slope above the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful herd of houses is settled .
On the plain slope from above the village people are skiing in the snow .
The dense forest of Makad deodar is spread on the summit of the mountain above the skiing slop .
There is heavy snowfall all around .
The roofs of the houses of the villages are shining because of the direct rays of the sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also the same silence is spread .
All around from the peak of the mountain to the valley the kingdom of Dhauladhar .
Within next five minutes we reach a large round circle in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is ' Lakkarbad ' .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Leukrabad is about 1500 .
The number of tourists , artists and health workers coming here can be estimated with the fact that there are 1700 apartments with a capacity of 6900 beds and 1500 shelters for 28 hotels , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
65 drops of hot water have been found in Lukobad till now .
Out of these 40 lac litres of water which is taken daily till 510 o'clock in the whole of the water settlement , is brought to the thermal pool of small and big 30 o'clock made at places , some are inside five star hotels and according to the pockets of people of various categories .
On reaching the village one feels very hot .
In the scorching sun the thick layer of snow is shining above the roof of the house .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the safest places in Switzerland in the form of a heritage of national importance .
It was told in Darjeeling only that Sikkim can go for only Sikkim 's taxis , that is why there is no checking .
The journey is on , the region is different , but the mountain is the same , tree is the same , all the winds are the same .
Chest moisture is the same on the whole body .
In the season of monsoon the beauty of rhythmic lights is here .
The plan to visit Darjeeling is permanent . First of all the decisions were taken for the screening of Karsiyang .
Karsyang is a small town of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunshine forests .
Famous for tea production .
If you move from Siliguri to Darjeeling , then at the beginning the tea garden welcomes those who move towards themselves while smiling .
Walking amidst the tea gardens from a road takes the pleasure of the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with jungles and on the other side hagiri is eaten .
Here sometimes forests and tea estates were visible .
There was an empire of greenery all around .
Once I went to see these natural jungles or the tea plants planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The tea gardens spread till far and wide are equally beautiful forests .
If we look at the road ways then it seems very amazing .
The serpentine verandahs of serpentine and vermilion paths were passing through .
Time was also passing .
If not passing then forests and tea estates .
Sometimes a small settlement could be seen .
From a distance only a hill looks very dense from house to house .
This was Karsiyang .
Staying here at one place we made a program to roam all day .
Therefore taking a car we set out on a tour of Karsyang .
Deer Park was first built .
A small garden is surrounded by huge forests all around .
To reach the above mentioned climb i . . deer park the vehicle had to leave behind a lot .
Despite Karsiyang being enchanted with beauty you have not yet got the status of development in the form of a tourist spot .
However , the city is quite good and clean .
Despite the road being deserted . the desire to reach Deer Park surrounded by forests and the joy of climbing amidst trees of shrubs was giving us courage .
The next place was the Sea Eagle Crag .
This is a point located at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the period of the British , lovers used to give up their lives by jumping here .
Now this is a park and restaurant .
There is a straight line here , from whose height the view of the whole city is spectacular .
In the tea gardens near the women were engaged in tea - breaking with their backs at a very fast pace .
There is a museum outside the Karsyang city but that day we could not go there because it seemed more necessary to tour the uninhabited environment of the tea estates .
The next day was scheduled to visit Darjeeling .
It was an adventurous experience in itself , but was very worried about how would we roam if we keep on raining like this .
But the conjugation was very good that by reaching Rock Garden we roamed around taking enjoyment of sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more pleasant .
On moving a little more down from here we found the Ganges surrounded by hills .
The scene of a waterfall falling from a height of 1500 metres above the sea level attracts tourists from all over the world towards itself .
In Rock Garden we found that there is a spring splendor in the empire of rocks and then the magical world of waterfalls in Ganga - Maya mountain .
Both of these places are located amidst the hills of Darjeeling a lot .
We saw 22 loops in Darjeeling lifting up on the train .
From here the whole of the hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen through binoculars .
The mood of the weather was clear till now .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , to get down where he was and to shake it .
In the evening a plan to walk and shop at Mall Road was made .
In the tour of Darjeeling the toy trains spend four times in the journey .
The journey of the toy train from Darjeeling to Dhuma and Darjeeling is special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake here and Alviram in the garden here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath market from this route , where switzers made of Nepali artists are found .
There is also an arrangement to go to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong though is a city of Darjeeling district but its color is different .
Here there is no greenery of tea gardens but the movement of forest - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Bala and Lolegaon , which is full of forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to visit Darjeeling the shadow of cold , but the tea gardens spread till Siliguri and Darjeeling have tied me with them .
My recent little trip was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not of foreign origin nor of Rajasthan but of very close to Jaipur .
Tourism in itself is an interesting subject in which sometimes journey draws attention towards itself , then at some special place , ship of water or any royal train or city like Pink City or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of this one special attraction people get attracted to it .
The place I am going to talk about , this bus has been made ready about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that has come here this place has really made request in the jungle .
Not only for the people going there , but also for the people staying there .
My guide echoes the words of Ram Babu Meena in my ears . Sir , before this we could not even think that we could live like this in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff is of this very area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people could not find work in the heritage hotel .
Ajabgadh resident Rambabu used to work in Jaipur before this and now in this unique royal style ` Aman Bagh ' .
He has changed his speaking into a new color .
Sahib ' is the style of Aman Bagh .
Nobody calls you English in there .
Aman Bagh is in fact a tourist spot with peace loving and all pleasant facilities .
That garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also makes your identity available in the surrounding areas .
Among the people spending holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan many people must have visited Bhangarh of the past why go away , even among the people of Jaipur , Kuchh has spent some time in that area .
After the opening of the Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad come here .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi had called me there with courage but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh .
This time when suddenly I reached there on the invitation of my foreign guests , then it seemed as if those people who want to spend a good holiday in less time , they must go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left out of those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to roam .
It was constructed in 100 twentieth century .
Its old wall is the witness of those days .
In the shadow of thick trees surrounded by mountains you get to see the first glimpse of Aman Bagh .
As soon as you come in , the way you are welcomed , it seems that here attention has been paid to divine peace .
Along with the bandage of mulberry in the wrist the mantra of magnificence is taken out alive .
We had reached at the evening but we intended to plant that garden once .
Like my hosting , this was so much fun that I could say , this is interesting .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
It is said that on everything new artistically we got the award in Aman Bagh .
The manager fixed our program for morning .
First of all a walk with Rambabu and the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on a narrow like road we saw a fort of Maghgarh on which gradually the sun rays were spreading .
We saw dry lake in which farmers were cultivating .
This year it did not rain but first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
For example the glimpse of rural life was such a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
Early morning I saw a traveller sitting in deep meditation .
This is a million dollar priceless moment .
He also sent us away by feeding us oars and curds with the traditional way of saying goodbye to Aman Bagh .
Now we understood that why come here after spending so much of money .
I have heard that tour packages are kept for traveling .
Is this right ?
No doubt , this happens in not just one state and tourists also show interest in it .
This tour is generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this tourists are taken to different places .
Staying there , eating etc . are also included in it .
This way there is an attempt to explore such places , where there has not been a lot of development and where there has not been any special effect of time on the life style of the nature and people .
Along with this where old tourist spots etc are also present .
Apart from this , attention is also paid on the study of traditional cuisines .
Actually the purpose of such a tour is to make the tourists acquainted with the habits and practices of living in that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to imagine , but such tours are really interesting and gives a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
With this despite being with many people you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time without being disturbed .
Yes , this is definitely so much that along with giving less expense and plenty of time this tour will definitely keep the demands of patience with you .
This is the reason that to enjoy these it is important to keep in mind some things , especially when you are watching through a foreign destination bus tour .
Look for the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior people of the military , children etc get discounts on this , while there is a discount for both the people .
Otherwise , it is cheap to buy tickets in advance , therefore it is better to plan for bus tour in the last moment than before .
Instead of ticketing get information about round trip .
It becomes cheap .
The rules related to the baggage are very strict , therefore get inquisitive about the size and weight of the luggage .
It should not be such that you have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or else you have to pay extra fee .
Also know the rules of insurance or compensation of loss with tour company .
Carry on bags remain good , but let 's go .
Because they get stuck in the racks on the seat .
Also keep in mind that during the tour the responsibility of luggage will be your own while changing the bus .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During busy season you should take special care of it .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat option will be with you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the comfort .
If you will feel more shaking at the back seat then reading at the next seat will not be comfortable .
If you have to take it again and again then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be more disturbed then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now it is a matter of crutches .
If you are in the perimeter of both the weapons , then sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other .
If there is not much crowd in the bus , then planning will be done .
If there is facility of washrooms to eat then take care of this matter as well because it becomes difficult to sit there for a while .
Make identification with bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its disappearance the bus driver does not take responsibility .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time then you can find some new tourist in your place and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .
It is said that if you did not see Rome in Europe then you did not see anything .

There are almost such buildings here in which magnificent fountains are built .

Ginger hotel located here is an excellent option for spending a comfortable day enjoying cycling , river cruise , cold sea winds and world famous cuisines on the roads of Goa .
On seeing today the cheapest return for Maldives is of 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stop at Male then also you can get hotels in less money , but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be small .
Sea cruises prove to be beneficial here only .
In the first week of December Louis cruise from Kochi started the only sea cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very popular in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Louie Cruise has restored its services from now on , but is expected to resume from October .
At least 5850 rupees per person on the ship of Louie Cruise you can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at night .
That is the rent for one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
If two are big then children less than 15 years of age are completely free .
What else would you like .
The fare of cruise include tea - breakfast , meals , all .
Every time the entertainment of the entertainment .
After reaching the capital Male , you can take enjoyment of the entertainment , activity of Maldives as per your pocket - from sea plan ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes if one plane has to stand before you all of a sudden then you will feel like a toy train .
But this tower of 12 - 15 seats is the best in an uninterrupted manner for touring of archipelago like Maldives .
When it gets up in the air running like speed boat on the surface of water then it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not get the experience of flying of ordinary airplanes .
Every time your eyes keep looking down looking at the resort islands and coral island in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
How clean does everything appear .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of them which has twenty sea planes .
If you want then you can take a flight of around Rs . -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or else you can take a complete plan for your day -LRB- condition is full of pockets -RRB- .
As such if you go to an island far from Male island then the ride of sea plane will be necessary because this is the source of traveling between different islands .
And that is such a journey that perhaps you will not feel the end of it .
Sea plane takes a journey of 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in highest island of Maldives -RRB- .
We were in the biggest antique and souvenir shop of the capital in the Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All the salesmen were listening very carefully the speeches delivered by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen .
To say honestly no Indian has been able to see the speeches of President or Prime Minister in such a way .
But when there was a question of the existence of a unique creation of this earth then it was very important to have such seriousness .
Many people might have considered the meeting held under the water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October , but they go to Maldives to take out the wrath of nature with them , then how bad the world will look .
There is something special in the beauty there .
In that small country it does not seem as if such a beautiful place has come .
While returning towards the jetty to its cruise after returning back from the market , when the sight went in the sea water of Barabbas circuit , then it felt as if the people here understood the value of its beauty to a great extent .
The water was so clear that the fish floating in depths of several metres below in the light of the lamppost were clearly visible along with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can also see some centimetres clearly in the water of the sea or river connected with any city of India then you will consider yourself lucky .
While returning on M . . Aquamarine the evening was moving around in the mind two hours in the evening .
coral reef is the life here .
Even on the stones laid on the tombs you will find coral rocks .
Just before listening to the speeches of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not certain that we were ahead of the residence of the best personalities of any country , there was no security personnel till far .
We were enjoying our hands inside the door of his bungalows and lifting our hands only fifty metres away from the garden and the photographs of the garden .
That you can think about the house of any such leader in India .
We also got to know that President sometimes crossing the road on foot only two blocks reach his office ahead .
Everything was surprising about Maldives .
Therefore I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
It seemed that those days were going to be special .
In the morning a boat from Cruise brought us to Airport Island .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives after traversing the ropeway .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near Male then we immediately recognized the Plan .
So many pictures that we had seen were of them .
But then it was not known that the next day he would get a chance to ride there .
From the sea plane of Trans Maldives we will go to Rangali island at a distance of one hundred and five kilometres .
From the sea plane flying at a height of around 1000 meters to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea level were amazing .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a flight stopping the breath from thrill and excitement .
But on Rangali island reaching the corner of Hillton Hotels we felt as if we have reached in some other world .
In such a world , where there was no residence from any outside world .
It was not even so , that it was difficult to get out the beauty or luxury like that from there .
Tour or battery run can also be done at Konark .
On both sides of the bridge while going from Jetti to the main island the scene of Jal Jeevan was marvellous .
Now we could not even make ourselves simple by the nature nearby , we reached such a place , it was timeless .
Descending several metres down the stairs in the sea we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all sides we could see different kinds of small - big fish , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated tables there was in itself a great thrill .
The fare of seeing and launching on this island on a sea plane from Male is only 47 thousand rupees for a man .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to give our passport in water .
But they knew , it was not possible .
With this expectation only from the heart that at some point of time i . . at some point of time i . . till some time i . . at some point it must be brought back .
He was planning to go out of Delhi for several days but due to arrangement of evening this was not possible .
When we wanted to enjoy wildlife in childhood then we thought why did n't we go to Jim Corbett on this .
This was the second bike tour of Ladakh after a bike tour in 2006 ahead of Khardungla pass - up to Pegong lake .
On the morning of 27 December we left from Delhi for Jim Corbett , but the zeal with which the core turned out to be our fast .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tiring .
Cora and bad roads in front from above .
Many times it seemed that now it has fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula in the morning at eight o'clock .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was near the park in Dikuli , which we had booked earlier .
That day there was no special program that despite cold we went to roam on the bank of Kosi first .
After spending two - three hours there the Corbett National Park was established in the 1982 in an area of 199 square kilometres in the Andaman district .
From there we went to tour Ramnagar down .
It turned very late in the evening .
It was decided to set out from Delhi that if the lions roaming in the jungle will definitely be seen then throughout the night in dream I will see lions .
In the midst of the depths of the night I heard a loud scream , and after that the dog gropes started , then they did n't get quiet for two hours .
Therefore the suggestion to travel in Kaladungi and Corbett Falls first came .
Kaladungi is 30 k . . away , while Corbett falls on the fall road .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladung where some special things related to his personal life are kept .
It was half past twelve while returning .
Kaladungi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village itself .
On reaching the resort gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they had made arrangements of boarding in the number one site Bijarani there .
On being asked about number one , it was told that there is more Grasland and during this time tigers come to the other side to escape from cold .
As soon as we reached Bijrani a guide was given , which takes two and a half hundred rupees to turn around for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two basket elephants , which had a long teeth .
I did photography in the royal palace .
In the middle the guide began to trek on the tiger .
Guide said that there are tigers in the park around 150 , of which some have died recently .
At many places we saw his claws also , but I was sad on not getting the view of tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
There was a tiger ride in my mind .
That is why I remembered one of my old friends of Haldwani .
I took him by phone the same way .
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
He asked if he saw the tiger .
His words were astonished as Tirath .
There was no permission to take bike in the park .
Somebody gave us advice that you take a ride inside .
During the journey it came to be known that on being an busy highway near the park often animals get injured or die by collision with vehicles .
