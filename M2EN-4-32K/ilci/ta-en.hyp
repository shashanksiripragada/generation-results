A small garden is surrounded by jungles all around .
The vehicle leaves a lot below to reach from the top .

We came to know that Darjeeling in the winters had tied us here from Siligudi to Darjeeling .
I got a lot of interest and thrill from this small journey .
This journey is not only of foreign countries but also of Rajasthan .
Tourism on its own is a matter of fact , when the traveling comes towards itself then it continuously happens to be one important place , water ship or some train or some city like Rojanagar , or the labyrinth of Udaipur .
People are attracted towards it due to some special attraction .
The place which I am talking about was built about four and a half years ago , in reality this place has the shape of a jungle .
Not only to go there but also to stay there .
In my ears the words of my chaff , Rambabu , sound of the fish is echoing , although before this we could not even imagine that if we had been able to stay here in the forest then we would have been able to stay here for a while .
50 percent workers are in this area .
Tourists coming here suddenly do not get employment in heritage hotels .
The natives of Ajabgadh , Rambabu did the work of Jaipur before this and now in this unique and marvellous anaesthetic garden .
He gave a new form by talking to himself .
Sahib is the estimate of Aman Garden .
There no one even calls you in English .
Aman Bagh is actually a peaceful place and tourist spot with all the best facilities .
This garden has its own history and the most important thing is that it introduces its nearby areas as well .
To spend holidays in the best statistics of Rajasthan the number of people roaming around in the forests of Banana , why should go far , only a few people from Jaipur had spent their night in this area .
After the opening of the Aman Park many people from the country and abroad come here .
I remember that night when Sapno Asmi called me eagerly but I could not go .
It is a unique experience if they have come to Bangkok on their own way .
This time suddenly on the invitation of his foreign guests I felt that these people want to spend a good holiday in the shortest possible time so that the Aman Garden could be taken .
This garden is a separate garden conserved in the seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to go for hunting .
Its construction was done in the 19th - 20th century .
Its old wall is the witness of those days .
Under the shade of dense trees and bushes surrounded by hills , the Aman Garden can mesmerize itself in the first part .
The way you are coming inside you will be welcomed in the same way as it is said that you can enjoy the peaceful environment here .
The magnificence of Mangala can be seen very fast along with binding the wrist .
We reached Dal Lake in the evening and planned a walk in the park .
My guest house Jaiki is very decorated and immediately talked to me , that is why it was interesting .
Attracted by all the palaces and palaces Laying is also included .
Everything is beautiful .
There is no surprise to receive the award in the Aman Estate because everything is modern , artistic .
The manager gave our program for the morning .
First of all we went on a walk with Babu and then on a trip to Bangkok through a jeep .
On reaching at the narrow pass we saw the fort of Ajmer on which the sun was rising gradually .
On looking at the dry lake the farmer was planting in it .
This year because of no rains , first time saw tobacco .
The rural life of Jokok was an amazing experience in this regard .
After that we went to Bangkok through a jeep .
I saw a tourist spot in the morning , specially in the morning .
These are priceless moments worth a million dollars .
There was a time when only the wanderer shepherds of the tribe named ' Gaddi ' used to camp here .
Now it has come to be known as the tourist who spent so much of the money here .
I was told that a tourist group has been formed to see the life of a tribal .
Is this right ?
Certainly this can be seen in some states and tourism has a special interest in it .
This tour is organised normally for 4 days to 2 weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
How to eat there ?
This way an attempt is made to do such exercises where there is not much growth and there is no significant improvement in the life style of the people and nature .
At the same time there are also old tourist spots .
In addition to this one also gets to pay attention to treatment of rheumatism .
In fact for such tourists the lifestyle and tradition of that place can be seen directly .
Even then it is a bit difficult to imagine , but such tourism shows interest in visiting and gives a different kind of experience .
It 's a different fun altogether .
Even if the crowd of people is there then you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this you can also take more time to read your favorite book in this journey .
Yes , along with cheap and all time giving peace to the mind this journey will definitely give us satisfaction .
To celebrate this it is important to keep in mind some special point of time when you will be watching any foreign destination from the bus route .
Before taking a ticket get a check up done of the best tea .
There is an amusement park made for both the people here who get tickets for the kids and those who do not get tickets .
In the same way it is better to buy the ticket of reservation so that the arrangement of tourism can be done in the last train in the bus terminus only then make arrangements beforehand .
Instead of traveling tell them about round trips .
The cost of morning also reduces .
It is very important to carry things , that is why it is important to take care of things like obesity and weight .
You leave some of your things in terminology or else fill electron .
At the same time get the enjoyment of insurance or loss from tourism team .
Carry on boxes will be comfortable .
Because it can be applied on the rock above the seat .
During tourism while passing through bus the responsibility of transportation is on your own .
Wherever you find a bus , go ahead an hour before that time .
If you are in busy season then keep this thing in the main season .
As a matter of fact the sooner you go the better seat arrangement is near you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the convenience .
Take the upper part of the back also but the front seat is not comfortable .
If you have to urinate again and again then take a short nap then if you do not want to get too much trouble then it will be better for you to sit near the door .
Now this is a tactical thing .
If you are sitting on a seat sitting on both sides then first sit on the seat of the corner and keep your pocket on the other side .
Therefore if there is not much crowd in the market then your arrangement is successful .
Hence if you have the facility of vasectomy then while selecting the ticket keep this thing in mind that it is difficult to sit there after some time .
Introduce the bus driver and the conductor .
This way you will get a lot of information .
Everybody comes out while cleaning the market .
At this time do not keep your normalness on seat because if it is lost then the prospective person would not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops , return back in time .
If you do n't go on time then you will be able to see a new tourist in your place and you will have to wait for another bus .

Although due to some reasons Louis cruise has now dropped its job , but it is expected to start later in October .
You can go to Maldives on a small amount of Rs . 5850 per person .
That is , for three days a person should make the fare of not less than 18 thousand rupees .
If there are two more elderly people then for children less than 15 years it is completely free .
And what to do.
Tea , buttermilk should be eaten during day only .
Every time , with happiness .
On reaching the capital evening you can take the pleasure of the adventurous games of Maldives from the jeep area to the sea shore .
If you are roaming around in big airplanes then suddenly it appears as if a plane has come in front of you .
But this train with 12 - 15 seats is the best for a tour of Orchid Palace like Maldives -LRB- island group -RRB- .
We did n't come to know when the speed of moving in the lower part of the water was like that of a boat .
While traveling in it you do not feel like flying in airplanes .
Each time you see under the window , below the separate sets of Maldives the view of fresh water of the island and coral islands .
How many companies are there in C . .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Transmal is the best place in this island which has sea plane nearby .
If you want then you can take a flight of around 4000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- for an hour or the whole plane you can hire you for the entire day .
If you are going to the island with great fanfare from Maldives then traveling to sea is necessary because traveling between different islands is easy .
And this is such a journey that if you feel scared of this danger then do not travel in that .
C . Blair is at a distance of 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres in the Maldives of Maldives .
We were in the most innate and Soviet - market of the capital of Agamkuan in Maldives .
All the salesmen are very carefully listening to the speeches given by the President of Maldives Muhammad Nainitaal one day before in the commutation of world temperature .
I am confident that even a Indian will not listen to the speeches of President or Prime Minister in this regard .
But when there is a challenge in the direction of a big creation of this earth then this fear is also very important .
Some people know very well the engravings of the water by going inside the Maldives in October because the nature ' s wrath is on them so much that the world becomes poorer than we .
Some specialities are there in the beauty there .
There is no such beautiful monument in that small country .
After wandering in the market they return towards their guru to get their gurus and after that they must eat the food of the sea by keeping an eye on the roads , because the people here know this grand border .
Under the light of Lamps Bongt fishes swimming in the depths of a few metres used to show all their colors .
This was a sea area which was attached to the city once .
If you are able to see the river connecting with any of the cities of India or if you are able to see some centimetres of sea water then you will be able to take the pleasure of yourself .
In the evening while returning to M . . A . . . on Maldives we started strolling for 2 hours in Jagnean .
The life here is coronary -LRB- flower -RRB- .
Till now you will get to see stones and pimples which appear on the gallows .
To hear the speeches of President Nasheed we were sitting on a still closed moat of a few governments .
We were at some distance from the top of the most important post of a country where there was no security at all because we could not believe it .
We were thrilled after nearing some 50 metres through garden and pathways .
Can you imagine this by taking in a common head 's house in India ?
It is said that the President had come to his office at the front of two blocks running on the road since time immemorial .
In the matter of Maldives every thing has been described here and there .
That is why I had the expectation of patience the next day .
This day was very special in the form of dance , music and dance .
In the morning a boat from Guruji reached till Air Force Jalland .
From there we reached to the place of Tros Maldive by roaming around in the runway .
Later in the evening we got to know that Guruji was coming out of the Maldives and we got to know him immediately .
We were looking at his so many pictures .
But then there was no doubt that the next day there would be a chance of looking at him .
We reached at a distance of 500 k . . from Trongsa Maldives by sea plane .
From the sea plane flying at a height of approximately 1000 metres the canyon could not be forgotten in the hundreds of rendezvous and coral islands spread in the sea level .
This beautiful water is not available anywhere .
This is a journey of providing breath with thrill and excitement .
But just as we reached on the hill resort of ` Hillton Hollows ' and ` Konrad Resort ' of Hong Kong island we felt as if we have come to some other world .
In such a world , outside there was no relation with any other world .
It was difficult to get out a beautiful and comfortable life there .
One can go to Gonorrhoea on foot or a ride of a battery run .
On both sides of the bridge while going till the main island from Jetties was marvellous for life .
Now with the nature near us we could not be natural , we could not even imagine ourselves .
We went to the glass room while descending down the sea for several metres through the steps which was under the water .
That was half in fact a meal , a room .
On every side through mirror we can view unique types of fishes , corals , skiing and scuba diving .
The food sitting on the decorated tables made the imagination of themselves .
The rent to see this island on sea plane from Male is 47 thousand rupees per person for drinking under water .
One does not feel like returning from there .
We were ready to float our pons on the water .
We know it's not going to happen.
We returned with the same expectation from our heart that at some point of time fortune will definitely bring us .
For a long time we were planning to go from Delhi to Jolly Grant , but it did n't happen because of being busy in the work .
We thought why did n't we go to Jim Corbett this time when there was a desire of wild animals from children .
In 2006 after trekking from Kardukla near and a little distance from Yakong lake this was another picnic spot .
In the morning of 27 December we set out from Delhi for Jim Corbett but along with that excitement and vagabondship had reduced our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula is really tiring .
The snow from above and the difficult road from above .
It was appearing several times when we would fall .
We reached Karzurola one way in the morning at 8 o'clock .
We arrived at Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres away from Ramnagar .
We were at a distance of 12 kilometres from the resort park which we had already registered .
Since there is no important program in the day , after getting cold we went to the bank of Kosi first .
After two - three hours we went to the Carpet Museum , which was very difficult at a distance of 2 k . . from the gate .
From there we went to see Ramnagar situated at a distance of 12 kilometres .
It was time for the evening time to return .
We left for Delhi determined that by looking at the tiger released from the jungle the tiger will be found in dreams for the entire night .
In the middle of the night I heard a loud noise then the dogs did n't stand till two hours starting from jumping .
Therefore first come on the way to Kaladung and Carpet waterfalls .
There was a museum of Jim Corbett , where some objects related to personal life were kept .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett -LRB- G . . -RRB- in Kaladunggi .
On returning it was half past one hour .
Kaldung is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village itself .
On reaching the hotel Safari gypsy was waiting for our arrival .
He told us that there is arrangement of touring in the first Saint Bijrani of that place .
When we asked about the number one then there was so much of the tiger coming towards that side so that it could be saved from cold .
On reaching Bijarala we got a guide and bought an hundred fifty rupees for an hour tour of four hours .
We went out to go in the middle of the forest .
We saw several species of deer and baboons there .
We saw the elephants with two petals moving in it , they had long teeth .
I kept on watching the film .
In the middle of it the guide began to ride on Fili .
It is said that there are about 150 tigers in the park in which some of them have died in the same year .
At many places we saw its footprints , but it was not possible to see tiger that I felt sorry .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
There was no dearth of tigers in my mind .
Then I remembered an old friend of mine of Haldwani .
I've phoned him.
I told him I was in Carbet.
He asked if he had seen the tiger .
His word ran like an arrow .
I didn't slow down.
There is no permission to take bike to the park .
One told us that to go inside take a ride .
