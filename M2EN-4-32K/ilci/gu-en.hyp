Its language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
Sindhu on one side of Kutch and on the other side of Gujarat on the other side there is a mix of both in language .
This is called Kutchi .
As such this is a saying that it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kutchi then you have to write Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where many times the earthquake has taken place and the entire city has been destroyed .
The monument of Jaisalmer - Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisalmer - Toral is very interesting .

Considered as the main base of the economy of Rajasthan , the tourism industry is going through bad times these days .
Due to the increasing terrorist threat to the global recession and South Asia the tourism industry has suffered a lot .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country has been decreased to a great extent during these days .
The latest statistics released by the Rajasthan Government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased to more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics the number of national tourists decreased by 9 . 87 percent and number of foreign tourists decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included , whereas in 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 10 lakh 77 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried regarding this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik the director of Holiday Homemakers of Rajputs says that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have adversely affected the tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop our strong base for tourism .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
21 percent tourists from the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
French tourists are the most among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan .
After this the tourists of Germany , England , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism the recent years have been the best for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first occasion that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
Nothing new is happening with regard to tourism .
Ranthambhore , Haveli , Fort , Wawan Forest are all old for serving the tourists .
In the tourism sector the matter of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism does not end in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
Here along with the foreign women tourists the incidents of rape and molestation have also taken place in the recent years in Rajasthan on a global level by illuminating the image of this state .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry many years ago but it has remained confined to papers only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan Government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the base of tourism , the Rajasthan Government had established RTDC in 1987 .
This corporation provides the facility of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc . to tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 bundles , 8 Cafeteria , three passers-by , one transport unit and two train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the condition of this corporation has changed very badly for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was estimated to be 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is this that in the last five years even 40 percent of their hotels have not been there .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also making it extremely difficult .
Royal Rajasthan of Wheels is one of them .
This could not be an attraction of the tourists towards the railway .
Even after reducing the fare these tourists could not get attracted to it .
Similarly in recent years a reduction has been seen in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in the tourist village formed by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists had stayed there this number decreased to 217 this year .
It is a matter of satisfaction for RTDC that there is no dearth of tourist attractions of Palace on Wheels i . . the Royal train .
This railway is providing continuous benefit .
Last year an advantage of 9 . crore rupees was received by RTDC by this train .
Located in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of worry in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .

The pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The gaze would be focussed there only in the redness of the sky on the horizon in the middle of the snow laden mountain range of the left hand .
There is such a coldness in air .
Along with the cooling effect the feeling of moisture is also felt .
The thick layer of snow covered with wood is visible from the noise of garbage and garbage under the feet .
One could not see anything even more because of the humidity filled atmosphere here and the fog engulfed before sunrise .
Eyes become stable on the redness of the east .
One feels like sitting on a wooden board facing east or north direction .
With the very touch of hands the sticky thick cloth gets stuck to the normal garbage and the hands get separated from the shock by the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from his country , this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village amidst these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third trip to Switzerland .
Before this had spent a lot of time , living or walking around .
The dense population settled on both the sides of small flowing river and in the valley is spread up to a great extent on the normal slopes .
This is the mouth of the main river of Switzerland which is situated on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The highway adjacent to Ron river and the cars running on it start becoming visible clearly .
The distance of 300 kilometres and the journey of two and a half hours from car is half an hour , then along with the parallel and half Roan river of Geneva lake along with the city named Ronti Monastery which is called the Jinova lake in French .
Geneva city is situated on the western part of this lake , 100 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide .
From there the lake becomes again river and goes towards the west .
On the left side is the Parwal , Gaganchhubi Alps mountain range on the right side .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Leuk , on the left side we go to the mountainous way towards the north leaving this highway .
Because of the slope of the mountain being south its sun is giving full heat to all the corners of the afternoon .
The quantity of snow is less here in comparison to the valley .
As we move towards height the density of snow starts increasing .
There is no special cold in the air due to clear sky and shining sun despite the accumulation of such snow on both sides of the road .
Complete it in half an hour on this circular mountainous road , we reach a small village named Thalassery .
Shelley is a big multi-storied bungalow of roof top , completely made of wood .
In Bhangra built with the cement concrete of the three storied bungalows there are rooms for the maintenance of essential services like electricity , water , Dhobighat etc . along with the parking of cars .
Valiya is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of producing wine in grapes .
37 % landmass of the whole of the canteen is cultivated in raisins .
The orchards of grapes in the villages settled on both the sides of Ron Valley provides a magnificent expanse to the beauty there .
To move till the orchards of grapes , to rest in the villages there at night and to make wine in the factories located here is an inseparable part of the tourism business here .
In a small village named Agra in the 12th century there is a very big museum of grape wine in a fort built in which foreign tourists have to register .
Once again we started walking in the middle of that very forest .
The mind becomes very upset by the questions being asked to children on the whole of the road for three - four kilometers .
On a sudden , there is a dramatic and delightful change from the scenery .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in the snow on flat slopes from above the village .
There is dense forest of cedar from the slope of skiing to the summit of the mountain .
There is a lot of snow lying all around .
The roofs of houses of villages are glittering due to the direct rays of the sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Peace is spread here also .
The empire of white snow was all around from the peaks of the mountains to the depths .
Within next five minutes we reach a big circle in the middle of that village .
The name of the town is Lakkarbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Lucknow is about 1500 .

The name of Albenin is of this village .

It was told in Darjeeling only that Sikkim can go only for Sikkim 's taxis , that is why there is no investigation .
The journey is on , the state is second , but the mountain is the same , tree is the same , beautiful winds are the same .
The moisture present in the whole body is the same .
In the season of monsoon the light of blue color is the same .
On the completion of the project of Darjeeling the decision to see Karsong was taken for the first time .
Karsyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , complete with forest of incense sticks .
Famous for excellent tea production .
Going from Siligudi to Darjeeling , at the beginning the tea gardens welcome you towards themselves .
Passing through the road in the middle of the tea garden hypnotises the mind for the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with jungles , on the other side deep green valleys .
At some places forest and tea estates are visible here and there .
There was a empire of greenery all around .
Once I got into trouble , look at these natural forests that the tea plants planted by man should be planted .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful the forest was , the more beautiful the tea gardens spread far and wide .
If we look at the streets on the way then the world looks magnificent .
The curved and circular path along the serpentine path was passing through .
Time was also passing .
If we did n't pass then forest and tea estates .
Some time or the other small settlement could be seen .
From a distance only a hill started to appear very dense from house to house .
This was Kurseong .
Staying here at one place we made a program to tour the whole day .
Therefore taking a car we set out on a tour of Kurseong .
Deer Park is the first .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
To reach the climb from the top i . . the deer park has to be left very low .
Kursyang despite being enchanted with beauty also has not been able to become famous in the form of a tourist spot .
Although the city is very beautiful and clean .
In spite of the roads being deserted the greed to reach till the Deer Park surrounded by forests and the joy of climbing the road between the smoke trees was giving us courage .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
On the other side of this city is a point located at a height .
This is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that in the era of the British lovers used to give life by jumping from here .
Now , this is connected to a park and a restaurant .
There is a stairwelling dome here , the view of the whole of the city from the height of which is presented with a beautiful view .
In the tea gardens near the women were drenched in breaking the tea leaves running very fast on their backs .
There is a museum outside Kurseong city on which we could not go there that day , because it seemed very necessary to tour the uninhibited environment of this park .
The next day 's tour to Darjeeling was decided .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but there was a big worry in it as if it is raining then how will we return .
But it would have been better if we reached to the Rock Garden and enjoyed the sunshine here .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with wide rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
From here we found the Ganges surrounded by hills going a little below .
The view of the waterfall between the rocks from here is worth seeing .
We saw in the Rock Garden that there are waterfalls in the empire of rocks and rocks here , then the fairy land of waterfalls in Gangamaya is worth seeing .
Both these places are very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Battasia Loop in Darjeeling while climbing up on the edge of the vehicle .
From here the whole of the hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen through binoculars .
The mood of the weather was clear till now .
But where we moved towards monastery , Ghat as if from where we got together and began to shine .
There was an arrangement for touring and shopping in the evening on the mall road .
Toy train increases the pleasure of traveling in Darjeeling .
The journey of Toy train from Darjeeling to Ghum and from Ghum to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Here in Mirik lake there is a little relaxation in boating and garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath market through this route , where sweaters knitted by the Nepali workers are also available .
There is also an arrangement to go to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is the only city in Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
Here not only is the greenery of tea gardens but the flow of forest - streams takes place .
The most popular tourist spot of Kalimpong is - Lava and Lolegaon which are full of jungles and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to see Darjeeling in the shadow of the cold , but the tea gardens spread till Siliguri and Darjeeling have stopped me .
A small journey of my recent past has been very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not of foreign origin but of Rajasthan is very near to Jaipur .
Tourism in its own way is a matter of interest in which sometimes journey draws attention towards itself , then at some time there is a special place , a ship of water or a city like a royal train or a pink city or a lake of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people get attracted to it .
The place that I am talking about is ready about four and a half years ago , but the preparation that place where this place is located has really made its identity in the jungle .
Not only for the people going there , but also for the people staying there .
In my ears the words of my guide Ram Babu Meena says , ' Before that we could not even think that we could stay in the jungle like this .
Fifty percent of staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work in the heritage hotel .
Ajabgadh resident Rambabu used to work in Jaipur first and now in this unique royal style in the Aman Bagh .
He had changed his speaking into a new color .
Sahib is the estimate of Aman Bagh .
There no one is talking to you in English .
Aman Bagh is really a peaceful and pleasant walk .
This garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces you to the surrounding area as well .
Some among the people spending the holidays of the royal family in Rajasthan must have visited Bhangarh fort .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of different countries have gone there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi had called me there with applause but I could not go there .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh after forgetting the path .
This time when suddenly I reached there at the invitation of my foreign guests then I found that those people who want to spend a good holiday in less time they should definitely go to the Aman Bagh .
This garden is a garden saved from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in the twenty first century .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
In the shadow of thick trees and surrounded by hills , the first glimpse of Aman Bagh attracts you all .
The way you come in , the way you are welcomed it seems as if attention is paid to the divine peace here .
Along with building mauli in Kanda the mantra of Manglacharya is also given a live pronunciation .
We had reached in the evening and thought of losing a circle in front of that garden .
The one who decorates my guest room , says ' Alaikum ' , is a nectar .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . No wonder that the Aman Bagh has also received the award recently .
The manager fixed our program for morning .
The journey on foot with first Rambabu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Azamgarh on which the sun light gradually spreads .
We saw dry lake in which farmers were cultivating .
This year it did not rain but first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
For which such a glimpse of rural life was unique .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
Early morning I saw a tourist sitting in a deep meditation in Holland .
This is a million dollars priceless moment .
The way to say ' Aavza ' to aman Bagh was traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd he sent us away .
Now we understood that why did tourists come here spending so much money .
I have heard that tour packages are kept for tribal life as well .
Is it right ?
Of course , this happens in not one but many states and tourists also show a lot of interest in it .
This tour is generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this tourists are taken to different places .
Eating etc . are included in this .
This way there is an attempt to explore such places , where there has not been a lot of development and where there has not been any effect of time on the life style of the people and the nature .
Along with this , the places worth seeing in the ancient tourists etc . are also present .
Other than this , attention is also paid on serving traditional cuisines .
Actually the purpose of such tours is to make the tourists experience the lifestyle and traditions of that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to imagine , but coming here actually is interesting and gives a different kind of experience .
The bus journey has its own fun .
With this despite being with many people you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to play without your favorite book .
Yes , it is important that along with giving less expense and more than enough time travel also requires your patience .
This is the reason that to believe it one has to take care of a few things , especially while going to some foreign places with the help of bus travel .
Test a good package before taking a ticket .
If students , senior men , children etc . get rid of them then there is a facility of rest for two people as well .
Otherwise , it is cheap to buy tickets beforehand , therefore in the last moment it is better to do the plan beforehand instead of traveling on buses .
Get information about the cycle journey without ticket on both the sides .
It is cheap .
Rules for goods are very strict , therefore , enquire about the height and weight of the goods .
It should not be such that you have to leave your luggage at the station or else you have to pay a lot of fee .
Along with this , you should also find out the rules of compensation of insurance or loss from tourism company .
The bags kept with you are good , walk with you .
Because it gets better on the horse back above the seat .
Also keep in mind that during the journey while changing the bus the responsibility of goods will be on your own .
From where you have to take the bus , reach there an hour before time .
During the coming season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat will be chosen by you .
While deciding the seat keep in mind the convenience .
If you feel a lot of shock at the last seat , then reading at the next seat will not be right .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be very troubled , then the seat of the window will be appropriate for you .
Now it is a matter of a walk .
If you are in a fix of two seats then first sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other .
If there is not much crowd in the bus , then the plan will be successful .
If the bus service is of washrooms then keep in mind while deciding the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there for a while .
Make identity with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not keep your luggage on the seat , because the bus terminus with which you do not take responsibility of losing .
Wherever the bus stops , come on the way .
If you did n't come on time then you can get some new papers in your place and you will have to wait for the second bus at the station .

Both the hotels of Ginger built in a place named Vakad situated on the Central and Pune - Bangalore highway in the Pimpri industrial area are equipped with all the modern facilities .
The neighbor state of Maharashtra Goa is rich with its beautiful sea shores and various water sports , which is like a heaven for tourists , where from the tour of ancient churches the magnificence of ancient times can be easily seen .
Located in Panaji , the capital of Goa , Ginger Hotel makes this journey of the western coast excellent .
Ginger hotel located here is an excellent option for spending a day fully enjoying cycling , river cruise , cold sea winds and world famous cuisines on the roads of Goa .
In today 's date for Maldive the fare for returning per person from Delhi is Rs . 28 thousand .
After this if you stay in Male , then also you can get hotels in less rent , but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then it will be small .
C - cruise proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Louis cruise from Kochi started the only sea cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very popular in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Louis cruise has stopped its service now but there is a possibility of its coming up again in October .
You can go on a tour of Maldives for a cruise of three days at a rate of at least 5850 rupees per person on the ship of Louis Cruise .
That is the rate of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two adults are old then children less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
What else would you like .
The fare of cruise includes tea , snacks , food .
With the entertainment of all times .
After reaching the capital Male you can take enjoyment of the entertainment , activities available in Maldives as per your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If a sea plane is standing at the front of you on a large plane then you will look like a game .
But this tower of 12 - 15 seats is the best for a tour of islands like Maldives .
While running like a speed boat on the surface of water it does not get to know when they are flying in the air .
In the whole of the flight you do not get the feeling of flying of ordinary airplanes .
Each time your sight will remain below the window , in the blue water of different kinds of islands of Maldives waiting for resort islands and coral islands .
Everything is clearly visible .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Tros Maldives is one of those , near which is sea plane .
If you want then you can take a flight of around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or else you can take the entire plane on rent for a day -LRB- really big -RRB- .
If you go to any island before Male island then sea plane will be necessary because this is the only way of traveling between different islands .
And it is such a journey that perhaps you will never have the desire to complete .
Sea plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in best -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the most ancient and memorable shops of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Malana .
All the sellers of the Maldives were listening to the speeches delivered at the World Environment Conference in Copenhagen a day before the President of Maldives .
With honesty I did not see any Indian listening to the speeches of Presidents or Prime Minister in such a way .
But when there was a question of the existence of a better form of this earth then such seriousness was necessary .
Many people might have considered the meeting held under the water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October to be a synonym of at least , but after going to Maldives they feel that if they take away the wrath of nature from us then how deep would the world become .
There is something special in the beauty there .
There is not that much of beauty in this small country .
To go back to the market from that spot to go for a cruise , when the sight went in the sea running along the unfathomable road then it felt as if the people here understood the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that the fish floating in the depths of several metres beneath the lamp post was visible in all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can also see some centimeters clearly in the water of the sea or river connected to any city of India then you will consider yourself lucky .
After returning to M . . Aquarine , the evening spent two hours in the garlands were mesmerizing .
coral reef is the life here .
Even on the rocks placed on the tomb you will get the rocks of coral .
Just before we heard the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
We did n't believe that we were in front of the residence of the best personality of any country , there was no protector from far .
With pleasure we were taking pictures of gardens and agasm , about fifty metres away by spreading our hands from the door of their bungalows .
Can you think about the home of some common leader in India ?
We also got to know that at some time the President reaches his office two blocks ahead crossing the road on foot .
Everything was surprising in the matter of Maldives .
That is why I was eagerly waiting for the second day .
It was known that that that day was to be special .
A boat from the cruise in the morning brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached Translational situated in the base of Maldives on cutting the ropeway .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near Male then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing above .
You had seen so many photos.
But then it was not known that the next day there would be a chance of a ride in it .
We had to go to Rangali island at a distance of 150 kilometres from Tros Maldives .
From the sea plane flying till a height of approximately thousand metres to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea level were unforgettable .
This beauty of water is not found anywhere else .
The flight that stopped with thrill and enthusiasm was that .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of Hillton Hotels in Rangali island we felt as if we have reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no relation with any outside world .
The relationship was not even this way that it was difficult to get out of the beauty or luxury like there .
Tour can also be done on feet or by battery operated car .
The scene of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jatti to the main island was marvellous .
Today we could not even listen to ourselves by the nature nearby , whether we reached such a place or not .
We reached such a room of glass landing on the sea water several metres down the stairs that were inside the water .
That room was actually a lunch room .
On every side we could see rare species of fish , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving .
The imagination of food was with great thrill by sitting on the decorated table there .
The fare of seeing and launching the underwater on this island from Malpe to Sea Plane is only 47 thousand rupees for one person .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to bathe in the water of our paratha .
But we knew that it was not possible .
After returning with that desire from a heavy heart you will definitely bring a nap here at some point .
For many days we were planning to go out of Delhi but due to busyness of work this was not possible .
When there was a love of wild life in childhood then we thought why should we go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 after biking till Pegong lake ahead of Khardungla in Ladakh this was the second line tour .
On the afternoon of 27 December we had to leave for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the fog that had descended from Joshore had vanished our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tiring .
Dhumas and bad roads in front from above .
Many times it seemed that it was falling .
After doing anything we reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Although we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Near the Amara resort park itself was in Dhakiki , the which we had earlier achieved .
That day there was no special program but we came to roam on the bank of Kosi before cold .
After spending two - three hours there we left for the Carbet Museum , which was near the Dhangdi gate at a distance of 2 kilometres extremely difficult .
From there we went to tour Ramnagar down .
It was evening after returning .
We had set out from Delhi that if we definitely see the lions roaming in the jungle then during the entire night in a dream I saw tigers .
In the middle of the dark night I suddenly got scared of thunder and after that the dogs who started to bathe should not stop for two hours .
Kaladunggi and Corbett waterfalls had come to sight before this .
Kaladhungi is 30 kilometres away while Corbett falls on the way .
In Kaladhungi is the museum of Jim Corbett Saheb , where some important things related to his life are kept .
It was half past twelve .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was coming to this village .
On reaching the resort Safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they had arranged for the sighting of the number one side i . . in Bijrani there .
On enquiring about one point we told that the land of grass is more there and during this time tigers come towards this side to escape from the cold .
Just as we reached Bijara had given us a guide , which takes two and a half hundred rupees for roaming for four hours .
We started going inside for the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two basket elephants , which had long teeth .
I did a good photography .
In the midst of this the guide began to follow the tiger .
Guide said that there are tigers in the park around 150 , of which some have died recently .
At many places we saw signs of their claws too but I was sad on not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to come to Delhi .
In my mind there was the dawn of the tiger .
Then I remembered one of my old friends of Haldwani .
I made him call the same thing .
I told him that I am in Corbett .
He asked if a tiger has been seen or not .
This word of it fell like a arrow .
I told him slowly , no .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone has advised us that you take a safari from inside .
