Its language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On the one side of Kutch on the other side there is a mix of both Sindhi and Gujarati languages .
This is called ' Kutchi ' .
As such this saying is ' Word ' , it does not have its own script .
If there is Kutchi writing then it is written in Gujarati script .
Near Bhoja itself is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes have occurred and the whole city has been devastated .

From Bhoja the small train of metre gauge will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of metre gauge will reach Ahmedabad and broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main source of income of Rajasthan is going through these two bays only .
Due to the rising tides in the world and South Asia the profession of tourism has been seduced .
With the point of view of tourism there has been a considerable decrease in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country these days .
The latest figures released by the Rajasthan Government are as follows that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than 10 percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to statistics 9 . 87 % in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 % in the number of foreign tourists have come down .
In 2008 a total of 298 lakh 36 thousand 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in 2008 , out of which 283 lakh 58 thousand 918 were domestic and 14 lakh 77 thousand foreign tourists were included , whereas in 2009 only 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 lakh tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 2558691 national and 1073414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried regarding this situation .
The director of Rajputana hemisphere Sanjay Kushok Baksh says that the accident of worldly life and terrorism has adversely affected the tourism industry .
Compared to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop strong tourism infrastructure here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India as well there has been a decrease of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to the previous year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
The number of foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan is maximum .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism the recent years have passed the best for Rajasthan .
This is the first time after 2002 that a decrease has occurred in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
There is nothing new with regard to tourism .
Desert , fort , Bavaria , jungle , all of them are old to pull the tourists .
In the area of tourism if we talk about working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism then all the governments do a lot but nothing has been done on that side .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time in recent years along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan warnings of grocers have also been made on the international level .
Years ago Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry to the state but it remained confined only on papers .
One example of the success of Rajasthan Government is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited .
With the purpose to encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides the facilities of staying , comfort , travel , boating etc . to tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motels , 8 cafteria , 3 dharamshalas , 1 bus terminus and 2 bus terminus are in Rajasthan but the condition of this corporation remains miniscule for many years .
In 2008 - 2009 the total area of RTDC remained 185 lakh , which is expected to become 632 lakh in 2009 - 2010 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is this that in the last five years even 40 % of its hotels could not be filled .
Along with the hotels other units of the corporation are also taking it to a big level .
The main among these are the Royal Rajasthan of whales .
There was no attraction of the tourists towards this train .
Even after reducing it did not attract the tourists .
Similarly in the recent years a decrease has been seen in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 2008 in this fair the number of tourists from within the country and outside had stayed in the tourist villages constructed by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists had stayed but this year this number has reduced to 217 .
In the midst of all this there has been patience for artistic purpose that there is no dearth of tourist attractions in Palace on Wheels i . . Palace on Wheels .
This train is continuously giving profit .
Last year an advantage of 9 . crore rupees was received by RTDC by this train .
In Rajasthan due to this fall occurring in the area of tourism the lines of worry are natural .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the heart of man then he can make gold from earth .
In the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra , Subaratrai city has shown this by settling a modern city Ambuvai .

At the time of the Chettinad kings there was acceptance of this goddess from far off places in the north and south hills .
The tribal people here used to pray the goddess .
The sacrifice of the human beings was also done here , due to which Raja Gaurinath Singh had closed the construction of this place .
Some other ruins of the Lohit district of Arunachal are found .
They are called the ruins of Bhishma Nagar which is situated in the middle of the Dibang and Dibang rivers here .
According to the folk tales this place was ancient Vidarbha , where at one time kings used to reign .

The trees of Pinjore hypnotise the beauty of this valley .
The eye sight falls in the exactly on the peak of the mountain ranges covered with snow on the left hand on the light redness emerging in the sky .
There is a lot of coolness in air .
Along with the chill occurring in the air the feeling of moisture is also done .
The dirt under the feet is the root of all the diseases .
There is humidity in the air and due to the fog emanating from the sun rays there is not much visible .
The eyes remain fixed on the redness of the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench in the balcony .
With the very touch of the hands the smooth layer of the palate becomes smitten with the spitting sound and the hand sneezes by the feeling of coolness .
This is the first experience of life in this small village based in the middle of these mountains , thousands of miles away from our country , covered with snow of Switzerland and is the first experience of living the night .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this spent most of the time in Geneva or nearby .
The dense population based on the valley on both the sides of the tributary river Vati is spread up to a great extent on soft slopy slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland ' Ronne ' -LRB- Hon ' -RRB- on both the sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
Balanced road of the river and ring vehicles are seen clearly on it .
At a distance of 300 kms and 2 . hours journey by car , half is from Geneva lake and along with half a row a river , near the city named Rondi Monastery , which is called the Geneva lake in French -LRB- Lakulima -RRB- .
Geneva city is settled on the western end of this lake , 300 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide .
From there the lake again becomes a river and goes towards the west .
There are mountain ranges of dust , sky touching , Alps across the lake on the right side .
Crossing the city with a beautiful pond named Leuk , we leave this highway from the left side , go towards the north on the mountainous way .
Because of the slope of the mountain being towards the south the sun of the evening gives full sunlight to the whole corner .
As compared to valley the amount of snow is less here , it is almost not equal .
As the jinns move towards the height , the quantity of snow starts increasing .
There is no special coolness in the air due to clear sky and shining sun because of good snow on both the sides of the road .
After covering a journey of about 20 kilometres on this darbar mountain road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thalassery .
Shelley -LRB- Chalet -RRB- - Those with slopy roofs , these are many storey bungalows made of wood in the entire way .
In the basement that is built with cement concrete of this bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , laundary etc . along with parking of vehicles .

This wine -LRB- pines -RRB- is the main center of making grape wine .
The cultivation of grapes happens on 37 % landmass of the entire Canton .
The gardens of grapes situated on both the sides of Roun Valley give a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking orchards of grapes -LRB- vineyards -RRB- , taking rest at night in their villages and eating wine in the factory of grapes is an inseparable part of tourism here .
There is a very big museum of grapevines in a small town named Aigel in the 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to first book for booking .
Once again we pass through the middle of that forest where we get burnt with fire .
Mind and soul even get upset with the chirping of children throughout the way up to three to four kilometres .
Suddenly on a turning point a dramatic and attractive change comes from the view .
Right in front , on the slope of the deep valley towards the left of the road a beautiful herd of houses is settled .
People are skiing in the snow on the flat slopes from above the village .
The dense forest of deodar is spread from the skiing slopy to the summit of the upper mountain .
Heavy snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the villages are glittering due to the direct rays of the sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also the same silence is spread .
From the peak of the mountain all around to the valley there is the rule of snow .
In the next five minutes we reach the center of this town through a big toy train .
The name of the town is leukerabad -LRB- Deukerabad -RRB- .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Levikarabad is about 1500 feet .
The number of tourists coming here , players and the practitioners of therapy can be estimated with this fact that for staying here 1700 beds equipped with 6900 beds capacity and 1500 beds capacity are 28 hotels , camping site of tents , 90 beds and 50 restaurants .

Bright snow is shining in the sun above the roof of the house .
Albenin -LRB- Albenin -RRB- is the name of this village .
Alpine village is one of the safest places in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling only that in Sikkim only taxis of Sikkim can be found , therefore checking is not done .
The journey is on , the river is second , but the mountain is the same , the tree is the same , the surface is the same .
The natural moisture present in the whole body is the same .
In the season of rains suda nisfi is the same .
As soon as the program to go to Darjeeling was finished the first decision was taken to take a look at Kurseong .
Kursong is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , lush green jungle .
Famous for the production of high tea .
If you move from Siligudi to Darjeeling , then at the beginning tea gardens welcome the tourists moving towards Muscat .
Passing through the road in the middle of the tea gardens attracts the heart towards the first time .
On one side the green mountain filled with jungles and on the other side deep greenery is eaten .
At some time the jungles here used to look like tea gardens .
There was greenery on all the four sides .
At one time it had become difficult to see these natural forests or to plant tea by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful the forest was , the more beautiful the tea estates spread till far and wide .
When the eyes fall on the roads then the universe appears marvelous .
The shape of the snake was zigzag and narrow path was going on .
The time was also passing .
If we were not passing then the forest and tea gardens were there .
At times small settlements are seen .
From a distance only one hill station - house etc . seemed to be very dense .
This was Kurseong .
Staying here at one place we made a program to tour the whole day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we set out on a tour of Kurseong .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden surrounds the large forests .
The climb was above that i . . to reach the deer park the vehicle had to leave behind a lot .
Despite being attracted to the beauty of Karsiang even now a progressive development has not been found in the form of a tourist spot .
Although the city is quite good and clean .
Despite the path being deserted . the desire to reach Deer Park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the road between the trees of sunshine was giving us comfort .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
This is a point located at the height of the city from the other side .
It is also called sacoid pint .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to get to know through jumping here .
At present it is a park and a restaurant .
There is a stairway cave here , the view of the whole of the city from the height of which is seen very beautiful .
In the tea gardens near the women were engaged in breaking the tea leaves with tea leaves at the back at a very fast pace .
There is a museum outside of Kurseong city but that day we could not get there because touring the charming environment of tea gardens seemed very important .
The next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
It was a pleasant experience in itself , but it was even more worrying about how to roam if it 's raining .
But it was very good that on reaching the Rock Garden we roamed the enjoyment of sports and games .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The way to reach here is even more attractive than this .
On moving a little more down from here we found the Ganges spread through the mountains .
The magnificence of waterfalls amidst rocks here is spectacular .
In the Rock Garden we found that there are fountains and waterfalls in the reign of rocks here and the whole world is covered with rocks in the Ganges .
Both these places are located very below the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw Battasia Loop in Darjeeling lifting up from the vehicle .
The whole of the hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of Durbin .
The weather was clear till now .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , where did we get down and started shaking .
In the evening a program of walking and shopping on Mall Road was organised .
In the tour of Darjeeling the tourists spend their time in the travel .
Touring from Darjeeling and traveling from Dhoop to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Here in Mirik lake there is a little relaxation in boating and garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from the same route , where the sweaters studded with the hands of the Nepali artists are found .
The facility to go to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also there .
Kalimpong is in the same city of Darjeeling district , but its form is different .
Here not only are the greenery of tea gardens but the arrival of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of forest waterfalls .
But due to lack of time this time we could not be able to reach Kalimpong .
We had come from Kolkata to Darjeeling in the shadows of winters touring Darjeeling , but the tea gardens spread from Siligudi to Darjeeling have tied me here with themselves .
A small journey of my recent past has been very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not of any country or of Rajasthan but of very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself , in which sometimes journey draws towards itself , at some time there is a special place , a ship of water or some city like a royal train or a pink city or a lake of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come in search of food .
The place where I am going to talk is ready just four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that place has come here , that place has really made fun of the jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
My guide resonates the words of Lord Rambumina in my ears , mate , before that we could not even imagine that we can stay in forest like this .
50 St . Staff is of this very region .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people could not find work in the heritage hotel .
A strange resident of Ramgarh , Rambabu used to work in Jaipur before this and now in this unique royal style ' Shanti Bagh ' .
It has moulded its own speech into a new color .
There is a style of peace - garden .
Nobody calls you English there .
Peaceful garden is a picnic spot of China and all the Sikh facilities .
This garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces you to the nearby area as well .
Among the people spending holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan the tour of Bhangra of the Buddhists could be done , why go away , some of Jaipur 's people spent the night in this area .
After the opening of the Shanti Bagh large people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night also when Prime Minister Shabda had called me there from his heart , but I could not go .
It 's a different matter that he had reached Mandu after wandering on his own path .
This time when suddenly I reached there on the invitation of my foreign guest then it felt that those who want to spend a good holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Shanti Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left out of these seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in 1990 .
Its old wall is the witness of those days .
Surrounded by hills and under the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of peace park attracts you .
As soon as you come in , the way you are welcomed , it seems that a lot of attention has been paid to the spiritual peace here .
The mantras of Mangalachar can be kept alive while tying poultice in Kalai .
We reached early in the evening and decided to plant this garden in a circular fashion .
My host Jackie who has been an expert in decoration , suddenly speaking it is interesting .
All are affected by palaces and palaces .
Its lighting is the most beautiful .
Everything is new but there is no wonder in art that Shanti Bagh has also got the award in the recent past .
The manager prepared our program for morning meals .
First of all a walk with Rambabu and the journey of jeep of Bhangra .
While walking on narrow streets we saw a magnificent fort on which gradually the sun 's rays were spreading .
We saw dry lake in which farmers were cultivating .
This year it did not rain but for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
There was such a unique experience of the life of the village for Jackie .
After that we reached Bhangra from the jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist in a deep meditation .
This is a multi-million dollar priceless bridge .
They also gave us farewell after listening to the tradition of Tsomoriri lake .
Now I understood why the tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are kept for traveling in Tribal life .
Is this right ?
Indeed and not one such happens in many states and tourists also show great interest in them .
This tour is generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this tourists are taken to different places .
Staying there , eating etc . are also included in it .
This way there is an attempt to explore such places , where there has not been much development and where there has not been a special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time old tourist spots etc . are also present .
Apart from this one also gets to pay attention on Tridoshin Kozer .
Actually the goal of such tours is to make the tourists face to face with the lifestyle and traditions of this place .
Although it seems a bit difficult in thinking , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
Despite being with many people you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to bored with the preparation of your favorite book .
Yes , it is equally important that along with giving you less expense and plenty of time this tour definitely demands patience .
This is the reason that to enjoy these things it is important to keep in mind , especially when you are watching some foreign destination by bus tour .
Before taking a ticket find the best deal .
Student , senior citizens , children , etc get discounts on them , while for two people there is also an arrangement of exemption .
However , it is cheap to buy tickets in advance , therefore it is better to do the planning first on the last bridge .
Instead of two way tickets know about Round trips .
It becomes lethargic .
Laws related to baggage are very strict , therefore keep in mind the size and weight of the goods .
It should not be such that you have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or else fill a different fee .
Also know the laws of insurance or compensation of loss from tour company .
Carry on bags , keep them right , take them .
Because they come into the rectangular shape on the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus during the tour the responsibility of goods will be on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During busy season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat selection will be with you .
While choosing the seat take care of the comforts .
If tremors start increasing in the previous seat , then there is no rest on reading on the seat of the front .
If you have to go again and again then take a seat in the corner and if you do not like being more distressed then the window seat will be better for you .
Now there is a talk of a miracle .
If both of you are in the sprain of the palms then first sit on the corner seat and keep your bag on the other .
If there is not much crowd in the bus , then planning will be successful .
If there is convenience in bus then while enjoying the seat keep in mind that it is difficult to sit there after a little while .
Make identification with bus driver and conductor only .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus everyone is called to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its disappearance the bus driver does not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time then a new passenger can get your place and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .

Famous with the district headquarters of Nasik , Trimbakeshwar Temple , Vipassana Station and Nandeshwar Temple are well connected .
Here at some time the journey of Pune is incomplete without seeing the famous Ashwa Ashram of Shaniwarwada and Lord George the palace of Peshwa rulers .
There are two hotels of Zanjeer in Pune , which are situated in Jhoppur and Waqad .
In the middle of the Pampiri industrial area and in a place named Wakad situated on the Pune - Bangalore highway the twin hotels of engine , all are equipped with the latest facilities .
The neighbouring state of Maharashtra Goa is equipped with its beautiful sea shores and various water sports , which is like a heaven for the tourists , where from the tour of ancient churches the magnificence of ancient times is spectacular .
Located in the capital Panaji of Goa the Janjar Hotel makes this journey extremely excellent on the western coast .
Located here is the best option to spend comfortable days on the roads of Goa taking full pleasure of cycling , horse - cruise , cool sea winds and world famous cuisines .
If we see in today 's history then for Maldives the fare of Rs . 28 thousand per person per person is the most cheap .
After this if you stay in the mall then you can get a hotel at least in the rent but if you go to an island nearby taking the enjoyment of the beauty of the Maldives then the pocket will be small .
Secretion proves beneficial here only .
In the first week of December , from Kochi to Louis cruise started the sole cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Luicroz is a European company and is a village named coffee in Cruise and Hotel Beapore .
Although due to some problems Louis cruise has stopped its service now but there is hope of the start of their period from October .
At least Rs . 5850 per person on a ship of Loy Cruise one can go to Maldives for a cruise of three days every night .
Meaning the fare of one person for three days is less than Rs . 18 thousand .
And if two adults are old then children less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
And what should be done .
In the fare of cruise tea , breakfast , lunch , all are included .
The enjoyment of every time together .
Reaching the capital Male , you can take the enjoyment of the entertainment , activities available in Maldives as per your pocket - from September to November .
While roaming in big aircraft in front of you suddenly appears in front of you as if a carpet is spread .
But this toy train with 12 - 15 seats is undoubtedly excellent for traveling in Maldives like archipelago .
When does it get up in the air running like speed boat on the surface of water , then does not come to know .
In the whole of the flight you do not have any idea of the flight of ordinary airplanes .
Eyes take care of yourself at all times by the window - the blue water of different shades of Maldives i . . seeing Maternal Resort Islands and coral islands .
How clean does everything appear .
There are only two companies in Maldives .
Transmaldine is one of those only which has 20 carpets .
If you want then you can take a flight of around 1000 rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or the whole day to enjoy your whole day -LRB- without doubt -RRB- on hire -LRB- without doubt -RRB- .
If you go to an island far from Malana then the journey of Sailin will be necessary because this is the source of traveling between different islands .
And it is such a journey that perhaps you will not have the desire to end .
Seaplanes travel a distance of 12 kms from 12 kms to 183 kms -LRB- in excellent way -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and showy shop of the capital in the Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All the salesmen were listening with great attention to the speeches delivered by the president of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed at Copenhagen World Festival .
If I say with honesty then I have not seen any Indian listen to President or Prime Minister with so much attention .
But when there was only question of the existence of a rare creation of this land then that seriousness was important .
Many people may have considered the seat entered inside the water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October as broken , but may have thought how poor the world would be by sprinkling a natural calamity .
In the beauty there it is something special .
In this small country such beauty does not suit .
To go back to the market from this tour of the market they hoisted towards the jettisoned , when all of a sudden the sight went in the sea along the road then it felt as if the people here understood the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that the fish floating in the depths of several metres beneath the light of the lamppost was visible in all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely enclosed by the city .
You will also be able to see some centimeters clearly in the water of the sea or river along with any city of India , then you will find yourself blessed .
In the evening while returning to M . . . Marienplatz was spending two hours in mind .
coral reef -LRB- Mongla -RRB- is the life here .
Here even on the stones laid on your graves you will find mongoose motions .
We were standing outside their official residence for some time before listening to the speech of President Nasheed .
It was not certain that we were not any protector far from the residence of the supreme personality of any country .
With joy we were pulling out our hands from inside the doors of its bungalows , gardens and fountains , just 50 metres away .
Can you think about any of the leading places in India ?
Even then it came to be known that at times while crossing the road on foot two blocks reach their office in front .
Every thing about Maldives was surprising .
That is why I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
Allahabad was that it was going to be the special day .
A boat from Cruise was taking us to Airport Island .
From there we reached at the base of Trans Maldives after traversing the ropeway .
Last evening when we were reaching near Karzmela then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing above .
That much of the pictures we saw , is of them .
But then it was not known that the next day there would be a chance of rides .
We were going to Rangali island at a distance of 100 - 5 kms from Transmal Diu .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resort and coral islands spread in the sea from the sea plane flying till a height of approximately one thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
He was the one who breathed a sigh of sadness and vexation .
But after reaching the corner of ` Hillton Hills ' on Rangali island it seemed as if we have reached some other world .
In such a world which was not involved in any outside world .
It was not even in this way that the beauty there was difficult to get out .
Tour can also be done on foot or by battery operated car .
The scene of water life on both the sides of the bridge while going till the main island from Jetties was marvellous .
Now we could not even take care of ourselves by the nature nearby , that we had reached such a place which was an unforgettable experience .
We reached such a room of glass landing on the sea water several metres down the stairs that were inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On the other side at the end of the glass humans could see strange kind of small fish , corals , acorning , snorkelling and scuba diving .
The thought of eating here sitting on the decorated tables was to give in itself a thrill .
The fare of seeing this island on coming to this island from Male , sea plane is only 47 thousand rupees for a single person .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to give our passport in water .
But we knew that it was not possible .
With this expectation itself that at some point of time the fortune of this place will definitely be taken here .
Since many days the plan was to go out of Delhi but due to busyness of work this was not possible .
If there was a fondness for wildlife from childhood then why did n't we think that it should be gym ?
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after the bike ride of up to Pyong lake ahead of Khardungla pass in Ladakh .
In the morning of 27 December we left for Delhi to Jim Corbett but the enthusiasm with which we had come out was giving us respite .
The journey from Hapur to Gajraula was really tiring .
Thicks of cedar and pine trees are found in abundance .
Many times it seemed as if it had fallen now .
Somehow reached Gajraula in the morning 8 o'clock .
Anyway we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was near the rest house in Dhuli , which we had booked earlier .
That day there was no special program , despite being cold we went for a walk on the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we went out to the Carbet Museum , which was barely 2 kms away from Dangdi Gate .
From there we went to roam Ramnagar below .
It was late in the evening while returning .
I had decided from Delhi that if we will see the lions roaming in the jungle then all night in dream I will keep looking at the lions .
Suddenly I heard a rumbling in the midst of the depths of the night and after that the dogs which started sounding did not pause for two hours .
Therefore the advice of going to Kaladangi and Carbet fall first came to be done .
Kaladungi is 30 kilometres away while Carbet Fall falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett , where some important things related to his life are kept .
While returning it was half past twelve .
Kaladangi is extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett is settled in this village .
On reaching the resort Safari gypsy was ignoring us .
It was told that he had made an arrangement for sighting in the number one place in Bajrangarh .
On asking about the number one it is said that there is more landmass there and tigers come towards it in order to escape from the cold .
Just as we reached Bijrani a guide was given , which takes about two and a half hundred rupees to roam around for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
We saw two twig elephants , which had long teeth .
I did gym photography .
This beach guide started tracking the tiger .
The guide said that there are only tigers in the park near about 150 , of which some have died recently .
At many places we saw the marks of their claws also , but on not being able to see the tiger it was untiring .
We had to return to Delhi on the third day .
In my mind there was a tiger ride .
That is why I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I phoned him like this only .
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
He asked that he did not see the tiger .
Its words were dazzled like a arrow .
I told you slowly , no .
It was not allowed to take rest properly in the park .
Take that advice inside for a ride.
