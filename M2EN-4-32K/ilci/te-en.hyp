Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yeah, it's the other one.
Sindh on one side and Gujarat on the other side therefore there is also a mixture of both in language .
This is called ' Kachi ' .
Although there is talk regarding this , there is no script of it .
If you want to come to Kachhi then you will have to write only the script of Gujarati .
Near Bhuj is that Anjaar city where many times earthquakes have occurred and the whole of the city has fallen .
The tomb of Jaisalmer - Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisalmer is very charming .
If we return back by the way through that path then we had to take the holidays of one month old and schools were opened there in Mumbai .
But what should we do now for fast buses of Gujarat do travel by train in Tatanagar .
The small train going to Meterge from Bhuj reaches Rajkot .
From there one more small train of Meterge will take you to Ahmedabad and from Ahmadabad will take you to Mumbai via broad gauge .
The tourism industry believed to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through a very poor condition these days .
There has been a great dearth of tourism due to the increasing number of fasts in Vaishali and South Asia .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has reduced very less in these days only .
A new report published in a recent survey by the Rajasthan government has revealed that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to the figures the number of national tourists decreased by 9 . 87 percent and number of foreign tourists by 27 . 36 percent .
In the year 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came in Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists had participated .
In this there are 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists .
People associated with tourism are worrying about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , founder of Rajputana Holiday Mercs says that with the incidents of vaishvik , magnificence of fastness the tourism industry has got affected much .
As compared to other countries of Asia we have not developed the tourism system here in strength , based on this .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
The number of French tourists among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan is maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism Rajasthan has spent a lot of time this year .
After 2002 this was the first time that there was a decrease in the number of tourists of Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , houses , forts , ponds , forest all are old for the joy of the tourists .
In the area of tourism the names of village tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism etc . all the governments tell a lot of importance but there is nothing in this direction .
Facilities for tourists coming to Rajasthan are also available very less .
Along with foreign women tourists in recent years incidents of rape and violence have also taken the beauty of this state to an international level .
Rajasthan government has given the status of tourism only a few years back but it has remained limited to only papers .
One example of Rajasthan government ' s victory in tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation .
To increase the number of tourists in Rajasthan and to develop the base of tourism , the government of Rajasthan established RTDC in 1979 .
These vegetations provide the facility of residence , food , transport , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 branches in this institute .
Among these 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight Cafeteria , three journeys , one unit journey , two train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan Valley , but this institute 's status as well has been pending for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is estimated to increase to 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The status of hotels of this institute is such that in the last five years even 40 percent rooms of these hotels have not been filled .
The other specialities of the organization with hotels cause it a lot of harm .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Hills .
Travellers could not get attracted to this train .
Even after decreasing the fare this did not attract the tourists .
In the same way at present during Pushkar Fair also the favorites of tourists were seen to be less .
In the year 2007 - 08 this fair was organised in the tourist village constructed by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists resided , this year there this number is only 217 .
Amidst all this the interesting thing of RTDC is that there is no dearth of attracting tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . the city train .
This train is continuously giving benefits .
Last year by this train RTDC has achieved a profit of nine and a half crores .
Due to these deformities occurring in the tourist area of Rajasthan it has become easy to see damage to the tourism sector .
Tourism is the most base of Rajasthani economy .
If a person wants to do something in the mind then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy had shown the truth of this by constructing a modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahyadri mountain peak of Maharashtra .
The one which he had dreamt , while developing everyday he would get a pleasant glimpse of his eyes .
This joy of theirs was also seen in the beginning of the Amby Valley National Park .
Amby Valley started work and today Amby Valley has been successful in making his place a better city .
In this city spread in more than 10 thousand crores only 9 percent land area hotels , houses and other facilities have been provided .
Plants , lakes , waterfalls , fountains and other facilities have been made available in 91 percent of the area .
Several industrialists have come forward to make their houses in this city made of only forts and today there are around 800 families in this city .
Initially industrialists and rich people bought their rest houses here as holiday home but today they have made their first home and from here they keep on coming to Mumbai for work .
Behind Amby Valley is Korigarh fort which makes this place very beautiful .
The remains of Likawali in western Siang district is very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found during the excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple statues of Tamara and Devi are found , which are mostly in the dilapidated condition .
Malininath ' is a prime place in this mountain .
At this place a statue of ten hands of the tomb of Durga has been found .
Behind the naming of this statue and a place here many stories and legends of the local people are present .
The ruins of Devlapani even today narrate the glorious saga of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamrueshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and Puranic stories the mention of the glory of Tamrueshwari Devi is found .
During the reign of the Chetia kings , people believe this god to be far off from far off places in the north - eastern mountains .
The forest people here used to worship Goddess .
Here men were also sacrificed , after which King Gaurinath Singh had forbidden .
Some other ruins of the Lohit district of Arunachal have been found .
It is said to be the ruins of Bhishmanagar that the land between Dibang and Diwang rivers is located here .
According to the folktales here this place is the ancient Vidarbha , where at one time King Bhishma had ruled .
Brahmkund is situated in the lower part of Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Tribals like Digha , Mishmi etc . here are the guides to the tourists .
These people themselves also have a lot of faith on this holy spot .
The main Parashuram Kund is just near the Brahmakunda .
On the day of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Apart from the ruins mentioned above in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal , the ruins of rowing in Diwang - Valley district are also very historical .
The remnants of the corner made of brick by brick near Roing still tell their stories .
Bathing , mud and other ponds around it , being made from the walls of soil and the ruins of roads on the sides make their ancient grandeur even today .
We reach Zero in four hours through jeep from Lakhimpur of Assam settled on the top .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
Located at a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming hilly place attracts everyone 's heart .
This is the same interesting place where there is an emergency .
It took several days for the jeep to reach here before the road route .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful Primorrhage , Volt , Jungle Continent , Strawberry and Rasaberries overwhelms the tourists .
Apple and peaches are grown here a lot .
There is a valley spread in an area of about 1524 metres and 26 kms .
This beautiful valley is the residence place of the people settled in a decadent state .
They have made it their heaven by many industries .
There is a lot of paddy harvest here .
This place is ' barley house ' .
This ten mile long field is the witness of their hard work and agriculture .
Their agriculture gets enough from Kali Nadi .
The palanquin makes the beauty of this valley moonlit .
The sight falls on the red color of the sky on the horizon in the middle of the snow laden peaks of the left hand .
There is a lot of coolness in the air .
Along with shivering cold one also feels cold .
On being hit by a noise it appears as if the layer is spread over the wood .
Because of the weather being silent and constricted before sunrise not very well .
Eyes remain constant on the red color of the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench in the balcony .
The thin layer spread through the hand starts slipping with a light sound and the hand gets displaced immediately by the cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , on coming to this small village located in the middle of these mountains of Switzerland covered with snow , this is the first experience in life of the night .
This is my third foreign trip to Switzerland .
Prior to this we spent a long time in Geneva or nearby .
On both the sides of the thin Baltistan there were 100 institutions then wherein approximately 1000 Buddhist monks must have been staying .
This is the main river of Switzerland 's Ron Valley on both its sides many small and big cities are there .
The National Highway parallel to the Rhone river and the cars moving on it are clearly visible .
300 kms away and 2 . hours journey in car , half past , parallel to Janiva lake and half Roan river coming from east to Montro city near Geneva lake which is called Lake Lama in French .
100 km long and 10 km wide this is the city of Geneva in the west .
From there the waterfall falls towards the west turning into a river .
On the right side the waterfall , glittering , sky touching Alps mountain peaks are there .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Loukoe , we left this highway from the road towards the left , come towards the northern side of the mountain .
Because of being on the southern side of the mountainous terrain the sun rays on the third day .
As compared to valley the snow here is no less .
As the climber goes towards the height , the melting of snow increases .
On both sides of the road despite being extremely snowy , there is no coldness in the air due to peaceful and shining sun .
We reached a small village by the name of Thalassery after completing a journey of about 20 kms on this slopy hill road .
Stones - roofs , huge verandahs of wood are there .
In this building of three storied cylindrical well with the stopping of cars there are parts to control important facilities like electricity , water , luxury etc .
Villey is famous for vineyards in Switzerland .
This is the main center of wine drinking .
37 % area of the total area of the country out of which grapes grow .
The vineyards of the villages on both the sides of the Ron Valley provides a special importance for the beauty there .
Walking on foot in the vineyards , touring them in the villages where at night rest and showing the taste of the wine brought into the industry is a part of the tourism department here .
There is a very big museum of wine in a cottage made in the 12th century in a small town of Agra which for seeing this foreign tourists have to make an aggressive booking .
Once we pass through that forest burnt with fire .
The heart was even more convulsed with the questions of children staying for three - four kms long .
Suddenly one turning point a dramatic and wondrous change comes in .
Just straight , on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is established in the field based on very deep valleys .
People are skiing in the snow on the plain plains situated at the edge of the village .
The dense forest of cedars is spread up to the summit of the peak of the peak of the skiing .
There is heavy snowfall all around .
The rays of sun falls on the houses of the villages because of the shining sun .
We reached that village in five minutes .
Here also the same calmness is spread .
From the peaks of the mountains on all four sides till the valleys , this is a glittering snow empire .
Within five minutes we reached a big circle situated in the middle of that garden .
The name of Varyakram is Leukkarbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the number of people of Leukbad is about 1500 feet .
The number of tourists , players and healthy people coming here can be estimated with the fact that there are 1700 apartments with a facility of 6900 beds and 1500 shelters , 28 hotels , tamboo camping site , 90 bed health center , 50 restaurants .
Till now 65 waterfalls of hot water have been found in Leukbad .

One feels extreme heat after reaching the village .
In the rising sun the snow spreads through the roofs of the house .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of those places which became the safety of ' national heritage ' in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that only Sikkim 's taxis go to Sikkim so that there is no trekking .
The journey is on , one is on the other , but the mountain is the same , that is the plant of trees , that is the sound of the wind .
It makes the whole body shivering .
This is the golden rays of the sun rising in the rainy season .
On the decision of the journey of Darjeeling the decision was taken that first of all take carsiasing camps .
Carsyang is a small town in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , incensed wood .
It is famous for producing tea .
While going from Siligudi to Darjeeling in the beginning the tea gardens are welcoming the people coming towards you with smile .
Going through the middle of tea gardens attracts the mind first time .
On one side green mountains filled with forests , on the other side dense forests .
Here once the jungles used to look like tea gardens once .
On all four sides was the empire of greenery .
Once when I saw Karbar then do I see these natural forests or do I see the tea gardens put by man ?
Both were attracted towards itself .
No matter how beautiful is the forest , tea gardens are spread equally beautiful .
On the way looking at the roads on the way it feels as if creation is unparalleled .
The path was more difficult ahead .
Time is also passing .
The forests and tea estates are not at all finished .
Sometimes small settlements were visible .
From a distance only on a hill a queue of houses - houses etcetera have been seen .
This is Karsiyang .
Staying here at one place we made a plan to tour the whole day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we set out on a journey to Karsyang .
First of all is Deer Park .
A small garden has large forests all around .
To reach the deer park the vehicle had to be left very low .
The beauty of Karsiyang is spread far and wide and has not yet become famous as the tourist spot of today .
Although the city is very good and peaceful .
The path was deserted but to reach Deer Park full of forests the joy of climbing the path between Mohan and Dhoopi trees was giving us courage .
The other place is Eagle Crag .
This is a point located at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the British period lovers used to take their life by jumping from here .
Although there is a park and restaurant here .
There is a Siddhima cave here , on seeing it from a height a beautiful view of the whole of the city is seen from here .
In the tea gardens near the women are engaged in wiping the tea leaves with great speed , making pills on their back .
There is a museum outside the Kasyang city but that day we could not go there because touring the beautiful environment of tea gardens seemed very important .
The next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was very troubled by this that how can we roam when there is rains .
But the weather was very good reaching till the Rock Garden and then we roamed around enjoying the sunshine coming here .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining .
On going a little below from here the Ganges flowing through some hills was visible .
Amidst the rocks here one gets to see the microbe of the waterfall .
We saw in Rock Garden that waterfalls falling from the midst of the empire of rocks and rocks here , waterfalls in Gangamaya are decorated with stones all over the world .
Both of these places are spread very low in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling .
After climbing up with the help of vehicle we saw smoke in Darjeeling .
With the help of telescopes all the mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen from here .
The atmosphere was very clear till now .
When we set out towards Monastery we do not know from where the group of clouds came and clouds burst .
There is a plan of shopping in Mall Road in the evening .
In the journey to Darjeeling the travel by train brightens the journey like a pure moon .
The toy train journey from Darjeeling to Gum and from Dum to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in the Mirik lake here and a short break in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath market through this route , where hand made sweaters , etc . are available in Nepal industry .
The facility to go to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also there .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district and its shape is different .
Here not only is the greenery of tea gardens but the sounds of jungles and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon which are full of forest and lake .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We came to Darjeeling from Kolkata to roam Darjeeling in the winters , but the tea gardens spread from Siligudi to Darjeeling here keep their faces shut .
A small journey of my condition was very pleasant and thrilling .
This journey is not of foreign countries but of Rajasthan , but of very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a favorite thing of itself , in which sometimes journey draws towards itself , sometimes some special place , ship or city , train or city , some city full of pink or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people are brought towards themselves .
The place that I am talking about was made about four and a half years ago , but with what construction this place came up , it really welcomed the forest .
Not only for the people going there but also for the residents there .
In my ears our guide Rambabu began to shout , " Sir , we did not even think this before that we could stay in the forest like this .
50 percent soldiers were of this place .
Suddenly I felt that so many locals did not even get work in the heritage hotels .
The resident of Ajabgarh Rambabu was working in Jaipur before this and today in this very important royal garden ` Aman ' .
He has himself expressed his desire to do something new .
Aiya ' is the estimate of Aman Bagh .
There no one will contact you with English language .
Aman Bagh is in fact a picnic spot with peace of mind and all comforts .
This garden has a history of its own and the most important thing is that it introduces you to the nearby areas as well .
The number of people spending holidays in the royal palaces of Rajasthan , which have been toured in Bhangarh of the past , why should you go far , among the people of Jaipur they also had to spend night at this place .
After the construction of Aman Bagh big people of different countries came here .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi called me there completely , but I could not go .
Other than this she herself had gone to Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there on the invitation of our foreign relatives , but I felt that those people who want to spend their holidays in less time , then Aman Bagh should definitely go .
This garden is the only garden left in those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in sixteen hundred and twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Bagh in the shade of hills and shady trees attracts you .
As you come in , you will be welcomed in the same way , by which you will feel that you have to pay attention to the great peace here .
Along with tieding a thread on the head a thread like thread is called pranayama .
We reached there in the evening and we felt as if we were putting a stick in that garden nearby .
The Jauki who had given us the hospitality was decorating it , immediately it came to me that it seemed very interesting to me .
All buildings and forts are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Yes , all of them are new , artistic . No wonder Aman Bagh has received a prize even today .
The manager fixed our program in the morning .
First of all a walk with Rambabu and the journey of jeep in Bhangarh .
While walking on the small road we saw the fort of Ajmer on which sun rays spread gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which farmers were growing .
This year it did not rain but for the first time we had seen the fruit of tobacco .
This glimpse of the rural life of Jaiki is unique .
After that we reached Bhanagadh by jeep .
Early morning I saw a tourist from Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is a priceless gift of millions of dollars .
Amin Bagh is also a method of Alvind which made us eat jaggery and curd .
Then it was understood that why do tourists come here to spend so much money ?
I have heard that to show Tribal life also tour packages are there .
Is it true ?
There is no doubt that it happens in not just one but many states and tourists also show more interest in it .
This tour is generally decided from four days to two weeks and during this time tourists can be taken to different places .
In this stopping , eating etc also take place .
This way an attempt is being made to explore such places , where there has not been a lot of development and where there has not been any significant effect on the nature and the life style of the people there .
At the same time ancient tourist sites etc . are also there .
Not only this , it is also paid attention to the study of traditional cuisines .
Actually , the goal of such tours is to show the dressing style and traditions of that place to the tourists .
Although it seems a little difficult to imagine here , but such tours are really interesting and involves an experience of a different kind .
Travellers going to Manali reach Sri Nagar or Manali while returning .
With this despite being with many people you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you will be able to enjoy your favorite book for a long time .
Yes , here it is important that we spend so much time and along with it request for patience in this journey also is there .
This is the very reason that to enjoy these definitely keep in mind some things , especially if someone is watching the destination with you in a foreign country through a tour .
Look for a good medium before taking a ticket .
Students , senior officers of the army , children etc . get concession on them , both are available for rent .
Although taking a ticket beforehand is less therefore it is better to plan a bus tour for the last minute .
Do know about the entire tour rate instead of travel ticket .
This is cheap .
There are also some suggestions for goods , therefore , it is important to know about the quantity and weight of the goods .
If this happens somewhere then you will have to leave some of your stuff in terminals or you will have to pay more debts .
Also find out the suggestions for insurance or loss in tour company .
Carry on bags are good , take them .
Because they fit in the Rock located on the seat .
Keep in mind this thing as well that during the journey while changing the bus you will have to take the responsibility of luggage .
From where to go by bus , reach there an hour before time .
During busy times you should take special care of this point .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat will also be available to you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind your comfort as well .
There are more wrinkles on the back seat , but there is no chance of reading in the front seat .
If you have to go for urination again and again then take the last seat , and if you do not like excessive restlessness then the seat beside the window will be better for you .
Now there is a very interesting thing .
If you are in a seat putting the hands on both the sides then sit on the last seat and keep your bag on the other .
If maximum number of people do not stay in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of bathing in the bus then while selecting the seat keep this in mind as well because after some time there is problem in sitting there .
Get acquainted with the bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get to know many important things from them .
It is said that while cleaning the bus everyone has to go out .
At this time do not keep your luggage on the seat because if they do not leave then the bus will not take responsibility for it .
If the bus stops anywhere then come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then your place will be available to some new tourist and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .
It is said that if Rome is not visible in Europe , then you will not be able to see anything else .

Pathian . This magnificent ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
There is a 30 feet open field in the middle of this huge tower .
Due to this place the devotees used to feel as if their prayers are directly reaching near the deities .
In the temple all around idols of Gods and Goddesses are made .
Although in 601 AD this temple has been converted into a church .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Vila Burgies is worth a visit .
Therefore on going to Rome do not forget to see them .
Definitely go to the museum built here so that on missing it you can get a chance to see excellent sculpture art .
The statues built here are so magnificent that it appears as if they are talking to us now .
Here the first Napoleon ' s brother Palin , who was married in the reign of Borgis , an idol lying on a bed feels as if you are unable to see it for a few minutes .
The main attraction of Rome is the fountains there .
Here approximately 300 forts are such in which magnificent fountains are built .
The most famous fountain of this place is ' Treevi fountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come to Rome again then along with this wish he should put a coin in this fountain .
It is believed that by doing this the desire is fulfilled .
The journey of this old city is not complete till then you will not be able to see Vatican City .
Since sixth century this place was the residence of the main religious guru of Roman Catholic religion ` Pope ' .
Although it is in Rome but in 1926 it has been given the status of an independent city .
You must see famous St . Peter 's Church , St . Peter Square , fountains , museums in Vatican City .
No doubt it will be a world like you and you will also get the experience of remembering it as well .

The neighbouring state of Maharashtra is Goa which has its own beautiful sea shore and variety of waterfalls , which is like a heaven for the tourists to see the beauty of ancient times visible from there .
Located on the western coast of Ginger Hotel located in Panaji , the capital of Goa , it is very exciting to travel .
Cycling river cruise , cold sea lanes and skiing along the Goa roads , enjoying the pleasure of the world famous Goal lovers Ginger Hotel located here is very convenient .
If seen in today 's situation then for going to Maldives the fare of Rs . 28 thousand per person is very cheap from Delhi .
After this if you stay in the fair even then you can get hotels in less money but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then money will go away .
Sea cruise is a very beneficial proverb here .
Just before December , in the first week of December , the only cruise of India began from Kochi , Luikruj , Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise has achieved great popularity in the business of European companies and cruise hotels .
Although due to some problems Louis cruise has now reduced its service but it is expected that it will start again in October .
You can go to Maldive on a three day cruise at an average Rs . 5850 per person in a submarine ship .
Meaning the fare of one person for three days is less than Rs . 18 thousand .
If there are two elderly people then in the age of 15 years the child is completely free .
One more thing should be done .
Tea - tiffin , food all are available on the cruise fare .
Every moment it is related to time .
After reaching the capital Male you can take enjoyment of the time spent in Maldives as per your pocket , work out - from sea plane ride to under water lunch .
If suddenly a sea plane has come before you while roaming around in big airplanes then you will feel like a toys .
But this tower of 12 - 15 seats is the best for touring in the archipelago like Maldives .
Running like a speed boat on the water we do n't know when it starts flying in the air .
On flying at full speed you will not feel the flight of normal flights .
Every moment your eyes will keep looking down from the window , in different sites of Maldives reserve islands and coral island in blue water .
The more it looks .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trachoma disease occurs due to a bacteria .
If you want then you can take around four thousand rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- by flight for an hour or you can take the fare of your entire sea plane for the entire day .
As such if you go to another island from the island then a sea plane journey will be necessary because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey that when your mind does not feel like ending it .
Seaplane is at a distance of 12 kms from 12 kms to 183 kms from Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and souvenir shop of the capital of Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
The salesmen are listening to the talks given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed at the World Environment Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier .
To tell the truth I did not see any Indian listening to the words of the President or the Prime Minister with so much care .
But when there is a question of the existence of a new creation on this earth then this magnitude is unparalleled .
Many people did n't feel like working in the conference that took place in the lap of water in the Maldives in October , but if they go to Maldives then it seems as if nature has drenched us in the worst condition in the world .
There are some such specialities in the beauty there .
Belief is that much of the beauty of that small country that is attached with it .
While returning from the market to go back to their cruise , while moving our eyes towards the sea water , it feels as if the people here have been able to understand the price of these beauty products .
The water is so clear that the fish floating in the depths of several metres under the Lappost can be seen with all their colors .
This is a part of the sea which is completely separated from the city .
If you can see the water of sea or river water totally different from any city of India then you will consider yourself to be very lucky .
Amusement Parks were established in an area of 100 square kilometres in the Bay of Bengal .
coral reef is the life here .
As far as possible you will get to see rocks of coral on the graves .
Just a few moments back when we heard President Nasheed 's speech we were standing outside his residence .
It is not believed that we were in front of the highest testimony of another country so far no one was safe .
We were very happy that after going inside the door of their house taking photographs of the Vasara and the gardens situated about 50 kilometres away .
Can you think about any political house in India in such a way ?
It was also known here that president sometimes went to his office two blocks ahead crossing the road on foot .
Every word about Maldives is surprising .
That is why I was waiting for the next day .
That is , on that day some special event would have taken place .
In the morning a ship with cruise brought us to Airport island .
From there we reached the base of Maldives after roaming in the runway .
We immediately recognized the sea plane moving above us when the cruise was reaching near Male in the evening .
How many photographs were there that were there .
But then did not lose , the next day got the opportunity to travel in it .
We had to go to Rongli Island at a distance of hundred and five kilometres from the sea plane of Trans Maldives .
It is unforgettable to see thousands of resorts and coral islands of the Maldives spread over the sea plane flying for about a thousand kms at a height of approximately 1000 kms .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
It is an adventurous and adventurous experience to take the breath seriously .
But after reaching the Conrad Resort of Hillton Hotels in Rangali island it seemed as if we had reached in some other world .
In such a world , outside it there is no relation between any other country .
Wasn ' t it even like this that it was difficult to get such a beauty or luxury on them .
Tour is also possible on feet or the vehicles running with battery etc .
The scene of the life style of the tribes on both the sides of the bridge passing from Jata to the main island is marvellous .
Now we were not able to believe ourselves naturally to the nature around us , we reached such a place where we could not imagine .
We reached the room of glass after crossing the sea water several metres down with the help of stairs that was inside the water .
This room is usually a dining room .
We can see all kinds of small and big fish , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating food sitting on the decorated chairs there was a lot of thrill in us .
The fare of seeing this island on coming to this island from Male to Sipline is 47 thousand rupees per person .
We did n't feel like returning from there .
We all were ready to throw our passport in water .
But you know , this is not that easy .
We got scared in this belief that whenever there is a chance , luck is there for sure .
I have been planning to get out of Delhi for several days but due to stress of work no way was possible .
Wild life was favorite since childhood but due to this reason I thought of going to Jim Corbett as well .
In 2006 after biking till Pegong lake situated ahead of Khardungla pass in Laddakh this is another bike .
In the month of 27 December we set out from Delhi for Jim Corbett but from the enthusiasm with which we set out smoke has vanished .
We were really tired in the journey between Hapur and Gajraula .
The smoke from the top and not being right in front of the road .
Many times it seemed as if we had fallen .
As if we reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Right we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres away from Ramnagar .
Our resort was near Dhikoli , which we had booked earlier .
On that day there was a special program that even when we were cold we went for a walk on the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we set out for Corbett museum , which is situated at a distance of 2 k . . from far .
From there we went to tour Ramnagar situated below .
It was evening right to return .
Just as we set out from Delhi we saw a lion roaming around in the forest for sure , in a dream the whole night I saw a lion .
In the middle of a deep sleep at night I suddenly heard a big noise and after that the dog started screaming and did n't stay for two hours .
Before hesitation the decision of touring Kaladungi and Carbet Fall has come .
Kaladungi is thirty k . . away , only then has Corbett come on the Fall road .
Kaladungi is a Jim Corbett museum where some special items related to his real life are kept .
It was twelve and a half to return .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village .
On reaching the resort gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they had provided the facility of seating there in one Saint Bijari .
When asked about number one then it was said that there was so much of grassland and Tiger had come towards this side to save from cold .
On reaching Bijanni gave us a guide , who takes two hundred and fifty to roam around for four hours .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
We saw several species of animals and deer of this place .
Inside we saw two tiger elephants , whose big teeth are .
I boldly photographed .
In the middle the guide began to ride on the tiger .
Guide said that there are around 150 tigers in the park , of which some have died now .
At many places we also got to see its claws but I was undeterred by not seeing tigers .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
There was a tiger in my mind .
That is why I remembered one of my old friends of Haldwani .
I photographed him .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
He asked if he had seen the tiger .
His sayings are as if they are an arrow .
I told you slowly , no .
There is no permission to take a bike to the park .
Somebody gave us advice that you take a ride inside .
