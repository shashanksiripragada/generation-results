Their language is different from Gujarat .
Yes, it's different.
Sind on one side of Kutch and on the other side Gujarat is a mix of two languages also .
This language is called Kochi .
Although there is no script of this language .
To write Kutchi it has to be written in Gujarati script .
The same Anjar city is situated near Bhoolbhulaiya where many times the earthquake had occurred and the entire city was destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisalmer - Toral is near Anjar .
Jaisalmer - the story of Toral is very thrilling .
If we want to return by that route then we will have to take a month 's leave and at the same time school will open in Bombay .
So what can be done . Now we will take the journey of the train by moving the fast buses of Gujarat .
The small train of metre gauge from Bhuj reaches Rajkot .
From there another train of metre gauge will reach Ahmadabad and will reach Bombay through the broad gauge train .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through a very bad phase nowadays .
Due to the fear of increasing terror in depression and South Asia there has been a deep impact on tourism business .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan done counting in the major states of the country has been found very less .
According to the recent status of the Rajasthan government in 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan was 10 percent less than in 2008 .
According to the number of national tourists the number of national tourists is 9 . 77 percent and number of foreign tourists is 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 were domestic and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were there in comparison to that in 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 were national and 73 lakh 414 foreign tourists .
People associated with tourism are very troubled by this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of ' Rajputana Holiday Home said that due to business recession and panic incidents tourism has affected the business of tourism a lot .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not develop strong fundamentals of our country .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists coming to France is maximum .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy prefer Rajasthan .
This year has been very good in terms of tourism .
After 2000 the number of tourists of Rajasthan decreased for the first time .
Nothing has happened from the point of view of tourism .
For deserts , palaces , forts , ponds , forest tourists everything has been kept in an old condition .
In the tourism sector , in order to work on the name of rural tourism , medical related tourism , adventure tourism all the governments are increasing but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get minimum facilities of facilities .
The incident of rape and molestation has also happened in the last few years with the foreign tourists in Rajasthan on the international level .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry many years ago but it was limited to only till paper .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of success in tourism .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the base of tourism , the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides the facility of accommodation , food , travel , boating etc . to tourists .
There are a total of 75 units in this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motels , 8 Cafeteria , three travellers , one travel and two trains Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the situation of this corporation has changed very badly for some years .
The loss of RTDC occurred in 2008 - 09 at a cost of Rs . 185 lakh which was estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The hotel condition of this corporation is such that in the last five years even 40 percent of these hotels did not get filled .
Along with the hotel the other units of the corporation have also faced huge losses .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Hills .
Tourists are not attracted towards this railway .
Even after reducing the fare it was not able to attract the tourists .
In such a situation the interest of the tourists towards Pushkar Fair has come down .
In 2007 - 08 AD in this fair the number of tourists settled in the tourist villages formed by RTDC has reduced to 217 this year from 398 foreign tourists .
Amidst all this the interesting thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth of attractions of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Royal train .
There is unlimited benefit by this train .
In the past year on this railway RTDC has received a profit of 9 . 5 crores .
In the tourism sector of Rajasthan it is natural to get worried due to this loss .
Tourism is the biggest source of economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the mind of man then he can make gold from the earth .
Subrata Roy has proved this by the construction of the modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
The dreams that he saw everyday , when he was able to achieve some success , he felt happy in his eyes .
His happiness was seen while inaugurating the first airport of Ambo Valley .
The work of Ambo Valley started and today Amby Valley has been successful in making its place in the form of a beautiful city .

Trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
Eyes start looking towards the light redness emerging in the sky amidst the snow laden mountain ranges of the left .
The wind is very cold .
In the weather , along with cold you can also feel moisture .
After listening to the chirping of the trees under the trees it is necessary to pay attention to the chirping of the trees .
Because of silence in the weather and fog before sunrise nothing can be seen .
Eyes get stuck on the lymph of the east .
He feels like sitting on a bench in the verandah .
With the very touch of the hands the mild sound of the jaws convulse and the hands fail to feel cold .
This was the first experience in the life of spending a night in this small village amidst mountains covered with snow of Switzerland thousands of miles away from our country .
This is my third trip to Switzerland .
Prior to this more time has been spent in Geneva or in their neighborhood .
The dense population settled on both the sides of the river Saru is spread up to a large extent on the soft slopes .
This is the valley of Ronan the main river of Switzerland on both the sides of which are small and big cities .
The vehicle on the Rajpath and the road along the Ron river is visible clearly .
300 k . . away and half an hour 's journey by car , half an hour 's journey , parallel to Geneva lake and half an hour from east to town named Ron river , Geneva lake , which is called France lake , is mixed with it .
Geneva city is situated on the western coast of this lake , 100 km long and 10 km wide .
The lake here again moves westward by becoming a river .
The mountain ranges of Dhabal , skycraping , Alps located on the banks of Dai and lake .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Lauka we reached the mountainous road in the northern direction by the exit gate from the left side .
Because of the slope of the mountains being south - west the sun rises in full in the afternoon .
The quantity of snow here is almost negligible in comparison to the valley .
The height of snow goes up as much as it is .
On both sides of the road despite good snow freezing there is no special cold in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
We reached a small village named Thalassery after completing the journey of about 20 kms on the circular mountainous way in half an hour .
Shelley - This is a big , big , multi-storied bungalow of the whole structure of the arched roof .
Along with the arrangement of vehicle in the basement made of cement concrete of this three storied bungalow there are rooms for controlling essential services like current , water , laundries etc .
Switzerland is famous for grape cultivation .
This is the main center of making wine - grapes .
On 37 % land of the whole of the canteen there is cultivation of grapes .
The orchards of grapes located at both the sides of Ron Valley provides a unique view to the beauty there .
Taking grape gardens , strolling , rest in the villages there at night and taking them to a factory to make wine of grapes , wine strips are an inseparable part of tourism here .
There is a big museum of grapes in a small cottage made in the 12th century in which foreign tourists keep on booking an advance for seeing .
Once again we are going through the dense forests of banyan .
The road of three to four kms was going bad in the question of children .
Then only in one bend the dramatic and charming change comes in view .
Right in front , there are many houses on the upper slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road .
People are skiing on the slopes above the village .
The dense forest of cedar trees is spread up to the heads of mountains on the skiing slopes .
Heavy snow falls all around .
The roofs of the house of slums are shining with the sun 's rays .
We reached the village in five minutes .
This silence is spread over here as well .
From the peaks of the mountains all around to the valleys the empire of white snow .
In the next five minutes we reached a big circle in the middle of that time .
Many times the name is ' leukerabad ' .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Likud is about 1500 .

The name of this village is ' Alienin ' .
Albanian village is one of the conserved places in the form of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can go for taxi only and there is no checking .
The journey is on , state is different , but the mountain is the same , tree is also one , wind is also one .
Louse in head of whole body is also one .
The glitter of weather during rainy season is also one .
As soon as the project of Darjeeling is ready , the decision to take a glimpse of Kurseong is taken first .
Carseng is a small town of Darjeeling .
The tea gardens are filled with dust - dirt through the jungle .
Excellent tea is famous for producing tea .
On moving from Siliguri to Darjeeling , first tea garden welcomes you in a cheerful way .
Heart gets impressed to go to the tea garden for the first time .
Green hills on one side and lush green valleys on the other .
Here at times the forest is seen sometimes in the tea gardens .
The empire of greenery all around .
Once we had gone to Muscat . neither would we see these natural forests nor would we see these tea trees planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
As beautiful as the jungle was in the jungle , it was as beautiful as the tea gardens .
On looking at the way it feels as if creation is unparalleled .
The tar and verandahs of serpentine rice used to pass through the road .
Time was also about to go .
The ones which were not cut are the forests and tea estates .
At times small settlements can be seen .
From a distance only a hill station - house , etcetera seemed to be dense .
This was Kurseong .
Standing at one place here we made the program of roaming all day .
Therefore taking a car we set out to roam around Kurseong .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
In the front that was to reach till the deer park , we had to leave the car with a lot of down .
Despite Kurseong being full of beauty it has not yet been able to develop or become famous as a tourist place .
Although the city is quite clean .
Despite road being deserted . the greed to reach till deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing paths between incense sticks was giving us courage .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
There is a point located at a height on the other side of this city .
This is called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the British period lovers used to commit suicide by jumping here .
These days it is connected with a park and a restaurant .
There is a dome here from which the whole of the city can be viewed and seen .
In the tea garden nearby women make use of the tea leaves by putting the towel on the back with a lot of speed .
There is an exhibition outside the city of Kurseong , but that day we could not go there , because the weather of tea gardens seems more important .
The next day it was decided to go for Darjeeling .
It was quite thrilling at this place but it seemed as if we were going to roam around in such a way that it was raining .
But the connection was so good that on reaching Rock Garden we got benefit from sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with stones , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The road reaching here is more charming than this .
On going a little below from here one can get to see Gangamaya , surrounded by hills .
The scene of the waterfall amidst rocks here is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we got to see that there is a sloping fountain of rock and marble in Ganga - Maa , beautiful scenery of the waterfall .
Both these places are present in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling a lot .
On getting up from the vehicle in Darjeeling we saw the loop of wind in the morning .
From here the whole of the hill and city of Darjeeling is seen through binoculars .
The mood of the weather was good till now .
But those people who are moving towards the monastery they know from where the cloud comes and gathers and starts glittering .
In the evening a plan was made to walk and buy molasses .
Tour of Toy Train make it more attractive in the journey of Darjeeling .
Tour of Toy Train from Darjeeling to Sleep and From Sleep to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake and a little break in the garden .
On this road tourists also go to Pashupatinath market , where sweaters knitted by the Nepalese artisans etc are available .
There is also an arrangement for Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is actually a city of Darjeeling district but its color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here , rather there is voice of jungles - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are - Lava and Lohegaon , which are full of jungles and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time I could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata for the winters .
A journey of my recent past was quite thrilling and entertaining .
This journey was neither of foreign countries nor of Rajasthan , it was very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an exciting element of tourism which sometimes attracts us towards itself , some special place some ships of water or some royal train or some city like Pink City or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people get attracted to it .
The place which I am talking about is built about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place was built , it is really like drenching in forest .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
Till now my guide on the subject of my comrade Ram Babu Manikarn . never thought before of Sahiba that I could live like this in my forest .
50 percent of staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not find work in the heritage hotels .
Ram Babu , the resident of Azamgarh , used to work in Jaipur before and now this royal garden is there .
He has kept his activities in a new style .
The meaning of Sahiba is Aman Bagh .
Nobody here addresses you in English .
Such bugyals are really pleasant places for peace and happiness .
This bugyal also has its own history and the biggest point of view is to introduce one to the neighbouring country as well .
There is no need to go away , very few people among the residents of Jaipur have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of such a bugyal many big people of the country and abroad have come here .
I remember that night when Shebana had invited me there today but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh by forgetting the road .
This time suddenly I reached there to invite my foreign guests , and I felt that those who want to spend a good holiday in a short time they should go to such a bugyal .
This bugyal is one of the seven bugyals in which the king of Alwar used to take rest for hunting .
It was built in nineteen or twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees from the sky the first sight of such bugyal will impress you .
The way you enter inside the will be welcomed by the way you will feel that here the attention is paid on divine peace .
Along with the bandage of malikholia -LRB- palanquin -RRB- the Sajeev pronoun of the mantra of Manglachar is done .
We reached in the evening and fixed our destination for a ride .
My Major sister Jackie who was in a hurry says , ' This is a very interesting thing .
Everything is inspired from the havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is the lighting facility here .
It 's not surprising that everything is new and artistic , that the reward given to such bugs has been given in recent times .
The manager fix our program for morning .
First of all we took a walk with Rambabu and then we made a trip to Bhangarh ji .
Walking on the way to the Karkad road we saw the fort of Ajwagad , on which the sun lighted gradually .
We saw Sukhi lake with which farmers were growing .
This year it did not rain but for the first time it got to see the cultivation of tobacco .
The chance to see rural life for Jackie was very pleasant .
After this we went to Bhangra by jeep .
In the morning we saw a tourist in Holland sitting crumbled in deep thought .
It's a million dollars.
While leaving such a bug they gave a farewell after eating their jaggery and curd in traditional manner .
Now we understood that why tourists come here to spend so much money .
I have heard that a tour package is prepared for watching the life of tribals .
Is this right ?
Certainly this is done in several states and not one such state , and tourists show special interest in this tour .
This tour is usually organised from four days to two weeks and during this time tourists can be taken to different places .
Among these the living , eating etc . are also included .
This way an attempt is made to visit such a place where there has not been a lot of development and there has not been any special effect on the life style of the people and nature .
Along with this is also an old tourist spot .
Apart from this attention is also given on eating and drinking of fresh food .
Actually , the purpose of such tours is to make the tourists face to face with the lifestyle and traditions of living in these places .
Although it seems a bit difficult to imagine but this kind of tourism is really thrilling and different .
There is a different fun altogether in the bus .
Despite being with many of them you can take the pleasure of being alone .
Not just this , in this journey you can read books of your choice but to keep them busy for a long time .
Yes , it is true that with less expense and spending a lot of time in peace this tour demands you all .
To enjoy these tours there is a need to remember some special things when you are touring some foreign places in the bus .
Make the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior citizens of military age , children etc . get rid of this tour and there is facility of exemption for both .
However , if you buy ticket from before then it will be cheaper and you will get it better than you plan to travel the bus at the end .
Instead of taking tickets of both the directions check the round trips .
It is cheap .
Goods related rules are done specially this is why one should inquire about his weight and weight of the goods .
It does not happen that you have to leave your luggage in the terminal or pay the extra rent .
Also get to know the rules of insurance and compensation from tourism company .
Carry on bags etc . are appropriate for this tour .
Because it stops him from above the seat .
Keep this in mind that while changing the bus you are responsible for goods .
From where you get up by bus reach the destination within an hour .
In busy season you should especially keep this thing in mind .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better will be the place to sit .
While choosing the place to sit keep in mind the comfort of the place .
There is more sneeze in the back and one can not get to fall properly in the front .
If you go to the bathroom repeatedly then take a place where you are , and if you do not like to get bored then it is better to take a seat towards the window .
Now it's a trick.
If both of you are trying hard then first sit in the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the adjacent seat .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then this plan will be successful .
If there is facility of bathroom in the bus then while choosing the place to sit remember this thing as if sitting there becomes difficult .
Talk to the bus driver or conductor .
With this you will be able to know many important information .
Everybody is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
At this time you will not leave your luggage in the place because if you lose it then the people of that place will not take charge of it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back at the right time .
If you do not have time then you can take a new passenger and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .

In fact it will show you the view of a different world and you will always get the feeling of remembering it .

Louis cruise is very popular in European companies and cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Louis cruise has stopped the service now but there is hope of resumption of this service in October .
You can tour Maldives every night for a cruise of three days at least Rs . 5850 per person in a submarine ship .
That is the rent for one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
If they are two adults then they are free of cost for the children of less age .
What else would you like?
The fare of cruise - tea , lunch , food etc are included .
Always with entertainment .
You can take the enjoyment of the entertainment , activity of your pocket after reaching capital Malayala Kalagramam - from sea plane ride to underwater launch .
To roam around the big airport suddenly on setting up a sea plane in front of you , you will feel it 's toy .
But this toy plane with a height of 12 - 15 metres is a unique experience for touring the islands like Maldives .
One does not even know when to run like a speed boat on water suddenly gets up in the air .
In the entire flight you can experience the flight of ordinary flights .
Your eyes will always remain beneath - seeing resorts and coral islands in different kinds of blue water of Maldives .
How clean is everything .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these , which has twenty sea planes .
If you want then you can take a flight of around Rs . 4000 -LRB- every person -RRB- on an hour or you can hire a plane for the entire day -LRB- definitely take a taxi for that -RRB- .
If you are going from Malayala Kalagramam to some other island then the travel of sea plane is essential because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you will never want that it will end .
The journey from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in the north till Mavilaru -RRB- of sea plane is done on the island of Maldives .
We were in the store of the biggest antique and woollen shops of the capital in the Ahmadi Bazar of Malar .
One day before the president of all the salesmen Maldives Mohammad Nasheed had heard at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen .
On telling truthfully I did not see any Indian speaking with much interest the President or Prime Minister of India .
But when this question arises about the formation of a new identity then it is important to have that seriousness .
Many people meet at the water level in the cabinet of Maldives in October , even if they take out the head of Maldives then how much poor will the world become ?
There is a special thing about the beauty there .
In this small country it does not seem so beautiful .
While going towards the jetty to return back to the cruise after that tour the time when we saw how much of the value of the beauty of this place was known by the people walking on the road towards the sea .
The water is so clear that in the light of the lampspost colorful fish is found to be seen to be several metres deep .
This is that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
It is a good fortune if you get to see some centimeters clean in the sea or river water attached to any city of India .
To come on the ambie aquarium we remembered two hours in the evening in Malana .
coral reef -LRB- Mongla -RRB- is the life here .
Even then you will get pimples on the buttocks .
Just before listening to the speeches of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
It is not believed that we were in front of the highest figures of any country , no one was able to see them till far .
We enjoyed lifting our hands inside the door of his bungalows and taking the photo of the garden only 50 metres away .
Can you think of any leader's house in India like this?
We also came to know that the president had to go to his office two blocks ahead crossing the road on foot .
Everything related to the Maldives is amazing .
That is why we were waiting for the next day at Brussels .
It seemed as if this would be a special day .
In the morning we took a boat from the cruise to our airport in Iceland .
From there we took the wheel of the runway and reached the base of the Trans Maldives .
Earlier in the evening when the cruise was reaching near the mall then we got to know the flights flying above .
I had seen many pictures .
But then did we know that the next day we would get a chance to ride on this plane .
We were going to Rongli Island at a distance of five kilometres from the sea plane of Trans Maldives .
In this sea plane flying at a height of around 1000 metres watching thousands of resort and coral island spread in the sea level is unforgettable .
This beauty of water is not seen anywhere else .
In thrill and excitement there was a flight to stop breathing .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of Hillton Hotel in Rongli Island it felt as if we have come to some other world .
In such a world there is no relation between the outer world .
There was no such thing as this that it is difficult to find beauty and luxury outside .
Tour can be done in or in battery operated cars .
From Jati to the main island the scene of water life on both the sides of the bridge was marvellous .
Till now we could not adapt to the environment of our neighborhood , we have reached such a place which was unimaginable .
Climbing down the stairs of the sea we reached such a house of glass which was under water .
This house was actually a dining room .
Everywhere on the other side of glass tiny fishes , corals , snorkeling and scuba diving were visible .
The imagination of food sitting on the floor gives a lot of thrill there .
The fare of seeing this island on coming from Malayala Kalagramam on this island is 47 thousand rupees per person .
I was not thinking of returning from there .
We were ready to take our passport in water .
But I knew it was not possible .
With the feeling of sadness I returned with the hope that sometimes I will bring his fortune here only .
I was planning to go out of Delhi for a long time but due to busy schedule this work was not possible .
There was a lot of love for wild life in childhood therefore it was felt that this time we should go to Jim Corbett .
In 2006 before Khardungla pass this was the second bike ride after the trekking of Pangong Lake .
On 27 December we left for Delhi for Jim Corbett but with the inspiration that fog had reduced our speed .
The road between Hapur and Gajraula was quite tired .
Again on it is a fog and a vicious cycle .
Many times it seemed that it would fall .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park was 20 kilometres before Ramnagar .
Our resort was near the park in Tikuli , the booking of which was done beforehand .
That day there was no special program , despite being cold we went for a walk on the bank of Kosi .
After staying there for two - three hours we left for the Corbett museum which was near the Ghangadi gate at a distance of two kilometres .
From there we went to tour Ramnagar down .
It was afternoon to return .
I had come out of Delhi with a conviction that lions would definitely be seen roaming in the forest but during the entire night in dream I saw tigers .
Suddenly I heard a loud noise in the depths of the night and the dog who started to cry then he kept running for two hours .
Initially the advice to tour Kaladungi and Corbett fruits came .
Kaladungi is 30 kilometres away , Corbett falls on the way only .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett in Kaladung where some special things related to his life are kept .
It was half past twelve to return back .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett is settled in this village itself .
After reaching the resort Safari gypsy was waiting .
It is said that they have made arrangements of seating in number one site , Bijarani .
Regarding number one it is said that the grass there is more and that the tigers there come towards this only to escape from the cold at this time .
On reaching Bijrani a guide is given us that to roam around for 4 hours take 250 rupees .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw the elephants of both the teeth , which had a long teeth .
I took a photo at the spot .
In the middle of it the guide began to trek on the tiger .
Guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park , many of whom died in this few days .
In many places we got to see the footprints of the tiger but the heart was restless because it did not see the tiger .
On the third day we were returning to Delhi .
There was a tiger spot in my head .
That is why I remember an old friend of Haldwani .
I called him just like that .
I told him that the corbet has come .
He asked if the tiger had seen it .
His words were bound to be arrows .
I told you slowly that I did not see .
There was no permission to take a bike inside the park .
One of us said that to roam inside take a safari .
