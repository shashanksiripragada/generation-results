Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaste
Enthusiastic Deepa Jyotirlingos
I bow down to such a divine light.
What could be a better idea to remember this lamp, let us spread the message of positivity and prayer to end the feeling of enmity.
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community is participating in it, but now the governments of many countries, its citizens and the social organizations of that country celebrate Diwali with full fervor.
In a way, India realizes there.
Friends, Festivals in the world were an attraction for tourists themselves.
Our India, which is a country of festivals, has immense possibilities in festivals.
Be it Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal or Bihu, we should try to involve people from other states as well as other countries in the joy of festivals.
We have so many different festivals in every state and every region - people of other countries have a lot of interest in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in increasing festive tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, it was decided to do something differently during this Diwali.
I had said - let us celebrate this Diwali with our women's strength and the immense success that India has achieved. That is, the honour of Lakshmi of India.
And see, soon after that, there was a lot of inspiring stories in the social media.
Kodipka Ramesh from Warangal wrote on Namo App that my mother is my strength.
When my daughters died in 1990, my mother took up the responsibility of five children.
Today, all five brothers are in good business.
Ramesh ji, my greetings to our mothers.
Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for her there is Lakshmi of India on Major Khushboo, who is the daughter of a bus driver and she was the leader of all the women contingents of the Assam Rifles.
For poetry Tiwari, the Lakshmi of India is his daughter, which is also his strength.
He is proud that his daughter is doing a fine painting.
She has also secured a very good grade in the CLAT exam.
Megha Jain has written that an elderly woman of 92 years of age is providing free water to the passengers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Meghaji is inspired by the spirit of humility and compassion of Lakshmi of India.
Many such stories have been told by the people.
You must take inspiration from that and do something similar in your surroundings as well.
I salute all these Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the famous poetess of the 17th century, Sanchi Hanamma, wrote a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
It is the same feeling that we are not talking about every Lakshmi of India. It seems that the foundation of this thing was laid in the 17th century.
What a beautiful word, how beautiful a feeling and how good a thought are in these poems in Kannada.
Our daughters are our pride and the glory of these daughters is a strong identity of our society and that future is bright.
My dear countrymen, 12th November 2019 is a day on which the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
Guru Nanak Devji's influence is not only in India but in the entire world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters have settled in many countries of the world, who are fully devoted to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget my visit to the Gurudwaras of Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot to say about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, which I can tell you, but there will be a lot to do with Mann Ki Baat.
He always kept the spirit of service supreme.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji believes that there cannot be any value in the work of selfless service.
He stood firm against social evils like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Devjis message has reached far and wide in the world.
He was one of the greatest travellers to our times.
He had visited several places and had won the hearts of all by his simple nature, humility and simplicity.
Guru Nanak Devji undertook many important religious journeys, which were called depression.
Taking the message of harmony and equality, be it the North, be it the South, the East or the West, he went to every direction, he met people, saints and sages everywhere.
It is believed that the famous saint of Assam, Sankardev, had also taken inspiration from him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
While travelling to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the water problem there.
Guru Nanak Ji is a famous place in Bidar, which is dedicated to the memory of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
During a sad demise, Guru Nanak ji travelled north, Kashmir and its surroundings too.
Due to this, a very strong relationship has been established between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji went to Tibet, where the people considered him Guru.
They are also revered in Uzbekistan where they had gone.
During one of his sad moments, he also travelled to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They were in the minds of lakhs of people who followed their teachings and are still following it.
Just a few days ago, there were about 85 Ambassadors from Delhi to Amritsar.
The Prime Minister visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar, which is the 550th Prakash Parv celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
The envoys who presented their credentials were: - 1. The 15th President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented their credentials to the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (October 3, 2018).
After that, several Ambassadors cast their photographs on social media, writing about good experiences.
I wish that the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will give us more inspiration to bring his thoughts and ideals into our lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that the 31st of October will be remembered by all of you.
This day marks the birth anniversary of the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who was a great leader in uniting the nation.
On the one hand, Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to unite people while on the other hand, he was also engaging with those with whom he had ideological differences.
Sardar Patel used to look at small things with great depth.
In fact, he was a man of detail, urging detail.
At the same time, he was a master at organizational skills.
Thousands of delegates from across the country were coming to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 1921.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the arrangements made for the session.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
It was decided that no one would be deprived of water.
Moreover, he was concerned about the stealing of the goods or shoes of a representative at the venue. And you will be surprised to know that Sardar Patel did that.
He urged them to connect with the farmers and make Khadi Pashmina.
The farmers produced a variety of pizzas and sold it to the delegates.
He put his shoes in these bodies, and kept the body with him, leaving the tension of stealing the slippers in his delegation's mind.
On the other hand, the sale of Khadi grew significantly.
Our country will always remain grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a commendable role in the Constituent Assembly.
They have done an important job of establishing fundamental rights, so that there is no discrimination based on caste and creed.
Friends, As the first Home Minister of India, SardarVallabhbhai Patel had done a great work and historic work of uniting the institutions.
This was the specialty of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel that he had his eyes on every event.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role in the integration of the country was discussed in certain regions.
He told Mudaliar Bandhu, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar and Arcot Laxman Swami Mudaliar that he should take the people of Travancore to India and unfurl the tricolour there.
The tricolor was hoisted immediately after his order and was hoisted in the sight of the neighbouring country to capture Lakshadweep.
Later, Sardar Patel told Mudaliar that he should personally ensure that Lakshadweep gets all necessary support for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is making an important contribution in India's progress.
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope you will visit these beautiful islands and the coast of the sea.
My dear countrymen, on the 31st of October, 2018, the Statue of Unity, built in the memory of Sardar Saheb, was dedicated to the country and the world.
This is the highest statue in the world.
The statue of the freedom fighter in America is twice its height.
The highest statue in the world fills every Indian with pride.
Every Indian had a sense of pride.
You will be happy to know that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists went to see the Statue of Unity.
This means that on an average 8500 people visit the Statue of Unity every day.
He expressed his conviction that SardarVallabhbhai Patel had in his heart the same faith. Now there are several centres of attraction like election garden, flower garden, jungle safari, nutrition park for children, unity nurseries etc. which are constantly evolving and giving a boost to the local economy and also providing new employment opportunities to the people.
Keeping in mind the facilities of the tourists coming to these villages, people of many villages are providing facilities like home stay in their homes.
Professional training is also being provided to those who provide home stay facility.
I am confident that the people there have also started the cultivation of Dragon fruit and it will soon become a major source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, for the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, the Statue of Unity can be a subject of study.
We are all witnesses to the fact that how a place could be developed as a world famous tourist destination in a year.
People from across the country and abroad come there.
Several facilities such as transport, leisure, guides and eco-systems are developing automatically.
There is a lot of economic activity and people are providing facilities as per the requirement of the passengers.
The government is playing its role.
Friends, Last month, Time magazine has come forward to place a statue of unity in the 100 important tourist places of the world.
I hope you all will be able to take some time out of your precious time and see the Statue of Unity.
But I urge every Indian to travel to at least 15 tourist places in India with family and stay there for the night. My request will remain with you.
Friends, As you are aware, every year since 2014, 31st October is celebrated as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas.
This day gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
Run for Unity - Run for Unity is being organised on 31st October every year.
It will involve people from every section of the society, from every level.
Run for Unity is a symbol of the fact that this country is one, this country is moving in one direction and we are seeing a goal.
Similarly, if we look at them these days, people see a verse and a widget about the Marathon.
Run for Unity is also one such unique provision.
Here, we have to run, we are connecting for Fit India and also for Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat.
And because of this, not only the body but the mind and the culture have taken India to new heights for its unity.
For this, you can get to know about the Run for Unity around you in the city you are living in.
In this portal, the Run for Unity is being organised all over the country.
All of you will run on the 31st of October - for the unity of India and for your own fitness
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the country with the thread of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a culture in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every turn and place.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to strengthen the unity and harmony of the country.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict on the Ram Janm Bhoomi.
Just a few days ago, there was an atmosphere.
How many people of different types had come to the ground
The group used to play games to take advantage of the situation.
What kind of language was used to heal the atmosphere .
Attempts were made to fill up loud noises in different voices.
On the one hand, there was a lot of turmoil in the atmosphere for two weeks. But when the results of Ram Janmabhoomi came, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all sects and saints gave a lot of restraint.
Try to reduce the stress in the environment.
But even today it is a day in my mind.
These things should always be kept in mind and they give us a lot of strength.
This is an example of how the spirit of unity gives strength to the country.
My dear countrymen, on the 31st of October, our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated on the same day.
I also pay tribute to the country which suffered a major setback today.
My dear countrymen, today, if one story is being heard far and wide in every household, if one hears a story from every village, from the north to the south, from the east to the west, in every corner of India, then that story is about cleanliness.
Every person, every family, every village wants to share their pleasant experiences in terms of cleanliness, because this effort of cleanliness is the efforts of 1.25 billion Indians.
1.25 billion Indians are the owners of their results.
But there is also a pleasant and entertaining experience .
I have heard it, I want to tell you that too.
Just imagine, the highest battlefield in the world, where the temperature falls from 50 to 60 degrees Celsius.
In the air there is only the name of oxygen .
Staying in such difficult situations is no less than a feat.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country by pressing their chests but they are also running a clean Siachen campaign there.
I appreciate the people of the country for this wonderful commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
It is so cold there that even disruption is difficult.
In such a situation, decontamination and management of waste is an important task.
In such a scenario, 130 tons and more garbage from the glaciers and its surroundings is a great service.
We all know that Siachen is such a part that it is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, running a cleanliness campaign here means ensuring clean water for those living in the lower areas, using the water of rivers like Nubra and Shauk as well.
My dear countrymen, festivals are a celebration of a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially during Diwali, every family gets something or the other to buy from the market.
The more we try to buy local, the more 'Gandhi 150' will become a great opportunity.
And I urge you to buy anything made in the hands of our weavers and in the hands of our Khadi artisans.
In this Diwali too, we must have bought a lot before Diwali.
But there are many people who would be thinking that if they go to Diwali then they will get a little cheaper.
There are many people whose purchases are still pending.
I would like to urge you all to come forward and buy local products while offering the best wishes of Deepawali.
Look how important a dream of Mahatma Gandhi can play
But sometimes there is a fire that doesn't exist.
There is wound somewhere .
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great fervor.
Mann Ki Baat , September 2018
Every Indian, be it any region, caste, religion, creed or language, is ever ready to express our joy and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, India's 1.25 billion Indians celebrated the festival of valour.
We remember the targeted attacks in 2016, when our soldiers gave a befitting reply to those who fought in the face of terrorism.
In different parts of the country, our armed forces have put up exhibitions so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the young generation can understand their strengths.
How capable we are and how our soldiers sacrifice our lives to protect the countrymen.
On the occasion of Parakram Parv, I remind the youth of the glorious legacy of our armed forces and inspire us to maintain the unity and integrity of the country.
I too participated in an event in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of valor.
It is certain that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to those who try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our country.
We believe in peace and are committed to promoting it but never compromise with respect and pay the price of sovereignty of the country.
India has always been committed and committed to peace.
This was a feat that our soldiers had achieved in the direction of peace.
Even today, India is one of the countries that has sent more and more troops to the UN peacekeeping operations.
For decades, our soldiers have played a pivotal role in maintaining peace and tranquility in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, the story of the sky is different.
One of the things that people have in their interest during the Republic Day celebrations is the fly past, in which our Air Force has demonstrated its might by airing heavily in the air.
We are celebrating Air Force Day on 8th October.
I heartily congratulate all the air warriors and their families who are serving the nation.
When the Pakistani aggression launched in 1947, the Air Force ensured that Indian soldiers and material would reach the battlefield in a timely manner to defend Srinagar.
The Air Force also gave a befitting reply to the enemy in 1965.
Who does not know the freedom struggle of Bangladesh in 1971
In 1999, the Air Force also played an important role in the liberation of Kargil from the scourge.
The Air Force carried out a bomb blast round the clock at the enemy's shelter in Tiger Hill.
Be it relief and rescue operations or disaster management, the nation is grateful to our air warriors for their commendable work.
His work in combating natural calamities like storms, floods and forest fires is remarkable.
The Air Force has also set an example in ensuring gender equality in the country. They have opened the doors of each of our departments for girls.
Now the Air Force is also giving the option of 'Parmant Commission' along with the Short Service Commission which I had announced from the Red Fort on the 15th of August this year.
India can proudly say that in our armed forces, there is not only male power but also female power.
Women are empowered and now they are getting armed too.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, one of our naval officers, AbhilashTomy, was struggling between life and death.
The entire country was concerned about how they could be saved.
We all know that AbhilashTomy is a brave soldier.
He is the first Indian officer to travel the world with a small name through any modern technology.
For the past 80 days, he had been keeping his pace at sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean, but the horrific sea storm caused a crisis in front of him, but the brave Indian Navy kept on fighting for many days in the sea.
I pray for the good health of AbhilashTomy. And this courage, his valour, resolve and the immense power of winning will certainly inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, even little children know the significance of the 2nd of October for our country.
There is another special significance on October 2 this year.
For two years from now, on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we are going to organize several events across the world.
Mahatma Gandhis thoughts inspired the entire world.
Whether it was Dr Martin Luther King Jr. or Nelson Mandela, everyone had power in Gandhi's mind and could fight a long battle to give our people the right to equality and dignity.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk about another important work of our revered Bapu which more and more people should make aware of.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
After that, in 1945, when the freedom struggle was emphasized, he prepared a revised version of those ideas.
Pujya Bapu put forth his thoughts on subjects such as farmer, village, worker's rights, cleanliness and the spread of education to the countrymen.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Pujya Bapu used to be a collection of people.
It was Bapu's specialty to connect people and to mix them with them. It was his nature.
Each one of them had experienced this thing when they had never experienced it.
He gave everyone an experience that it is most important and absolutely necessary for the country.
The biggest contribution to the freedom struggle is that they made this struggle a mass movement.
In response to the call of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle, people from all walks of life and every section of the society sacrificed their lives.
Bapu gave you an inspiring mantra.
Can they control our lives and regions
Can crores of people get Swaraj, those who are hungry and their soul is satisfied
Then you will find that your doubts are getting reduced and ego is getting over.
My dear countrymen, one of Gandhijis mantras is equally important today.
Today, the middle class of the country is growing, its economic strength, its rising purchasing power can we remember Bapu a moment while buying something
Who is fortunate to have direct or indirect benefit from this procurement.
I will be more delighted if the poorest of the poor gets the benefit.
Keeping this mantra of Gandhiji in mind, whatever we buy in the days to come, when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we must keep in mind that our purchase should benefit some or the other country. And those who have shed their sweat, those who have used their money, their talent, they should be benefitted in some form or the other.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I believe that this small step can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
But this was achieved and India got independence.
Similarly, today we can feel that my small work can also contribute in the economic progress of my country, in economic empowerment and in strengthening the poor to fight against poverty.
In today's era, this is the true patriotism, this is the work of venerated Bapu.
He said that all these Khadi clothes have been made very hard, every thread of it should work.
The sense of belongingness to the nation and affection towards the countrymen were embedded in the veins of that great personality of that childhood.
Two days later, along with the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji.
It is the name of Shastriji that inspires the people of India with unlimited devotion.
His humble personality has always been a matter of pride for every countryman.
The specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri is that he used to look humble from outside, but he was determined like a mountain from his mind.
His announcement of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is the identity of this great personality.
His selfless penance towards the nation had led to the clarion call for the soldiers and the farmers of the country to scale greater heights in a short span of about one and a half years.
My dear countrymen, today, when we remember revered Bapu, it is natural that he will not be able to speak on cleanliness.
The Swachhta Hi Sewa campaign started from 15th September.
Crores of people took part in it and I got the opportunity to work with the students of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I visited the school which was laid by Pujya Baba Saheb himself.
People from all parts of the country participated in the Shramdaan on the 15th of this month.
The institute also participated in the event.
School students, college students, NCC, NSS, youth associations, media groups, private industry, all have done a massive shramdaan.
I heartily congratulate all these Swachhta lovers.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful story not only in the country but in the entire world about which everyone is talking about it.
This time, India is hosting the largest ever Global Sanitation Convention in history, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC) - the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Cleanliness Ministers and experts from around the world have come together to share their experiences and experiments on cleanliness.
The closing ceremony of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on October 2, 2018, at the commencement of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Bapu.
My dear countrymen, in Sanskrit, there is a saying - , That is, justice is at the root of Swaraj. When there is a discussion of justice, the spirit of human rights is inherent in that.
This is especially necessary to ensure the freedom, peace and justice for the oppressed, the deprived section of the society.
The Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar provided for the protection of the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the NHRC National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 1993.
The NHRC would complete 25 years in a few days.
NHRC has worked to protect human rights and enhance human dignity.
Our beloved leader, the former Prime Minister of the country, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, had clarified that human rights are not a different concept for us.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has documented all the buildings of the Vedic period, Sukhinah.
NHRC has generated widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
In its journey of 25 years, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and faith in the people of India.
I believe that this is a promising thing for a healthy society and for the best democratic values.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been set up along with a national level Human Rights Commission.
As a society, there is a need to understand and practice the importance of human rights and this is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
This year too, let us organize Run for Unity in our villages, cities and towns with our efforts.
Run for Unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb as he worked for unity throughout his life.
I appeal to all of you that on 31st October, through 'Run for Unity', we should strengthen our efforts to connect every section of the society, every part of the country with the thread of unity, this will be a great tribute to them.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all for the holy festival of Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadashmi.
Thank you!
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
The entire country is celebrating the festival of Raksha Bandhan today.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious day.
Raksha Bandhan is a celebration of the bond between sisters and brothers, a symbol of love and faith.
Janmashtami will also be celebrated soon.
There will be an atmosphere of joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy and joy in all walks of life, including the one on the horse, the palanquin, Jai Kanhaiyalal ki, Govinda-Govinda.
The joy of being painted in the colors of Lord Sri Krishna is a bit different .
Sir, modern Sanskrit - Dinmasti.
Sanskrit Language Sarala Iti Sarva Vadanti.
Brothers and sisters, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, the day is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
At the same time, we Indians are proud that since Vedic times, Sanskrit has also played an important role in the propagation of knowledge.
In Sanskrit, and in the literature of this language, knowledge lies in every field of life.
Not only this, it is also said that Sanskrit language also mentions the mantras which give a detailed answer to this topic that how to challenge the temperature rise which is today's global problem.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Matiur village in Shivamoga district in Karnataka still use Sanskrit language for speaking.
You will be surprised to know that a special feature of Sanskrit language is that new words can be created in this language.
It has been said in a well-descripted Subhashita that how important the guru is in life - Aksharmastu , Gurushya - Prabodhite .
My dear countrymen, monsoon rains bring a new hope to our hardworking farmers.
It is a boon for the sand, dried trees and stagnant water as a result of severe heat.
But sometimes it brings the devastating floods, catastrophic floods.
Rainfall at most places with heavy falls at a few places very likely over the country.
I pray that those injured recover at the earliest, the Prime Minister said.
But even in such times of crisis, we see humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everyone is helping them at their own level whether it is in Kerala or in any other district of India.
He made relentless efforts to save the lives of those who were stranded in the floods.
Be it the Air Force, Navy or the Army, the Border Security Force, CISF, RAF, the Army have played an important role in rescue and relief operations.
In this holy month of Onam, let us pray that the country, especially Kerala, get the strength to come out of this crisis as soon as possible and also speed up the development journey of Kerala.
On behalf of all the countrymen, once again I would like to assure the people of Kerala and the people of the country that the entire country is with you in this hour of crisis.
He had gone a long way from active politics for the last 10 years.
But after 16th August the country and the world saw that even after 10 years of the common man of India, there was a lot of love for Atal ji.
India will always remain grateful to Atal ji for his 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change has brought about two major changes in the politics of India.
First of all, the size of the Cabinet of the States was restricted to 15 of the total number of seats in the State.
Secondly, the limitations imposed under the Counter-Terrorism Act were reduced from one clause to two clauses.
A clear guidelines were also issued to ensure that the members of the party were disqualified.
Atalji was a loyal patriot.
It was during his tenure that the time for presenting the Budget in the House was changed.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget in Parliament to earn the morning rent.
Some of the rules in the Code made it possible for the public to hoist the tricolour.
So, more and more Indians got the opportunity to unfurl our national flag.
Atal ji has done a great job of bringing our precious tricolor closer to the people.
In this regard, people are casting their vote as opponents.
I pay my tributes to Atalji on his behalf by reaffirming his resolve to fulfill the dream of a prosperous and developed India.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and that of Rajya Sabha was 74.
The Act will protect the interest of communities from SCs and STs.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had sentenced the culprits to death for just five days.
In Rajasthan too, a similar decision has been taken in the court of law against women in a similar manner.
This Act will play an effective role in preventing atrocities against women and girls.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
In this Monsoon Session of Parliament, all the Members have collectively provided a valuable account of the past year.
Today, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs at the public level.
My dear countrymen, today, millions and millions of Indians are being caught in the Asian Games in Jakarta.
The Asian Games are still going on.
I would like to congratulate all the players who have won medals for the country.
The number of medals won for the country has gone up, especially for our daughters.
Pay attention to your fitness, because a healthy and healthy country can build a prosperous and prosperous India.
Namaste, I respect your feelings.
Everyone gets surprised to see that Patan was built in the 11th century in Gujarat.
The land of India will have to be called as the laboratory of engineering.
Many engineers in India have come up with ideas only.
We have had one such gem in our tradition of carrying the legacy of great engineers.
Bharat Ratna is Dr.
M.
Visvesvaraya.
The Krishnaraj Sagar Dam built by him on the Kaveri river is still benefiting lakhs of farmers and the people.
In Kutch, it is called Bhoonga.
I have seen and experienced three earthquakes in these houses.
I myself have experienced three earthquakes in this house.
But go inside and see, you will not see any harm happening at all.
This house has been built by our ancestors in accordance with the nature and the geographical structure of this place.
After visiting the house, I felt that even before ages, the engineers of that period used to think about the local conditions and how they built the house according to it so that the common man could be protected.
Now that we celebrate Engineers Day, we must also think of the future.
There should be workshops at places.
What new things should we learn in the changing times
What things should people be taught
How to connect
Today, disaster management has become a major task.
The entire world is facing a natural crisis.
In such a scenario, how can a new look of structural engineering be
How will it have different courses
Why should a student learn these things
Many such things should be thought of when Engineers Day is celebrated.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivals.
Along with that, preparations for Diwali will also begin.
In Mann Ki Baat, you will keep on sharing your thoughts.
At the same time, we will continue to work for the development of our country with full vigour.
With this spirit, my best wishes to you all
The people of some areas are still waiting for Varuna.
India is vast and has diversity in it, but at times Varunaraja too has shown us the form of our liking and disposition.
In such a scenario, the most important responsibility lies with us, that we all become nature-loving and nature-friendly.
If we become Nature lovers, we will be able to strike a balance between Nature and Nature.
You all must have seen this incident on television.
In fact, it takes about a few hours to go and return to that cave.
When they came to know that they could not come out, they took refuge in a small height in the cave.
However, they did not have a day or two but they stopped within 18 days.
Now we can imagine how his moment and moment were in a mental state when he saw a direct death.
On the one hand, these children were struggling to deal with the crisis and on the other hand, humanity across the world was united and expressing the divine human values.
Especially, after seeing everyone's restraint, I feel that this is a learning, a learning and a learning quality.
The parents of those whose children were stuck inside, do not face any pain or discomfort.
But, patience and restraint with which the entire society goes through peaceful means is an important lesson for all of us.
In the entire operation, a soldier from Thailand Navy lost his life.
The whole world saw and realized that these jawans showed courage and patience to help the people stuck in the cave in a very difficult situation full of water and darkness.
This incident has shown that when humanity is united, such wonderful things are happening.
But for that we need to work only in a calm and stable manner and focus on what we are working for.
A few days ago, Neeraj ji, the beloved poet of our country, left us forever.
Neeraj ji was one of the specialties.
He had great faith in hope, faith, determination and self-confidence.
Neeraj ji's everything can be a source of inspiration and strength for all Indians.
Similarly, the months of July and August are very important for the farmers and the youth.
Because there is a problem of admission of colleges during this period .
Millions of youngsters like Satyam are coming out of school life and going to college.
Young people move on a new path in their lives.At a time when our focus is on getting out of the question, we are on the cut-off stage.
Now the attention of the students is drawn from home to the hostel.
The students have come out of their parents shade and come under the umbrella of the professors.
I am sure my young friends will be very excited and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, we had to leave our homes and leave our villages on the other side, we had to leave our villages in a safe environment and become self-reliant.
Many youngsters have to leave their homes for the first time to give a new direction and a new direction to their lives.
I would like to tell all of you to stay calm and enjoy this life.
You have to study, but as soon as you learn, you must have the natural eagerness to discover new things.
Old friends have a special value.
I used to hear about the educational success of a student named Ashram Chaudhary from a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, facing many challenges in life.
The MBBS entrance examination for AIIMS, Ashram Jodhpur has been concluded in the first attempt.
Similarly, Anushka Panda, a Divyang from Gurgaon, was born with a hereditary disease called spinal muscular atrophy.
All of them have shown the world how to overcome every difficulty faced by them with their resolve and determination.
If you look around, you will find many such examples.
Any good event happening in any part of the country, in every corner of the country, gives me energy.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I had noticed in a news item, in which it was written, Two youths realized the dream of Modi.
On reading the news, I came to know about how our youth today use technology for smart and creativity and how they try to bring about a change in the lives of the common man.
The incident was such that San Jose, the city of America, is considered to be the center of technology and once I was talking to the Indian youth there.
At that time I urged them to think about how they can use their talent and skills for India and take some time out and do something new.
I had made an appeal to the brain gain answers to the brain-drain problem.
Two IT professionals from Raebareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Bajpayee ji accepted my request and presented a new vision.
A smartgaon app has been developed by Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji using their professional skills.
This app will not only connect the people of the villages to the whole world, but will also be able to get information and information on their mobile phones.
The residents of Taudhakpur village in Raebareli, the village head sarpanch, the district magistrate, the chief district officer, have created awareness among the people for using this app.
Indeed, your visit to Pandharpur is a wonderful journey.
Friends, This year on 23rd July, Ashadhi Ekadashi is celebrated with great reverence in Pandharpur.
Pandharpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
In the footsteps of the great saints like Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram, the great Vithal named Thoun Vithal walked on foot towards Pandharpur, playing Talam Mridung.
Pilgrims visit Pandharpur to see Vitthal, also known as Vittoba or Pandurang.
It is the God that protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
People from the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense faith and devotion towards Panduranga.
Let us go to the Vitoba temple of Pandharpur and tell about its magnificence and beauty.
The essence of these saints lies in the message of harmony, love and brotherhood.
The Saints gave the mantra to give strength to the society to fight against superstitions.
He also encouraged them to continue their efforts to eradicate social evils from the society and inculcate a culture of compassion, equality and goodness in the minds of people.
Lokmanya Tilak was a sea of courage and self-confidence.
The British tried their utmost to prove him guilty of sedition three times in 20 years.
This is not a simple thing.
Today, I would like to tell the countrymen about the incident that took place in Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
At that time more than 40,000 people were present in Ahmedabad to welcome him and during his visit Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had got the opportunity to discuss with Tilak.
In this meeting, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel and Lokmanya Tilak had been impressed by their ideas and thoughts.
After the demise of Lokmanya Tilak on August 1, 1920, Shri Patel decided to make Tilak a memorial in Ahmedabad.
Finally, Tilaks statue was built and Sardar Saheb inaugurated the memorial on February 28, 1929, by Mahatma Gandhi, not by anyone else.
My dear countrymen, this statue is as rare as it is said that Lokmanya Tilak ji is sitting on a chair and on the bottom of Tilak ji is written 'Swaraj Hamara Hai'.
Public Ganesh Utsav, with traditional reverence and devotion, became an effective medium to spread awareness, collective work, to create a sense of harmony and equality among the people.
In view of this, there was a need to fight against the British in that particular period.
And the celebrations by Tilak served to unite everyone by breaking the barriers of caste and sects.
With the increasing popularity of these festivals in the times to come, it is evident that the heroes of our ancient traditions and history are also very much attracted to today's younger generation.
Today, in many cities, in almost every street, a mandapa of Ganesh festivals is being constructed.
All the families in the streets organize a Ganapati festival.
Here too, our youth gets a good opportunity, their leadership, festival organizers, program organizers and coordinators can develop the qualities of their leaders.
From the statue of Lord Ganesha to the decoration, everything should be eco-friendly.
Today, every Indian needs good governance and development.
I talk about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Azad put his life at stake, but he never bowed to foreign rule.
I am fortunate that I got the opportunity to visit this village where Chandra Shekhar Azad is located in the village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I also had the opportunity to pay my respects at the Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad, the brave-hearts like Chandrashekhar Azad who did not want to die by the bullets of the foreigners, fought till the end of the freedom struggle and sacrificed their lives.
This was one of his specialties.
Once again I salute these two great sons of Mother India Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
A few days ago, in the recently concluded Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championships held in Finland, India's valiant daughter Hima Das won a gold medal and made a new history.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhyan, has sent me an e-mail from Indonesia, which is currently preparing for the Asian Games.
In our e-mail, we have written that the most important moment in the life of an athlete is when he holds a tricolor in his hand.
Unity, we all are proud of you.
We are proud of you for bringing glory to our nation.
Ektan has won Gold and Bronze medals in the World Para Athletics Grand Prize 2018 in Tunisia.
We should move forward like this, keep playing and keep developing.
My dear countrymen, there have been many historical events in the month of August, but at the same time various festivals also come in this month, but due to the rainy season, diseases also keep spreading in the house.
I will definitely meet you once again in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
Hello!
My dear countrymen, I once again got the opportunity to interact with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Recently, a historic match for cricket took place in Bengaluru.
You too must have come to know very soon. I talk about the cricket test that has taken place between India and Afghanistan.
In this match, both the teams performed very well.
Rashid Khan, one of the Afghans, did a great job in this year's IPL.
I express my gratitude to our Indian friends for providing a platform to our sportspersons for their skills.
I represent the best and the best in Afghanistan.
One incident came to the fore as to how a player can become a player.
Sports is a great medium to unite the society and to show the talent and skills of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that we will continue to play and develop with each other in the same manner.
My dear countrymen, on the 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day was a different one.
Whether it is the European Parliament, the United Nations Headquarters in New York, or the Japanese Navy's Fighter Ship, people used to perform yoga.
It was for the first time in Saudi Arabia that a historic event related to yoga was organized and I came to know that this time, women had guided many asanas.
The Indian and Chinese troops jointly practiced yoga at high altitude peaks in Ladakh.
We are trying to connect everyone by breaking the boundaries.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have celebrated Yoga Day across barriers of caste, religion, region, colour or gender.
If people from all over the world used to participate in 'Yoga Day' with so much enthusiasm then why would there not be any excitement in India
Yoga has been practiced at all three places - the soldiers of the security forces of our country, base, naval and air force.
Some of the brave soldiers performed Yogasanas on the submarine.
Some of the soldiers performed yoga at the snowy mountains of Siachen.
The air warriors of our Air Force are astonished by performing Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the ground.
It is important to mention that he did not do yoga sitting in the aircraft, but did yoga in the air.
Yoga was practiced everywhere - schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or playgrounds.
Yoga has done the job of uniting people from all over the world across barriers of caste, creed and geography.For ages, we have been living in the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.
Our sages, sages and saints have always emphasized upon this thought.
Today, Yoga has been accomplished by meditation.
Today, the idea of Wellness is working on a revolution.
We consider the mother as God, the mother gives birth to us and we consider her as God, this is our culture.
Sometimes the doctors rebirth us.
The role of doctors is not limited to medical care alone.
The doctors have not only medical knowledge but also a keen experience on how their lifestyles can be, how their lifestyles can be improved and how their health impacts are there.
Indian doctors have made a mark for themselves and the world through their immense talent and skills.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I convey my best wishes to all our doctors and colleagues on the occasion of Doctors Day on 1st July.
India has a rich history.
When I was in Gujarat and working there, a large national convention was organized by the people of Sant Kabir's tradition.
It is well known that Sant Kabirdas Ji had taken the tomb of Maghar in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh.
But do you know why Kabirdas Ji chose this place to take the tomb
At that time he believed that the one who dies in Maghar, does not find a place in heaven.
On the contrary, whosoever kills in Kashi, he goes to heaven.
Maghar was considered an unclean place but Sant Kabirdas Ji never believed in such things.
Sant Kabirdas Ji emphasised on the importance of social harmony, peace and brotherhood through harmony and brotherhood.
This was his ideal.
We see this ideal through their compositions.
This means that one who considers the pain of another, is a true fakir, a saint.
And whosoever does not know the pain of others, he is sincere.
Kabirdas ji had laid special emphasis on social harmony.
He was thinking beyond time.
The knowledge that is available to the people should be considered as the basis and should be respected.
Even though it has been so long today, the things that Kabir has said are equally effective.
Today, when we read and heard about Kabir Ji, it seems that these things are telling us about the era of knowledge.
We feel that his thoughts are relevant even in the present times.
When we talk about Sant Kabirdas Ji, I was reminded of one of his two words- "Guru Govind Doo Khade, Kake Approach".
There is such a great guru, Jagatguru - Guru Nanak Dev ji.
He has shown the way to crores of people and has been inspiring for generations.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji used to say that service to the poor and the needy is like service to God.
Wherever he went, he worked for the welfare of the society.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji started the Langar system of providing free kitchens to people belonging to any caste, creed, sect and other community by providing food to them.
Guru Nanak Devjis 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated in 2019.
The horrific incident at Jallianwala Bagh that will mark 100 years of birth in 2019 was a turning point in the entire humanity.
Peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice always triumph.
Syama Prasad Mookerjee on his Birth Anniversary today.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was a great contributor to this.
He was very enthusiastic and committed to the development of West Bengal.
Let us all, Dr.
In the last few weeks, I have had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video call.
We have got the opportunity to go beyond files to know about the changes that are taking place in the lives of people.
In remote and far-flung villages, through the Common Service Centres (CSC), women are providing services from the age-old pension to the passport of the village.
One of the sisters from Chhattisgarh collects the bottles and does the business of making them ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras in the country and are also providing medicines at affordable prices in nearby villages.
I am glad that the success of the common man is the true strength of this country because the success of the common man is more than the success of the government.
In such a disappointing environment, he tells us about the hopes, new enthusiasm and the incidents that have taken place in the lives of the common man.
The incident of a young girl from a small village in remote and far-flung areas also inspires 1.25 billion people.
For me, a moment spent with the beneficiaries through a video bridge with the help of technology, is also very pleasant and inspiring.
In another way, a new happiness, a new enthusiasm and a new inspiration is given to the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-40,50-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge and they gave me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you for this thing.
On the one hand there are professionals and technicians and on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters working in the field.
Now you would also be wondering that agriculture and technology are two different occupations.
The scheme was started and successful efforts were made to increase the income of the farmers.
On the one hand, a chain has been created from the production of crops to the marketing of their produce. On the other hand, the role of the farmer brothers is important in that and on the other hand, efforts are also being made to ensure the participation of the farmers in the profit making.
Friends
The work that you have done with your youth is really inspiring.
One Nation, One Tax was the dream of the people of the country.
If I want to give maximum credit for improving One Nation, One Tax, I will give it to the states.
GST Cooperative Federalism is a very good example of which all the states have taken decisions for the welfare of the country and only then the tax reforms at such a large level were possible in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and this meeting is being attended by people from different political ideologies.
There were 17 different types of tax systems in the country before the GST, but now a single tax system has been implemented in the entire country in the new system.
GST is a victory of honesty and a celebration of honesty.
Earlier, there used to be complaints about inspector raj in the tax cases.
GST, perhaps, is the worlds biggest tax reform.
A period of 5 to 7 years was possible to bring about reforms in the country at such a massive scale, and to stabilize the entire scheme in a holistic manner.
Namaste The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
Encouragement, excitement, enthusiasm, hope, aspiration and resolve to do something. When such an environment prevails, no one can remain untouched by it.
This was the time when people from all over the country used to think about which players are going to play today.
How India's performance should be, how many medals we won and these were also very natural.
Our players too have done well in fulfilling the expectations of the countrymen and have won a medal after a while.
Be it Nambaji, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton, India has done the best.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze: India scored a total of 66 medals.
This success makes every Indian proud.
It is a matter of pride and joy for every player to win a medal.
This is a moment of great pride for the entire country and for all the countrymen.
Probably my words will be shortened to express those feelings.
But I want to tell you what I have heard from these players.
This is the reason why there were many things that happened for the first time.
Manika Batra has won medals in all the matches that she participated in.
She is the first Indian woman player to win Indias first gold medal in the Personal Table Tennis event.
India won the highest medal.
The 15-year-old Indian batsman, Anish Bhankar, became the youngest player to win a gold medal in the Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Indian Para Power Lifter to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games.
This time the Games were special because most of the medal winners were women.
Be it squash, boxing, weightlifting or be it Nambaji, women players have performed very well.
Everyone was eager to fight the battle. Both medals were awarded to India.
The players participating in the games had come from different parts of the country, small towns and cities.
It is also the contribution of his friends who have instilled in them their morale in every situation.
Last month in Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen, especially our youth for Fit India and I had invited everyone.
Join Fit India, represent 'Fit India'.
And I am very happy that people are participating in it with great enthusiasm.
Many people have expressed their support by writing letters, sending letters and sharing their health mantra - 'Fit India' on social media.
A householder, Shashikant Bhosale, has shared his picture on the aquatic lake and has written: My love is my body, my love is waterer, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath wrote - "I feel happy and healthy with the morning walk.
And they further say: For me, fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, why we are happy
Devnath ji has no doubt that happiness is health.
While sharing his photo of mountaineering Shri Dhaval Prajapati wrote - For me travel and trekking is a Fit India.
I am very happy to see that many famous personalities are encouraging our youth for Fit India in a very attractive way.
Film actor Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
Many more youngsters have shared their experiences while participating in Fit India.
I believe that such movements are extremely beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
And one more thing I will definitely say - 'Yoga' is the name of 'Fit India Movement' without spending any money.
The importance of International Day of Yoga on 21st June is now accepted by the whole world.
You too will be ready from now on.
Not alone - your city, your village, your department, your school, your college, every person, every age, man, woman, should try to join yoga.
I want to talk to you today in order to invite you for a new work. And I have seen that many youngsters are learning new things this time.
My young friends, I request you to join a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India - Sports, Human Resource Development, Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation - have joined hands to launch the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
College students, youth from NCC, youth from NSS, youth from Nehru Yuva Kendras, who want to do something, who want to become a part of society to bring about a change.
This is an opportunity for all those who decide to do something in the society with a positive energy and this will also strengthen cleanliness. And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October, we will get the joy of doing something before that. And I would also say that the best trainers who have done good work in the colleges and universities will be given national awards.
Not only this, the UGC will also provide two credit points to the trainees who will complete this.
I once again invite students, students and youth to take advantage of this internship.
You can register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship on MyGov.
I hope that our youth will certainly succeed in this movement of cleanliness.
Let us use these holidays as an opportunity to experience a new experience.
This group of youngsters has started a massive campaign for the education of street and slum children.
Initially, the condition of the beggars on the roads or the children who did small and big work left them so much that they completely immersed themselves in this work.
Starting with 15 children from slums near Geeta Colony in Delhi, this campaign has now reached 2,000 children from 12 locations in the capital.
The youth and teachers associated with this mission have been engaged in this massive effort to bring about a social change by taking two hours out of their busy routine.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers of the country.
With collective efforts, they have not only changed their fortunes but also changed the fate of our region.
In Bageshwar in Uttarakhand mainly Mandwa , Chaulai , Maize or barley are grown .
What did they do - started making biscuits from these crops in the field and started selling them.
These farmers have set up a cooperative society in Munnar and a factory has been set up to manufacture biscuits.
Taking note of the patience of the farmers, the administration has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being distributed not only to about 50 Anganwadi Centres of Bageshwar district but to Almora and Kausani .
Due to the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has not only gone up to Rs 10-15 lakh but has also reduced the migration from the district due to employment opportunities for more than 900 families.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there will be a war for water in the future.
Everyone talks about it but is it not our responsibility
Dont we feel that water conservation should be a social responsibility
It should be the responsibility of every person.
Our ancestors have done this for centuries.
He has given priority to every drop of water.
They have come up with innovative solutions to save every drop of water.
Those of you who have got the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu may have noticed that in some temples of Tamil Nadu big inscriptions have been written on irrigation system, water conservation system and drought management.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will find many inscriptions everywhere.
Even today, various wells are popular as tourist destinations, but we should not forget that these are also living proofs of our ancestors' water conservation campaign.
Along with Adlaj and Rani of Patan in Gujarat, these are UNESCO world heritages, their magnificence is spectacular.
In this way wells are of a kind only .
If you go to Rajasthan then you must visit Jodhpur.
This is the biggest and most famous of all of India and the most important thing is that the area where there is deficiency of water is there .
April, May, June and July is the time when there is a good opportunity to store rain water and if we prepare it beforehand then it will be of immense benefit to us.
MNREGA funds are also used in this work of water conservation.
In the last three years, everyone has made their own efforts towards water conservation and water management.
32,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water management in addition to MGNREGS funds.
In the year 2017-18, out of the total outlay of Rs.64,000 crore, 55 expenditure i.e.
Nearly 150 lakh hectares of land has benefited from such water conservation and water management measures in the last three years.
Under MGNREGS, the district administration has taken up the responsibility of conserving land and water on a large scale.
With the help of people from around 40 to 45 villages, the dried rivers of Sasur Khadri have been revived.
Be it cattle, birds, farmers, agriculture or villages, this is a big achievement.
I would like to say that once again April, May, June and July are before us, we should also take some responsibility for water conservation, we should also make some plans, we should also do something.
When Mann Ki Baat falls, all around I receive messages, letters and phone calls.
Ian Kumar Banerjee from Devitola village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal wrote on MyGov that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many do not know the philosophy of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore to live a peaceful, beautiful and true life.
Please discuss this in Mann Ki Baat programme so that people can get to know about it.
I would like to thank Ionji for attracting the attention of all the friends of Mann Ki Baat towards this.
Gurudev Tagore is a man of knowledge and wisdom, whose writings have set a mark on all.
Rabindranath was a talented, multifaceted person, but one of them was a teacher every moment.
When I got the opportunity to listen to Rabindra Sangeet on radio and when I got the opportunity to listen to a poem called Anandloke and Aguner Poroshmani then I got a new consciousness.
You must have been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay my respects to Rabindranath Tagore.
The holy month of Ramzan is going to start in a few days.
Throughout the world, the month of Ramzan is celebrated with great reverence and reverence.
The collective purpose of the day is that when a person is hungry on his own, he also realizes the hunger of others.
When he feels thirsty he feels the thirst of others .
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings and message of Prophet Muhammad.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood like them.
Once a person asked the Prophet - What is the best work in Islam
Prophet Saheb said, whether you know them or not whether you give food to the poor and the needy and try to think thoroughly about them.
In a message, Shri Narendra Modi said that Shri Mohammad Shah believed in the wisdom and compassion of the Prophet.
They were not proud of anything.
He used to say that ego overcomes knowledge.
The despatched Mohammed believed that a person is rich not because of this property but because of his sacred soul.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showed the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions around the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the responsibility of Lord Buddha to follow and follow the path shown by him.
Lord Buddha is the source of inspiration for equality, peace, unity and brotherhood.
These are the human values that the world needs today.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar used to emphasize that Lord Buddha has a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Baba Saheb strengthened crores of people be it Dalits, oppressed or deprived sections of the society through the Constitution.
There cannot be a greater example of compassion.
In order to understand the pain of the people, compassion was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries and along with them they always carry rich thoughts of Lord Buddha.
The entire Asia has a legacy of the teachings of Lord Buddha.
Many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar have deep rooted Buddhist traditions and Buddhist teachings. And for this reason, we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which will connect important Buddhist sites in South East Asia with important Buddhist sites in India.
I am very happy that the Government of India is a partner in the restoration of several Buddhist temples, including the beautiful Ananda Temple in Bagan in Myanmar hundreds of years ago.
Today, the world is witnessing conflicts and human sufferings, the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to end the hatred with compassion.
I extend my greetings on the auspicious occasion of Buddha Purnima to all those who have faith in Lord Buddha and believe in the teachings of compassion.
I seek blessings from Lord Buddha for the entire world, so that we can fulfill our commitment towards building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statue of Lord Buddha, it is believed that Laughing Buddha brings good luck, but very few people know that Smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in India's defence history.
Now you would be wondering what is the connection between Smiling Buddha and India's military power
It was the day of Buddha Purnima.
A nuclear test was conducted at Pokhran, Rajasthan on May 11, 1998.
It is 20 years since its inception and was tested on Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias test was successful and thus India demonstrated its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that this day marks its military strength in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world that for peace, inner strength is essential.
Similarly, when we become stronger as a nation, we walk peacefully with everyone.
In the month of May 1998, nuclear tests were carried out and this month is not only important for the country, but the way these tests were done, is also important.
This event has shown to the whole world that the land of India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can scale new heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan.
As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 11th May 1998 celebrations, let every youth pledge to contribute to building a strong India, a strong India and a strong India by following the mantra of Jai Vigyan given by Atal ji for the power of India.
Make your strength a part of India's strength.
We will also get a new happiness and a new solution to take forward the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, I would like to meet you in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat and talk to you more.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ram Navami.
A few days ago, on the 26th of January, when all the chiefs of the ASEAN countries came here, they were accompanied by an army of artists.
And it is a matter of great pride that most of his countries presented Ramayana before us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are equally influential and inspiring not only in India but also in the world and in the ASEAN countries.
I once again convey my greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, as always, I have received a large number of letters, emails, phone calls and feedback from all of you.
I read what Komal Thakkar has written about starting the online classes of Sanskrit on MyGov.
I read a comment by ShriyutDhanshyam Kumar ji from Barkar village in Nalanda district of Bihar on Narendra Modi App.
The concern you have expressed on the ground water level is of course very important.
Shreeyut Shakal Shastri ji from Karnataka used his words in a very clever manner and wrote that 'Ayushman Bharat' is possible only when there is Ayushman Bharat.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresh ji has said that I should talk about the health of the youth.
According to him, if we compare our comparisons with other Asian countries, then the Indian youth is physically weak.
Yogi ji, I thought that this time I will talk about health in detail with everyone - will discuss on a strong India.
Prashant ji Government of India shared all those photos and videos on the same day on Social Media and Narendra Modi App.
Now you can click the photo and tweet and reach out to your friends.
Angha, Jayesh and many other children from Chennai have written to me the thanks cards which have been given to them after the book "Exam Warriors".
I would like to tell all of you that because of your letters, I get tired of the entire day.
So many letters, phone calls, feedback, I could read everything I could read and hear, and I could hear a lot of things.
Today, even if I decide to do the same thing, I will have to say the same thing every month.
This time more and more letters have been sent to the children and they have written about the exam.
You have told me your plan on vacation.
In the summer, animals and birds have been worried about the lack of water.
The farmer brothers and sisters have sent letters to all the things that are happening in the country related to farmers' fairs and agriculture.
Some conscious citizens have suggested measures to conserve water.
Since we have started this Mann Ki Baat programme on radio with each other, I have been experiencing a manner in which more and more letters during summer season come on topics related to summer.
Prior to the examination, papers were presented to the students regarding examination care.
That is, things in mind change according to the weather. And perhaps it is true that these things in our minds also change the weather of some other person's life and why not change it
When I get to read in your letter that how Ahmad Ali, the rickshaw driver of Karimganj in Assam, has built nine schools for the poor children due to his willpower, I get to see the indomitable willpower of our country.
When I got the opportunity to hear the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Chaudhary from Kanpur, he used to go on the pavement to feed the poor and also provide free medicines, then I got the opportunity to feel the brotherhood in the country.
Many passengers traveling through their cabs helped a lot.
An engineer daughter paid her first full salary.
Thus, after a gap of 12 years, the noble efforts of Akher Sadul Lakskar were successful.
Today, due to his determination and his hard work, he has built a morgue in Punri village near Kolkata with a provision of nearly 30 beds.
Today, the vision of the whole world to see India has changed.
Today, when India's name is honoured, it is only because of the sacrifice of these sons and daughters of Mother India.
Expected: A positive atmosphere of self-confidence is being created.
This self-confidence, this positivity, will prove to be our resolve for a New India.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for our farmer brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastriji, to Lohia ji, to Chaudhary Charan Singhji, or to Chaudhary Devi Lalji, all of us, agriculture and farmers have considered them as an integral part of the country's economy and the general life.
Also, Lal Bahadur Shastri laid emphasis on protection of trees, plants and plants, and better agricultural infrastructure.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh had urged the farmers to use new technology, innovate and use it and stressed on the need.
This state, which has a very small area, has done a great job.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have recorded a record production of over the last five years during 2015-16.
He has proved it through his experience that when the goal is set, when there is a strong resolve, if there is a will to accomplish it.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, an important decision has been taken to ensure that the farmers get fair price for their crops.
It has been decided that the notified crops will be given MSP of at least 1.5 times of their cost of production.
To give a detailed account, the cost of production that will be taken care of for the guarantee, the wages of the laborers working on the farm, the cost of the animal labour, the cost of renting machinery, equipment or animals, the cost of seeds, the cost of all the fertilizers used, the land revenue given to the state government, the interest paid on the capital, the rent paid on the farm land, and not only this, the cost of the farmer's hard work or the value of his labour, if any person of his family is working in the field, will also be included in the cost of production.
In addition to this, there has been a massive improvement in the agricultural market across the country so that the farmers get fair market for their produce.
Efforts are being made to ensure that local markets, wholesale markets and global markets come together.
In order to ensure that the farmers do not have to go far for selling their produce, 22,000 rural mandis in the country are being upgraded and integrated with the APMC and the e-NAM platform.
That is, arrangements are being made to connect agriculture with any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is not only our resolve but also our 1.25 billion citizens who will come together to pay the best tribute to Gandhiji.
How should the theme of Gandhi 150 be Logo
Let us all pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and take inspiration from Bapu and take our country to new heights.
Today, the country has moved ahead with a traditional approach in the field of health.
Earlier, it was understood that the responsibility of the Health Ministry was only for doing all the work related to health in the country.
But now all the Ministries and Departments, be it the Ministry of sanitation, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Department of Chemicals Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, or the State Governments, all are working together for a healthier India.
Preventive healthcare is the cheapest and the easiest way.
The more aware we are about health care, the more beneficial we will be to the person, the family and the society.
Besides, work is being done at a comprehensive level in the direction of setting up of health care centres across the country.
Yoga has created a new identity in the world today in the field of preventive healthcare.
The body remains healthy and strong by yoga .
It is due to your commitment towards Yoga that today Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached every household.
This years International Day of Yoga - i.e. on 21st June, we have 100 days more.
In the last three years, people from all over the country and all over the world have enthusiastically participated in every IDY event.
This year too, let us make a pledge that we will make Yoga our own and inspire our entire family, our friends and all others to do Yoga.
We have to make Yoga more popular by taking it to the children, the youth and the senior citizens and to the women and men of every age group in a new, attractive manner.
Similarly, TV and electronic media in the country are doing various Yoga related activities throughout the year.
But can we make some programs that create awareness about Yoga as a campaign from today till Yoga
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher but a Yoga teacher.
However, some people have made me a yoga teacher by using their innovations and have made some 3D animated videos of my yoga practice.
I will be able to reach out to you through this video, that is, we will be able to practice asanas and Pranayama.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
The work of setting up more new centres is also underway.
I request the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to inform the needy about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras so that their expenditure on medicines is greatly reduced and they will be of great service.
The cost of stents required for heart patients has been brought down to 85.
The cost of knee implants has been brought down to 50-70 by controlling the cost of knee implants.
Under the 'Ayushman Bharat' scheme, over 10 crore families i.e.
The total number of seats in the 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to 68,000.
New AIIMS are being set up in different states to provide better treatment and better health facilities to the people of the country.
A new medical college will be set up for each of the three districts.
We aim to make the entire country TB-free by 2025.
This is a very big work.
There is a need to spread awareness among the people and help you in this thing.
In order to get rid of TB all of us have to work together.
My dear countrymen, on 14th April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Several years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar had expressed the need for industrialization in the country.
He opined that it is an opportunity for the poorest of the poor to get employment.
Today, the 'Make in India' campaign is successfully running in the country.
In such a scenario, the dream that Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt of becoming an industrial superpower is an inspiration for us.
Today, India has emerged as a bright spot in the world economy and today India is the world's largest FDI destination.
The entire world is looking at India as a hub for investment, research and development.
Keeping this in mind, today the 'Smart City Mission' and 'Urban Mission' have been launched to provide better roads, water supply, healthcare, education, digital connectivity to big cities and small towns of the country.
Baba Saheb had a firm belief in self-reliance.
He was not allowed to lead a life of poverty.
At the same time, he was of the opinion that the poor would not be able to get rid of their poverty by providing them with some vibrancy.
Today, initiatives like MUDRA Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India are creating young innovators and young entrepreneurs in the country.
He had seen Jal Shakti as a national power.
Baba Saheb had a vision of establishing several river valley authorities and separate water commissions for the development of the country.
Today, historic efforts are being made to develop waterways and ports in the country.
Ports are being developed at different sea shores of India and the infrastructure of the old ports is being strengthened.
In the 40's, the main points of discussion were the Great War, Cold War and Partition.
In a way, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation of the spirit of Team India.
They discussed the importance of the federal system and stressed on the need for the Centre and the States to work together for the development of the country.
Today, in every department of governance, we have taken the mantra of 'Co-operative Federalism' as well as competitive cooperative federalism.
And most importantly, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is the inspiration of crores of backward classes like me.
He told us that to move forward in life, there is no need to be born in a wealthy or a well-known family. Those who are born in poor families in India can dream big, they can try to fulfill it and they can also succeed.
Many a times, many people have tried to seduce Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This is an India that belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, and to the backward.
The Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organized from 14th April to 5th May on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
It will have separate programmes on subjects such as rural development, welfare of the poor and social justice across the country.
I urge all of you to participate in this event in greater numbers.
My dear countrymen, in the coming days, many festivals like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi are coming.
Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti is a day to learn from his sacrifice and penance.
The life and teachings of Lord Mahavira, the message of non-violence is an inspiration for all of us.
Greetings to all fellow citizens on Mahavir Jayanti.
Easter reminds us of the inspiring teachings of Lord Jesus Christ and the message of peace, harmony, justice, kindness and compassion among mankind.
The festival of Baisakhi is celebrated in Punjab and West India in April.
Many many thanks
We have seen that the color of the sea is blue, but in our daily life we feel that the water is colourless, it is not colourless.
Have we ever thought about the color of the water in the river or sea
This question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
With this question, a great scientist of modern India emerged.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light scattering.
His discovery is known as Raman Effect.
On the 28th of February, Raman considered to have discovered the light scattering. As such, we celebrate the 28th of February as National Science Day every year, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery.
Many great scientists in the field of science produced this country.
On the one hand, the great mathematicians Bodhayana, Bhaskara, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta, on the other, Sushruta and Charaka are our pride in health care.
From Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose and Hargov.in, scientists like Satyendranath Bose have brought glory to India.
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, we have also been named as the most popular Bosonian particle.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a program of Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Mumbai.
It was interesting to know about the miracles in the field of science.
Artificial intelligence helps in the making of robots and other specialised machines.
Nowadays machines are making more smart through self-learning.
This technology can be used to make the lives of the poor, the deprived and the needy easier.
In this program of artificial intelligence, I had urged the scientific community to use artificial intelligence to make the lives of our Divyang brothers and sisters easier.
Can we predict natural disasters through artificial intelligence
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel to inaugurate the iCreate in Ahmedabad.
A young man there developed such a digital device that he could not speak. A mute person wrote that his voice was transformed and he could communicate with a person as he speaks to him.
I believe that we can use artificial intelligence in many such places.
The machine works as per your wish.
However, what we want to do from the machine depends on us.
The use of science for the welfare of mankind and the use of science for achieving the highest standards of human life is also important here.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the light of electricity, had often failed in many of his experiments.
When asked about this, he told them that I have found 10,000 ways of making electricity lights. That is, Edison made his indignation his strength.
Today, I am here in Auroville, the land of Maharshi Arvind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and demanded a response to their rule.
As a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
He showed the path to humanity by finding the answers.
It is important to ask questions again and again to know the truth.
This is the true inspiration behind scientific research.
Why, what and how these questions do not come to the fore so that we do not have to stay healthy.
On National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with the field of science.
May our young generation be inspired to discover truth and knowledge, may they be inspired to serve society with the help of science.
Friends, In times of crisis, in times of crisis, I receive many messages on safety and disaster, and people write something or the other.
Shri Ravindra Singh from Pune has written on the subject of Occupational Safety in his reaction on Shri Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He writes that in our country, the quality of safety at factories and construction sites is not as good.
In his Mann Ki Baat address on the occasion of the National Security Day on March 4th, the Prime Minister asked people to take the theme of safety, which will increase awareness about safety.
When we talk of public safety, two things are important: readiness and preparation.
Safety is of two types, one that is required during disaster and the other that is required in daily life is safety.
In our daily lives, we were not aware of safety, but were difficult to secure in times of disasters.
If we remain vigilant and follow the necessary rules, we will not only save our lives but will also save our society from the scourge of the scourge.
We see that many things have been written about safety at the place of work but it does not seem that the same thing is being followed.
Municipalities, who have fire engines, should make mock drills in front of students by going to different schools once in a week or month.
It will have two advantages, the Fire Service will also develop a habit of being alert and the new generation will also get education on this issue and there is no need to spend on this thing in a way, in a way it becomes a part of education and I always urge you for this thing.
When we talk of disasters and crises, India is geographically diverse.
The country has suffered some natural, man-made, disaster and chemical and industrial accidents.
NDMA focuses on disaster management of the country.
NDMA runs on disaster such as earthquakes, floods, cyclones, landslides etc.
Training and awareness have an important role to play.
Two-three years ago, in the heat wave, thousands of people lost their lives every year, the NDMA launched a campaign to spread awareness and organize workshops in this regard.
This shows that we can achieve safety by prioritizing safety.
Ex-Servicemen are being mobilised to fight COVID-19 pandemic. The Ex-Servicemen are being mobilised to fight COVID-19 pandemic.
NCC and Scouts also assist in this work and impart training.
Joint Disaster Management Exercise BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal was also the first and extensive exercise.
These values should become an integral part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, in this budget, emphasis has been laid on generating energy from waste to wealth and waste through biogas for the village under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The initiative has been named GobarDhan (Gardhan) and Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources (GRB).
In some European countries and China, energy is generated from animal and biological residues, but it was not fully utilized in India.
We are moving in this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Gramin.
Livestock dung, farm waste, kitchen waste are targeted to be used for biogas based energy generation.
Under the GobarDhan Yojana, farmers in rural India will be encouraged and brothers and sisters will be encouraged to not just look at dung and garbage as waste but also as a source of income.
The Gobar-Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in keeping the villages clean.
It will help in increasing the income of the farmers and animal rearers.
The collection of waste, its transport and bio-mass will increase employment opportunities.
An online platform for proper implementation of the Gobar-Dhan Yojana will be created to connect the farmers with the consumer and give a fair price to the sugarcane and the agricultural waste products.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially the sisters living in rural India, to take advantage of this opportunity by creating self-help groups, creating cooperative societies.
I invite you to become a part of this movement of clean energy and green jobs, take the initiative to convert waste in your village into wealth and convert dung into wealth.
Different types of art works were made using garbage.
Work schools were organized to train people on all aspects of waste management.
Everyone gave innovative ideas about cleanliness, started thinking and presented poems.
A festive atmosphere for cleanliness was created.
In particular, school students took part in the competition.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and administration for the innovative manner in which this festival was organized for waste management and cleanliness.
8th March is celebrated as International Womens Day every year.
Several events are being organized in the country and around the world.
Women achievers who have done commendable work in various fields are honoured on this day.
Today, the country is moving forward in the direction of women-led development.
I remember Swami Vivekananda on this occasion. He had said - , , , , , : , : , , : , : , , : , : , : , , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , , : , : , , , : , , : , , : , , : , : , , : , : , , : , : , , : , , : , : , : , , : , , .
Swamijis thoughts 125 years ago reflect on the women power of Indian culture.
Today, it is the duty of all of us, it is the responsibility of all of us, to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
We are a part of a tradition where men are known for women, a son of Yashoda, a son of Kaushalya, a son of Gandhi, a son of a son.
Women are empowered, empowered and have equal partners in the development of the country. This is the dream of a New India.
A few days ago, a person had suggested a good idea to me. He said that on March 8, many programs are organized on Women's Day.
"14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representatives, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis 50 thousand Raj Mistry.
You can imagine the magnitude of the event.
The women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has such a power that will transform the Swachhata Abhiyan into a peoples habit.
Brothers and sisters, Two days ago, I heard the news that electricity reached the three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence.
You know that this island is 10 kilometers away from Mumbai.
For 70 years, in three villages of Elephanta, darkness was spread in the lives of people of Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sat harbour, and now his life has brightened.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and the people there.
I am glad that the villages and caves of Elephanta are now illuminated.
This is not just electricity but a new beginning.
What can be a matter of happiness than being able to illuminate the lives of the countrymen and to bring happiness to their lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, We have just celebrated the festival of Mahashivratri.
The highlight of this month is the celebration of the auspicious harvest of March and the flowering of the Amphan.
This month is dear to you for the festival of Holi.
Holi will be celebrated all over the country on 2nd March.
Holi is also important for us as well as for Holi. This is the day to burn evil forces.
May this festival bring happiness to the lives of our countrymen.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2018
For the first time in 2018, I am talking to you through Mann Ki Baat.
Just two days ago, we celebrated Republic Day with great fervor.
This is the first time in the history of the event that the Chief Guests of the 10 countries attended the event.
My dear countrymen, today I will mention the letter of Prakash Tripathi ji.
I am glad to see that today women are making rapid progress in every sector of India, they are moving forward and are raising the heads of the country.
The respect that women have given in our country since ancient times, their place in the society and their contribution is a matter of great pride for the whole world.
There is a great tradition of great sages in India.
Several scholars of India have contributed significantly in making the ribs in the Vedas.
You will not be able to know many such names as Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi.
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society and our family together in the thread of unity.
Be it the great scholars like Lappamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee of the Vedic period, great scholars like Akka Mahadevi and Meerabai, saints like Ahilyabai Holkar, rulers like Ahilyabai Holkar, brave women like Rani Lakshmibai, women power has always inspired us.
Prakash Tripathi in his letter has cited a number of examples.
He wrote that the journey of our courageous Defence Minister, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, from Sukhoi-30 onwards, will inspire her.
A team of three brave women fighters namely Bhavkanth, Mohana Singh and Avni Chaturvedi have become pilots who are now undergoing training at Sukhoi-30.
A few days ago, the Honble President started a new thing.
The President met a group of women who have done something extraordinary for the first time in their respective fields.
Our women power has done an extraordinary job of breaking the chain of orthodoxy in society and has established a new record.
He showed that hard work, hard work and determination can overcome difficulties, overcome obstacles and create a new path.
Now this path inspires not only the contemporary people but also the generations to come.
The book is available in the e-book format on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, the women power of this country has a very important role in the positive transformation of the country and the society.
Today, while talking about women empowerment, I want to mention a railway station here.
Now you might have thought about the connection between a railway station and womens empowerment.
Matunga railway station in Mumbai is the first railway station in India which is situated at a distance of 22 km from the station.
This station has women staff in all the departments.
After watching the Republic Day Parade, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media that lakhs of women had participated in the BSF biker contingent.
These women used to be courageous and surprised even the visitors from abroad.
Empowerment and self-reliance are the same words.
Today our women are leading.
They are also becoming self-reliant.
But these tribal women of Chhattisgarh have created a new picture in front of the country with their women power.
The area of Dantewada in Chhattisgarh is under Maoist influence.
Be it violence, atrocities, bomb, guns, pistols, the Maoists have created a very pleasant atmosphere here.
In such hazardous areas, tribal women are becoming self-reliant through e-rickshaws.
Whether the introduction of a social life or not is the result of a change or not, the system of reform has developed.
Continuous efforts are being made at the individual and social level in our country against the social evils, evils and practices.
Recently, a good effort was made in Bihar.
More than 13,000 kilometers of human chain was built in the state to eliminate social evils, which was the world's longest human chain.
In this campaign, people have created awareness in the society against the evils of child marriage, dowry and so on.
The entire state resolved to fight against evils like Hundred and Baalvihwah.
Young people, mothers and sisters joined the campaign.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, this human chain got connected to the border of the state with complete integration.
Our society should be free from such evils, so that all the people of the society get the benefit of development in the true sense.
Let us all resolve to exterminate such evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there and everyone involved in the human chain.
However, after getting to know about Jan Aushadhi Kendras, he started buying medicines from there and now his father's medicine expenditure has come down by 75.
This provides a huge financial assistance to the general public, especially to the senior citizens who use medicines on a daily basis.
Generic medicines procured under this scheme are as per WHO standards.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This is not only providing cheap medicines but also creating new employment opportunities for the individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Amrit stores in Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and hospitals.
The only purpose behind this scheme is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country and to build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Mangesh from Maharashtra has sent a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
As a result of this photo, my attention was drawn to him.
In this photo, a grandson took part in the Clean Morna River along with his brothers and sisters.
I am told that the citizens of Akola have started a program to clean the Morana river under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
One more disturbing thing is that the character of the river was filled with wild grass and watermelon.
There was a lot of garbage and filth on the river and its branches.
The villagers prepared an action plan and on 13th January 2020, one day before the Makar Sankranti, the Swachh Morna Abhiyan was launched, according to which, in the first phase, the cleaning of both the pits of the river Morna was done at four places in an area of four kilometers.
I have been told that till now the river Morna is not completely clean, Akolkar will continue this campaign every Saturday morning.
This shows that if a person decides to do something, then it is not impossible.
He said that through mass movement, big work can be done to bring about change.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of discussion going on about the Padma Awards.
There is a tradition of awarding Padma awards every year but for the last three years, the entire process of this award has been changed.
Now any citizen can name a particular name for this award.
The entire process has been made online thereby bringing transparency in it.
Now the work done by that person is being taken into account and introduced instead of the identity of that person for the award.
You all must have heard that you will be happy to know the work done by Arvind Gupta.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has spent his life preparing toys for children.
They are constantly trying to ensure that the children use scientific methods and solvents with useless and fake items.
For this, he went to 3000 schools across the country and showcased the paintings made in 18 different languages and inspired children.
The same is the case with Sitava Jodatti from Karnataka.
It is not said that she is the goddess of women empowerment.
For the past three decades, she has played a major role in transforming the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi.
At the age of 7, he dedicated himself as a Devadasi, but Sitava spent his entire life for the welfare of the Devadasis.
Not only this, he has done a great job for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard a lot about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor tribal family.
He used to do a simple job, but he was fond of performing traditional tribal paintings, paintings, etc.
It is because of this metre that she has been honoured not only in India but in the entire world.
Demonstrations from countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy have been showcased.
He has been conferred with the Padma Shri for recognizing the talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who has made India proud abroad.
They have produced more than 500 herbal medicines on the basis of their souvenirs.
He has been awarded the Padma Shri award for his outstanding social work in the field of detection and treatment of such victims.
Today, I want to mention one more name, the 75-year-old Subhasi Mistry of West Bengal has also been selected for the Padma awards.
The lady, Subhasini Mistry, sold the utensils and vegetables in the houses of others to build the hospital.
This crisis in his life inspired him to set up a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in the hospitals built by their tireless efforts.
I want to tell the countrymen that there are millions and millions of people around us who work for the society, who live for the society, who dedicate their lives, who work for the welfare of the society, who work for the welfare of the society, who work for the welfare of the people, who work for the welfare of the society, who work for the welfare of the people, who work for the welfare of the society, who work for the welfare of the people, who work for the welfare of the society.
Such people dont work for respect at all.
My dear countrymen, every year on the 9th of January, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Pujya Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa on 9th January.
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between Indians living in India and around the world.
You will be glad to know that Mayors of Indian origin, Parliamentarians and delegates from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, UK, Suriname, South Africa and the United States of America and many other countries participated in this event.
I would like to thank the European Union for giving this information to the people of the whole world through a reference to a remarkable work done by the European Union, to identify the people of Indian origin and to the people of the world.
30th January is the death anniversary of those who showed a new path to all of us.
The path of peace and non-violence is Bapu's path, be it India or the world, individual or family or society.
Hello!
This is the last episode of Mann Ki Baat in this year and see Yoga, today is the last day of the year 2017.
Throughout the year, we talked about a lot of things and also shared a lot of things.
The innumerable letters, responses to Mann Ki Baat, and interactions with people from across the country would have given me a new energy.
This year is going to change in a few hours, but our conversation and our conversation will continue.
In the coming year, we will also be discussing new topics and will share new experiences.
Many congratulations to all of you for 2018.
Just a few days ago, on 25th December, the festival of Christmas was celebrated all over the world with great fervor.
We can see the essence of service in the Bible.
The Son of Man, less not to be a Servant, but to be a Servant, and to be a His Life, as a Blasingtu All Humankind.
These words show the importance of service, the greatness of service.
There is no race in this world, religion, tradition or caste, but the priceless form of humanity is known through Seva Bhava.
In our country, we are talking about Nishkam Karma, Nishkam Karma i.e.
In our country, it is also called Seva Parmo Dharma.
'Jiva-Seva' is Shiv-Seva and Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans had said - 'Jiva-Seva' should be life-seva with love.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The life of Guru Gobind Singh ji's valour and sacrifice is a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached the great values of life and based on those values, he himself lived.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji has inspired people from all the roles of a Guru, a poet, a philosopher and a great warrior.
He fought against atrocities and injustice.
He taught people to shun the shackles of caste and religion.
In all these efforts, he suffered a lot at the individual level.
But he never gave up the feeling of hatred.
Every moment of his life, he kept on conveying the message of love, sacrifice and peace.
It shows how great his personality was and how unique he was.
I am fortunate that I got the opportunity to participate in the Prakash Parv event organized in Patna Sahib on the occasion of the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
One January, 2018.
You will be surprised to know that the New Year used to come, and every year even January comes.
But when I say special, it is very special.
And I urge all of you to register as voters.
The whole of India is eager to welcome you as our 21st century voters.
As voters of the 21st century, you too will feel honoured.
Your views will be the basis of the New India.
The strength of vote is the greatest strength of democracy.
Convergence is the most effective tool to bring about positive change in the lives of millions of people.
We just get the right to vote.
So what should we have in the 21st century, what should be our dream in the 21st century India
You too will be able to become the creator of the 21st century India and it will start from January 1.
I am confident that with the skills of this energetic young man, the dream of a New India will come true.
When we talk of a New India, this New India should be free from the poison of racism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
It should be free from filth and poverty.
In New India, peace, unity and harmony should be our guiding light.
Let the youth of New India come forward and deliberate on how a New India should be.
They should also set a path for themselves and those who are associated with it will become a large group of people.
We will continue to move forward and the country will also move forward.
Just as I was talking to you, I had a feeling that can we organize a mock parliament in every district of India
Can the youth of the age group of 18 to 25 years come together to deliberate on the new India and find ways and means to create the same youth
How can we accomplish our resolve before 2022
What can we do to build the India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom movement into a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is that we too should create a mass movement for a grand 21st century India.
Today there are innumerable new opportunities for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth is moving forward and becoming successful.
I believe that an independent and strong system should be created so that the youth of this New India can get information about these schemes in a single place.
My dear countrymen, last time in Mann Ki Baat, I had told you about the importance of positivity.
Any work can be accomplished easily with positivity and enthusiasm.
In English, people say: In the previous Mann Ki Baat, I had urged my countrymen to share the positive moments we experienced during the year 2017 and to welcome the year 2018 in a positive atmosphere.
People have given a very positive response and shared their experiences on social media platforms, MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
Some people have also shared some special achievements in their personal lives.
Sound byte is my name Meenu Bhatia.
I live here in Mayur Vihar, Pocket-1, Phase-1, Delhi.
My daughter, Mr.
B.
a.
I got this loan very easily and my daughter could continue her education.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I speak from Bodoland.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
The work on national highways was done in 2017 from our village of Bhinar.
Therefore, the roads here have become better and the business is getting faster.
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja.
I reside in Sadatganj in Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bewani.
There was a serious problem of water in our region and for the past 40 years we were dependent on the water supply of the army.
Now there is a separate waterway for us.
Let us enter the New Year with the joy of such little things. Let us take concrete steps to move from a positive India to a progressive India at the beginning of the New Year.
Now all of us are talking about positivity, so I am also eager to tell you one thing.
Recently, I was very encouraging to know about Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak who has secured the highest rank in the Civil Services Examination in Kashmir.
He was the first to appear in the Kashmir Administrative Service Examination and was the first to leave the atmosphere of terror and hatred.
He wrote the story of success.
Today, Anjum has become an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but for the youth of the entire country.
The Anjuman proves that despite the situation being so bad, depression can be eradicated through positive action.
Recently, in the last week, I had got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu Kashmir.
I used to get to know about the kind of will power, the enthusiasm and the dreams that they had.
She used to say that she wanted to progress in some area of her life, she had a lot of hope in her mind.
While talking to them, I feel that disappointment is not a sign.
They had enthusiasm, joy, enthusiasm, tremendous energy, great dreams and resolutions.
All the time I spent with these Kashmiri girls, I got a lot of inspiration from them.
This is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, when we talk about famous religious places not only in our country but all over the world then it is natural for Sabrimala of Kerala to talk about the temple.
Crores of devotees visit this world famous temple to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami.
P.
No one is big or small in this campaign.
Every pilgrim considering it as a part of the worship of God, he does something or the other to clean up.
No matter how big a celebrity is, no matter how rich a person is, no matter how big a person is, no matter how big a person is, no matter how big a person works, no matter how big a person is, everyone participates in this 'Punyam Punkanam' program like a common traveller.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
There, along with hard work, a strong resolve for cleanliness is also taken.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu, together we have pledged to make Swachh Bharat a Swachh Bharat and a Swachh Bharat.
Efforts are being made at a massive level across the country towards cleanliness.
The change is also visible in the rural as well as urban areas due to the large scale involvement of the people.
The Swachh Survekshan 2018, the worlds largest sanitation survey, will be conducted from January 4, 2018 to March 10, 2018, to assess the sanitation status in urban areas.
This survey will be conducted in more than 4000 cities and about 40 crore population of the country.
These include open defecation free cities, garbage collection, transport vehicles, scientific waste management, efforts to change the habit of the people, how much peoples participation, capacity building and efforts are being made to clean up the garbage.
During this survey, teams will conduct city screening.
They will also interact with citizens and seek their feedback.
The Swachhata App is being used and analyzed for improvement of various types of services.
It is not a matter of fact that keeping cleanliness is the government alone.
It is also a great responsibility for every citizen and civil society to maintain cleanliness.
And I urge every citizen to participate in the cleanliness survey in large numbers.
And make a pledge to ensure that our cities do not fall behind in terms of cleanliness, our streets and our societies do not fall behind.
And I believe that you people would be using this kind of garbage just like dry garbage, wet garbage etc.
The principles of 'Reduce, Reuse and Recycle' are very effective for waste.
The ranking of cities will be done on the basis of this survey.If the population of our city is more than one lakh, if the population of our city is more than one lakh, then it should be our dream that the population of the country is less than one lakh.
And we should make efforts as well.
And all of us have a dream that our cities, our efforts, our progress and the progress of the country should be ours.
With this resolution, let us once again remember Pujya Bapu and strive to fulfil the resolution of a Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that seem very small but if we look at them as a society, we become familiar with them.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you.
I understood that if a Muslim woman wants to go to Haj pilgrimage, she cannot go to Mehram or our male companion.
Especially, these rules and regulations are not in Islamic countries.
But in India, a Muslim woman was not given this right.
And I am very happy to note that our government has taken care of these things.
I have full faith and I firmly believe that the journey of India's development will continue on the strength of our women power and the confidence of their talent.
And that is why our women should also get equal rights and equal opportunities at the same time, so that our efforts continue and we need to move forward with women and men on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for us.
This year, 26th January, 2018 will be remembered in a special way.
This year, leaders from all ten ASEAN countries will be the Chief Guests at the Republic Day celebrations.
This year, the Republic Day will be celebrated with 10 Chief Guests.
The year 2017 has been a special year for both ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed its 50th anniversary in 2017, and in 2017, it completed 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN.
It is a matter of pride for all of us Indians to join these great leaders of 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
Dear fellow citizens, As we celebrate festivals, our country is in a way a land of festivals.
Probably there is no such day when no festival is celebrated on that day.
May the coming New Year bring happiness, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
Let us all move forward with new zeal, new enthusiasm, new joy and new resolve.
The festival of Makar Sankranti, which is associated with nature, will begin in January with the advent of the sun.
In Rajasthan, it is said that Magh-bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu are important for us.
These festivals are usually celebrated on the 13th and 17th of January.
Thank you very much, dear countrymen.
Now we will say the same again in 2018.
Indian citizens will not be able to find that they are not respected.
At that age, they are bigger than all of us and are witnesses to the different phases of the country.
I have had the privilege of interacting with him on telephone prior to his departure to foreign countries.
It was a kind of affectionate dialogue between us so that we can talk to our elder sister in a small spirit.
I do not speak very well about such personal interactions.
Listen, even at this juncture of your life, Lata Didi is eager to see and eager for everything related to the country.
The sense of satisfaction in his life is connected with India's progress, with the changing India, with the new heights of progress.
Modi ji: Latadi Namaskar.
I have spoken to Shri Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Homodhi ji: I used to travel by plane.
Lata ji: Okay, good.
What should be celebrated on birthdays
And the accomplishments that we have achieved have been achieved only through meditation and penance.
I am really nothing.
Lata ji: Ho.
Your letters are also available to me and I keep meeting you.
I dont want to trouble you because I see it. I know how much work you do and how much you have to think.
Modi ji: My mother is very happy with your affection.
Lata ji: Modi ji: But I will come soon.
In the coming weeks, the celebrations will continue throughout the country.
Our homes will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around you who are deprived of the joys of these festivals.
Darkness below is what we call darkness.
Probably this saying is not just a few words, it is an order, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Whenever you come to our homes with sweets, clothes and gifts, think of visiting them for a moment.
At least do the work of delivering essentials to the needy outside the house without using the goods that are more than required.
In many cities, many such institutions work with start-ups of young friends.
They collect essential items such as clothes, cereals, food from their homes, and supply them to the needy.
The smile on the faces of many poor families, the joy of the festival doubled, the shine on our faces, the light on our lights will shine further and our Diwali will shine further.
My dear brothers and sisters, In Diwali, Lakshmi comes home in the form of good fortune and prosperity and traditionally Lakshmi is welcomed.
Can we welcome Lakshmi in a new way this year
In our culture, daughters are considered Lakshmis because daughters bring good fortune and prosperity.
Can we organize these programs in our society, in villages, in cities and cities for the honour of daughters
Can we make a program to honour these Lakshmis of India in Diwali this year
There are many daughters and many hearers around you who are doing extraordinary work.
If someone is working to educate poor children, if someone is engaged in awareness about cleanliness and hygiene, if someone is a doctor or engineer, if someone is doing service to the society, if he is a lawyer then he will try to give justice to someone.
Let our society recognize and honor such people and take pride in them.
There should be such a programme of honor throughout the country.
One more thing can be done.
Sharing more and more information about the success of these girls through social media and using the hashtag Bharat Ki Lakshmi.
We had launched the 'Selfie with daughter' campaign and it had spread all over the world. Similarly, we should also launch 'Bharat ki Lakshmi' campaign this time.
Promoting the Lakshmi of India means strengthening the path of prosperity for the country and for the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had said a lot back then that Mann Ki Baat has a great advantage over the fact that I have had the privilege of communicating directly or indirectly with many well-known and unknown persons.
A few days ago, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tawang, has sent me a letter of honour and written in it, I read that letter before you.
I live in Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This year when my exam was over, some people asked me if you had read this book by Exam Warriors.
I told them that I have not read this book.
But I went back and bought this book and read it two-three times.
My experience after that was very good.
Had I read this book before the exam, I would have benefitted a lot.
I believe that if you are thinking about the new version of this book then you must include some more mantras for parents and teachers.
Thank you for reading the book twice or thrice and thank you for telling me about the shortcomings in it.
My young friend has entrusted me with a job and has ordered me to do something.
I will surely obey my order.
What you have said is that whenever a new version of this book comes, I will definitely try to write something for the parents and the teachers.
But I would like to appeal to all of you that you can help me in this thing.
What are your experiences in everyday life
I once again express my gratitude to our young friend and student AlinaTang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you are getting to know about the plans of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and television, and you are also discussing about it.
But you are aware that I am a common man like you, a common man like you. And that is why the impact that we see on a common man is equally visible in my life as well as in my mind because I am one of you.
Then I also heard that speech and saw the confrontation.
Just a short while before that address, he was defeated in the final round by Rafael Nadal, the world's emperor, for winning the Grand Slam and tennis 19 times.
The audience present there welcomed him with enthusiasm .
And the donor Nadala. He also spoke about how he had inspired millions of young people to play tennis.
He had set an example of sportsmanship in front of the world even after being defeated in the past.
At the same time, on the other hand, winner Nadal too appreciated the donor's game.
There is a lot to learn from each and every age group.
These are moments that are beyond winning or losing, when there is no meaning of victory or defeat.
The thoughts of our ancestors were really commendable.
Vidya Vinaya Upadhyay, Haritin Naraini Kasya Manujsya. Mani Kanchan Sankalp: Peoples Loksya Loksya Lochan Anundam means, when a person has the ability and humility at the same time, then who will not win the right mind of a person
In fact, this young sport has won the hearts of all the people around the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, whatever I am going to say now, they are really going to tell you for your own good.
There will be debates on the ground, there will be debates on the ground, but if things are stopped at a fast pace then it will be of great benefit.
It becomes difficult to stop those things which are spreading at a fast pace.
But in the beginning if we wake up and stop it, a lot can be saved.
With this spirit, I feel that I would particularly like to speak to my dear youth.
You all are aware that tobacco addiction is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit alcoholism.
The nicotine present in tobacco is an increase in the amount of alcohol in it.
By its consumption in young age there is adverse effect on development of brain .
But today I want to talk to you about a new topic.
You must be aware that recently a ban on cigarettes has been imposed in India.
E - cigarette is a different electronic device than a regular cigarette .
Because of the heating of nicotine substance in cigarette a type of chemical smoke is produced through which nicotine is consumed .
We may be aware of the danger of regular cigarettes but a mix of e-cigarette has been created so that there is no danger due to e-cigarette.
So that it does not spread foul smell like other cigarettes, fragrant chemicals are used in it.
We have seen around us that in many homes there are father-in-law sensors but even then they stop the others from smoking in the house.
The issue of e-cigarette is different.
If someone smokes around us then we can understand it from his people.
If someone has a cigarette packet in his pocket then he can also understand it from Vasan .
But e-cigarette is not a thing, so many youngsters and youngsters are unaware of the fact that sometimes as fashion statements, they are proudly seen in their books, in their offices, in their pockets, in their hands with e-cigarette and then intoxicants.
Youth is the future of the country.
Cigarettes are being banned so that our youngsters do not get addicted to drugs.
This restriction has been imposed so that the dreams of the family are not wasted, the lives of the children should not be spent in the country and the habit of intoxication should not spread to the society.
I urge you all to quit smoking and do not indulge in any wrongdoing on e-cigarettes.
Come, let us together build a healthy India.
Hey, you remember Fit India, dont you
Fit India does not mean that you go to gym for two hours in the morning and evening, as much as you want.
For Fit India, we have to stay away from all these drugs.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is indeed a privilege for us that our country has been the birthplace and work place of many such extraordinary people who have spent their lives for the welfare of others.
India is the birthplace of many such extraordinary people, the land of karma, and these are the people who have dedicated their lives not only for themselves but for the welfare of others.
One such great man will be honoured in Vatican City on October 13th.
It is a matter of great pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will declare Mariam Thresia a saint on the coming 13th of October.
The work that Mr. Mariam Thresia has done for the welfare of humanity in his 50 years of childhood is a unique example for the whole world.
He was very fond of social service and education.
He built schools, hostels and orphanages.
He established the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Family, which is still fulfilling their values and mission.
I once again pay tribute to Mr. Mariam Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters from the bottom of my heart for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for not only the whole of India but for the entire world that as we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians have pledged to be free from single use plastic.
Looking at the leadership that India has taken in the direction of environmental protection, today the eyes of the countries of the world are being extended to India.
I am confident that all of you will join the campaign to get rid of single-use plastic on October 2.
People are contributing in this campaign in their own way but a young man of our country has started a campaign in a unique way.
When my attention was drawn to his work, I interacted with him over telephone and tried to understand his new experiment.
Probably the conversation with them will be useful to some people of the country.
Mr. Ripudaman Belviji is making a unique effort.
When I heard the word Ploging for the first time, it was also new to me.
You have been running this entire programme in an innovative manner and in a special way that the youth like you.
I congratulate you from the bottom of my heart.
And friends, this year, on the birth anniversary of Respected Bapu, the Sports Ministry is also organizing the Fit India Plogging Run.
Plogging of two kilometers on October 2.
This programme will be held across the country.
We have heard from Ripudaman that how to do this program, what should be done in the program.
Through this campaign, awareness about health among the people is also increasing and awareness about cleanliness is also increasing.
I believe that if 130 crore Indians take a step in the direction of making single use plastic free then India will move 130 crore steps simultaneously.
Once again, thank you very much to you.
My best wishes to you, your team and your innovativeness.
I would like to say something a little bit about that.
In fact, in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to elaborate on this. But today, I am just saying that we should get an opportunity to prepare for it.
You might remember that 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
So we should start preparing for this thing from now onwards.
We will talk in detail about this but this is the time.
Some people can start the exercise and some other schemes can also be made.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on the 15th of August I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that by 2022 we should visit fifteen places in India.
There should be a stay at at least fifteen places and one or two nights.
We should look at India, understand it and experience it.
We have so much diversity.
And when people come on vacation on the occasion of Diwali, they definitely go out for excursion. Therefore, I once again urge you to visit any fifteen places in India.
My dear countrymen, on the 27th of September, the World Tourism Day was celebrated and some of the responsible institutions of the world are presenting the tourism rankings.You will be glad to know that Indias ranking in the Competitiveness Index of Tourism has improved.
And all this has been possible only because of the cooperation of all of you, especially due to the understanding of the importance of tourism.
If we make even more efforts, we will be able to get top in the world's top 75 years of independence.
There should be happiness and enthusiasm as well.
Our festivals are celebrated together, jointly celebrated together, and so are the values imbibed in this collective life, and a new strength of collective life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to interact with the children of Karnataka.
The Times Groups newspaper Vijay Karnataka took an initiative in which he urged the children to send letters to the Prime Minister.
She also wrote that if children are given more information about nature then it will be useful in future for protecting the environment.
Rida Nadaf, a daughter of a soldier from the Army wrote that she is proud of it.
No Indian will feel proud of the soldiers of the Army
And you are the daughters of those soldiers. It is very natural for you to feel proud.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has said that her school is 5 km away from her village, so she has to leave home early and is late in returning home.
He suggested that schools should be near their homes, so that they dont have to play with their friends for too long.
Brothers and sisters, I got the opportunity to read these letters and take the initiative of a newspaper so that they could reach me.
For me, Sudha was a very good experience.
My dear countrymen, today it is 26-11.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
It was in 1949 that the Constitution adopted the Indian Constitution on this day.
The implementation of the Constitution began on 26th January, 1950 and therefore we celebrate 26th January as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked hard for nearly three years to frame the Constitution.
No area of life, no subject of nature has been neglected.
Equality for all and sensitivity to all is the identity of our Constitution.
It is our duty to follow the Constitution in letter and spirit.
Be it a citizen or an administrator, everyone should follow the Constitution.
This is the message of the Constitution that there should not be any harm to anyone.
The draft Committee was one of the most important Committees.
Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Committee.
They played a big role.
He ensured that the welfare of every section of the society is ensured.
On 6th December, we remember and salute him on his Mahaparinirvan Diwas.
Baba Saheb has made a huge contribution in making the country prosperous and strong.
It is the death anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 15th December.
Sardar Patel, the son of a farmer, who made his name Iron Man, also did an outstanding job of tying the country in a uniform thread.
Sardar Patel was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
But the country cannot forget that nine years ago on this day on 26-11, there was a terrorist attack on Mumbai.
The nation salutes the brave citizens, police and security personnel who lost their lives on this day.
The country can never forget their sacrifice.
It has been equipped to destroy the human power.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world should come together to defeat terrorism.
Born on this land, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi gave the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and terrorism are trying to destroy and weaken our social fabric.
And that is why it is the need of the hour to make the forces of humanity more aware.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Navy Day on 4th December.
The Indian Navy protects its coasts.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You must be aware that our culture has developed along the banks of rivers.
Be it the Indus River, the Ganga River, the Yamuna or the Saraswati our rivers and seas are both economic and strategic.
These are gateways to the whole world.
This country, our land, is in close touch with the oceans.
When we look at history, about 800-900 years ago, the Chola King's navy was counted among the most capable naval forces of the Chola dynasty.
In the expansion of the Chosa empire, his navy had contributed to bringing the empire to the name of economic power at that time.
Several examples of the mission and research journey of the Chola Navy are available even today in Sangam literature.
Very few people are aware of the fact that most of the navies around the world have been allowed to include women in post-harvest times.
But in the Chola Navy, and that too 800-900 years ago, women had done a commendable job.
They had participated in the war too.
The Chola rulers had the latest knowledge of ship building.
How can one forget the strength of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his navy while mentioning the Navy
The circumnavigation of the circumnavigation of the globe was done by Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud-Janjira, Swarnadurg related to Shivaji Maharaj were either in the coastal areas or in the sea.
The Navy of the Marathas was protecting these forts.
The expedition included large and small boats.
His naval personnel were capable of attacking any enemy and defending themselves from the attack.
It is only impossible to discuss the Maratha Armor and not to mention Kanhoji Angre.
He gave a new glory to the Maratha army, and in many places Maratha soldiers were raised.
Even after Independence, the Indian Navy has done a lot of valor.
Be it the liberation war of Goa or the Indo-Pak war of 1971.
INS Sumitra gave her immediate assistance for rescue and relief of the fishermen from the water and handed them over to Bangladesh.
In the month of May-June this year, when there was a massive flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our Navy immediately reached there and assisted the government and the people there.
In Bangladesh, our naval ship INS Ghariyal had also provided Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) to Bangladesh.
In the month of June, the Papua New Guinea government has given us a message of "SOs" and our navy has helped us to save the fishermen of their fishing boat.
Even during the sea attack on a merchant vessel in West Gulf on 21 Nov 19, our naval ship INS Trikanda ran for assistance.
This is a day of pride and respect for the security forces of the country and this year the Ministry of Defence has decided to launch a special campaign from 1st to 7th December 2018.
Throughout the week, children, elders and all the people put the flag on the national flag.
There should be a movement to express respect for the soldiers across the country.
On this occasion, we can distribute Army Flag.
Around you, if anyone in your acquaintances and experiences are related to the military, then he can post his experiences, his courageous actions, and pictures related to him at the Armed Forces Flag Day.
Inviting the army personnel in schools and colleges, they will be able to know more about the military's work.
This is a great opportunity for our new generation to get more information about the army.
This is also the opportunity to mobilise funds for the welfare of our defence forces.
The fund is being used by the Sainik Kalyan Board for the welfare of the injured soldiers and their rehabilitation.
On this occasion, let us also contribute to boosting the morale of our armed forces.
Let us also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, 5th December is World Soil Day.
I also want to tell my farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is an important component of the Earth.
Whatever we eat, everything is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is connected to the soil.
Just imagine, what will happen if there is no nutrients in the world
How to live?
This was discussed in our culture for a long time and that is why we have been aware of the importance of soil since time immemorial.
In our culture, on the one hand, devotion to the soil and the feeling of respect towards the soil were naturally felt in the minds of the people. At the same time, due to the use of many scientific methods, soil nutrition was also ensured.
Two things are very important in the lives of the farmers of this country: devotion to their soil and the scientific approach.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that the farmers of our country are not only connected with traditions but also aware of modern science and use it in agriculture.
I have heard about Tohu village, Bhoranj block in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh and the farmers there.
The farmers there used to use chemical fertilizers in an unbalanced manner because of which they used to consume the quality of soil.
Production has come down and farmers income has also come down and the productivity of the soil has also come down.
Some of the conscious farmers of the village understood the seriousness of the situation and after that the farmers of the village inspected their soil and accepted that they were advised to use fertilizers, nutrients and bio-fertilizers.
As a result, all of you will be surprised to know that the information provided and guidance provided to the farmers through the Soil Health Card has yielded positive results.
In Rabi 2016-17, the production of wheat has gone up by three to four times and the income has also gone up by four to six thousand rupees.
If you are concerned about the crop then you should take care of the soil and if you take care of the soil and the soil then it will also take care of you.
More than 10 crore farmers across the country have created Soil Health Cards so that they can get better information about their soil and get proper crops.
We pray to the mother earth but did you think that the fertilizers like urea are so harmful to the health of the mother earth
Many scientific experiments have proved that the destruction of soil is due to excess of urea.
The farmer is the son of a mother earth mother then how will he make his mother sick
It is the need of the hour to revive this relationship of mother and son.
Can our farmers make a pledge to use urea for our agriculture by 2022 that will mark 75 years of independence
Once the sons and daughters of Mother Earth made a pledge that there would be rapid improvement in the health of the soil and the production would also increase.
The lives of farmers will change in the truest sense.
We are now experiencing global warming and climate change.
There was a time when winter used to begin before Diwali.
Now it has come to pass in December , and it is getting cold all the time .
It is our experience that we dont have to come out of the chaos.
However, even in this season, the conscious people work effectively and their examples inspire all of us.
But determination and resolve were greater than all of them.
An eight-year-old son could not speak, but he took the support of Shitti.
He got up at 5 a.m. and went to a village house and asked him not to defecate in the open.
The efforts of this child who went to at least 30-40 houses every day and taught the lesson of cleanliness, have made the village Open Defecation Free.
Every moment we get to learn something new.
Today, they are doing well in every field.
Be it sports, competitions or social activities, our disabled persons are not lagging behind.
You all remember that during the Rio Olympics, our differently-abled players had won 4 medals, and they also won the World Cup for the blind.
There are many types of competitions going on throughout the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Para Aquatic Competition was held in Udaipur.
80 percent of their body parts do not have muscle cells, but look at their courage, determination and hard work.
He also won the Gold Medal in the 70th National Para Aquivalent Competition and was selected by Sports Authority of India (SAI) for 20-20 Para Olympic Games.
He is one of the 32 Para Aquifers and will be trained at the Centre of Excellence in Gujarat.
I salute and convey my best wishes to the young brother-in-law of Jiggar Thakkar ji.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
He was born on this day of the birth of the Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen and I hope that this festival of Eid will give you new inspiration, new energy, new energy and new resolve to increase peace and harmony in the society.
(PHONE CALL) Namaste Prime Minister, I speak Neeraj Singh from Kanpur.
I request you to repeat one of the ten best things you have told us through Mann Ki Baat throughout the year and we will be able to recall them and learn more.
You have made a very good suggestion.
After listening to your words, I feel more eager about it, I want to change it.
The old people who live in our villages often tell us that do not forget their sorrows, do not forget their happiness.
Whether it is a photo, a small story or a small film, I invite you to welcome 2018 in a pleasant atmosphere, with good memories, with positive thinking and with positive thinking.
Let us share positive stories on the Narendra Modi App, on MyGov or on social media, with Positive India (Hashtag Positive India).
Let us highlight the events that inspire others.
Let us all see the strength and impact of these combined efforts.
I will certainly try to convey the experiences of positive India in the next chapter of Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, next month, I will once again interact with you all for Mann Ki Baat.
You will get the opportunity to talk about a lot of things.
Thanks a lot
The sixth festival, which will be celebrated after Deepavali in six days, is one of the festivals celebrated with reverence in our country.
This includes the traditional rules from food to clothing.
The unique festival of Chhath Puja is completely associated with the worship of nature and nature.
The Sun and Water are central to the worship of Chhath, the pots and earthen pots made of bamboo and mud are useful ingredients of this worship.
The world worships Ugavati, but in Chhathpuja we have a culture of worshiping those who have a certain set of values.
The festival also highlights the importance of cleanliness in our lives.
Prior to Chhath Puja, the cleanliness of the entire house, as well as the cleanliness of the river, pond, banks and places of worship, all the people are very excited about it.
Surya Vandana or Chhathpuja is a festival of protection, prevention and discipline.
Commonly asking for something, it is considered as a lack of time and inferiority complex.
But after half the morning in Chhathpuja Prasad had asked for food. This is a special tradition.
The reason behind Prasad's asking for food is that it eliminates ego and ego is such a feeling that it disrupts the progress of a person.
It is very natural that people are proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am confident that Mann Ki Baat has been tied up with the people of the country for a hundred percent season.
Take the example of Khadi and handloom.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I always appeal to Khadi, and you will be happy to know what its impact is.
I was told that on October 17 this month, on the day of Dhanteras, the Khadi Gramodyog Bhawan store in Delhi registered a record sale of Rs. 1 crore 20 lakh.
You would be happy to hear that Khadi and handloom have been sold at such a large scale in one store.
During Deepavali, the sale of Khadis gift coupons has gone up by almost 680.
The sale of Khadi and handicrafts has registered a growth of nearly 90 this year as compared to the previous year.
Today we get to see that the youth, the elderly, the women, every age group likes Khadi and handloom.
I can imagine how much benefit the weavers families, the poor families, and the families who work on handlooms will be from this business.
But, with the experience of the past few years, I can say that Khadi has now replaced Khadi for Transformation after Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion.
Khadi is becoming a means to empower the poorest of the poor by transforming the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is a big role for the village industry.
Shri Rajan Bhatt has written on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about the experiences of Deepavali with my security forces and he wants to know how our security forces celebrate Diwali.
Mr. Tejas Gaikwad has also asked on the Narendra Modi app that can we arrange for the sweets of ours to be supplied to the security forces
We also remember our brave security forces.
We feel that the sweets of our house should reach the soldiers of the country.
Deepavali is celebrated with great fervor.
This Diwali brought to me a special experience.
I respect every soldier of the security forces, including the countrymen, for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice of the security forces that they are protecting the country from the odds that they are facing on the border.
When you get time, when you get time, then you should listen to the experiences of the soldiers, listen to their pride.
Many of you may not be aware that our soldiers are not only protecting our borders but also playing an important role in world peace.
Everyone is aware of the UN's efforts to establish peace all over the world and their positive role.
And we are the 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' the world is one family.
It is because of this belief that from the very beginning, India has been active in various UN initiatives.
You all are aware of the fact that both the proposal of India's constitution and the proposal of the UN Charter began with the words 'Woi the People'.
India has always emphasized on gender equality and UN declaration on human rights is a living example of that.
The pros and cons of the pros and cons of India's 'All-Mane R. Burney Free and Equivalent' programme in his international forum was changed with the efforts of Hansa Mehta, India's representative, and was later adopted as 'All-Human Beings R Berne Free and Equival'.
If we could see it then it was a small change, but it was through a powerful idea.
India's contribution to the UN Peacekeeping Operations means India's role.
More than eighteen thousand Indian security forces have served in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
In the present situation, nearly 7000 soldiers are added to the UN Peacekeeping exercise and this is the third highest in the world.
As of August 2017, Indian soldiers have served in at least 50 operations in 71 Peacekeeping Operations.
This peace effort came from Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan, Indian Army Hospital has treated over 20,000 patients and rescued countless people.
Indian security forces not only protected the people of different countries but also won the hearts of those people.
Indian women have also played a leading role in ushering peace.
India is the only country in the world that has sent women police units to Liberia under the Shanti Abhiyan mission. Very few people know about it.
And this step of India has proved to be an inspiration for the countries of the world.
After this, all the countries have started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to hear that India's role is not only related to the peace campaign but also training in the peace campaign of 85 countries.
In this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave pacifists have given the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peace campaign is not an easy task.
Our security forces have to go to remote areas and do this.
Their memories fill the heart of every countryman with pride.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, a brave man who was honoured with the Param Vir Chakra.
Lt Gen Premchand ji made a special mark in Cyprus.
In 1989, he was appointed as the Force Commander for Operation, Namibia in the year 72 and served for the independence of that country.
General Thimayya, who was the Chief of the Indian Army, also led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and sacrificed his life in peace.
India has always been a messenger of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
We believe that everyone must move forward with a vision of peace, harmony and a better, peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our holy land, our great personalities have served humanity selflessly.
Sister Nivedita, who we call sister Nivedita, is also one of these extraordinary people.
She was born as Margaret Elizabeth Noble in Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda gave her the name Nivedita.
The meaning of the statement is dedicated in full form.
Later, he proved himself by doing the same thing in his name.
On his 150th birth anniversary yesterday, Minister of State for Home Affairs, Smt.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was deeply saddened by the atrocities committed in the British Raj.
The British not only made their country a squirrel but they also tried to make us a squirrel in mind.
It has always been going on to create inferiority complex in our culture.
Sister Nivedita restored the glory of Indian culture.
He worked to awaken national consciousness and to keep the people united.
He went to various countries around the world and raised his voice against the anti-social behaviours of Sanatan Dharma and Darshan.
Well known nationalist and Tamil poet Subramaniam Bharti, our revolutionary poem Pudumir Pen, New Woman and Women Empowerment are well known.
It was believed that his inspiration was sister Nivedita.
Sister Nivedita Ji also supported the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
Through their writings and conferences, Basu has helped in research and propagation.
This is a beautiful feature of India that spirituality and science have helped each other in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Scientist Jagadish Chandra Basu are the best examples.
In 1899, a lot of plague was observed in Kolkata, and seeing this, hundreds of people died.
She did not take care of her own health and started cleaning the roads.
She was such a woman who could lead a comfortable life but she was linked to the services of the poor.
People, inspired by his sacrifice, helped him in service.
He taught people the teachings of cleanliness and service through his car.
On his tomb, he wrote, "Higher Repository Sister Nivedita who gave us everything to India.
No doubt, he did the same.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the heroes of New India.
Earlier the disease used to occur at a very young age, our concern is that it has been seen in the last stages of life - now even in young children.
This kind of disease was prevalent among the youth as well.
But now our lifestyle has changed.
These days, these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders.
This kind of diseases occur during youth i.e., reduction in physical activity and change in food habits.
There is a need for society and family to take care of this.
When we think about it, it will be remembered that there is no need to speed it up.
There is only a need to change our habits and habits by doing a regular exercise.
Instead of going for lift children get the habit of climbing those stairs .
After dinner, all the families should go with their children.
Yoga for Young India
This Yoga will help our young friends, especially in adopting a peaceful lifestyle and protecting them from lifestyle disorders.
The 30 minute yoga before school is the special feature of this thing that Yoga is easily accessible and accessible.
And I would like to say that Yoga can be easily accessible to the people of any age group.
It is easy to learn, it is easy to learn and it can be done anywhere.
There is no need for special resources and field.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, good news has been brought about in the field of sports in the last few days.
Our sportspersons have brought laurels for the country in various fields.
In hockey, India won the Asia Cup hockey trophy.
Our players performed the best sporting feats and on this strength India became the Asian Cup champion after ten years.
India was earlier the Asia Cup champion in 2003 and 2007.
I convey my best wishes to the hockey team and all their team members.
After hockey, there is also news in badminton.
Badminton star Kidambi Srikanth won the Denmark Open Trophy and won the country's pride.
This is his third Super Series Premier after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
Friends, this month, FIFA Under-Satellite World Cup was organized.
Many teams from all over the world have come to India and they have displayed their skills on the football field.
I also had the opportunity to see one thing.
There was a lot of enthusiasm in the players and the audience.
This is the biggest event of the World Cup and the whole world was watching us.
I was thrilled to see such a big fight and the energy, enthusiasm and courage of young players to do anything.
The World Cup was successful and all the associations performed the best.
Even though India did not get a chance, the Indian players won the hearts of all.
The whole world including India enjoyed this festival of sports and this entire competition became thrilling and entertaining for football lovers.
There are indications that the future of football is bright.
Once again, I congratulate all the players, their cooperation and all the sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, in order to give justice to the feelings of all the people who write to me on the subject of Swachh Bharat, I have to make Mann Ki Baat daily and I have to dedicate my Mann Ki Baat address on the subject of cleanliness only.
If some young children send photographs of their efforts then some young people get involved in it.
Wherever there is a story of a new initiative on cleanliness, there is a news of the change that has been brought about by an officer.
A few days ago, I received a detailed report which included the story of the transformation of Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
There, an NGO called the Ecological Protection Organization launched a cleanliness drive at Chandrapur Fort.
In this campaign of 200 days, people did not stop, they did not get tired, they did the work of cleaning the fort.
And who would have seen this photo, who would have been disappointed with the filth around him, would have ever realized how the dream of cleanliness would be fulfilled - so I would like to tell my people that you can see a live image of the youth, the hard work done by them, the enthusiasm, the determination of their work.
This will change the despair of us.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of November we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
Guru Nanak Devji is not only the first guru of Sikhs, but he is a Jagadguru.
He spoke of the welfare of the entire humanity, and the similarity of all castes.
He emphasized on women empowerment and respect for women.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji traveled 28,000 kilometers and during this journey, he taught the truth about humanity.
He interacted with the people and showed the path of truth, sacrifice and duty.
He gave the message of social equality and showed it not only through words but also through our karma.
They started anchoring, creating service to the people.
Sitting together, eating together created a sense of unity and harmony among the people.
Guru Nanak Devji gave three messages of meaningful life - Remember God, work hard, work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Devji created Gurbani in order to convey his principles.
In the coming 2019, we will celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
Let us try to follow his message and teachings.
My dear countrymen, on the 31st of October, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
You are aware that he had laid the foundation stone of a modern India.
We can learn a lot from the life of this great saint of Mother India.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is that he was not only a thinker of change but also a thinker of practical solutions to achieve this.
He was a skill-giver in realizing his ideas.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had done the job of connecting India in one thread.
It has ensured that crores of Indians can be brought under the umbrella of one nation and one Constitution.
He was able to overcome all odds due to his decision-making.
He was honoured wherever there was a need for respect.
He used force wherever there was a need to use force.
He set a goal and resolved to achieve that goal.
Only those things could have been done to keep the country together.
They dreamt of a nation where all people are equal.
I believe that Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's ideas are always inspiring.
He had said, "No distinction between caste and creed can stop us, all the children of India, we should love the country and make a future of mutual love and goodwill.
These thoughts of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring and relevant for the vision of our New India.
And his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
I appeal to all of you to participate in the Run for Unity with your blessings.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali, with a new resolve, with a new resolve, you all must have gathered here in your daily lives.
My dear countrymen, all their dreams come true.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
Three years of Mann Ki Baat has been completed through All India Radio.
Today it is the 36th part.
Most of them inspire me.
There are many things to improve the government.
There are also some personal complaints.
And I take half an hour a month but people send their stories on Mann Ki Baat for 30 days.
As a result, there has been sensitivity in the government as well.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a unique journey of the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
Perhaps, in such a short span of time, I got the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country and I am extremely grateful to the countrymen for that.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Acharya Vinoba Ji used to say, Non-Governmental, Non-Governmental, Non-Governmental.
Instead of going out of the political spectrum, instead of going out of the tension, I have tried to connect with you with a stable mind.
I am aware that after three years, social scientists, universities, researchers, intellectuals and media experts will definitely analyse this.
And I believe that this idea will be useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future.
I had once said in Mann Ki Baat that we need to take as much food as we need to do and we need to worry about it.
After that I have seen that a large number of letters have been received from every corner of the country.
Many social organizations and youngsters are already working on this thing.
I came to know that there are many people who are engaged in the task of uniting and exploiting the food-grains.
Once I saw the word Selfie with Daughter of a Sarpanch from Haryana and told them in Mann Ki Baat.
Just see, Selfie with Daughter has started a big campaign not only in India but in the whole world.
This is not just the issue of social media.
This event created a new self-confidence and a new pride for every daughter.
A few days ago, I was interacting with the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
I told the people who were going out to roam around the country that wherever you go, you send pictures of those places on the subject of Incredible India and lakhs of photographs of those people have come.
It has come from every corner of India and in a way it is a great opportunity for the people working in the tourism sector.
I experienced this through Mann Ki Baat that how a small event can create a mass movement.
I was thinking about the three years since Mann Ki Baat had started today. At that time, several incidents in the last three years have touched my heart.
Every moment a thought is being taken to take the country to the right path.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the welfare of others, for the good of the society and for the progress of the country.
I have understood, learned and learned from my countrymen in the Mann Ki Baat campaign of these three years.
I salute my countrymen from the bottom of my heart.
Once I had talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, I had said that Khadi is not a garment, but a thought.
Once again I would like to appeal that we should continue with the Khadi campaign which has been started.
If we buy Khadi then we should work with the spirit of lighting the lamp to the homes of the poor.
This work will strengthen the poor of our country and that is why we have to do this.
How to bring new technology, how to increase the production capacity, how to put a hand on solar energy
The old practice of 20-25 or 30-30 years is now underway to revive the system.
Now the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri in Varanasi Sevapur in Uttar Pradesh had been closed for 26 years but now it has been revived.
Several organizations have been associated with it.
Many people have been provided new employment opportunities.
The Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) in Pampore, Kashmir started its training centre once again and there is a lot to contribute to this area.
With the restart of this training centre, it will be of great help to the new generation in modernizing the textiles and new products.I feel very good that when the big corporate houses are offering gifts, they have started supplying Khadi products recently.
People have also started giving Khadi items while visiting each other.
Cleanliness will connect people's minds.
Your Excellency, President ji started this work and the entire country participated in it.
Be it the elderly, men, women, cities or villages, everyone has become a part of this cleanliness drive today.
When I say that 'Sankalp se Sidhi' (Sankalp se Siddhi), we all see how the Swachhata Abhiyan is moving towards a resolution.
Everyone accepts this movement, supports it and contributes in some or the other way to realize it.
I express my gratitude to the Honourable President.
But at the same time every section of the country has considered it as its work .
And it is a matter of great happiness for me that in the first four days of the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign, more than 75 lakh people have participated in more than 40 thousand programs. And I have seen that some people have been continuously working, they have decided that they will continue to work till the right results are achieved.
One thing is that we have to clean somewhere and the other thing is that we do not want to litter with awareness but if we want to make cleanliness a habit then we also need an ideological movement.
Several competitions were organized on this occasion in connection with the Swachhata Hi Sewa campaign.
More than 2.5 crore children participated in the essay competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children have photographed.
Using your ideas, we took a picture of cleanliness.
Many people wrote poems and during these days, the pictures that I have sent to my childhood friends, children, post them in social media.
When it comes to cleanliness, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
These people have carried this movement forward in a very good manner.
They are also leading the Swachhta movement in their own way.
In the Swachhata Hi Seva movement, we can see that the electronic media and print media in our country can do a great service to the nation.
Recently, a few days ago, I got to know about the 18-year-old boy from Srinagar, Bilal Dar.
No, there is nothing like that.
Bilal Dar has been working for five to six years from the age of 12-13 years.
The biggest lake in Asia is near Srinagar, the lake cleans the lake by evacuating it from plastic, polythene, used bottles, garbage or garbage.
Bill Dar is young but has become an inspiration for everyone who has a passion for cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must accept that future history takes birth from the womb of history. And when it comes to history, it is very natural to remember the great men.
This month of October is the month of remembering many of our great men.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, on October 11, the birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh, and on September 25, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.
This is the birth centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
What was the focal point of all these great men
Nanaji Deshmukh left politics and spent his entire life in the work of Gramodaya and when his centenary year is being celebrated, it is natural for him to respect the work of Gramodaya.
The former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalam Ji used to talk about rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh when he was talking to the youth.
He used to mention Nanaji's work with great respect and he himself went to the villages to see Nanaji's work.
Deendayal Upadhyay Ji spoke about the last man in the society, just like Mahatma Gandhi.
Sardar Saheb had brought the whole country together.
Now we should move forward with the mantra of unity by running for unity.
You people say with great ease, naturally, Unity in Diversity the speciality of India.
We are proud of diversity, but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I would like to repeat to my countrymen, especially to my young generation, that we are in an awakened situation.
Summer is a holiday, Diwali is a day. There is a need to go out somewhere or the other in our country.
People go out as tourists and it is very natural.
But sometimes it seems a matter of concern that our people dont see our country, they dont want to know its diversity.
You must go to a foreign country, I am not against it, but you must also visit the places of our country.
If we look at the life of Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam Ji then one thing is remembered that when they all visited India, they were able to see India and at the same time they had a new inspiration to live for India and to dedicate their lives for the country.
All these great men had travelled widely in India.
They tried to understand India at the beginning of their work.
The value addition in tourism will take place at a time when we do not go to Paramukukha as an interviewer, go as a student and try to understand his life.
I have had the opportunity to spend the night in more than four hundred and fifty districts. And today, when I take charge of this great responsibility in India, I feel very useful.
It doesn't take much time.
I appeal to all of you that in this vast India, Unity in Diversity is not just a slogan but also a storehouse of our immense strength.
There are many types of food - drinks in our country .
Even if we keep eating a new item throughout our life, there are so many types of things that the first product will not come back.
Now, this is a great strength of our tourism.
I believe that if you go out somewhere then you will take forward my first mission.
You must send pictures on 'Hash Tag Incredible India'.
When you meet the people there, send their photos.
I am thinking in my mind that what can be the seven best tourist destinations in our state to promote tourism in India, every Indian should know about those seven special places in his state.
If possible, one should go to the seven places.
Can we find out about these places
Can we make this information available on the Narendra Modi App
Can we share this information on Hashtag Incredible India
Just imagine, if all the people of one state come to know about this thing then I will tell the government that they should check the information related to the same thing and also prepare the publicity material about the same seven things that have come from every state.
This means in a way, how can we encourage the tourist places with the intention of the people
The Government of India will work on this.
Come, join me.
From the month of October to the month of March, you can also become a major partner in the country's tourism promotion.
I invite you for the same.
My dear countrymen, as a man, many things touch my heart.
They stir up my mind.
Some things fill my mind with a lot of things.
In the end, I am a person like you.
The Indian Army has been awarded two gallantry medals in the form of Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi.
This is an exceptional achievement because both the husbands of Self and Fund have been martyred in the service of Mother India.
You can imagine the state of mind if the world dies at such a young age.
But Swati Mahadik, wife of martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadik, made a firm resolve to deal with this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He completed his training through 11 months of hard work and spent his life in fulfilling his husband's dream.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, husband of Mukesh Dubey was a hero in the army and died for his motherland.
His wife Nidhi decided that she should join the army and fulfil her resolve.
It is natural for every countryman to respect his or her mother power and those brave-hearts.
I congratulate these two sisters from the bottom of my heart.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and the festival of Diwali are an opportunity for the youth of the country.
The FIFA Under-17 World Cup is being held in our country this year.
I am confident that we will have to hear the slogan of football all around.
Every age group will have an interest in football.
It will not be possible to see our young friends playing in the fields of schools and colleges in India.
Come, the whole world is coming to play on the land of India so that we can make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
It is the time of the worship of Mother Durga.
How the whole atmosphere is filled with the pure fragrance .
My dear countrymen, I salute you.
On the one hand, while the entire country is celebrating festivals, on the other hand, it is natural for the country to get concerned about violence from any part of India and this country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi.
It is the country of Sardar Patel who laid down his life for the unity of the country.
Generations of generations ago, our ancestors have accepted the values of public life, non-violence and these things have become part of our veins.
We have been hearing this thing since childhood - Ahimsa Paramo Dharma.
I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that violence will not be tolerated in the name of faith, be it communal or political ideology or be it faith in the person or be it faith in the tradition or be it faith in the law in the name of faith, no one has the right to take law in the name of faith.
I would like to assure my countrymen that the people who take up the law, who suppress the path of violence or group, this country will never tolerate it and no government will tolerate it.
Everyone has to bow before the law.
Due to thousands of years of cultural tradition, considering the cultural tradition, social tradition and historical events, it may not have been possible in 365 days that one day would not have been celebrated without festivals.
Now you must have seen that our festivals follow the cycle of nature.
There is a direct relation between nature .
Most of our festivals are associated with the farmers.
First of all, I would like to call you - , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .
Yesterday, the festival of Santsari was celebrated in Jain community.
In the Jain community, Paryatan Parv is organized at Bhadramas.
The last day of the festival is Sanvatsari.
This is indeed a unique tradition.
The day of Samvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way it is also a day of forgiveness and this day has the tradition of calling each other 's miniscule ' .
We have heard this discussion and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say - forgiveness is the specialty of a strong man.
Shakespeare in his play The Merchant of Venice writes to explain the importance of forgiveness: Mercy is two blades, it stays with him and he is the one who forgives and forgives, both receive the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, at present, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated in every corner of the country with great joy.
When it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi, it is natural to speak on the occasion of Ganesh festival.
Ganesh-Chaturthi is celebrated for 10 days.
This Mahashan is considered to be a symbol of unity, equality and goodness.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the auspicious occasion of Ganeshotsav.
Recently, Onam was celebrated in Kerala.
Onam, a prominent festival of colourful festivals of India, is Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
These days our festivals appear to be the reason of the attraction of tourism .
I will tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or the Durga festival in Bengal has become an attraction of tourism in a way.
Also, your other festivals are an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think about what we can do in that direction.
Id-ul-uha will be celebrated across the country on the same day, in the series of festivals.
Idul uha greetings to all fellow citizens.
Festivals are a symbol of faith and trust for us.
We have to make the festivals of our New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals are associated with cleanliness in family life.
Preparation for the festival means cleanliness is not a new thing for us.
But it needs to become a social habit.
The urge for public cleanliness should not only be a part of the house but also of the entire village, city and city, in our state, in our country and the country.
My dear countrymen, the definition of being modern is changing.
A massive campaign called Eco friendly Ganapati has been launched.
If you look at the tube, then the children of every house are making Ganpati by bringing the soil and making Ganapati.
Some people are coloring vegetables, some are cutting paper pieces.
Different kinds of experiments are being conducted in every family.
And it seems as if we are aware of new experiments.
When the Swachhata Abhiyan was launched three years ago, it will take three years on the 2nd of October.
Its positive results are visible.
The percentage of toilets has gone up from 39 to nearly 67.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation.
A few days ago there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water of the flood came to a standstill.
On the last occasion, the workers of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind in Dhaner in Banaskantha district of Gujarat performed a systematic cleaning of 22 temples and 3 mosques which were affected by the Puranas.
Everyone went out of their sweat.
The best example of unity for cleanliness, an example that inspires everyone, was presented by all the workers of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.
If this becomes our enduring feeling of cleanliness, then where can our country go
My dear countrymen, I take a challenge to all of you that once again, 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti, 'Swachhata Hi Seva', as I was saying earlier, 'Jal Seva is Prabhu Seva', 'Swachhata Hi Seva'.
Make an environment of cleanliness throughout the country.
We should look for opportunities as soon as we get the opportunity.
But let us come together.
On holidays or Sunday, come together and work together.
We will go to the neighbouring villages and work with a movement.
I appeal to all the NGOs, schools, colleges, social, cultural leaders to the government officials, collectors and sarpanches to create a clean and hygienic environment for 15 days before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
A department has been set up at these places where you can write your name and the name of the family after the construction of a toilet.
My friends from social media can run some constructive campaigns and can actually become an inspiration for working on the lines of the world.
The Swachh Siddhi Competition will be organised by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in which essay competitions, short films competition, painting competitions are being organized.
You can write essays in different languages and there is no age restriction on them.
You can make short films on your mobile phones.
You can make a 2-3-minute film that will inspire cleanliness.
It can be in any language.
I invite everyone to join this cleanliness mission.
I would once again like to reiterate that on October 2, Gandhi Jayanti, we should take a pledge to celebrate October 2, and that is why, since September 15, Swachhta Hi Seva must reach every household.
We have taken some steps for cleanliness.
Be a part of it by working hard.
You will see how this theme will shine on Gandhi Jayanti on October 2.
You can imagine that after 15 days of this Swachhta Abhiyan and after Swachhta Hi Sewa, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, we will be happy to pay homage to venerated Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today, I specially want to accept my gratitude.
I express my gratitude from the bottom of my heart, not because we have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for a long time, I want to express my gratitude for this thing and accept that through Mann Ki Baat, millions of people of the country are getting connected with it.
I get an opportunity to understand the feelings of the people of the country.
The more impatient you wait for Mann Ki Baat, the more I wait for your message.
I am eager because I get to learn something from all of you.
Several of our small things come up for a new thought and therefore I express my gratitude for our contribution.
You are connected to your mobile phones and you become a part of these bad habits.
Prime Minister, I speak from Pune, Aparna.
I want to tell my friend that he always tried to help the people, but I got tired of seeing a habit of that.
Once I went to the shopping mall with her.
We make payments at a large place without paying any price but also with our hardworking brothers and sisters, who have no faith in them.
Doesn't we feel that there is always a connection between the sellers of such goods, small shopkeepers and vegetable vendors who sell their products near our homes.When we connect with the auto rickshaw drivers then we try to connect with them.
Not only this, we are also asking to reduce the tax rate of two to five rupees. And it is the same thing that we went to the big hotel to eat or to pay the money without seeing the bill.
For this, the question is not of money but of how much damage will be done to their heart.
He was a poor man and that is why he doubted his honesty. You might not have made a difference in your lives for two or five rupees but you might have thought that how big a change would have been brought about by this small habit of yours
Madam, I am grateful that you have given me a message by calling the phone that touches the heart.
I believe that my countrymen will also stop behaving like this with the poor.
My dear young friends, the entire country celebrates National Sports Day on 29th August.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player and hockey wizard Major Dhyan Chand Ji.
His contribution to hockey is unparalleled.
I want to remind you of these things because I believe that the new generation of our country should be associated with sports.
Sports should become a part of our lives.
If we are the young countries of the world then the youth of our country should be seen in the field of sports.
Sports is physical fitness, intellectual discipline, emotional association.
I understand what more needs to be done
In a way, sports is a boon for the heart.
Today, in the age of computer, I want to say that the field of sports is more important than the sports station.
Play FIFA on computers, do it on the field.
The joy of playing cricket on the open field is different from the cricket on the computer .
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out and they used to ask the mother: 'You will come to your house.
Today the situation is such that when the children sit in the corner and watch the games or cartoons on their mobile phones, the mother asks if you go out.
This was the time when the mother used to tell the child that when you will come to know that when will you go out
It is a matter of great happiness for our youth that on October 6-28, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup is being organized in October 2018.
Today, while talking about sports, a touching episode of Mann Ki Baat last week has happened which I would like to tell the people.
I had the opportunity to meet a young girl. Some of them were born in the Himalayas.
He spent 30-30 days in water, and in the waves of the sea, these six daughters will be the first incident all over the world.
Who is an Indian, who doesnt feel proud of such daughters
I salute the courage of these daughters and I asked them to share their experiences with the countrymen.
I will also provide a separate place for his experience on the Narendra Modi App.
We must read their experiences because it is a story of adventure, a story of love and I will be glad that if these daughters have brought their stories to us, then my best wishes and blessings are with them.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
It is the birth anniversary of the former President of our country, Dr.
He was a President but throughout his life he used to present himself as a teacher.
He always liked to be a teacher.
The teacher's main quality is to create a sense of creativity and knowledge among our students.
When we celebrate Teachers Day, can we take a pledge together
Let each of us make a pledge for five years, let us show the way to accomplish it. And after five years, we will be happy to accomplish our resolution and make life successful.
There is such an event in the life of every teacher that his efforts have changed the life of a person.
If we make collective efforts, we can play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
I work for the Indian Research Centre at the Harvard University in Mumbai.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is a matter of discussion not only of India but of the economic scholars from all over the world.
The scheme was launched on 28th August, 2014 with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow the scheme is completing three years.
30 crore new families have been linked, bank accounts have been opened.
Today I am happy that the poor of the society have been made a part of the country's economy.
Now there is an atmosphere of restraint.
He feels that money can be used for children.
Some good work can be done in the coming days.
Moreover, if a poor person sees a RuPay card in his pocket then he feels like a rich man, it has a credit card in his pocket and RuPay card in my pocket.
He feels a sense of humor.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the banks. This is in a way saving the poor.
This is their strength in the coming days and the insurance of the accounts opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has also been removed.
Today, the poor have a lot of confidence due to the low premium of Rs.1,30,000 for 'Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana'.
Due to the insurance of one rupee in several families, if something happens to the family then his family will get Rs. 2 lakh.
Today is not the time, but I will tell the people of the bank that they should upload it on mygov.in.
My dear countrymen, once again, I wish you the very best.
Thank you very much.
The mind of the person is such that in the rainy season he feels very charming .
Animals, birds, trees, nature all get radiant with the advent of monsoon.
However, this rainfall sometimes takes a record and when it realizes how powerful it is to destroy the water.
Nature gives us life, nurtures us, but at times the worst form of natural disasters like floods, earthquakes etc.
Whatever changes are taking place in the changing weather and environment, there is also a very negative impact.
In the last few days, some parts of India especially Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and some parts of Bengal have been facing natural calamities due to heavy rains.
Full monitoring is being done on the flood affected areas.
Be it the soldiers of the Army, the Air Force, the NDRF or the paramilitary forces, all of them are putting their lives at risk in such times.
Farming, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electricity, connectivity are all affected.
People are talking about their problems.
Slowly, we can also prepare our work schedule according to the weather forecast, so that possible damage is avoided.
When I am preparing for Mann Ki Baat, I can see the citizens of the country preparing for it more than me.
This time, I have received a lot of letters, phone calls and people are still expressing their happiness about GST as well.
One of them phone calls you - Namaste, Prime Minister, I speak Nitu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard your Chartered Accountants' Day address and was very impressed.
Similarly, GST has started in our country on the same date last month.
You can tell me whether the government had expected the results after one month or not
I would like to hear your views on this.
It has been almost a month since the introduction of GST and its benefits are also visible.
I am glad that when a poor person writes to me about how the prices of essential commodities have come down due to GST, how things have become cheaper.
The start-up feared whether the GST was not known or not, but now it seems as if the work has become easier than before. A person from the far-flung hills of the North East writes.
These facilities are not only available but are also being supported to achieve the same economic momentum.
The speed at which this change has been brought about, the speed at which this change has been brought about, the speed at which it has been replaced, the atmosphere of trust has been created throughout the country.
Economics scholars, scholars in the field of management, scholars in the field of technology and scholars in the field of management will present India's GST experiment as an ideal system in front of the world.
For many universities of the world, such an example will become a hair study.
This is because such a big change has been brought about in such a big way. And it is a great achievement to successfully implement this tax in such a vast country with the help of so many crores of people.
All decisions have been taken by the states and the Centre together.
As a result, every government has given priority that there should not be any overburdened burden on the expenditure of the poor due to GST.
You are well aware of the fact that what was the price of a commodity before the GST, what was the price in the new situation, all the information is available on mobile GST app.
I heartily congratulate all the employees of the Ministries, Departments, Central and State Governments for this work.
GST is a great example of the victory of India's collective power.
This is a new historic victory.
And this is not just a tax reform but a system that strengthens a new honest culture.
In a way, it is also a mission of social reform.
Once again, I congratulate crores and crores of people of the country for accomplishing such a big task in a smooth manner.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
In a way, several incidents have taken place in the month of August which are particularly linked to the history of independence.
This year we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of uit India Movement.
However, very few people would be aware that uit India slogan was given by Dr.
Yusuf Meherally.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
What could be a greater inspiration
The uit India Movement was an important struggle in the Indian freedom struggle.
This movement had made the country free from the British Raj.
This was the time when the people of India against the British rule, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, whether educated or illiterate, in every corner, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in the
Responding to Mahatma Gandhi's call, millions of Indians were putting up their lives in a struggle with the mantra of Karo or Die.
Millions of young people of the country had given up their education and had withdrawn their books.
Great men like Lohia, Jayprakash Narayan played a key role.
In both the events of the cooperative movement and the uit India Movement - 1920 and 1942, two different forms of Gandhiji are seen.
The form of cooperative movement was different and in 42 years, such a scenario had developed so rapidly that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of Do or Die.
This was because of public support, people's strength, people's resolve and people's struggle.
The whole country was fighting together.
Sometimes I believe that if we try to link the pages of history with the pages of history then India's first freedom struggle was established in 1857.
This freedom struggle, which began in 1857, continued till 1942 every moment in some or the other part of the country.
This long period of time has instilled a spirit of freedom in the countrymen.
Everyone was committed to doing something or the other in that direction.
Generations have changed but resolutions have not been fulfilled.
People used to come, people used to get connected, they used to go away, new people came and the country was making every effort to overthrow the British rule.
These five years would have been decisive.
Now I want to connect you with this mathematics.
You became independent in 1947.
Today the year 2017 is going on.
It has been almost 70 years since that incident.
During the period, the governments had come and gone.
The system was created, the system was changed, the system was made deaf and the system was increased.
Everyone has tried their best to make the country problem free.
Efforts were made to increase employment in the country so that poverty can be eradicated and development can be achieved.
There was a lot of hard work in his own way.
Success too.
It was even higher.
For example, from 1942 to 1947, it was five years of our resolve.
Similarly, I see that the period of five years from 2017 to 2022 is now before us.
We should celebrate 15th August as Sankalp Parva of 2017 and when we complete 75 years of our Independence in 2022 then we should fulfil that resolution.
Today, not just the slogan of 'Karenghe Ya Marenge', it is about connecting with this resolve of a New India, we have to take this task forward, and we have to succeed with that spirit.
We have to live with this resolution and fight with it.
Come, let us run a massive campaign in the month of August this year from 'Sankalp se Siddhi'.
Every Indian, every social institution, every local system, every school, every college, every organization - let us make some or the other new pledge for a New India.
A resolution that will be fulfilled in the next five years.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
Let us be a part of this Sankalp Parv.Today, whether we are anywhere else or not, we are definitely online.
Therefore, I would particularly like to invite my young friends in the online world to come forward and contribute innovatively in the creation of a New India.
Using technology, come up with videos, post, blogs, graphs, new ideas.
Let this campaign become a mass movement.
uit India uiz for young friends will also be launched on the NarendraModiApp.
This quiz on uit India is an attempt to familiarize the youth of the country with the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you will spread it to a wide range of levels.
My dear countrymen, on the 15th of August, as the Prime Servant of the country, I got the opportunity to interact with the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
I am just a moment.
Please send your ideas on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
I myself read them and on 15th August I will try to share these ideas as much as I get.
Last three years, I heard a complaint about my 15th August speech that my speech was a bit longer.
I will finish it in 40-45-50 minutes.
There is a social economy in India's economy.
And that economy should never be under-written.
Our festivals are not just occasions of joy and exhilaration.
Our festivals are also mediums of social reform.
But at the same time, every festival of ours is directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
In a few days, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, Ganeshotsava, then Fourth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja and Diwali together will gather together. And this is the time when the poor get the opportunity to connect with their economy.
And in these festivals there is a natural bliss as well.
And if we talk about the economy then hundreds of families start making reserves through the medium of small domestic industries months before the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
From khadi to silken threads, no one knows how many types of diamonds are made. And nowadays people have become more interested in making homemade bucks in their homes.
Businesses of thousands and hundreds of people like rickshaw pullers, rickshaw pullers, sweets etc.
It is directly related to those poor families who make small earthen lamps.
But today, while talking about the economy of the poor people associated with festivals, I would also like to highlight the issue of environment.
And they have requested me that I should talk about the eco-friendly Ganesh idol so that people can choose statue of soil from now on.
First of all, I am grateful to these conscious citizens.
He urged me to discuss this topic in advance.
This year's public celebration of Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
And when I say this thing a long time ago, I am sure that all of you will get connected with this resolution.
And this statue will provide employment to the poor artisans, and will feed the poor.
Come, let us connect our festivals with the poor, let us connect with the economy of the poor, let us celebrate our festivals with the economic benefits of the homes of the poor, let us try to ensure that they enjoy the happiness of the economy.
I convey my best wishes to all the citizens for the various festivals.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters.
Just a few days ago, our daughters had performed brilliantly in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I had the opportunity to meet all those players this week.
I was very pleased to speak to him, but I realized that he had a lot of passion for not winning the World Cup.
There was a strain on his face and his stress was there.
I told him a different analysis.
I said, look, these days there is a time when the expectations of media are enhanced.
Such is the increase that when success is not achieved then the same aspirations are changed in anger.
We have seen many such games in which if the players of India fail, then the anger of the country is expressed against those players.
Some people leave their limits and talk about things that are painful.
But this is the first time that even though our daughters did not win the World Cup, 1.25 billion people of the country took the responsibility of that defeat on their shoulders.
Indeed, the younger generation of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to bring glory to the nation.
I once again congratulate the youth of the country, especially our daughters from the bottom of my heart.
Let every citizen of the country make a pledge and every citizen of the country should prepare a roadmap to realise this resolve in the next five years.
Let us move forward together, let us do something or the other.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
The weather is changing.
This year the summer was also very severe.
However, the monsoon rains have entered the country on time and the movement ahead is continuing smoothly.
There is a pleasant atmosphere in many parts of the country due to heavy rains.
In the last few days, there has been a lot of relief from the heat waves after the rains.
And all of you have seen that no matter how fast life is, no matter how much stress or tension, whether it is personal life or public life, the arrival of rains, the situation in our minds changes.
Today, Lord Jagannath's Rath Yatra is being celebrated in many parts of the country with great reverence and enthusiasm.
Now, Lord Jagannath's Rath Yatra is celebrated in some parts of the world as well.
Lord Jagannath ji is connected to the poor of the country.
The people who paid tributes to Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar. He would have seen that Lord Jagannath Ji had to admire the temple and its traditions, because it included social justice, social harmony.
The holy month of Ramzan was celebrated with great reverence and reverence.
Now it is the festival of Eid.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is the month of donating holy things.
It is a month to be happy and the more you enjoy it the more you enjoy it.
Come, let us together take inspiration from these holy festivals and take the country forward as a treasure of happiness.
In this holy month of Ramzan, a very inspiring incident of Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh came to me.
The families of about 3500 Muslim brothers and sisters living in those small villages, in a way, the population of our Muslim brothers and sisters is more there.
During this Ramzan, the villagers have decided to build together a toilet.
The government is also providing assistance for this individual toilet and under this assistance, about 17 lakh rupees have been given to them.
You can spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for turning this holy day into an opportunity for the welfare of the society.
One thing of theirs is also very inspiring.
And most importantly, he made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
You know that in our country, three regions of Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana will also be declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my special gratitude to the administration, government and people of these five states for completing this task.
Then it becomes the movement of the body and mind.
This is also the subject of cleanliness.
These bad habits have become a part of our nature.
They have become a part of our habits.
We have to make regular efforts to get rid of this.
Everyone will have to pay attention.
We have to remind ourselves of the most inspiring event.
And I am glad that now cleanliness has not been a government programme.
It is becoming a movement of the common man and the society.
And when the people sitting in the government also carry forward this work with public participation then its strength increases manifold.
Recently, a very good incident has come to my notice, which I would like to tell you.
This is the incident in Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration took up a major task with public participation.
A 100-hour non-stop campaign.
And what is the goal
In 100 hours, toilets were constructed in 10,000 houses in 71 Gram Panchayats.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the administration have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages were declared Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of that village in Vizianagaram district, who have set an inspiring example with their hard work.
This awareness of Shri Prakash Tripathi's democracy is commendable.
And democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
Awareness in the mind is the price of liberation.
There is a need for regular awareness of democracy and therefore we also have to remember those things which are attacking democracy and move forward in the direction of the best aspects of democracy.
1975-25 June was such a dark night which no democratic lover can forget.
No Indian can forget it.
In a way, the country was transformed into Turks.
The anti-surrection was pressed.
Jaya Prakash Narayan and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.
Even the judicial system could not escape that horrible shadow of crisis.
The newspapers used to become completely unemployed.
Todays press, students of the world, and those working in democracy, are repeatedly remembering that period of time and constantly trying to increase the awareness of democracy and keep doing it.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in Turung.
When the Emergency was completed one year, Atal ji had written a poem and he described the mood of that time in his poem.
My dear countrymen, every Indian has taken pride in the world today.
June 21, 2017- The entire world was celebrating Yoga.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the sun's rays in the morning.
There was no Indian who could not feel proud of it.
It is not that there was no practice of yoga before but today, when Yoga is tied in the thread of yoga, it becomes the reason for connecting the world.
Most of the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga.
People practiced yoga at The Great Wall of China, while at Machu-Pichhu in Peru, people performed yoga at 2400 metres above sea level.
People practiced yoga under the shade of Eiffel Tower in France.
In Afghanistan, in Herat, India has given a different dimension to the friendship of India by practicing Yoga at the India-Afghanistan friendship dam i.e.
Yoga classes were organized along with Yoga Masters at UN Headquarters.
In Gujarat, around 55,000 people from Ahmedabad had set a new world record by practicing Yoga at the same time.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
And this is the first time that I have got the opportunity to practice Yoga in rainy season.
Our soldiers performed yoga in Siachen at 20, 25 or 40 degrees Celsius.
Be it our armed forces, border security forces, ITBP, CRPF, everyone has made Yoga a part of their lives along with their work.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, since this is the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that send to me pictures of three generations of Yoga together.
Some TV channels also took up this issue.
I got a lot of photos related to this and some of them were stored on the NarendraModiApp.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to attend a very popular programme.
In Kerala, P.K.
N.
A good programme is organized by the Panicker Foundation to make people aware about the habit of reading books and to make people aware about reading books.
I was reminded of the fact that I had just finished that thing from my mind.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a tradition in the government that we should not give flowers, we should give books or we should welcome them with a handkerchief.
That too is a handkerchief of Khadi, so that Khadi can get a boost.
I was in Gujarat, I had become a habit of all of us, but after coming here I was able to get rid of that habit.
But I went to Kerala and once again I became aware of that habit.
And now I have again started advising the lower people in the government.
We can also develop our temperament gradually .
The lives of flower vagabonds were limited.
Once I took it in my hand and then I will keep it.
But if a book is given, in a way it becomes a part of the house, it becomes a part of the family.
When I am telling you this thing then how historic it was .
Last year when I had gone to England, ueen Elizabeth of London invited me for dinner.
How many years have passed, but Rani Elizabeth has maintained the handkerchief given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I went there, she showed me a lot of happiness.
And when I was looking at it, he was urging me to touch it and see it.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I believe that these habits do not change at all and whenever they say so, they become rich.
However, we should talk about these things and keep trying.
Now I cant say where I went and if someone gives me a bouquet then I will refuse it.
My dear countrymen, as a Prime Minister, there are many types of things.
However, I have developed a habit for myself that I read some of the letters that I receive every day and that gives me an opportunity to connect with the common man.
There are different types of letters, different types of letters written by people.
Recently I got to read a letter and I think I must tell you about it.
A letter was sent to me by a housewife in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, from far away south India.
And when the letter was received, he used to write that he had planned to take up some economic activities in his family keeping in mind the education of the children so that some financial help could be provided to the family.
I took money from the banks under the Mudra scheme and started working towards supplying some goods from the market.
Some people asked me, I have registered on my own. I want to tell the people of the country that you should also get the same opportunity on the internet.
Visit GeM is a new kind of system.
Those who want to supply the goods to the government, sell the broom, sell it and send a table, they can register on it.
All the departments of the government are watching the registration of the people under the EEGM.
Many things are cheap because of lack of agents.
The Arulmoji Madmani has registered on the Governments website the goods they can supply.
And it is unfortunate that the letters he has written to me are very interesting.
He has written that he got money under the Mudra scheme, his business started, I wrote a list of what I could provide on e-GeM and I got an order from the Prime Minister's Office.
It was a new news for me as to what will be the background of the Prime Minister's Office.
This is an opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
Had Arun Ji not written a letter to me, I would not have noticed that a far-flung system under the e-GeM system can be procured from the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country.
It has transparency, it has empowerment as well as entrepreneurship.
Government e-Marketplace-GeM
I wish that those who want to sell their goods to the government, they should associate themselves with it as much as possible.
I believe that this is a good example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and what is the goal of Minimum Government, Maximum Governance and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga, while on the other hand we are proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground for yoga then our dreams will be far away to cross the horizons of the sky.
A few days ago, India has done a lot in the field of sports and science.
Today, India is hoisting its flag not only on the ground but also in the space.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 small satellites including Cartosat-2 series satellite.
And besides India, these satellites include satellites from almost 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
And this small satellite mission of India will go a long way in helping the agriculture sector cope up with the natural calamity.
You might be aware of the fact that a few days ago, ISRO successfully launched the GSAT-19.
And this was the heaviest satellite launched by India till date.
And the newspapers of our country compared it with the weight of an elephant.
So you can imagine the great work your scientists have done in the field of space.
On 19th June the Mangal Mission completed 1000 days .
You all are aware of the fact that when we had successfully completed the Mars mission, the entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
He is sending pictures, giving information, getting scientific information and working for more than the prescribed time.
On the completion of one thousand days, it is important for our scientific journey to space.
We are also seeing that the performance of our youth is improving in the field of sports.
Recently, India's Badminton Player Kidwai Srikanth has enhanced the pride of the country by winning Indonesia open competition.
I heartily congratulate him and his trainers for this victory.
A few days ago, I was very happy.
T.
Usha gave an opportunity to attend the inaugural function of the synthetic track of Usha School of Athletics.
The more you encourage sports, the more you will learn sports, the more you will learn sports.
Sports plays an important role in personality development.
Sports is an important part of all-round personality development.
There is no dearth of talented sports persons in the country.
If the children of our family have interest in sports, then they should be given an opportunity.
They should not be forced to study by lifting them from the ground and closing them in the room.
They should study, if they are able to do wonders, but if they have talent in sports, then schools, colleges, families and the people around them should give strength and encouragement to them.
Everyone should dream for the next Olympics.
It is difficult to forget the summer of this year .
We were waiting for the monsoon.
Today, as I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has begun.
I convey my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and the entire world, especially the Muslim community on the auspicious occasion of Ramadan.
Prayers , spirituality and charity are given utmost importance in Ramzan .
India is very fortunate that our ancestors have created such traditions and today India can take pride in this thing that 1.25 billion people of the world can take pride in the fact that all communities of the world are in India.
This is a country where there are people who believe in God and those who deny God.
There are people who worship idols and also those who oppose the statue.
Here, every kind of thought, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition is there, and we have imbibed the art of living with each other.
And in the end, be it religion, sect, thought or tradition, all these things give us the same message - peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan is going to be helpful in taking this path of peace, unity and harmony forward.
I once again convey my best wishes to all of you.
I am glad to say that many people have responded to it.
In a personal way, everyone has shown the spirit to tell me what you had in mind.
I have not been able to read everything, everyone's message has not been heard, so many things have been received.
But whatever we have seen on these messages, some have tried to learn music, some have tried to put their hands on new musical instruments, some are trying to learn new things by using YouTube, some are learning new languages.
Some people are learning cooking, some are learning dance and drama.
Some people have written that we have started writing poems.
Some people are trying to understand nature and live with nature.
I am very happy that I want to tell you a phone call too.
"I say I'm a coward.
When I was reading about the freedom struggle, I realized that how much struggle had to be fought for India's independence, how much sacrifices had to be made, how many freedom fighters had to struggle for independence.
I was inspired by Bhagat Singh, who had achieved a lot at a young age.
Therefore, I request you to give a message to the new generation about this.
I am glad that the younger generation is interested in knowing about our history, about our freedom fighters and about the people who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Several great men spent their youth in the arena of freedom struggle, several youngsters went to the gallows.
And that is why today we breathe freely in an independent India.
You must have seen that those great men who had written and studied during the freedom struggle had contributed greatly to India's independence.
I had visited Andaman Nicobar a long time ago.
I had gone there to see the Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote the book 'Maji Janmthep' in Turung.
He used to write poems, write on walls.
They were locked in a small cell.
How the freedom fighters would have suffered
When I read Savarkar's book 'Maji Janmthep', it inspired me to see the Cellular Jail.
A sound show is also presented there, which is very inspiring.
There will not be any state in India, there will not be a single language in India, none of whom will be punished for blackmailing the freedom struggle in Andaman and the Cellular Jail.
It is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar, who spoke the language, every generation, every generation has suffered this.
My dear countrymen, 5th June is the first Monday of this month.
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi often used to say - One must care about a world one will not see.
It is our duty to take care of the world we do not want to see.
If you have come to power then open the windows of the room, open the doors, breathe in the fresh air, a new consciousness emerges.
When the five elements that have formed our body come in contact with those five great souls then a new consciousness emerges in our body.
We all have experienced this but we never take care of it. We dont tie it in a thread or a thread.
Before this you must see that when you come in contact with your natural state a new consciousness will develop within you .
Therefore, on the 5th of June, the global campaign to connect with nature should become our own mission.
We are benefitting from the protection of environment by our ancestors.
Now if we protect the environment then the next generation will benefit.
Atharvaveda is one of the greatest guiding principles of the environment and was written thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth: Son of Aham Separate: The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has said.
The Vedas said that the purity within us is due to earth.
The earth is our mother and we are her son.
If we recall the memory of Lord Buddha, we can clearly see that the three events of the birth of Lord Buddha, the enlightenment of him and his Mahaparinirvana were under way.
But it needs to be integrated in modern words and with modern logic.
Through Yoga, we are connecting the world with one thread.
Just as Yoga unites the body, mind, intellect and soul, it unites today.
Due to this lifestyle, speed and increasing responsibilities, leading a life of stress is becoming difficult.
Even at a very young age, it has been observed that this stressful mind has started showing symptoms.
Yoga plays an important role in leading a stress-free life in such a time when it comes to taking the medicines and the days to come.
Yoga is the way to ensure health and well-being.
Yoga is not just exercise .
It is possible through yoga to experience the difference between body and mind, and the health of thought and practice.
Just two days ago, I have written letters to all the leaders and governments around the world.
Last year, I had announced a few Yoga related competitions, and had announced a few insurance schemes.
Slowly the work will progress in that direction.
I have received a suggestion and I congratulate this valuable idea secretary.
There is a very interesting information .
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga, and on this occasion, you should appeal that three generations of family should practice Yoga together.
Aji-Azoba, I-Baba, son-Mulagi - all three generations should do yoga and upload pictures of it.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow, there will be such a beautiful blend of yoga that will give a new dimension to it.
I am grateful for this idea and I also believe that just as we had run the mission of Selfie with Daughter and had a very interesting experience, in the same way, the photographs of Yoga will be appreciated across the country and the world by doing Yoga together.
You must send a photograph of the people of those three generations of yoga where you are performing Yoga, on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov.
Yesterday, there will be a photo from today and tomorrow, which will ensure a golden future.
I invite you.
The International Day of Yoga is still three weeks away.
In a way, this disease is a campaign for the protection of health.
I invite you all to join this movement.
When I got the opportunity to speak from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the first 15th of August in my tenure, I talked about cleanliness.
Since then, my journey has been going on from different parts of India till date and I have come to know that Modi is closely watching what Modi is doing and what Modi is going on.
This is the reason why I received a lot of phone calls and I have rarely thought of them in the same way.
But I am grateful to them for taking into account this thing.
You can also listen to this phone.
"Namaste Modi ji, I am speaking Naina from Mumbai.
Modi ji, on TV and on social media, I often see that wherever you go, there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission according to your call.
Not only are the adults involved, but children have also become aware about cleanliness.
Children often appear big when stopping the dirt of roads on the elders .
The cleanliness drive that you had started from the banks of Kashi has taken the form of a movement with your inspiration.
You are true that wherever I go, the government machinery does not only work in cleanliness but recently the festival of cleanliness is celebrated in the society as well.
Five days before I reached there, seven days ago, 10 days ago, a large number of cleanliness drives were organized.
A few days ago, I had visited Kutch in Gujarat.
A massive cleanliness drive is going on there.
But I could not understand the mutual relationship between these two things.
But after coming to the telephone, I thought that this thing is true.
You can imagine how happy it would have been to me. And the country is also taking note of it in such a manner.
The relationship of cleanliness also connects me with my visits. What else can be a matter of happiness for me
There is a habit of preparing the rest for the welcome of the Prime Minister, but cleanliness has become the main thing in this regard.
It is also a matter of great happiness and inspiration for anyone who loves cleanliness.
Idea is very good, but I have to think about it.
But it is true that this movement has to be raised and instead of giving a memento to you, it is a good thing to get rid of that small ton of garbage that has come out of the cleanliness drive.
How a great humanity would work
Once we started treating this waste as an asset, several new methods of waste management will come up before us.
Young people associated with start-ups will also come up with new schemes and come up with new ideas.
The Government of India, with the help of the State Governments, has decided to open a massive campaign of waste management with the help of the peoples representatives of the cities.
On World Environment Day, 5th June, around 4000 cities will have access to solid waste and liquid waste collection equipment.
Two types of waste will be made available, one green and the other blue.
Two types of waste are produced - one wet garbage and the other dry garbage.
The waste will be stored in 4000 cities and we will put dry garbage in blue waste bins and wet garbage in green garbage dumps.
For example, the waste that comes out of the kitchen, whether it is vegetable salad, the remaining food, the egg shell or the milk powder, is wet waste and put it in green garbage.
The other kind of waste consists of waste material like trash paper, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, polythene, broken coaches, rubber, metal etc.
I am confident that we will develop such a culture, we will have to take new steps in the direction of cleanliness every time and then we will be able to fulfil the dream of Gandhiji regarding cleanliness.
Today, I want to mention one thing with pride that even if one person decides on the basis of Mann Ki Baat, he can create a mass movement.
Cleanliness is one such task.
The people worked hard for about 80-90 weeks to rejuvenate the Versova beach and when thousands of tons of garbage was wasted, it became clean and beautiful on the Versova beach.
The entire responsibility of this work was taken up by Varsova Residence Voluntary (VRV).
Brothers and sisters, Today one more thing is that I have been told that under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the part of the Reasi block in Jammu and Kashmir has become Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate all the citizens of the Reasi block and their administrators and Jammu and Kashmir for setting an example.
And I have also been told that the women living in that area of Jammu and Kashmir are the leaders of this entire movement.
He took out a torch at the place to spread awareness and inspired people to go out of their homes and neighborhoods.
I heartily congratulate those mothers and sisters and also the administrators there who have made a grand beginning by making a block on the land of Jammu and Kashmir Open Defecation Free.
My dear countrymen, for the last four and a half days, the performance of the present government has been reviewed from newspapers, TV channels, social media, for the past three years.
I see this process as a very positive sign.
The three-year tenure has been passed on every criterion.
People from every section of the society have analyzed it.
Wherever you might have appreciated, some might have supported you, some of your mistakes have been made, and I consider all these things as important.
I also express my gratitude to those who have given a critical and critical feedback.
If we highlight the shortcomings, then we get an opportunity to reform them.
It is very important for an awakened nation and a vibrant nation.
My dear countrymen, I too am an ordinary citizen like you and I am equally impressed by every good and every good thing as it will be in the minds of the common man.
It seems as if I am sitting at home, in the family, in interest of things at home.
And there are hundreds of such families who have written this thing to me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, we will meet again in every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every season has changed, the results of the exams will begin, and a new student will come to life, and with the onset of monsoon, a new joy, a new aroma will come.
Come, let us move forward in such an environment in which we love nature.
My best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, Namaste
Like a seeker, there are countless people who have contributed to the society, on the other hand, the government often does not get the attention of the people.
There was a detailed analysis of the suggestions that came up for Mann Ki Baat every time.
What are the types of suggestions, what are the complaints, what are the experiences of the people
It has been observed in general that human beings are natural to advise others.
In a railway or bus, if someone has coughing then the other person will immediately come and tell him to do this.
Advising and suggesting is something in our nature.
They are the people who give a lot of suggestions, those who try to reach me, those who do something or the other in their lives.
They try to do something better according to their intelligence, power, strength and circumstances. And when these things came to my mind, I felt that these are not common suggestions but these are the words of experience.
Some people also make suggestions because they feel that if this idea is heard by others where they are working then many people can benefit from it.
Therefore, it is their natural desire that we mention it in Mann Ki Baat and all these things are very positive in my view.
First of all, I express my gratitude to all those workers who are engaged in some or the other thing for the welfare of the society.
Moreover, when I mention something, it gives me immense pleasure.
Last time some people had suggested to me in Mann Ki Baat, had expressed concern about the food being consumed and I had mentioned it.
And after mentioning about it, on the NarendraModiApp, many people from every corner of the country used to experiment with innovative ideas to avoid overeating.
I had never thought that today the young generation of our country has been doing this thing for years.
We have been hearing this thing for the past few years, but later I came to know that the youth of my country is engaged in this work.
Many people have sent me videos.
There are several places where there is a bank of pools.
In the banks of these pools, people collect pulses, gather vegetables and those who are in need take them away.
The person who gives satisfaction also does not feel insulted.
This is an example of how work is being done with the help of society.
This is the last day of the month of April.
The States of Gujarat and Maharashtra are being established on 1st May, 2020.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have constantly made efforts to scale new heights of development.
We have contributed to the progress of the country and the life of the great men in both the states inspires us in every field of the society and in the memory of these great men we should take the pledge of taking our state, our country, our society, our city and our family to the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022.
He said that plans should be made to take this resolution forward and with the participation of all citizens.
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports.
The summer that remains in our country in May-June, this year it has been a pleasant experience for us in March-April.
And when I was asking people about Mann Ki Baat, people had suggested that most of the suggestions should be made during these summer days.
s.
Karthik and many other friends have expressed concern about the birds.
He has said that we should keep water on terraces, pits and I have seen that small children of the family do this thing with great interest.
Once they came to know why they should fill this water 10 times a day so that they can see if there is water in the pots that are kept there and they keep watching whether the birds have arrived or not.
We think that this is his game, but it is a wonderful experience to awaken this feeling in the minds of young children.
You too, see, a little bit of a feeling of a new happiness for the animals and birds.
A few days ago, Shri Jagat Bhai had sent a book from Gujarat which has expressed concern over the decline in the number of symbols he has given in this book a lot of details about the experiments and efforts he has made in his campaign form.
Though we have painted in our country, our animals, our nature and our lives, it is important that we collectively strengthen these efforts.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the religious leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community, Syedna Saheb had completed 100 years.
He lived for 103 years.
And on his 100th birth anniversary, the Bohra community had launched a massive campaign to save the memory of the brave martyrs.
I had got the opportunity to launch it.
He distributed about 52,000 bird feeders to every corner of the world.
It has been included in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that the newspapers, the giver of milk, the vegetable, the postman or the postman come to our house but we forget that if they want water then they should ask for it.
Young friends, I have to make some contribution with you as well.
Sometimes I feel worried that many of our young generation feel happy to spend a comfortable life.
Mother - father also keep taking care of them in a safe condition .
There are other areas too, but most of the comforts are being watched.
Now the exams are over and plans have been made to enjoy the holidays.
Summer holidays, even in summers, feel better.
But as a friend, I have to say something about how to leave your vacation.
I am sure some people will certainly try and tell me.
If you use this holiday and I propose three of them then it is a good thing but try one of the three.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
Sometimes watching something on TV or reading in books or listening to one 's acquaintances and feeling yourself , there is a difference between both the sides of the ground .
The experiment should be a positive one, it should bring out the feeling of comfort.
We belong to a middle class family and we belong to a happy family.
I dont want to say that, please do it again and do it again.
In the evening, take your football, take a volleyball or any sports item and go to a poor village.
You can play with those poor children yourself. You will often find that you have never had the joy of playing games in your life before.
When children living such a life in the society will get the opportunity to play with you, you people have ever thought about the great change in their lives.
And I am sure that once you go, you will feel the same again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many voluntary organizations work as service providers.
At times there are very hot camps .
Individuals are of development, they are of a variety of development and they can participate in it.
But at the same time, you feel that you have done this kind of summer camp, you have done a course of personality development and you should reach those people who did not get the opportunity and learn the things you have learnt.
You can teach them how to do it.
I am also worried that technology came to reduce the gap and that it came to close the boundaries of technology.
Each one of them is busy with technology on the other.
Today is the era of competition.
Friends, The dream of becoming a lot in life is a good thing, the idea of doing something is good and should also be done.
But also see that the human element within us does not get disturbed or we do not go away from human qualities.
Can we give some emphasis on this aspect of skill development
Try to spend time with oneself, away from technology.
Learning something in music, learning 5-50 sentences in a new language, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi and Punjabi.
If we look at the country with so much diversity then we can find someone to teach around us.
If you can't swim, then learn to swim, draw pictures and do not get a better picture, but try to put something on the papers.
The sensation within you will have to be revealed.
Sometimes we say small things that we dont want to learn.
You see, all these new experiments, this skill will give you happiness and you will be able to get out of the system that has been tied up in a frame of life.
Friends, please do something outside your kitchen.
This is the opportunity to make life.
And you might be wondering that if all the examinations are over, if you join a new round of career, then that opportunity will not come.
And so I tell you that if you have the desire to learn magic then learn the magic of letters.
Show magic to your friends.
You should try to know something or the other which you do not know, it will definitely benefit you.
It will give consciousness to the human power within you and it will be a good opportunity for development.
I can tell you through my experience that we can not imagine what we can learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages, new areas.
After going to one place, stay for three to four days.
Then go to another place and stay there for three to four days.
You will get to learn a lot from this.
Whenever you go, you must send me the photos there.
Have you seen what new thing
Where do you go?
You can share your experiences using the Hackathon Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a very good opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from cash transactions.
You too do it but you can earn through this scheme. You have thought about it.
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
If you download the BHIM App, you will also be using it.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your bank accounts.
If you get 20 people done in a day then you can earn 200 rupees by evening .
Traders can earn and students can also earn.
And this scheme is till 14th October.
You will be contributing towards making a Digital India.
In a way, he had become a symbol of VIP culture. But experience used to tell that a red light used to fall on a vehicle, but gradually he used to prick on his head and this VIP culture was deeply embedded in his mind.
No one will be able to claim that the red lamp that has been installed in the head has come out.
I have received a very interesting phone call.
He has also expressed his patience during the call but this time it gives an impression that the common man does not like it.
He finds a kind of involvement in it.
Namaste Prime Minister, I say Shiva Choubey, from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I read aloud in the newspaper, in which I felt very proud to hear that Every Indian is a VIP on a road, and today my time is equally important.
I dont want to get stuck in the traffic jam and I dont want to stop for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this decision.
Making of red light through government decisions is a part of the system.
However, we also have to remove it from our minds.
If we all make a conscious effort together, we can do it.
Our idea of a New India is to increase the importance of EPI in place of VIP and when I call EPI in place of VIP, my feelings are clear - Everri Person is Important.
Every person has his or her importance and every person has his or her importance.
If we accept the importance of 1.25 billion Indians, if we accept the importance of 1.25 billion Indians then what a great strength will be there to fulfil the great dreams.
We all have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that let us recall our history, our culture and our traditions.
It gives us energy and inspiration.
This year we are celebrating the one thousandth birth anniversary of 1.25 billion countrymen, Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.
Due to some or some other reason, you were so impatient and so small that you continued to think about it for more and more centuries.
Centuries will be of great importance for other countries of the world.
But India is such an ancient country that we have got the opportunity to cherish its memories for thousands of years and more than a thousand years ago how a society was there
Just imagine it.
Even today, how difficult it is to say about breaking the social norms.
How could it be done a thousand years ago
He himself, through his conduct, had committed the society to those who believed to be untouchables.
Thousands of years ago, he had organized a movement to enter his temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that in every era, great souls have been born out of our society to eradicate the evils of our society.
As we celebrate the one thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya, we must draw inspiration from him to awaken the spirit of social harmony and unity.
The Government of India will also release a commemorative postage stamp on 1st May in memory of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.
I salute Saint Shri Ramanujacharya and pay my respects to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, 1st May has another significance.
It is also celebrated as Labour Day in many parts of the world.
And when it comes to Labour Day, labour is being discussed, workers are being discussed then it is very natural for me to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And very few people would know that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the relief and respect that the workers have received today.
Baba Sahebs contribution towards the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb and Saint Shri Ramanujacharya, I also remember the great saint and social reformer of the 12th century Karnataka, Guru Basaveshwara Ji.
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to attend a function.
It was a programme to dedicate his or her oratory collection to the nation.
In Kannada, he had said - 'Kaay Kave Kailas' meaning 'You can earn the cash of Lord Shankar's house with your hard work, that is, the heaven comes only through karma.
In other words, labour is Shiva.
I once again mention 'Shramev Jayate'.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to recall the memories of Dattopant Thangi.
My dear countrymen, a few days later, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People all over the world celebrate the festival associated with Lord Buddha.
The world is facing the problems that the world is facing today - violence, war, destruction, weapons of mass destruction. When we look at such an environment, the thoughts of Buddha appear very relevant.
And in India, Ashok's life is a great symbol of his journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that the United Nations has celebrated Vesak Day on this great occasion of Buddha Purnima.
This year it will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get an opportunity to pay tributes to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
It will provide an opportunity to highlight their memories.
My dear countrymen, in India, we have always tried to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And when we call 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' then it is not only in India but also in the global context.
Several projects are underway.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The capacity and associated facilities of this satellite will be of immense help in fulfilling South Asia's economic and development priorities.
This is an appropriate example of our commitment towards South Asia.
In most parts of the country, a large number of families will be engaged in the examinations of their children.
Those who have passed the exam will have a stress-free environment and those whose exams are still going on, there will be a lot of stress in those homes.
But this time I will say this thing that listen to what I had told the students through Mann Ki Baat last time.
At the time of examination, those things will definitely be useful to us.
Today is 26 March .
March 26 is Bangladeshs Independence Day.
A historic battle against injustice, a tremendous victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of the Wang brothers and sisters.
On this significant day, I convey my best wishes to the people and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day and also wish the people of Bangladesh progress, development and progress that India is a strong ally of Bangladesh.
We are a good friend and will continue to work shoulder to shoulder for peace, security and development in this entire region.
We are all proud that Rabindranath Tagore is a shared heritage.
The National Anthem of Bangladesh too is composed of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
It is interesting to note that Gurudev Tagore was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913 but the British also gave him the title of 'Naithud'.
When the British killed a large number of civilians in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who had raised their voices against this incident.
This was the period when this incident had a great impact on the mind of a child of 12 years of age.
The brutal massacre in Jallianwala Bagh had given a new inspiration to those children who laugh in fields, in gardens during adolescence and have inspired a new life.
In 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagat Singh, that is, the son of all of us, was a source of inspiration for all of us.
Three days ago, on the 23rd of March, Bhagat Singh ji, his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and you all know about the March 23rd incident.
At that time, on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, the service of Mother India was satisfied and there was no fear of death.
He sacrificed his life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes are still an inspiration for us.
The ballads of sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru will be decorated with words.
I had the opportunity to visit that place a few days ago, I had experienced that there are special spots on that land and I will tell the youth of the country that when there is an opportunity when there is a network of opportunities in Punjab then you must visit the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Battukeshwar Dutt.
This was the time when the expectation of independence and its intensity was increasing.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for the armed revolution.
100 years ago, on 10 April 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had organized the Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary year of the Champaran Satyagraha.
In the Indian freedom struggle, Gandhi ji's thoughts and Gandhi's style were seen during the Champaran Satyagraha.
This was an important turning point in the entire journey of freedom struggle, especially through the way of struggle.
This was the period when Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, Ahmedabad mill workers ended and the work culture of Mahatma Gandhi had a bearing on it.
Gandhiji returned from abroad in 1915 and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
We cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the statue of Gandhiji in our minds today.
Imagine a person returning to India in 1915 and only two years in office .
The country did not recognize him, nor was he influenced by him. This was just the beginning.
We can imagine how hard they have suffered and how hard they have worked at that time.
Champaran Satyagraha was such an event in which Mahatma Gandhi's organizational skills, the power of Mahatma Gandhi to recognize the pulse of Indian society, the ability of Mahatma Gandhi to unite, motivate and put the poorest of the poor to fight against the British Raj, and this is the reason why we experience the vastness of Mahatma Gandhi.
We can learn this from him and there was a time when the names of those great leaders whom we heard, whether Gandhiji was Rajendra Babu or Acharya Kripalani sent them to the villages.
And the British could not understand what was the method of Gandhiji's work, there was a struggle and there was a new creation too.
One side was conflict and the other was creation.
On the one hand we had to sacrifice our duties while on the other we had to devote ourselves to constructive work.
It is the desire of 1.25 billion Indians to change, to bring about change, and to lay the foundation of a New India.
New India is not a government program or a political party.
New India is an appeal to 1.25 billion Indians.
There are many who go to hospitals and serve the patients. There are many who run for blood donation whenever they need.
Many people worry about the stomach of the hungry.
Our country is multi-faceted.
Service to the people i.e. service to the people is different in our veins.
If we look at it in a collective form, if we look at it in an organized form then it is such a great power.
If every citizen resolves that I will follow the rules of transport, if every citizen decides to discharge his responsibilities with honesty and if every citizen decides that I will not use petrol and diesel for one day in a week then things appear to be small.
You will see that the dream of a New India that 1.25 billion people of this country will see will be fulfilled in front of your eyes.
I mean to say that every citizen must abide by his civic duty.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude.
In the last few days, an atmosphere has been created in our country that people have participated in the digital payment and digital movement in a big way.
After demonetization, there has been an increase in various types of digital payments.
It has been only two-and-a-half months since the launch of BHIM App, but so far around 1.5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
Will the 1.25 billion people of the country make a pledge to make 2.5 billion digital transactions in a year
We have announced this in the budget.
For 1.25 billion Indians, if they want to do this thing in their minds, they dont have to wait for a year.
This will be done in six months.
2,500 crore digital transactions, if you pay school fees and do not pay them in cash and digitally, if you travel by train then you will pay the digital payments in your air travel.
We can do this in our daily lives.
In the last few days, several digital fairs have been organized for public education and public awareness.
There is a resolution to do 100 programs across the country.
80 - 85 programs have been organised .
There were also twenty-one schemes.
About 1.55 lakh people have got the benefit of the lucky customer scheme.
70,000 traders have received their insurance cover.
On the completion of 100 days, a big event is going to be organized at the end.
There is a system of big riddles.
I am confident that we will propagate BHIM App in all the days that we have been holding for the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Let us partner with each other on how to use less cash and how to use less currency notes.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to share that every time I ask peoples suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, several suggestions come from them, but I have seen that there are suggestions for cleanliness every time.
Excellency, my greetings and good wishes to you all. First of all, I congratulate you all that you have won with a lot of votes in these elections.
I want to tell you something in my mind.
I want to say that people should understand the need for cleanliness themselves.
I go through that river every day where most of the people pollute the river by putting garbage in it.
This river flows from the 'Rispona' bridge to my house as well.
I would like to say that we should try to root out these things through a group or through a news paper.
See, brothers and sisters, how difficult it is for a single girl to learn.
How much anger has she faced on seeing bananas in the river .
I consider this a good sign.
I want that dirtiness develop in the minds of 1.25 billion Indians.
Since the cleanliness movement has started, awareness has come among the people.
Everyone has been involved in it positively.
Now this campaign has taken the form of a movement.
There is a lot of hatred towards cleanliness.
There is a special importance of awareness and active participation.
But cleanliness is a matter of habit rather than a movement.
This movement is a movement to change the habits and to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can be in collective form.
The work is difficult but we have to do it.
I believe that the spirit that has been created between the new generation of the country, between the children, the students and the youth, is a sign of good results.
I would like to tell the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be the message of every one of us.
Have we ever thought about the damage that we would give to the food that we would give to the poor
Have you ever thought that if you do not waste your food then how many poor people can feed them
This is not a matter that needs to be explained.
In our house when the mother increases the food for the child then she says - take as much food as possible for the child .
Some or the other efforts are being made, but the sadness about it is a social evil.
This is injustice to the poor.
The second point is that if the family is saved then the family will be benefitted financially.
I do not want to talk much about this, but I think there is a need to increase awareness.
I know that some youngsters are running such campaigns.
They have created a mobile app.
Wherever such food is eaten, they communicate with other people and use them for food.
The youth of our country are doing this kind of hard work.
You will find such people in every state of India.
His life inspires us not to waste food, but to increase food as much as possible.
See, there are only ways to change those people who are aware about health , often tell them to keep their stomach empty .
I will tell the countrymen, there is no depression or disorder.
A psychological environment has to be created and treatment starts .
Its first mantra is - instead of suppressing sadness, instead of suppressing sadness, get out.
Tell your colleagues, friends, parents, brothers and sisters, teachers openly what happens to you.
Sometimes the students living in the hostel suffer more due to loneliness.
He does not come to the food table.
Have you ever noticed why he does this
We know that this is the first step towards depression.
If he keeps away from staying with his family, if he goes alone, then it will not happen.
See, he will remain in the company of those people with whom he spends his time freely.
Inspire the smile and inspire him to be clear and let him know where he has touched his mind.
This is the best solution.
Depression can become a cause of mental and physical diseases .
Just as diabetes invites all diseases, similarly, it disrupts the immune system of the fight, courage and decision-making.
Your friends, your family and your environment can keep you away from becoming sad and you can also get out of that mood.
There is one more solution.
If we are not able to open it to the people near us then do one thing, go to those places where the work of helping them with service is being done.
If we try to understand their pain through service then we will have a new confidence in our minds.
By combining with others , serving someone and serving selflessly , stress of mind is relieved .
Although yoga is also a good way of keeping the mind healthy .
Yoga helps a lot in getting rid of stress, freedom from stress and happiness.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga.
We should also prepare ourselves from now on and celebrate the mass yoga festival in lakhs of numbers.
If you want to make some suggestions on Yoga Day, then you should reach me through my mobile application and guide me.
We can compose songs and poems on Yoga, so that the theme can reach out to the people.
However, in the last few days, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
It is a matter of great pleasure that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
She carries the responsibility of the family, takes care of the economic responsibilities of the house and sometimes causes injustice to the newborn.
The Government of India has taken an important decision in this regard.
Working women will now be given maternity leave of 26 weeks, which is earlier available in 12 weeks, at the time of childbirth.
In this regard, only two or three countries are ahead of us in the world.
India has taken an important decision for our sisters.
The primary objective is to take care of the newborn babies who are future citizens of India.
If we take care of her in a child's condition and she gets the love of her mother then tomorrow this child will become the glory of the country.
This will also improve the health of mothers and hence this important decision will benefit about 18 lakh women.
May the life of these great men inspire us and give us the strength to make a pledge for a New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada is a New Year. Best wishes to you all.
The time for the production of crops after the rainy season and the farmers getting ready to take their hard work .
New years are welcomed in different ways in different parts of our country.
New year is being welcomed in Gudhipadava in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Santsar Puja in Awadh province, Jud-Sheetal in Mithila province in Bihar and Satuwani in Magadh region.
India is a country full of countless diversity.
My best wishes to all of you on this New Year.
Many many thanks.
The winter is over now.
Springs have entered the lives of all of us .
As a result of summer the grapefruit of mango appear only in spring .
At the same time, the yellow flowers of mustard in the fields give a new lease of life to the farmers.
The blossoming flower of ribs indicates the arrival of Holi.
Amir Khusro has given a very interesting account of this transformation in nature.
Amir Khusro writes, "Fool raahi sarson becomes gross, amba feet, tesu flowers, coal say, Dar-Dar.
When nature is happy, when the environment is happy, then man also takes full pleasure in this season.
The festivals of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi are the colors of happiness in human life .
In an atmosphere full of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are going to leave Phalgun this last month and are ready to welcome the coming quarter.
Spring is the confluence of these two months.
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions and millions of people of the country for inviting suggestions before Mann Ki Baat.
We are grateful that we have remembered this proud achievement of India.
Be it poverty eradication, prevention of diseases, connecting with the world, knowledge and information technology, science has highlighted its importance.
February 15, 2017 is a glorious day in Indias life.
Our scientists have brought India to the world with pride and we all know that in the last few years, ISRO has successfully completed many missions.
After the successful launch of Mars Mission on Mars, ISRO has set a world record in the last few days in the space sector.
These achievements will be historic not only for ISRO but also for the entire country.
This cost-effective space program of ISRO has become a wonder for the whole world and the world has lauded the success of Indian scientists with an open mind.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 satellites of these 104 satellites is Cartosat-2D, which is the satellite of India. And the images obtained through this satellite will be used for information, mapping, infrastructure development, information about development and urban development.
Especially to my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water is available in the country, how much water is available in the country
It is also a matter of great happiness for us that our young scientists and women scientists have led this campaign.
ISRO's success is a matter of great pride, with such a large participation of youth and women.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I congratulate ISRO scientists.
These scientists have kept up with the aim of using space science for the service of the nation, for the common man and they are recording new records.
No matter how much we congratulate these scientists and their team, it will be less.
Indian scientists have done this.
The capability of this missile is such that even if a missile comes to attack India from a distance of 2000 kilometers, its missile will destroy it in space itself.
When we look at some new technology or some new scientist, we feel happy.
Those who do not get the same answer, they dont get well.
And if we look at the journey of thousands of years of human development then we can say that this journey of development is not complete.
New science, new technology and every technology, every new science, every new era is born.
My dear young people, when we talk of the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our young generation should be attracted to science.
The country needs many scientists.
Todays science can become the reason for a sustainable change in the lives of generations to come.
A few days ago, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had organized a unique competition on the occasion of the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Socio-economic research was invited.
Sometimes in order to find answers, the problem itself highlights the importance of science.
In 2005, there was heavy rains, floods, flooding in the sea and a lot of obstacles.
When there is a natural crisis, the most difficult thing is for the poor.
Two people worked tirelessly and developed a house-to-house system that will save lives, save water from coming home and save lives from diseases caused by polluted water.
The system is also being technically operated.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
There has been an increase in the number of DG-Dhans in the last few days.
The young generation is particularly habituated to making digital payments over their mobile phones.
I believe this is a good sign.
In our country, in the last few days, the 'Bhartiyawan Consumer Scheme' and the 'Digital Wealth Business' scheme have received good support.
It has been almost two months, every day 15 thousand people are getting Rs. 1000 each.
Through these two schemes, the goal of making digital payments in India a peoples movement has been welcomed across the country.
It is a matter of great happiness that today, under the DG-Dhan Yojana, 10 lakh people have been saved, more than 50 thousand traders have received the reward and nearly 150 crore rupees have been deposited in the form of savings.
There are more than 100 consumers under this scheme who have received Rs. 1 lakh each in the form of reward.
There are more than 4000 traders who have received Rs 50,500 each.
Expressing happiness, Shri Santosh from Mysore wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he received an award of Rs. 1,000 under the lucky customer scheme.
But I want to tell you one important thing that he has written that it should reach you.
He wrote that when he got a reservation of Rs.1000, he noticed that a poor woman's house was set on fire and all the things were burnt down in the fire.
Santosh ji, our new and our work is satisfying to all of us.
You have done a very inspiring job.
Brothers and sisters, The 22-year-old executive of Delhi, after demonetization, is now associated with digital transactions and the lucky customer scheme of the government, he got a reward of Rs.1 lakh.
A young student from Maharashtra, Pooja Nemade, is doing a postgraduate course and teaches how Rupaycards, e-wallets are used in their family and how they enjoy it.
How important is the award of one lakh rupees for him, but he has taken up this work as a woman and is connecting others with it.
This movement has a very valuable role in the fight against corruption and black money.
Everyone associated with this work, in my view, is anti-corruption cadre, anti-corruption team of the country.
In a way, you are a soldier of good faith.
On 14th April, a big relief of Rs.
It's about forty-five days.
Remembering them, we can teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
He taught us how to imbibe these qualities.
Especially teach those small and retail traders around you.
On this occasion, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar and the BHIM App, should be given special importance.
And that is why I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation laid by Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
We have to reach out to 125 crore hands across the country through the BHIM App.
The movement that started in the last two-three months has resulted in the success of several urban settlements, many villages and many cities.
My dear countrymen, the agriculture sector is at the root of our countrys economy.
The economic strength of the village boosts the economic momentum of the country.
I want to tell you a very happy thing today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have filled the godowns with hard work and hard work.
This year there has been record production due to the hard work of the farmers of our country.
Similarly, the records tell us that our farmers have broken all the previous records.
This year such crops have been sown in the fields that every day it seems that Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than 2,00,000 tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country.
This is more than eight per cent more than the previous record in the name of our farmers.
This is an unprecedented achievement by itself.
I especially thank the farmers of the country.
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to grow pulses for the poor of the country, along with the traditional crops, because pulses also provide the highest protein to the poor.
I am glad that the farmers of my country heard the voice of the poor and planted pulses in about 200 lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but it is a great service to the poor of my country.
My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special thanks for the way my farmers have done a great job and produced record pulses.
My dear countrymen, in our country, from the government to the society, from the institutions to the organizations, from everyone, there is something going on in terms of cleanliness.
In a way, everyone seems to be aware of some or the other way of cleanliness.
The government is also making constant efforts.
A few days ago, a program of senior officials of 23 state governments under the leadership of our Secretary, Water and Sanitation, the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India, was held in Telangana.
What is the importance of physical cleaning, not just in the closed room of the city of Warangal, Telangana
After experimenting the same thing the Toilet Pitching Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February .
They were cleaned by evacuating toilet boxes of six houses and officials themselves demonstrated that emptying the pits used for twin pit toilet can be used again.
He also showed how comfortable the toilets built using this new technology are, and there is no problem in cleaning the toilets, there is no hesitation in it, no hindrance can be obstructed.
We can clean the pit of a toilet as soon as we clean it.
And this is the cleanliness of the pits of the toilet. If you look at it as a fertilizer, then in a way it is black gold.
We can see how waste to wealth is produced and this has been proved.
A standard twin pit toilet for the families of six persons and this model fills in about five years.
After that, the waste can be easily removed and released into another pit.
Waste accumulated in the pits was decompositioned in six to twelve months.
Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium are full of nutrients and it is considered to be a very good fertilizer in the agriculture sector.
The way the government has taken this initiative, the other people have also done this kind of experiments.
Now a special program has been started on Doordarshan.
The more it will be broadcast, the more it will be.
Several departments of the government regularly organise Swachhta Pakhwada.
In the second half of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation are going to carry forward the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We are aware that whenever any citizen of our country does something good then the whole country feels a new energy and self-confidence is increasing.
We welcomed the achievements of our Divyang sportspersons in the Rio Para Olympics.
The country is proud of the success of these differently abled friends.
I always believe that the disabled brothers and sisters are powerful, determined, courageous, and determined.
We can learn from them every moment.
Whether it is sports or space science, the women of our country are not lagging behind.
They are moving ahead walking step by step and with their success they are bringing glory to the nation. A few days ago, our women team has won a silver medal in the Asian Rugby Saving Trophy.
I convey my best wishes to all these players.
World Women's Day is celebrated all over the world on 8th March.
There should be greater awareness and sensitivity towards girls in India as well as in the family and society.
This mission of saving and learning is going on at a rapid pace.
Today, this has not been just a government programme.
Today it has become a movement of social consciousness and public education.
The common man has been associated with this initiative in the last two years.
This initiative has forced every corner of the country to think about this burning issue.
We have brought about a change in the thinking of the people about the age-old customs which had been prevalent for years.
After the birth of a daughter, the festival was celebrated. Whenever we get the news, it gives us immense pleasure.
In a way, positive thinking about girls is leading to social acceptance.
I have heard that in the state of Tamil Nadu, Cuddalore district has banned child marriage under a special campaign.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to the scheme of saving and saving the lives of the children, besides organizing Gram Sabhas, the district administration is making every effort to ensure that the orphan girls adopt and get education.
In Madhya Pradesh, under the 'Har Ghar Daksha' initiative, education is being run for girls from village to village.
Efforts are being made to revive the school dropout girls from Rajasthan through Apna Bachcha, ApnaVidyalaya.
New ideas are being associated with it.
It has changed according to local needs.
When we celebrate Womens Day on the 8th of March, we will have the same feeling - Women, who are powerful, who are the women of India or who are with us, who are with us, who are with us, who are with us. My dear countrymen, we get an opportunity to talk something in Mann Ki Baat.
You too would be actively participating.
I am extremely grateful to you for your participation.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
On January 26, we celebrated our Republic Day with great joy and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
This festival, which reminds us of Indias Constitution, the duty of its citizens, the rights of its citizens and its commitment to democracy, is in a way a celebration of the responsibility of bringing democracy to the next generations.
But the more we talk about the rights and duties of citizens in our country, the more we talk about them in a comprehensive manner, the more we talk about them.
I hope that the more important the rights are given at every level, the more important the duties are also given.
This morning, at 11 a.m., we took a two-minute silence and paid homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country.
On January 30, at 11 o'clock in the morning, I observed this two-minute silence. As a society, as a country, we have to become a natural habit.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the families of the brave soldiers who have been conferred with various gallantry awards.
The awardees include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I especially appeal to the youth of the country that you are very active on social media.
Can you do one thing Can you find out about those heroes who have received this honor on the internet and send them to your friends by writing two good words about them
When we get to know about their bravery, their valour and their valour deeply, then we feel proud and are inspired.
While on the one hand we were happy to hear the news of 26 January 2020, at the same time, the soldiers deployed in Kashmir to protect the borders of our country had to lose their lives due to avalanches.
I salute all those brave soldiers and salute them.
My young friends, you are aware that I keep telling you our Mann Ki Baat.
The month of January, February, March and April is the period of great crisis in every family.
In almost every house, one or two children are examined but all the families were under the burden of that exam.
At that time, it seemed appropriate to interact with my student friends, their parents and teachers, because for many years, wherever I go, the examination of the children in those places where I meet them becomes a cause of great concern.
A strange mental state is being created in every home where the family is worried, the students are worried, the teachers are worried.
When I announced that I would like to speak on this subject, many teachers, parents, students sent me a message, asked questions, sent some suggestions and also referred to the difficulties faced by you.
I would like to share with you the thoughts that came to my mind after reading all these things.
I received a telephony message of creation.
Sir, let me tell you that on the day of examination, a very frightening atmosphere was created in our family, neighbors and our society.
It does not make the minds of the students sad, it becomes sad.
I want to ask you that why cant this environment be happy
The Prime Minister said, The question that I have asked is true but it will always spread to all of us.
There are very few who appear in the exam.
For most of them, the exam was a pre-requisite.
It is indeed a matter of great concern that you have to decide on the issue.
He will get the same results as he will get the same results as he will be able to face the problem and he will get the time for repentance.
Therefore, I am of the opinion that you should be able to face examinations as if there are some festivals.
This is the strength of the festival.
The entire family should play their part in fulfilling this festival with enthusiasm.
See, the picture will change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there are exams in these 3-4 months.
These three-four months, in their respective manner, should be converted into festivals, following the traditions and the environment of their families.
And that is why I will tell you, "Smile More, Score More".
In a stressful environment, all the doors are closed, nothing can go in from outside and cant come in.
The process of thinking stops and it becomes a burden.
And you do not have knowledge, there is lack of information, there is lack of hard work.
But when there is tension, your knowledge, your knowledge, your knowledge, your skills, and your stress, are filled with stress.
It is important to remember A Happy Mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we do not look at the exam with the right perspective.
It is like a question of life and death.
This examination will be the only thing that you have done throughout the year.
There will not be a test of your entire life.
This test is not about how you are leading a life, how you are leading a life and how you have to lead a life ahead.
In addition to the examinations conducted by them in class, you must have gone through a series of tests.
The former President of India, Dr.
J.
The biggest challenge that I see in today's education is becoming exam oriented.
Markets are getting a lot of importance.
This has not only increased the competition but has also created a lot of stress for the students.
I want to know your views on the current trend of education system and its future.
Though he has answered in his question, he wants me to share some of my views on the subject.
There is a limited use of qualities and character.
If you believe in these things, then Marks will be behind you and you will never have to run behind them.
Your knowledge will be used in life, your skills will be used, your self-confidence and determination will be used.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a big blow, can you see his mark sheet
Its experience, its knowledge and the successful journey of the field of lawyerry can be seen there.
Therefore, this scourge of Marks sometimes stops us from moving in the right direction.
The issue of continuous competition with others has also been raised by Mr.
This is a very big mental battle.
Examples related to sports are easy to understand, so I say the same.
Most of the successful players have a specialty that they are self-reliant.
Let us take the example of Sachin Tendulkar.
For 20 years, he has been constantly breaking his own record and moving forward by defeating himself.
He should say something wonderful because he has followed the path of self-reliance rather than competing with others.
Even in every field of AYUSH, you must ask yourself if I could study for two hours peacefully, if I could study for three hours.
Was it too late to get up early in the morning
First, we do not have to sleep because of the stress of examination.
He further said, My mother did not learn a lot.
Even then, he used to sit with me and get rid of mathematics from me.
I would like to tell the parents that they should focus on three things - accept, teach and give time.
Parents must be aware that the expectations from their teachers and their children are from the root of many problems.
The burden on you will also be removed.
I was there and I saw that he did not ask a single question about the health of that person.
They started listening to Vinodi in a very short time.
In just 4-5 minutes, the entire atmosphere was completely relaxed.
The aerobics scare the patient by talking about the disease he visits.
I want to tell the parents that sometimes we are familiar with the children.
Have we ever thought that we should give children an atmosphere of joy and laughter during examinations
You see, the atmosphere will change.
I have received another big call from Kamal.
He said, "Namaste Prime Minister, I cant name it myself as I did my childhood as well.
Once I had tried to copy it.
And when I tried to copy it, it was also caught, because of which many friends around me had a lot of trouble.
These short-cut roads become the reason for copying.
You must have heard this many times.
I will repeat the same.
In any case, there will be adverse effects of copying.
If the same creativity, the same time will be spent on the exam then perhaps it will not be necessary to copy.
One phone call has come to me and she says, "Namaste Prime Minister, my name is Monica, I am a 12th student and I want to ask you some questions related to the board exams.
My first question is about the growing tension in these examinations, how can they be reduced
When I talk about playing and playing during the exam, your teacher, your parents will keep on following me.
He said that he is the Prime Minister who tells children how to play during exams.
Because in sports, we generally understand that the focus on studies is decreasing.
This thinking is wrong in the root.
The root of the problem is that only .
Two moments out of your studies, watch a little sky, watch the trees around you, light up your mind and then study in your room.
Give yourself the time of rest for five minutes.
You will see that the work is progressing at a rapid pace.
Whether everyone likes it or not, but my experience tells me the same thing.
There is no need to sit in the room.
Stand under the sky, go to the chair, breathe for five minutes and then sit in the study.
Some people think that if you wake up very late at night then there will be a lot of study .
But no.
Take as much sleep as is necessary .
There will be a total increase in your efficiency.
When I go for the election campaign, sometimes my voice is sitting.
At one such meeting, I had come to meet a folk singer.
They asked me, How many hours do you sleep
But this does not mean that you keep sleeping continuously .
However, the people of your home will stay with me.
It is a very big medicine to keep mind , brain , body attentive .
However, my young friends, you people are engaged in the preparation for the examinations and I am stuck in my mind.
Probably this saying by me will help you to alleviate your stress.
But at the same time, I will also say that do not take the blame on what I have told you.
If there is a problem then do it or not, otherwise it will become a burden.
Do not put the burden of expectations on children. I am also concerned about what your parents have told you.
Keeping in mind your determination and self-confidence, stand with the exams.
My best wishes are with you.
In order to cross every criterion, make that criterion a festival.
Therefore, no examination will remain the same.
You should move ahead with this mantra.
Dear fellow citizens, The Indian Coast Guard will complete forty years on February 1, 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
The Indian Coast Guard, with its built 126 ships and 62 aircraft, is the fourth largest Coast Guard in the world.
Indian Coast Guard personnel are working round the clock to ensure that the countrys maritime border and sea areas are protected by following the motto of the Prime Minister.
Last year, the people of the Coast Guard took pride in making our countrys sea shores clean with their responsibilities.
Thousands of people participated in the event.
He was truly appreciative of the safety of the coastal areas as well as the cleanliness of these beaches.
Very few people are aware that not only men but women are also fulfilling their responsibilities with a similar zeal in the Coast Guard of our country.
Our women officers in the Coast Guard are pilots, observers and even the Hovercrafts have been entrusted to them.
Today, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard, the issue of coastal security remains a concern at the global level.
On 1st February, the festival of Vasant Panchami will be celebrated.
He is considered to be the art of learning.
Not only this, it is an inspiring time for the heroes.
The song Mara Rang de Basant Chola shows the same inspiration.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens on the auspicious occasion of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, while broadcasting the Mann Ki Baat programme, Akashwani also fills it with new colors with your innovative ideas.
Mann Ki Baat offers a great opportunity to connect with you.
I convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, Namaste, Greetings to all of you.
Today is the day to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Jesus Christ has said, The poor should not take our advantage, we should accept it.
St. Luke has written in the Ganspel, that the Jews not only served the poor but also praised the service done by the poor and in the true sense this is empowerment.
A story related to it is very popular.
It is said in that story that Jesus stood near a temple treasury .
Several wealthy people came and offered a lot of donation.
After that, a poor widow was brought and she placed two copper coins in it.
Now if we go to see this then what is the value of two copper coins
It was surprising for the devotees standing there .
Then Jeshon said that the widow had donated the highest amount, and others had given a lot, but this woman donated everything that she had.
Just a few days ago, I got the opportunity to launch several development works in Varanasi, where Malaviya ji had been in penance.
I laid the foundation stone of the BHU Cancer Centre in Varanasi, Your Majesty Madan Mohan Malaviya.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
The contribution made by Atal ji can never be forgotten.
Under his leadership, he made the country proud in the field of nuclear energy.
Whether it is a party leader, a Member of Parliament, a Minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji has set an example in every field.
I salute Atal ji on his birthday and pray for his good health.
As a worker, I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are awake today in front of my eyes.
When I tweeted this morning, I shared an old picture of how Atalji's love as a small worker.
Today, on the occasion of Christmas, the people of the country will get the benefit of two schemes.
In a way, two new schemes are being launched.
Everyone has to learn and understand from each other.
In order to promote this, the Central Government's incentive scheme for customers as well as small traders has been launched today to strengthen the mobile banking system and to make it a habit of e-payment.
The objective of the scheme is to promote the consumer centricity and to promote the Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana (DDUGKY).
The scheme will start from today and will continue for the next 100 days.
Every day, 15,000 people will receive a premium of Rs. 1,000 each.
On 14th April, 2020, after three months, Dr Jitendra Singh said, there will be a huge relief of Rs.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on that day there will be a great deal of relief worth crores of rupees.
Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana is primarily for traders.
Traders should join this scheme on their own and also involve customers in making their transactions cashless.
Separate insurance will also be provided for such traders and these savings will also be there in thousands.
The traders will continue to do their own business and they will also get the opportunity to win the prize.
The scheme has been designed keeping all sections of society, especially the poor and lower middle class people at the centre.
Those who purchase more than Rs. 3000 will not get the benefit of these buffaloes.
Even the poorest of the poor can purchase goods through a feature phone or common phone using USSD, selling goods, paying money and all of them can be beneficiaries of this insurance scheme.
In rural areas too, buyers can sell and sell through AePS and the bookies can also win.
30 crore citizens can join the BBBP scheme soon.
It is very easy as you send messages on WhatsApp with as much ease as you can.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to see that awareness about how to use technology, how to make e-payments, how to make online payments is increasing rapidly in our country.
Cashless transactions have increased by 200 to 300 in the last few days.
The government of India has taken a major decision to promote this.
The traders will be able to guess how big this decision is.
Tax exemption has been granted to traders who are engaged in digital transactions, who will make online payment without cash in their charge.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
A Committee has been constituted under the Chairmanship of Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu.
At the same time, I have seen that several schemes have been started by the state governments on their own.
Somebody told me that the Assam Government has decided to give 10 rebate to pay the property tax and trade permit fee through digital means.
50,000 to the bank accounts of 75 of its subscribers during the period January to March, 2020 with a minimum of two digital transactions.
He also announced that the Government will provide Rs. 5 lakh security cover to 100 percent digital transactions by the Government under the Best Panchayat on Digital Payments scheme by March 31, 2017.
The Government of Assam has announced an ex-gratia of Rs. 5,000 to the first 10 farmers, who have fully digitally paid for the procurement of seeds and fertilizers under the Digital Farm Scheme for the farmers.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and all those who have taken such initiatives.
Several organizations have successfully carried out several successful experiments to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers of the villages.
I was told that in a short span of time, 35,000 farmers had procured 5 lakh pieces of fertilizers through digital mode and it took only two weeks to facilitate the farmers to sell their fertilizers through the Gujarat Narmada Khore, Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited.
It is a matter of pride that the companys fertilizer sales have gone up by 27 this year as compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters, The scope of the informal sector has increased in our economy and our system of living. And most of the time these people get the money, the money, the money and the wages of the workers, and the cash payment is being provided to them.
Wherever you should get Rs.100, you will get Rs.80.
At the same time, they are also becoming the beneficiaries of other benefits.
Our country is the country with the highest youth power.
Technology is easily accessible to us.
A country like India should be at the forefront in this field.
Our youth have also made great strides in the field of start-ups.
These are golden days of the digital movement.
Our youth will be able to empower this sector with new ideas, new technology and new ways of doing so.
At the same time, all of us should join in the campaign to make the country free from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, every month, I appeal to people to give their suggestions and ideas before Mann Ki Baat.
80 to 90 of the suggestions received on MyGov and Narendra Modi App are related to the fight against corruption and black money.
When I saw all these things, I divided them into three parts with a strong heart.
In the suggestions given by some people to me, I have written in detail about the difficulties faced by the citizens and the inconveniences that they are facing.
In another way people have written that despite such a good work and sacred work for the welfare of the country, abuse is taking place in some places and how new avenues of fraud are being explored.
The third kind of people have written in letter and spirit to support what happened and continue the fight.
The number of people who have urged that corruption, black money should be completely eliminated and strict action should be taken if necessary.
I would like to thank all the countrymen who helped me by sending a lot of letters.
The Minister said that this step taken to completely stop black money transactions is commendable.
We are fighting against corruption and black money just like the armed forces.
Several rumors have spread that the words written on notes are wrong, the rate of sweets has increased, the currency of two thousand rupees will be canceled, the currency of 500 and 100 rupees will be canceled.
However, the people of this country were stunned by the rumours.
Moreover, many people came to the ground, using their skills and intelligence, to bring out the true face of the people who spread rumours, proved to be false and brought the truth to everyone.
I salute this power of the people as well.
My dear countrymen, today I feel that when 1.25 billion Indians are standing with you, nothing is impossible.
Janardan is the form of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God alone.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for participating in this great struggle against corruption and black money.
I wanted the House to discuss about the fight against corruption and black money.
Had the work of the house been done then there would have been a good discussion.
There are some people who are spreading rumours that there are some concessions to the political parties.
The law is the same for all.
Whether it is a person, an organization or a political party, everyone should follow the law and everyone has to do it.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and black money spend time in finding faults with the government.
There is also a question of how to change the rules repeatedly.
This government is for the people.
For 70 years, what power has been involved in this period of dishonesty and corruption, what will be the strength of those forces
When I decided to fight against such people, they started a new effort every day to defeat the government.
On the other hand, several citizens have written letters to discuss the ongoing unfair practices as well as various deviations.
The common man is providing several times more information than the information that comes in the government system.
The success we have achieved is due to the awareness of the common man.
The government has prepared an e-mail address to inform the people about the same.
I express my special gratitude to all those writing this letter, I believe in his letters and I am blessed with a lot of blessings.
This is not a complete break.
This is the beginning.
There is no question of being tired, there is no question of stopping and there is no question of getting rid of the work for which 1.25 billion people get the blessings.
You would be aware that there is a law on Benami Property in our country which was enacted in 1988.
He had kept the hooligans in Basan.
We took it out and implemented the effective Benami Property Act.
In the coming days, this Act will have to show its effect.
What we have to do for the welfare of the country and for the welfare of the people has been our top most priority.
Indias ranking has improved in the World Bank Doing Business Report.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have jumped 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and jumped 19 places in the World Bank's Domestic Performance Index in 2016.
Evaluation of several reports is in such a way that India is progressing at a rapid pace.
My dear countrymen, this time the people of the country were disappointed with the session of Parliament.
He expressed his anguish over the functioning of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their displeasure over the issue openly.
But even in such situations, some good things happen and the mind is satisfied.
A good work has been done in the functioning of the Parliament but the attention of the country has not been given to that.
Brothers and sisters, I am proud to say that the bill related to the mission that my government has been moving forward for the disabled persons has been passed by the Parliament.
I express my gratitude to all the MPs in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this and I thank them on behalf of crores of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is also committed to the Divyangs.
I have tried to accelerate the movement of the person.
I wanted the Divyangs to get their rights and they should get their due respect.
By winning four medals at the Olympics, our Divyang brothers and sisters have given a new dimension to our efforts and faith.
Due to his victory, he not only raised the nation's stature but also surprised the people with his strength.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, like every citizen of the country, have an invaluable heritage and strength.
I am happy that after passing the bill for the welfare of the Divyangjans, they will get more employment opportunities.
The limit of reservation in government jobs has also been increased to 4.
The Government has enacted a new law in accordance with the United Nations mandate.
This includes 14 categories.
My young friends, In the last few weeks, we have achieved great pride in sports as well.
The Indian Cricket Association won 4-0 series against the United Kingdom.
Some of the young players have done well in this.
If we have a young player like Karuna Nair, then we have done a trident.
L.
Rahul played 199 runs.
Virat Kohli, the leader of the Kasoti Sangha, led the Sangh well while doing a good job.
Indian Cricket Association of Spinar Golandaj R.
Ashwini was declared the 'Creator of the Year' by ICC and the 'Creator of the Year' by the ICC.
I heartily congratulate all of them.
Even in the field of hockey, good news has come and good news after 15 years.
Junior hockey team has won the World Cup.
After 15 years, Junior hockey team has named the World Cup.
Congratulations to the young players on this accomplishment.
This accomplishment is very well in the future of the Indian Hockey Team.
Last month, our women players also performed very well.
The Indian Womens hockey team won the Asian Championship and recently, a few days ago, the Indian Womens Association won the Bronze medal in the Asia Cup.
I heartily congratulate all the players in the cricket and hockey team.
My dear countrymen, the coming year of 2017 should be a new year of joy and enthusiasm, let all our resolutions be fulfilled and let us scale new heights of development.
This New Year should also give an opportunity to the poorest of the poor to lead a happy life.
My best wishes to you all for the year 2017.
Thank you very much.
Even as every year, I had gone to China to celebrate Diwali with my Indian soldiers.
I celebrated Diwali in the highlands of the Himalayas along with the ITBP jawans and the soldiers.
But the experience of this Diwali was different.
The unique way in which 1.25 billion citizens of the country, the Diwali that was dedicated to the soldiers of the Armed Forces, the same was reflected in the faces of every soldier, the same spirit was reflected in them.
Some people have made videos, some have done poems, some have done pictures, some have done cards and some have made videos.
And when I read this letter, I was very surprised.
These letters are full of emotions and innovation.
At the same time, a suggestion was made on My Gov that by collecting the selected items, the same coffee table book can be made.
A soldier from our army wrote to me, Prime Minister, the Holi of our soldiers, Diwali and every festival is on the border.
It seemed as if we were celebrating Diwali with 1.25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, in this Diwali, your feelings towards our armed forces will be limited to just a few occasions.
I urge you, as a society, as a nation, to develop this habit, be it a festival or a festival, we should keep in mind some or the other aspect of the country's soldiers.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of our army increases by 1.25 billion times.
A few days ago, the Sarpanch of the state of Jammu and Kashmir had come to meet me.
He was a member of the Jammu Kashmir Panchayat Council.
They had come from different parts of Kashmir valley and there were about 40-50 people.
I had the opportunity to talk to him for a long time.
He had come up with issues related to the development of his village.
They had some demands and when our dialogue started, the issues of the environment, the law and order situation in the Kashmir valley and the future of the children came up naturally.
Schools are being set on fire in Kashmir. And I saw that they felt the pain of their countrymen.
He said that not a school, but a child's future has been burnt.
I request you to look into the future of these children.
Just a few days ago, the board exams were conducted in the state, where about 95 per cent students and girls from Kashmir, both girls and boys passed the exam.
I would not only like to congratulate him for his enthusiasm, but I also thank his parents, relatives and his teachers and the Sarpanch of all the Gram Panchayats from the bottom of my heart.
My dear brothers and sisters, At a time when I had asked you for Mann Ki Baat', I could say that you have sent a suggestion on the same subject.
All of them were told in detail about the notes of 500 and 1000.
I was also aware of the fact that we have to face many new challenges in our daily life.
There cannot be a way of getting rid of the diseases that we have been facing for 70 years.
I can understand your difficulties.
The country with a currency of 500 and 1000 rupees and the country with such a huge amount of currency, this decision is worth billions and billions of rupees.
The world is looking at Barakine. Every economist analyses the same.
All over the country, the central government, state government, local government departments, one lakh 30 thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1.5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh banks, friends, are working day and night with a sense of dedication.
Despite a lot of stress, they are working with a very peaceful mind, considering this as a sacrifice for the service of the nation and an attempt to change it.
When will we start in the morning, when will the night be complete
Suddenly there was a need for money.
Many such incidents take place everyday in TV, newspapers and discussions.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who have worked hard and worked hard for this great feat.
Capacity is known only when success comes after the test.
I remember that when Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana was started and bank employees took the responsibility of it on their shoulders and they had done the work that was not done in the last 70 years.
Today, once again they have accepted that challenge and I believe that the resolution of 1.25 billion people of this country will give a new strength to this country, for the collective efforts of all.
But the bad habits have spread so much that even today many people do not get the bad habits.
Some people still feel that this amount of corruption, this black money, this unaccounted money, benami money, some people have to find some roads and bring them back to the system.
They are looking for illegal ways to save their money.
Saddened by the fact that they have chosen the path of using the poor.
They are trying to save money by confusing the poor and by filling them in their bank accounts or by doing some work from them.
I want to tell such people today that whether they want to reform or not, whether they want to reform or not, whether they want to comply with the law or not, whether they want to see the law
But don't play with the lives of the poor by doing a great job.
And the government does not want the problems faced by the countrymen.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village, Taluka Tharali, Ji Hadara and Madhya Pradesh.
It is commendable that we have stopped the notes of 500 and 1000 rupees.
I wish that through Mann Ki Baat, many such examples have been brought to the public that the people, despite being helpless, welcomed these stern steps for the progress of the nation.
Because we say good days will come, but no one could even imagine that we would take such a big step.
Black money and corruption have been a source of great inspiration for people looking at the notes of 500 and 1000 rupees.
There will never be a better day for every Indian.
I feel so happy and so proud that the common man of my country has a great capability.
People go there and eat there and after 2-4-6 days when they go there then they pay the money.
This is the strength of my country which includes service, sacrifice and honesty.
At the time of elections, I had launched Chai Pe Charcha and this thing has spread across the world.
But I did not know that marriage is done in 'Chai Pe Charcha'.
In Surat, Gujarat, a daughter only served tea to those who got married to her.
Once I was watching the news on TV that I was late in the night and there was a small village called Dhakiyajuli in Assam.
What did they do when a note of Rs.2000 was received
Four women from nearby neighborhoods came together and went to the market and bought it together and paid money using a note of Rs 2,000.
See, how changes are taking place in the lives of the villages.
Some people immediately benefited from this mission.
I came to know about the situation in small towns.
I came to know from about 40-50 cities that due to the closure of these notes, the people who remained behind were not paying the money.
And we are aware that the poor people dont pay the money in advance for the past two days.
Those who are big people, those who are familiar with them, those who know that no one will ever ask them, they will not give them the money, and that is why they are very tired.
Each Municipal Corporation gets 50 percent of the tax paid.
However, this time, the decision on the 8th of this month has made everyone move to deposit their old notes.
Last year, the tax collection in 47 urban areas was about Rs. 3-75 thousand crores.
You will be surprised to know that in this one week, Rs. 13,000 crore has been deposited with them.
But today I specially congratulate the farmers of my country.
I have been taking data on the crop production of this season.
The farmers have found a way even after the difficulties.
The government has taken several important decisions, including prioritizing the farmers and the villages.
Small traders in our country send employment and help in increasing the economy.
In the last budget, we took an important decision - just like the biggest mall in the village, even the small shopkeepers in the village will be able to carry out their business for 24 hours.No law will stop them.
Initiatives were taken to provide loans through the MUDRA Yojana.
However, due to this decision, it was natural for them to face problems.
I want to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is a chance that we too should enter the digital world.
You should also download the bank's app on your mobile phone. You should also keep a POS machine for credit card.
Let us learn how to do business without using a note.
You see, the big malls, the way they increase their business through technology, a small businessman can increase his business with the help of 'Yugery Friendly Technology'.
There is no chance of anything getting worse and there is a chance of increasing it.
I invite you that you can make a big contribution in creating cashless society.
There are road to technology, safe, reliable and fast.
I believe that I would like to tell my worker brothers and sisters that they are very exploited.
But friends, you are my real soldier and braveheart.
There is a unique opportunity in front of us to serve Mother India and to take the country to greater economic heights.
The world does not have a generation as old as your experience.
We are aware that the previous generations do not know what used to happen.
You know how online banking, online ticket booking is being done.
There is nothing special about it.
But today the country that wants to do great things, which is your dream, the cashless society, it is true that 100 per cent of us will not succeed but we have not started it.
If we start a cashless society, then the goal is not far away.
Wallet is e-packet.
Many types of cards are available.
Crores of poor families in India have RuPay cards under Jan Dhan Yojana.
But after 8th, the poor have also started using RuPay card, which has gone up by almost 300.
Similarly, for getting prepaid cards for mobile phones and for spending the money in bank accounts, prepaid cards are available.
This work is so easy that just as you send the Whatsapp.
We know how to forward the message to the uneducated, especially the under-privileged.
Not only this, technology is becoming so easy that it does not require the help of smart phones.
Be it a dhobi, a vegetable seller, a milk seller or a tea seller, everyone can use it.
I have put emphasis on simplifying the system.
All banks are working on it.
In the last two-four days, you will be able to read in the current letter that has been issued in the last two-four days.
The technology that is being used to spend online will be available on our mobile phones.
Not only this, if you take half an hour or two hours a day and tell at least ten families that what is the use of technology, how can you download the app from your bank
We have to take this campaign out of the clutches of cashless society and get rid of corruption, campaign to free the country from black money, campaign to get rid of people's problems.
If the common man learns this system then he will be freed from the worries and I believe that it will not take long for all the youth of India to sacrifice themselves in this work.
Within a month we will be able to stand as a modern India in the world.
And you can do this through a mobile phone and can go to 10 houses every day.
I invite you, do not stop with your support, we will become an army of change and we will bring about change.
We will take this fight forward to make the country free from corruption and black money.
And there are many countries in the world where the young people there have transformed the life of the nation and there is a revolution from the youth.
A mobile system called M-Pesa was developed by Kenya, and it was used by technology and named M-Pesa.
This country has brought a big revolution.
My young friends, I once again urge you to take this campaign forward.
I invite you from schools, colleges, universities, NCC, NSS, collectively, individually and individually.
The most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji is pushing the cleanliness campaign forward.
And that is why he remembered the work of cleanliness on his father's birth anniversary.
He writes: One of the poems of Harivansh Rai Ji, one of them is an oasis, a oasis, a oasis, a tan of clay, a man of mind, a lifetime of me. My introduction is given through the medium of Harivansh Raivansarai.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, I have always connected with you through Mann Ki Baat, through my thoughts, through my letters, on My Gov and on Narendra Modi App.
At 11 o'clock, the Mann Ki Baat programme will be broadcast but we will soon be able to hear it from regional languages.
Diwali is celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is such a country where 365 days of the year are celebrated somewhere or the other.
This festival is another name for the lives of Indians. Anyone who observes these distances will feel that it is natural.
Since the time of the Vedas, the tradition of festivals in India has changed according to the times.
However, one thing can be seen in this journey that the entire journey of festivals celebrated in India is linked with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas'.
The basic purpose of this is to expand the horizon of individual and individuality, to expand the horizon of our limited thoughts from the society to the universe, and to achieve it through the festival.
If we consider the food contained in the festivals celebrated in India, then our ancestors have organized scientific festivals in a scientific way about the weather, what kind of food should be taken, what kind of crops should be grown by the farmers, how it should be included in the festivals.
Today the whole world is talking about the environment.
Destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
The tradition of festivals in India, however, inspires one and all, from kids to elders.
Be it trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, we celebrate these festivals which create a sense of responsibility towards everyone.
We take holidays on Sundays, but the old generation of labourers, Kolishnava, all these days, take holidays on the new moons and full moons.
This darkness is not darkness due to lack of light, it is also darkness of darkness.
It is an effort to light the lamp of lights in the society to spread the light of positivity by lighting the lamp on the occasion of Deepawali, the darkest and darkest of the evils of the society.
Though the houses of the poor have a clay pot, they appear to be clean, shiny in the days of Diwali.
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is a cleanliness drive.
But the need of the hour is not only to clean the house but also to clean the entire area, to clean the streets and to clean the entire village.
In that context, we should extend this tradition of cleanliness.
This festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the boundaries of India.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different ways across the world.
Many governments and administrators around the world want to participate in the festival of Diwali.
You might be aware that the US Postal Service has released a postal stamp this year on Deepavali.
The Canadian Prime Minister also shared his photos of Diwali with Prime Minister on Twitter.
In London, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom hosted a banquet in his honour, in which he participated, on the occasion of Diwali.
There is not a single city in the UK that does not celebrate Diwali with great enthusiasm.
What is there in the photo that the Singapore PM has placed on Instagram, and has shared with the whole world with pride
As many as 16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament of India.
He told me that the Prime Minister of New ealand had just arrived here, that he would like to return to New ealand soon to attend the Diwali celebrations.
I would like to say that this festival of light of Deepawali is also a celebration of inspiration to the world community from darkness to light.
In the festival of Diwali, new clothes and various tasty cuisines are played with great interest.
Little children and young people like to laugh wildly .
Sometimes children dont get scared of excitement, they try to make a big noise together and sometimes invite a big crisis.
Many a times we do not know what are the things around us, whether there is a chance of fire burning.
It is a matter of concern that news of such accidents, fire incidents, maladies are reported during the Diwali.
On the day of Diwali, many doctors are busy celebrating Diwali with their families.
The festival of Diwali lasts for a long time in our country.
While celebrating Deepavali, we also prepare for Chhath Puja.
The festival of Chhathpuj in the eastern part of India is a big festival and it takes four days to celebrate the festival.
This festival conveys a very meaningful message to the society.
We get everything from what Suryadeva gives us and it is difficult to figure out what we get from the real and the absolute sun.
Chhath Puja is a celebration of the worship of Surya.
People in the world worship the rising sun.
But Chhathpuja is such a festival in which the festival of moonlight is also worshipped.
A big social message is also given through it.
In my spirit, the soldiers of the armed forces are always grateful for their sacrifice, penance and hard work. And in that spirit, I feel that this Diwali should be dedicated to these security forces.
I have invited the countrymen for this mission, the message to Soldiers.
Today, I would like to bow down to those who do not have a feeling of love, pride and respect for the soldiers of the country.
The way this spirit has been manifested, it has led to the realization of a rising power in every citizen.
Through your messages, our security forces have received a new courage and a new boost.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, poor people, traders, shopkeepers, political leaders, sports persons, actresses, everyone has expressed their feelings.
The media has described the ship as an opportunity to express gratitude to the Army.
Today, as we celebrate Diwali, at the same time, some jawans are standing in the desert, some are on the peaks of the Himalayas, some are protecting the industries and some are watching the security of the airport and these soldiers are fulfilling innumerable responsibilities.
I can imagine how proud it will be for the soldiers of my country.
Message to Soldiers The Hackathon is being conducted on 31st March, 2018.
Ashwini Kumar Chauhan has sent a poem and I want to read it and show it to me.
I am speaking at the Shivani Mohan.
The message to Soldiers on the occasion of Diwali is a big boost to our armed forces.
My father and sister both were officers in the army.
Our entire family is full of soldiers.
We have several officers in the Army Circle on the border of the country, who receive very good messages and they get a lot of encouragement.
I want to say this with my appeal that along with the army officers and jawans, their entire family and their wife too make a big sacrifice.
Through your messages, the entire army community is getting a very good message and I also wish you the very best on Diwali.
Be it natural calamities, problems in maintaining law and order, fighting the enemy or the courage to bring the youth back on the wrong path, our soldiers continue to be inspired and guided by the spirit of the nation at every step of their lives.
I want to tell you about one incident, I want to tell you about what can inspire you to achieve success.
Among the security forces, we have an ITBP jawan, Vikas Thakur, who resides in a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
The name of his village is Badaha.
We had visited our village on ITBP jawans leave.
That is why Himachal Pradesh was truly Open Defecation Free.
Very few people go to those villages.
Engineering students from the city, located at a distance from the village, were reminded that there was no toilet in this place.
The students of NCC, NSS and engineering students decided to build toilets in the village.
The youth took all the necessary things like toilet, brick, cement and other things on their shoulders and laid their feet for the entire day to that village.
They built a toilet in the village by their own hard work and they performed a small village in the remotest part of the forest free of open defecation.
That is why Kerala will soon become Open Defecation Free.
Gujarat has declared Sudha All Municipal Corporations-Mahanagari, almost 150 open defecation free.
10 districts have been made Open Defecation Free.
Haryana is celebrating its Golden Jubilee on 1st November and has decided to make our State Open Defecation Free within a few months.
So far, 7 districts have become Open Defecation Free.
Work is progressing at a rapid pace in all the states.
I have mentioned only a few states.
I congratulate the people of these states for their participation in this campaign and for their contribution in eradicating the darkness from the filth of the country.
My dear countrymen, there are many schemes of the government and after the first scheme, the first scheme has to be stopped after the second scheme is presented in line with that.
Generally, no one pays attention to these things.
The old scheme is going on, new schemes are going on, the schemes that are coming up are awaited and they continue to do so.
The households in which gas is used for cooking, the households that have electricity, do not need kerosene.
He has taken a major decision to free Haryana from kerosene.
I believe that the way they have taken up this work, Haryana will soon become kerosene-free.
Only the intermediaries and brokers will get affected.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always been a guiding light for all of us.
The need of the hour is to pay attention to the aspirations of the poor of the country.
In order to get out of the crisis, we have to take one step by one.
Despite our age-old thinking, the distinction between son and daughter should be eliminated in the society.
In schools, Sudha is now a separate kitchen for children and girls.
This is the opportunity to give our daughters the experience of a discriminatory India.
It is not right that after the 21st century is over, darkness should spread throughout the village.
The mission of providing electricity to those villages is being successfully implemented to make them free from darkness at the earliest.
Successful efforts are being made to make 5 crore such families smoke-free.
Small traders, traders, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, buyers and sellers, all of them were stuck in the vicious circle of money laundering.
Several people have been freed from this vicious circle of fraud through the schemes of MUDRA Yojana, stand-up scheme and Jan Dhan accounts.
Direct money is deposited in the banks through Aadhaar so that it directly reaches the intended beneficiaries.
This is an opportunity to free the lives of the common man from middlemen and middlemen.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the 31st of October, the birth anniversary of the great Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who dedicated his life for the unity of India.
You will be aware that Sardar Patels birth anniversary will be on 31st March.
Sardar Patel devoted his entire life to connecting the country and was successful in his mission, he brought everyone together.
At the same time, it was unfortunate that on the same day Indira Gandhi Ji was assassinated.
You all are well aware of the incident that happened in the country after his assassination.
Sir, I want to ask you what can be done to prevent such unfortunate incidents
My dear countrymen, this is not the pain of just one person.
History shows that Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had done a great job of uniting the country after Chanakya.
This injustice done to the Sardars on the birthday of that great man who had spent his life for unity is painful for all of us.
However, we should not take into account all these difficulties and we should not move forward by chanting the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of the country.
Whether it is language, caste, creed, language or food, all kinds of food, but unity in diversity is the strength of India, it is the specialty of India, it is the responsibility of every generation.
It is the responsibility of every government to explore and establish unity in every corner of the country.
It is important that we keep away from the evils and ideologies of the people and also save the country.
Sardar Saheb has given us an India, it is our responsibility to make it a Shreshtha Bharat.
It is the mantra of unity that lays the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
Sardar Saheb's life had started looking at the struggle of the farmers.
But Sardar Saheb took the initiative not only for struggle but also for constructive work.
I respectfully offer my tribute to Sardar Saheb and I appeal to all of you, on the occasion of Ekta Diwas on 31st October, to remember them and take a pledge of unity.
My dear countrymen, Karthik Poornima is the festival of lights in this Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev and his teachings are the guiding principles for the entire humanity, not just in India but for the entire humanity.
It was Guru Nanak Devs message of service, truthfulness and goodness.
His mantra was Peace, Unity and Harmony.
Every teachings of Guru Nanak Dev showed the way to free the society from discrimination, superstitions and vices.
When we had reached the peak of untouchability, caste system and such distortions, Guru Nanak Dev had chosen Bhai Lalo as his partner.
Come, let us move forward with the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, which inspires us to work against discrimination and illuminate our lives just like Sudha Ji Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
My dear countrymen, once again, my best wishes to all of you on this Diwali, which is dedicated to the soldiers of the country.
My best wishes to you all for your dreams, for fulfilling your resolutions and for leading a happy and happy life.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
We have lost 18 brave soldiers of our country in the recent terrorist attacks in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our army.
They will destroy every such obstacle and put in their best efforts so that the 125 crore people of the country can live with happiness.
But the army does not speak.
Today I want to talk to the people of Kashmir in a special way.
Now the people of Kashmir are well aware of the anti-national forces.
And as they have realized the truth, they have started moving on the path of peace by separating themselves from these ideas.
Every parent feels that schools and colleges are functioning at the earliest.
Farmers feel that the fruits and vegetables grown in the fields are going to the markets all over India.
Economic activity seems to be going on smoothly.
And in the last few days, these things have started to become easier.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we can find a solution to every problem sitting together, find a way out and pave the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
It is the responsibility of the government to protect the citizens of Kashmir.
The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I have got the opportunity to know a lot about the attack through social media.
There is an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of every kind of people in every part of India and this strengthens democracy.
A young man named Harshavardhan, who has studied in eleventh grade, has recently presented a different idea to me.
Then I resolved to study more than three hours a day.
He said that the country will be used as a citizen.
I am glad that you can think calmly and calmly at such a young age as you are living in an environment.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would also like to say that the inflation in the minds of the people of the country is a huge price.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
This shows the determination to do something.
Everyone felt that something was happening, everyone felt like doing something.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had tried to touch the feelings of the country in a very good way.
And Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan gave this mantra and inspired the common man of the country to work for the country.
Every citizen has another way of expressing patriotism through the movements of bombs and guns, which was shown by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
My dear countrymen, Mr.
Karthik has written on the Narendra Modi page that his Thali history of Para Olympics has been created, and the game he showed is the victory of human consciousness.
Shri Varun Viswanatha has written on the Narendra Modi page that our plate has done very good work , we should mention this in Mann Ki Baat .
Not only both of us, but every person in the country has also been associated with our players in the Olympics as an emotional one.
Moving ahead from sports, the Olympics and the performance of our players have completely changed the attitude of humanity towards Divyangs.
And I cant forget the words of our victorious sister Deepa Malik.
When she won a medal, she said that this medal has defeated the disability itself.
There is a lot of strength in this saying .
This time 19 athletes had participated in the Paralyspics Competition along with three women of our country .
In comparison to other sports, when differently abled people play games, it is even more important to have physical capacity and skills in sports.
You will be surprised to know that our players won four medals, two gold, one silver and one bronze.
Devendra Jhajaria, who won the Gold Medal, won the 2nd Gold in the Gold Medal.
He had to lose one hand because of the shock of electricity.
Just imagine, a person who wins the first gold medal at the age of 21 and when he wins the 25th gold, how much effort would he have made in his life
Marrypappan Thangavelu won the gold medal in the high flying category.
They dont live in big cities or in a middle class, they dont belong to a wealthy family.
At the age of twenty-one, she won medals for the country on the strength of her solemn pledge despite her physical difficulties.
Thilit Deepa Malik did a great job of blowing the Vijaydhvaj.
Varun C.
Bhati won a bronze medal in the high flying category.
Very few people would be aware that what kind of divyang people have achieved in the Paralysis competition this time.
Not only this, I was surprised when I came to know that the 4th best player in the tournament was not awarded medals but he finished the race in less time than the medal winners of the 4th edition of the tournament.
I congratulate all these players and in the coming days, India is moving forward in the direction of preparing an easy plan for the Olympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organized a Mahashibir for the Divyangjans and several world records were recorded at that time.
Gauri Shardul and her mother had come from the remote forest of Nang district and the entire Ramayana flowed in the form of a verse.
And when I heard the people gathered there, people were astonished.
I got the opportunity to release a book on the success stories of the lives of Divyangjans.
This experiment was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records .
It is a matter of pride for all our countrymen that three World Records have been created by Divyangjans in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago on October 2, on the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu, we launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
And on the same day, I had said that cleanliness should become a habit, every citizen should have this duty, an atmosphere of hatred towards filth should be created.
Now, on the 2nd of October, when two years are over, I can say with confidence that the awareness about cleanliness has increased in 1.25 billion Indians.
And I had said - One step towards cleanliness and today all of us can say that everyone has made an effort to move forward.
And that is why every citizen, be it a common citizen, a ruler, a government office or a road, a bus station or a railway station, a school or a college, a religious place or a hospital, a small child, a senior citizen, a rural poor, a farmer, every person is making some contribution towards cleanliness.
The media friends have also played a positive role.
I wish that we continue to move forward.
And that is why if we talk about rural India then nearly two crore three and a half crore toilets have been constructed till date.
A healthy competition has started in the states, districts and villages.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will be able to achieve their full potential in Open Defecation Free villages.
Congratulations to those who have worked on it and best wishes to those who are working on it.
And I appeal to the countrymen that we will have to free the country from this problem, for the honour of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children.
Let us move ahead with this resolution.
I would especially like to present a scheme for my young friends, who use technology in a big way.
By calling this number 1969, we will not only be able to know the condition of constructing toilets in our city but will also be able to apply for construction of toilets.
We should take full advantage of it, especially the younger generation should take advantage of it.
The Government of India has also called upon the corporate sector to come forward.
He urged the young professionals to come forward and work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the district as a representative of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
The fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the compost from the garbage.
The farmers who do organic farming have been asked to make available the fertilizer.
It has been said that those who want to improve the health of their soil, those who are concerned about the health of their soil, those who have suffered the loss due to the use of chemical fertilizers, should get the same fertilizers as required.
And Shriman Amitabh Bachchan Ji is making a special contribution in this work as a good ambassador.
I invite the youth to start a new start-up in the field of waste to wealth, develop equipment and technology.
This is definitely a work to do.
This year, India Sanitation Conference is being organized in a special program from 25th September to 3rd October.
Ministers from across the country, Chief Ministers, Mayors of Municipalities, Commissioners will meet and discuss with each other, the issue of cleanliness and sanitation only.
What could be the technology
What could be the economic policy
How can public participation be achieved
How can we create employment opportunities
All these topics will be discussed.
I can see that new news about cleanliness is constantly coming up.
Recently I read in a newspaper that the students of Gujarat Technology University went to 100-77 villages and started awareness campaign for the construction of toilets.
He himself worked hard and contributed to the construction of nearly 900 toilets.
Recently, you must have seen that a team led by Wing Commander Paramveer Singh travelled 2800 kilometers from Devprayag to Gangasagar and gave a message of cleanliness.
Different departments of the Government of India have prepared their guidelines.
Every department pays attention to cleanliness by deciding for fifteen days.
In the month of October, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the Panchayati Raj Department and the Rural Development Department will come together to formulate a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
In the last two weeks of the month of October, from 16th to 31st October, 2020, the Ministry of Agriculture Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries, and Ministry of Consumer Affairs will launch the Swachhata Campaign in their respective areas.
I appeal to the citizens that you too should join those departments where there is a regular relationship with them.
You must have seen that a survey on cleanliness is conducted.
Earlier, after conducting survey in 73 cities, the situation regarding cleanliness was highlighted to the people of the country.
Now this work will be done in nearly 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh.
Because the citizens of every city feel that we are lagging behind, now we have to do something good.
A competitive environment has been created for cleanliness.
I hope that all of you, the people of India will contribute in this endeavour.
On October 2, we mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali, I urge you to buy Khadi.
This time also I would like to say that there should be one thing in our family that can be used in the house of the poor so that the lamp is lighted in the house of the poor.
On Sunday, the 2nd of October, as a citizen, can you become a part of the Swachhata Abhiyan
Two hours, four hours, you take a live part in the work of cleaning and I will tell you to take a photo of it and share it with the Narendra Modi App.
Share video if there is a video.
See, your efforts will give a new strength and a new momentum to this campaign across the country.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, the joy of giving life is different, no one should record it or not.
And the response that he received can be called a very inspiring event in the national life of India.
Several youngsters, small and big institutions of our country, corporate people, students and voluntary organizations will come together to celebrate the joys of living in many cities of the country from 2nd October to 8th October.
It is their mission to bring together food and clothing to the needy.
It was a pleasure to see the players on the faces of those poor children.
I want to encourage the youth of those cities where this joy of living and selling is going to be celebrated. I want to help them.
My dear countrymen, today is the 25th of September, the birth anniversary of Deen Dayal Upadhyay and today the beginning of his birth centenary year.
He gave an explanation to the political ideology that millions of workers like me have been working with.
The Prime Minister spoke of Indias roots in politics, and the idea that it supported Indias cultural tradition.
The birth centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji, who gave us the philosophy of Integral Humanity, is beginning today.
It is their contribution to the principles of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Vishwas.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the interests of every grassroots person.
How can the fruits of development reach the poorest of the poor
He presented the entire economic framework in two words - work on every hand and water to every farm.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Vijayadashami, two years ago, I started Mann Ki Baat.
On completion of two years, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the listeners for the way you have praised this initiative, and have blessed me.
I also express my gratitude to All India Radio because they not only broadcast Mann Ki Baat but also worked hard to make it accessible to the audience from all regional languages.
I would also like to thank the listeners of Mann Ki Baat who have written letters to the government and have shown fault in the government's work, who have given a platform to the government officials to solve the problems of the people.
So this episode of Mann Ki Baat is not only about 15-20 minutes but also an opportunity for social change.
There can be a greater happiness for anyone.
How can we celebrate the festival that connects human beings
And that power will become the medium of true power and then all of us together will celebrate the festival of victory.
May this power be meditative, may we move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'
To take the nation to new heights, let us celebrate Navratri and Durga Puja with peace, unity and harmony.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of the text of PMs Mann ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 28.03.2017 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
My dear countrymen, on the 29th of August, is the birth anniversary of Hoki's enchanter, Dhyan Chand.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day all over the country.
I pay tribute to Dhyan Chand Ji and also remember his contribution towards this cause.
He played an important role in winning Indias hockey gold at the Olympic Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
All of you are familiar with the name of 'Bradman' by cricket lovers.
My dear countrymen, as the time of Mann Ki Baat approaches, so many suggestions begin to come up on MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
Apart from cricket, there is so much awareness and awareness about other sports in India as well.
It became a source of inspiration for me to convey this message.
Sachin says, In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, you must talk about Indus, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar.
The medals that you received were won by the girls.
Our daughters have proved that we are no less than anybody.
One of these daughters is from North India, one from South India, one from East India and another from India.
Therefore, it seems as if these daughters of the entire country have taken the responsibility of bringing glory to India.
MyGov writes that we have been able to do better in Olympics.
He said, Congratulations to H.E. Modi on winning two medals in Rio first.
But I want to take care of it. Was your performance really good
And the answer is no.
We need to scale new heights in the field of sports.
Our parents continue to focus on studies.
The society also believes that sports is a disaster of time.
We cannot ignore the fact that we have not been able to achieve it as per our expectations.
In some cases, it has happened that those players who were doing good work in India, they could not show what they were doing in the game here and they won only two medals in the medal tally.
One more thing is true that if you do not receive medals or watch them closely, you will find that for the first time, Indian players have done a lot of good work in sports.
Just now, in Nambaji, our AbhinavBindraji was in the fourth place, and he was a medal with a very small difference.
The same thing happened in Tennessee, in the case of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopona.
After Usha ji, for the first time in 32 years, LalitaBabar became eligible for the final round of the track field.
You will be glad to see that after 36 years, the women's hockey team has reached the Olympics.
For the first time in the last 36 years, the hockey team of men has been able to reach out to the walk out.
Our team is strong and a part of the gumt is that Argentina who won gold medals, who won the same medal in the entire competition, who defeated them
The performance of some players was good, for example, Aditya Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das.
My dear countrymen, we have a lot to do, but if we continue to do so, we will be disappointed.
I have announced a committee.
This committee of the Government of India will study in depth the aspects of sports and the study of what is being done in the world will be done by the committee.
The Committee will prepare a roadmap on what we can do.
We have to make plans with a vision of 2020, 2024, 2028.
I also urge the State Governments to set up such committees and to discuss the power of their power in sports, the power of their power, the power of their power to select one or two sports persons.
We will make full preparations and I am confident that we, a country of 65 per cent of the youth population of 1.25 billion Indians, will together achieve the best in the field of sports.
We have to move forward with this resolution.
Fellow citizens: 5th September is Teacher's Day
For some years, on Teachers' Day, I have been with the students and I was spending time with them as a student.
I was learning a lot from these students as well.
For me, 5th September was Teacher's Day and Education Day.
Therefore, there is a need to express my feelings in this regard.
The place of Mother's place in life is also the place of teachers.
I have also seen such teachers who are more concerned about our human beings than themselves.
He lives for his disciples, students.
At present, after the Rio Olympics, Pulela Gopichand's discussions are all around.
He is a sports person, but he is an example of how an excellent teacher is.
Teachers have always contributed in the lives of all of us.
On 5th September, we mark the birth anniversary of former President of India, Shri Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and the entire nation as Teachers Day.
Even if he reached any place in his life, he tried to live the role of a teacher himself.
And my own words are very bad in such a beautiful letter.
Who could have seen the good signature of those people that I feel respecting them.
If you have a photo with your teachers on the Narendra Modi App, if you have a good memory, if you have a motivational story, then share it with you.
Remember, the contribution of teachers in the eyes of students will be valuable to us.
Brothers and sisters, Ganeshotsav will also be celebrated in a few days.
Ganesh Ji is an embodiment of the wisdom that our country, our society, our family, each and every person, must have an uninterrupted life.
When we think of Ganesh Utsav, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak.
Lokmanya Tilak's tradition of public celebration of Ganesh Utsav is to be promoted.
The program should be designed so that the society gets new inspiration, new energy and self-reliance is my birthright and I will achieve that.
Today, Ganesh Utsav has been organized not only in Maharashtra but also in every corner of the country.
Discussions are held on public issues, essay competitions, rangoli competitions are organized.
It touches the social aspect through the pure art of art.
Lokmanya Tilak ji has given us the mantra of 'Swaraj is my birthright'.
Now we have the right to Surajya, we should move towards Surajya. Can we not spread the message of the mantra of 'Surajya' on the basis of 'public celebration of Ganesh'
I invite you.
It is true that festivals are the strength of the society.
The festival brings a new consciousness in the individual and the society.
Life is impossible without a festival but it is expected to change as per the demand of the times.
This time I have come to know that some people have written a lot about Ganeshotsav, Durga Puja and are also concerned about the environment.
Statues made of POPs are not environment friendly.
This pain is intensely shared by others as well.
I pray to all of you, that as in the ancient times, the statue of Lord Ganesha and Durga ji should be used and that we should not follow our old traditions.
Protecting the environment, protecting our rivers, protecting the small creatures from pollution is in a way a service to God.
I do not know with what kind of emotions you will take these issues, but I am not saying this alone, but this is the opinion of many.
Some people believed that the sculptor of Pune, Abhijit Dhondfal, the founder of Kolhapur- Institute of Nature, Vigyan Prabodhini.
Ganeshotsav is also a social service.
There is a lot of time for binoculars.
My best wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred the Saints title on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had dedicated her entire life to the service of the poor of India.
It is natural for all Indians to feel proud when Mother Teresa receives her Saints Degree, who served the poor in India throughout her life.
The ceremony will be held on 4th September, 2018 and will be attended by a delegation of officials led by the Government of India, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, on behalf of 1.25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, then there was a big change.
Manpower is the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments, has successfully tried to bring the people together for cleaning the Ganga and the Ganga.
On the 20th of this month, the village heads were invited to Allahabad on the banks of Ganga.
I congratulate all the chiefs who have come to Allahabad for this resolution - from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and from Jharkhand and West Bengal.
I congratulate all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have fulfilled this idea.
I also congratulate the Chief Ministers of all the five states that they have taken a certain step towards the cleanliness of the Ganga by bringing together the manpower.
Someone wrote from English or Hindi and someone wrote from Chhattisgarh that there should be a toilet in our house.
He demanded the construction of a toilet.
Some kids have written that even if my birthday is not celebrated this year, they will walk, but make toilets compulsory.
The children in the age group of seven to seventeen years did this work.
This had such an impact and had an emotional impact that the parents wrote letters to the teachers to pass the school the next day and promised to build a toilet in the house by the end of one day.
Many congratulations to those who have given this idea, those who have tried to do it and my parents are very much appreciated that they have taken a decision to construct a toilet in their minds.
The daughter of a 16-year-old girl from this district called the Satyagraha against her family.
See the specialty of this village head Mohammed Shafi:
He deposited 18,000 rupees and built a toilet within a week.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of every Indian.
This is the resolve of some Indians.
Some Indians have set their goals.
However, everyone has not been associated with it, everyone has been making some or the other contribution.
Every day news reaches out - what are the efforts
The Government of India has given a thought and urged people to make a film on cleanliness for 2-3 minutes and send the short film to the Government of India.
I would like to tell the TV channels that you too should compete in this kind of competition.
Innovations can also strengthen the Swachhata Abhiyan.
I invite you and my countrymen, India has always wanted to have cordial relations with its neighbors.
However, it is not a channel of ordinary radio, it is an important step.
Our neighbour is Bangladesh.
We are aware that Bangladesh and West Bengal are connected by a single cultural tradition today.
He will interact with each other and exchange ideas and be happy with the AIR from both sides.
All India Radio has played a major role in making people-to-people contacts.
The President inaugurated the channel.
Thank Bangladesh for working with us for this program.
I also congratulate all the friends of All India Radio for their contribution in foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, even though you have entrusted me with the post of Prime Minister, in the end, I am a person like you.
Sometimes emotional events touch me a lot.
Such emotional events give a new strength, a new inspiration and inspire me to do something for the Indian people.
He has written to me a 84-year-old I-G retired teacher.
Even though I have been told not to mention my name, I want to mention his name.
In a letter, he said that when we asked to give up the gas subsidy, at the same time he gave up the grant and later I forgot it.
However, a few days ago, a person from amongst us came here and he gave me a letter, thanking me for living with you.
For me, this letter of the Prime Minister of India is no less than Padma Shri.
My dear countrymen, those who gave up their LPG subsidy, they tried to give a letter to them, some or the other person would give me a letter.
I am trying to give letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me, You are doing a great job Your mission to liberate the poor mothers from the smoke of stoves and I am a retired teacher.
I am sending a donation of fifty thousand rupees so that the poor mothers can be saved from the smoke of the stove.
You are aware of the fact that when a mother pays Rs 50,000 to the poor mothers for their gas connections, the question is not about Rs 50,000.
These are the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters, which strengthens the faith in the future of my country.
He did not write this letter to me as Prime Minister but he wrote a letter to me, Modi Bhaiya
There have been frequent floods in some parts of the country.
The state government, the central government, the local bodies, the social institutions - helped the citizens as much as possible.
In August 2016, all the political parties, including the opposition parties, had unanimously adopted the GST Bill.
This is an example of how big this work was done when all the parties came together and all the parties got together.
Similarly, all the political parties of the country have put together a voice in relation to what has happened in Kashmir.
Those people who try to bring these little children forward and create such kind of confusion, they will have to answer some or the other innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is vast and diverse.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen these things that strengthen unity and only then will the future of the country be bright.
I have full faith in the power of 1.25 billion people.
This morning I got the opportunity to spend some time with the youth of Delhi. And I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports in the entire country will paint every young person with enthusiasm and hope.
We all know that in a few days, the Mahakumbh of sports is going to take place all over the world.
ROY is going to be repeated in our ears.
There will be a lot of expectations from you, but the 1.25 billion people of the country have worked to instill confidence in those players who have gone to play in Rio.
In the coming days, wherever we are, we should do something or the other to encourage our players.
The players who reach the Olympics reach there only after hard work.
This is a kind of hard work.
It is more important to win and lose but to reach the game at the same time it is more important, and therefore, I convey my best wishes to all the players who have come to the Rio Olympics.
Today, I am talking about this Rio Olympics, a poem lover- a student of Punjab Central University, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, has sent a poem.
Many of you are poets who have written poems, may write poems, some people will perform those poems, in every language, but they share the poems that Suraj has sent me with you.
Ankit, on his death anniversary as former President of India, Shri Abdul Kalam Ji.
The whole country and the world paid tribute to him, but when Abdul Kalam ji's name comes, then the words of science, technology and missile come to the fore and the image of a future capable India comes in front of the door. And that is why your government is working to realize the dream of Abdul Kalam Ji.
You are right, Ankitji.
And if we want to go with it or want to move ahead then we should do research, research and innovation and both these are the lives of technology.
If research is not an innovation, then just like the water that produces foul smell, technology also becomes a burden.
If we continue to work on the strength of old technology without innovation, then in this world, in the changing era, the government has taken some steps to attract science to the new generation, to create research and innovation for technology and therefore I would like to say Let us aim for innovation.
And when I say Let us think to innovate, then I mean AIM.
The schools in which such tinkering labs will be established will be given Rs 10 lakh and Rs 10 lakh will be given to them for up to five years.
On the other hand, India is facing many problems.
You face problems and difficulties in daily life.
Now we have to find a technology-based solution.
We have called upon the younger generation of the country through the Atal Grand Challenges that if you find problems and problems, then find them through technology, innovate, innovate and take them to us.
I am glad that the Government of India has given you a special award for the technology that has been used in solving the problems and difficulties. And I am happy that we got to know that people are interested in it when we told about Tinkering Labs.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, we were also worried about drought and if we enjoy the rains, we are getting news of floods.
The state government and the central government are working shoulder to shoulder with the flood victims.
Everyone feels happy and happy despite the rains, as the focus of our entire economic recovery is rain and the farming is on it.
Sometimes such diseases happen that we have to repent after birth .
But if we remain alert and cautious, if we are constantly striving, then the ways to escape from it will become easier.
We watch the advertisement on V, but we are sometimes a bit sad about the work.
The government, the hospitals, the doctors will do our work but I request you too, to be vigilant, in order to avoid any water-borne diseases, in your home, in your area and in your family.
My dear countrymen, we want to draw our attention to another crisis.
Today, life has become very fast, and as a result of this, we do not have time to think about ourselves.
If we fall sick, it seems that we are recovering as soon as possible and antibiotics are taken for that.
We should not walk shortcuts.
Completion of course of those pills.
Even if it is left incomplete the bacteria will be benefitted , even if it is more than required then also the bacteria will be benefitted , as a result the course for taking pills has been started in the same day .
It is necessary to complete the course, however, it is necessary to complete the course.
In a doctoral language, it is called an antibiotic resistance, how to use antibiotics, how to follow their rules.
There has been a sudden decline in the mortality rate of the mother in the past decade, but even today, a large number of pregnant mothers are not able to save lives.
Less blood during pregnancy , infection during childbirth , high blood pressure etc .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign called Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Under this campaign, on the 9th of every month, pregnant women will be given free screening at Government Health Centres.
In order to save the lives of both mother and child, I have urged the gynecologists to ensure that on the 9th of this month you are not able to offer free services to the poor mothers.
My doctor brothers and sisters, cant they provide 12 days in a year to the poor
There are thousands of such doctors, they asked me, they gave me the same letters that they had taken forward the work by accepting the invitation.
There are thousands of such doctors who believe in me.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is concerned about climate change, global warming and the environment.
This is being discussed in a collective manner in the country and the world.
There is no plant that has no medicinal properties, says the Nishti Mula Aushadhi.
The one who donates the tree , the tree protects him from falling into the heaven like a child .
But in today's generation there are some people who follow these ideals and practice them.
It is said in the Anushashan Parva of Mahabharat that trees also fulfill the responsibility of the child in the world and as if Sonal had taken the responsibility of fulfilling not only the wishes of her parents but also of the entire society.
Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junnar Taluk, Pune, Maharashtra, married her grandson Sonal in a different inspiring manner.
Temples should start a tradition of planting saplings in the rainy season.
Plantation can easily become a mass movement.
I keep telling the farmers that if we damage the soil because of the dam being tied on the edges of our fields then can we cultivate timber instead of timber
Today, in order to build a house in India, we have to import timber worth crores of rupees from abroad.
If we plant such a tree on our farm which will be useful for the work of timber, it will be able to cut and sell it with the permission of the government after 15-20 years, it will provide a new source of income for us and you can save India from importing timber.
In the last few days, several campaigns have been initiated using the weather patterns in several states. The Government of India has recently passed a CAMPA Act, with a fund of more than 40 thousand crore rupees going to the states for tree plantation.
I am told that the Government of Maharashtra has planted 2.25 crore trees across the state on July 1 and pledged to plant 3 crore trees next year.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan has organized a large forest festival of Maru-Bhumi and has pledged to plant 25 lakh trees.
25 lakh trees in Rajasthan are not small .
Those who know the land of Rajasthan will be able to know how big this task has been accomplished.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase green cover to 50 by 2029.
The Green India Mission, which has been launched by the Government of India, has also started the Green India pledge.
Gujarat has a glorious tradition of the Siddha Forest Festival.
This year, in Gujarat, several projects such as Amravan, Ekta Van, Shaheed Van, have been launched under the Van Mahotsav and have started the campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cant mention all the states, but everyone deserves praise.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa.
When we go abroad, we talk about international policy trade, we talk about security, we talk about some agreements.
But for me, the journey to South Africa was like a pilgrimage in a way.
South Africa says it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness are heard in the world, then the faces of Gandhi and Mandla appear before us.
During my visit to South Africa, the Phoenix Settlement was known as Sarvodaya, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
His visit will always be remembered in my memory.
Equality and equality of opportunity is not such a great mantra for any society and government.
The two ways of equality and equanimity lead us to a better future.
We all hope for a better life, we want a better future for children, the needs of everyone are different, the advances are different, but the road is the same and it is about development, equality, equal opportunity, equality and opportunity.
Come, let us take pride in those Indians who have displayed this essence of life in South Africa in their lives.
He told me about one incident - the Prime Minister, I am speaking at a sculpture gallery from Bengaluru.
A few days ago, I had read a letter in the newspaper that a woman lost 11 lakh rupees due to fake e-mail and committed suicide.
As a woman I was very sad about it .
I want to know your views on this.
Everyone knows that when we get to know about the things that are going to happen on our mobile phones, we get to know that you have received such a huge amount of money and you have to carry the money.
If some people fall in love, some are caught in greed.
These technologies are spreading the trappings of the world.
Sometimes we fall in love.
I believe that we should be cautious of this evil and be alert and if such false news comes, then we should tell them to our friends.
My dear countrymen, during the ongoing session of Parliament, I got the opportunity to meet many people.
Your Parliamentarians bring people from their respective departments, meet them, tell them about their issues, tell them about their problems.
But I had a pleasant experience these days.
Some students from Aligarh also came to me.
The enthusiasm of the children was such that they had brought a big album along with themselves.
Artistic paintings have been painted and painted at the station.
You must visit Aligarh and see this station.
This is an example of how peoples participation can bring about change.
Congratulations to all those who have worked like this in the country and my friends from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, there is a season of festivals in our country along with the rainy season.
Festivals are organized in fairs, temples and shrines.
You too must be associated with festivals at home and abroad.
Raksha Bandhan is a special celebration of our ties.
Can we not present Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana as a gift to our mothers and sisters of our country this year on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan last year
Just imagine, give your sister such a gift that will ensure her life's true security.
Moreover, be it a woman who cooks food in your home, or a woman who cleans your house, or a daughter of a poor mother, you can offer them a 'Suraksha Bima Yojana' or 'Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana' on the occasion of this festival.
My dear countrymen, there are many of you who were born after independence and I am the first Prime Minister of this country, who was born in independent India.
The 75th anniversary of uit India and the 70th anniversary of India's independence can give us a new inspiration, a new enthusiasm, a new hope. This can be an opportunity for the resolution of doing something for the country.
The festival of independence is not a government event, it should be a celebration of the countrymen.
It should be our festival like Diwali.
I hope that you too will be able to work with the inspiration of patriotism.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, I got the opportunity to interact with the people of the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
There must be a few things in your mind, your wish should be presented in a grand manner from the Red Fort.
You might be wondering that as your representative, as your Prime Servant, if you ask me this thing from the Red Fort then you must write to me, give me some suggestions and give me a new thought.
Let us remember the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters and remember the great men who had laid down their lives for India and let us move forward with our resolve to do something for the country.
Once again I got the opportunity to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
For me Mann Ki Baat is not a ritual.
I am eager to talk to you on my own.
And I am happy that through Mann Ki Baat, I can reach out to the common man of India.
I thank All India Radio for their successful efforts to telecast Mann Ki Baat' regional language at 8.00 pm.
And I am glad that those people who listen to my Mann Ki Baat programme, post the programme, carry their feelings to me through the phone as well as through the MyGov website and through the Narendra Modi App.
The issues suggested by you people help me to run the government.
How proactive should governance be for the welfare of the people
How much priority should be given to welfare of the people
For this, my interaction with you is very important.
World Environment Day is celebrated on 5th June.
There is a lot of concern about the environment around the world.
The theme of World Environment Day 2019 is ero Tolerance for Illicit Wild Life Trade. We should not only talk about flora and fauna but also talk about water.
The reason for this is that you must have seen that in the forests of the Himalayan regions of Uttarakhand, Himachal and Jammu Kashmir, they had recently suffered heavy rains.
Therefore, it is the duty of all of us to save forests and save water.
He interacted with the Chief Ministers of each State for about two-and-a-half hours.
They listened to what they wanted to say.
Some states, especially Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, have made extensive use of technology.
We have to take these successful steps of State Governments through NITI Aayog to other States in the country as well.
In order to overcome such problems, public participation becomes the main reason for success.
Therefore, water conservation is equally important.
And that is why drop more crop per drop - more production, micro irrigation and less water.
In many states, sugarcane farmers are now using drip irrigation, micro irrigation and some people are using drip irrigation.
I have also come to know from them that there are major targets before many states, particularly Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat, in terms of concrete irrigation.
It is their endeavor that every year two or three lakh hectares of land would be brought under micro irrigation.
If this campaign is implemented in all the states, it will not only benefit agriculture but it will also increase the storage of water.
Our Bandhuni Mission Bhagirathi project in Telangana has tried to optimally utilize the waters of Godavari and Krishna Rivers.
Efforts are being made to revive the ground water in Andhra Pradesh with the help of technology through the Nirru PRAGATI Mission.
In the peoples movement that has been launched in Maharashtra, people are not only providing labour but also providing financial assistance.
I am sure the Jal Jeevan Mission will really help in saving Maharashtra from the water crisis of the future.
The state of Chhattisgarh has taken up a peoples rule-water state campaign.
A massive campaign has been launched to revive the wells of Rajasthan and Gujarat in the form of a water temple where the old canals are available.
However, there is water shortage in some parts of that state.
A big work is being done by constructing small dams and check-ups there.
This is really a pleasant experience.
But there is plenty of water , so we are careless and if there is no water in the rain then how will it work .
And the subject of water is not limited to farmers alone.
This is related to the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban, the rural, the rich and the poor.
Therefore, water should be our priority when it rains, and when we celebrate Diwali this year, how much water did we save during the rainy season
You will see, your happiness will increase manifold.
And this is not just the work of the government, not of the political leaders but of the common man.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a modern India.
Our India has to be transparent.
The way India has been moving from one end to the other end in a similar manner.
To do this, we have to change our old habits.
Today, I want to touch upon a subject in which we can successfully move in that direction if we help me.
But the time has changed.
The entire world is moving towards cashless system.
Through electronic technology, we can earn money and send money.
There is no fear of stealing your pocket also, there is no concern about keeping it in mind.
It will be automatically registered.
The practice of this method will seem difficult in the beginning, but once the habit is over, this system will become easier.
This is possible because in the last few days, bank accounts of almost all the families of the country have been opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
On the other hand, Aadhaar numbers were also found and mobile phones are now in the hands of almost every Indian in India.
That is why Jan Dhan, Aadhar Mobile and Jam (JJB).
By integrating them, we can move towards cashless arrangements, cashless society.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been issued to the Jan Dhan accounts.
In the coming days, they will be useful for both credit and debit.
And in a way, a small machine has also been made available to it.
O.
With the help of this machine, you can donate money to others using Aadhaar number and RuPay card.
One of the initiatives taken by the Government of India is how to raise money through POS.
We have taken another initiative in the form of a bank on mobile.
It will be very easy to exchange money through your mobile phone.
In a way, this is the step taken by the banks in this direction.
Movements are going on in the post offices to provide banking services.
If we learn to practice this method in practice, we will not lose the need for direct transactions, we will not lose the need for cash withdrawal.
Transactions will continue on their own and will bring transparency.
Unbearable transactions, two-digit transactions will stop.
The impact of time spent will also be reduced.
Therefore, I appeal to the countrymen to start this thing.
You see, once this system has been started, we will move forward in a smooth manner.
Who could have felt 20 years ago whether such a mobile would be in our hands
Slowly getting used to it is not possible to stay without it .
It is possible that the cashless system will be gradually scaled up.
But if this happens in a short span of time then it will be better.
We should encourage our players who are participating in the Rio Olympics, and their confidence should increase.
He was the Chief Ministerial candidate.
But he was also the Minister of the Government of India.
Whether they get nutritive food according to requirement or not .
Whether the trainers should be there for their physical fitness
I am happy to see that even in such an environment, my colleagues are so aware of your work as Sports Minister, be it the results of the elections or the possibilities of giving new responsibilities as Chief Minister.
When the 1.25 billion people of our country feel that this belief is with us then it gives us a lot of strength and gives them confidence.
Last time I had discovered the subject of FIFA Under-Satellite World Cup.
I received suggestions from all over the country and at this time I can see that an atmosphere of football is being created all over the country.
Many people have been taking initiatives and creating their own teams.
I have received many suggestions on the Narendra Modi App.
It is possible that many of them would not be playing games, but the interest in sports in the minds of thousands of youngsters in the country was a pleasant experience for me.
You are familiar with the relationship between cricket and India, but I have seen that there is so much interest in football.
Everything should not be measured by the scale of victory and defeat.
India should make its mark in the world with the spirit of sportsmanship.
I also urge the countrymen to do something to create an atmosphere of enthusiasm for our friends associated with sports.
In the last 8-10 days, new results are coming from somewhere or the other.
I am not talking about the election results. I talk about those students who have studied in a routine manner throughout the year.
Now it has become clear that the results of 10th-Baravi are beginning to come together and our daughter is performing valour.
It is a matter of happiness.
We have to move forward with confidence.
But I have come up with a new kind of problem at a fast pace and I had never thought about it before.
I was very impressed by reading this.
He used to say that when I went home after getting 89.33 marks, I had felt that there would be a lot of appreciation on all sides, but I had to say that if I had got four marks in the house then it would have been 90.
But I feel like there is a shock in my mind.
Excellency, I have read your letter through Barakai. I believe that this pain can be not only for you alone but also for millions and millions of students like you.
Because the environment is such that the one that has got the opportunity to find faults instead of enjoying the pleasure.
This is another form of negative attitude.
I would like to appeal to the people of the neighborhood, to the parents that their children should accept and welcome the results.
Otherwise, there will be a day when you will get 100 marks, and yet someone will say that you have got 100 marks, but if you have been dumb, it would have been better.
Therefore, everything has to be limited.
Santosh Giri Goswami of Jodhpur has also written a similar letter.
They say that their closest friends are not ready to accept their conclusions.
They say that something better had been done and something better had been done.
I would like to tell you that in such a situation, you do not lose yourself.
Everyone expresses hope, listen.
Stay firm on your resolve and try to do something better.
But if we dont take satisfaction from what has been achieved then we will never be able to build a new material.
And that is why I would urge you to sing of the success that has been achieved.
Those who do not get good marks in the field of sports, they move forward in the field of music, they move forward in the field of art, they move forward in the business of business.
God has given some or the other skills to everyone.
Buses, you will recognize your inner strength, focus on them and you will progress in life.
There was a time when Santoor Vad was an integral part of the folk music of the Kashmir valley.
But Pandit Shivkumar, who made his contribution to this instrument, became an important voice in the world of music today.
Sanai - Indian music has a limited space.
During the period of King-Maharaj, there was a place of sun at the entrance gate of the court.
But Ustad Bismillah Khan took this musical instrument and placed it at the height of one of the best musical instruments in the world.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I feel that the expenditure on medicines in the poor families of our country is going to bring down the financial burden of that family.
And it is true that the cost of not falling sick is very low, but after falling sick it becomes like that of a good health then it costs a lot.
Why dont we have our lifestyle so that we dont go out of the disease, we dont have to face the financial burden on families.
One is, maintaining cleanliness is the most important way to stay away from the disease.
The biggest service to the poor is cleanliness.
And the second thing that I constantly urge is Yoga.
Some people call it Yoga.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga.
The entire world is attracted towards Yoga, faith and acceptance by the world.
This is the invaluable gift that our ancestors have given to the world.
Yoga gives strength to a stressful world to live a balanced life.
For those associated with Yoga, it is easy to stay healthy, be balanced, make a strong will power in mind, and concentrate in every work.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just a programme.
And sometimes the collective environment can bring about a change in the lives of the person.
I hope that on 21st June, we will do something about it.
The culture of the entire office changes and the environment also changes.
Can we make use of 21st June for Yoga in our lives
Can we do yoga for our social life ?
I request you not to be left behind.
Being healthy is very important for India to be healthy.
My dear countrymen, I am constantly connecting with you through Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, I had given you a mobile number by giving a missed call and you could hear Mann Ki Baat.
But now it has been made easier.
By giving a missed call to this number, whenever we want to hear Mann Ki Baat, we will be able to hear it.
Hello.
During holidays we decide to do many things.
The program takes place and during these holidays, as a mango leaves, it seems that if you want to enjoy the mangoes then you will feel that if you want to make some snacks in the afternoon then it will get better.
But this time due to the severe heat, this joy has taken a toll on all the four sides.
It is natural that there is an environment of care throughout the country.
And when there is continuous drought in them, the water bodies freeze.
Sometimes, due to encroachment, sometimes due to narrowing of roads, disruption of water supply due to disruption, the reservoir is reduced from the capacity.
And this thing has been going on for years so that the water storage capacity is reduced.
However, I have seen that the citizens too are making great efforts for this.
Many villages are aware about it and the real value of water is known only to those who have faced the crisis of high intensity.
And there is a sensitivity towards saving water in such a place, and there is an ability to do something about it.
A few days ago, I was told that in the district of Ahmednagar in Maharashtra, the village panchayat and its villagers have handled the subject of water in a very sensitive manner.
He decided that those crops, which require more water, those crops like sugarcane, should not be harvested.
It seems very easy to hear, but it is not as easy as possible.
How big a pledge must have been made by all of you
He took the lead in irrigation, drip irrigation, water conservation and water harvesting and today this village is standing on its own to overcome the shortage of water.
I am telling you about this small village of Hivrebazar, but there are many such villages, I appreciate and convey my best wishes to all such villagers for their outstanding work.
He built nearly twenty-seven fields.
As a result, ground water level has increased and water level has increased.
He said that when crops need water, they get water and they get big data.
There has been an increase of 20 per cent in their income from agriculture.
Not only did the water save, but the quality of water was improved due to the increase in the level of water.
However, many such initiatives are taken by the citizens who never come to the fore.
If you look around you, you will notice how people try to find ways to deal with this problem through innovative ways to deal with drought.
It is the human nature that despite all the difficulties, if a good thing is understood then the feeling that all the difficulties have been solved.
During the monsoon this year, the possibility of rainfall from 106 to 110 was revealed everywhere and the message of peace was conveyed to everyone.
It is still time for rains, but good rainfall brings the message of alertness.
Can we take up a campaign to save water in a village
Farmers need soil and it is useful for crops in the field.
If we take away the soil from the village then it will not only benefit the farmers but it will also increase the storage capacity of the ground water.
There will be water in our wells.
Today, there is a crisis of water, the situation of drought, but the month of next month and a month is in our hands.
Their concern is natural because this work has been going on for the past 30 years.
Several governments have come forward and several schemes have been formulated. It cost a lot of money.
The Ganges gives us livelihood and gives us a new strength to live by the Ganges.
The way Ganga flows, it gives a new impetus to the economic activities of the country.
A Bhagirathi brought us to the Ganges, but to save it, there is a need for crores of devotees today.
This campaign will never succeed without peoples participation.
Several efforts are being made at the government level.
Efforts are being made to get support from the states which are located in the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to involve social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have been taken to keep the Ganga flow, to keep the Ganga surface clean and to prevent industrial pollution in the water of the Ganges.
Everyday solid waste from drains and drains flows into the river.
In order to clean the garbage, the work of cleaning the garbage from Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna is being done with the help of a trash skimmer.
It has been made available to all local administration agencies and urged them to use it to clean the garbage.
Recently, I was told that wherever these efforts are being made, 3 tonnes to 11 tonnes of garbage is collected every day.
That is, it is true that such a large amount of dirt has stopped spreading.
In the coming days, there are plans to set up trash skimmers in some more places and people living in the slums of Ganga and Yamuna will soon experience it.
In order to curb industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with paper industry, liquor manufacturing factories and sugar mills.
I still feel that it will have good results.
The discharge of effluents from paper factories is now almost on the verge of closure.
This is the sign that we are moving in the right direction and in a way awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that if someone from the far flung southern part of the country meets me, then he would definitely say - Sir, the Ganga will not be clean.
This belief of the common man will help in the mission of cleaning the Ganga.
Citizens are donating to clean the Ganga.
This work is going on in a better way.
My dear countrymen, today is the 24th of April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
On this date, the Panchayati Raj system in our country started.
And gradually the Panchayati Raj system spread across the country is working successfully today as an important element of our democratic governance system.
On 14th April, on the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar, I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit the place of his birthplace, Mhow.
I got the opportunity to bow down to that holy land and today on the 24th of this month, I will celebrate the Panchayati Raj Day in the state of Jharkhand, where the maximum number of our tribal brothers and sisters reside.
And at 3 in the afternoon, I interacted with all the Panchayati Raj Institutions across the country.
This campaign has done a great job of creating awareness.
How can a democratic institution be empowered in every corner of India at the village level
How will the village become self-reliant
In some villages, distribution of food was also done.
The awareness that has come from the villages is the essence of India-Udai.
Gram Uday is the basis of India-Udai.
Therefore, if we focus on Gram Uday then we will not be able to achieve the desired results.
Sharmila Gharpure from Mumbai phoned and expressed her concern.
I am speaking from Mumbai in Shirmila Gharpur.
I have a question about school and college education.
There is a need for reforms in the education sector over the years.
Not having the right school or college or having the quality of education .
Even after completing their education, they dont know many basic things, so that their children are left behind in the world.
What are your thoughts about this
Today, every family has the greatest dream of a father-in-law i.e.
The parents should be concerned about how to educate the children, how to provide good education. And I believe that the families in whom this awareness is felt, the results are on the school.
Every government in our country has emphasized upon the issue of education and every government has tried its best in its own way.
But now the more important the expansion is, the more is the improvement in our education system.
You have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
uality education from literacy campaign should now be our priority.
Today, we have to pay attention to the number of schemes that have been measured.
Priority has been seen in how many children had come to school today.
Now we have to focus on ensuring that the children who have come to school get good education and proper education.
You must have seen in the budget of this government that efforts have been made to provide good education.
You will see that in this budget, 10 government universities and 10 private universities will be freed from government control and placed at challenging and competitive levels.
Would you like to work towards becoming the best university
The scheme has been launched with the objective of giving them complete freedom.
Along with this education is as important .
People have been asking me about one issue for the last several days.
The web portal writes on MyGov that some people write on my Narendra Modi App, and the majority of the youth write on it.
Honble Prime Minister Namaskar, I am speaking from Bijnor to Mona Karnawal.
For the youth of today, there is a lot of importance in sports as well as in education.
They should have a sense of unionism, good leadership, which will also lead to their all-round development.
I want to encourage as many youth as possible and the government should also encourage NCC, NSS and Bharat Scouts and Guides. You should send me so many suggestions.
One day I came to my mind to speak to all of you before I spoke to you.
And when I asked him that such a meeting had been held earlier, his answer was that this is the first such meeting since independence for the country.
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all the young people, young friends who have urged me to do all these things.
A lot of work is being done at your level, but if our organizations work collectively, in an organized manner, then what a big impact could be there.
Now it is true that I was a NCC by myself and was a cadets of National Cadet Corps.
I got the benefit of it in my childhood and I also believe that there should be a new consciousness in such organizations.
At this meeting, I raised some issues before them.
We talked to him about a lot of things.
We have many young organizations working in our country, what kind of innovations can be brought in their work, in their programs
If we write this on my Narendra Modi App then I will take it to the right place and I believe that after this meeting all these things will get a boost.
I believe that this will happen to us as well as to involve ourselves with all these things.
My dear countrymen, I want to tell you one thing that you will be compelled to think.
I believe this is a matter of awakening for all.
You must have seen that the political situation in our country was such that what party would provide gas cylinders during the last several elections.
And every political party felt that if it was to reach the middle class through elections then gas cylinders would be an important thing.
This is a universal experience.
But we never thought of going out of this framework.
Today, my countrymen, I am happy to share my thoughts with you.
I chose a different path and that path was to trust the people.
Sometimes we should trust our people more than the political leaders themselves.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
In our country, the grant was rejected when it was the right equation.
I would particularly like to appeal to all political parties today that at least one thing we should do to believe in people everywhere.
We will get the result that you would never have thought about it.
We have to move in this direction.
And I always feel that as I came to my mind, why should I take an interview for a third and fourth grade job
Believe in those who have passed the exam and have secured the marks.
Sometimes I feel that we can announce that there will not be any ticket checker on this single railway line.
It comes to my mind that this is not a government rule but it can create an atmosphere of trust.
And there are no political leaders who create this atmosphere. One crore families of the country have created this thing.
Every breaking news, in every newspaper and news channel, is painful.
Is there not a good thing happening around us in this country of 1.25 billion people
Please change the situation.
Ravi ji has expressed his deepest condolences, but I believe that this anger is not against me but against the situation around the world.
You might remember that our former President, Dr.
I have seen that some TV channels spend a lot of time with positive news.
Today an atmosphere of positive news is being created.
Everyone feels like good news and good news.
It is true that a big person, a good thing, uses the best words, and speaks in a better way, the better it is, the better it is, the better it is, the better it is, the better it is, the better it is.
It is true that if we emphasize on goodness then there will not be enough space for evil.
If the lamp is lit then darkness will be removed and it will happen.
And that is why you might be wondering that the government has started a website called Transforming India.
It is not just the government, but it is also the welfare of the citizens.
And this is the portal on which you can send some good news, some good news.
You can make a contribution.
Ravi ji, you have given me a good suggestion but please do not stay with me.
The Kumbh Congregation is a unique feature of our country.
Kumbha fair can be a center of attraction for tourists .
Very few people in the world knew that for such a long time, crores of people came to the river bank.
In the peaceful environment and peaceful environment there is a celebration of peace .
Such events are setting new benchmarks for peoples participation in programme management.
For the last two days, I have seen that many people are uploading the pictures of Kumbh.
I believe that the tourism department of the Government of India should compete with the tourism department of the state and should appeal to the people to upload the best photographs.
People returning from there will carry the message of cleanliness.
I believe that Kumbh is a religious, spiritual fair but we can transform it into a social event.
I am glad that as always, our thoughts have connected with things in my mind. Once again many-many thanks.
I and you are always waiting for Mann Ki Baat.
During this time, I have seen a lot of letters, comments phone calls, there are many suggestions, motivations - everybody can do something or the other. There is a feeling and there is a lot of things that I want to include but due to the time limit, I cant include everyone.
However, I would like to share your thoughts with you once again by engaging in this episode of Mann Ki Baat.
You might remember that last time I had discussed some of the things written by Premchand ji and we had decided to share some of the books that we would read through the Narendra Modi App.
Some people have advised me that I should talk about some more books.
But I must accept one thing that I cannot give time to read books on a large scale.
But there is one benefit that I get the opportunity to know about the subjects related to several books on the subjects that you write and write.
But I believe that the experience of the last one month that we have to take this initiative forward.
And when we read a new book, write it there, discuss it, and you can suggest a good name for the book.
And I can feel that these days the minds of Indians have been shaken in the matter of water.
Several effective efforts are being made for water conservation across the country.
People have shared information about traditional practices.
Many innovative campaigns on water conservation have been started by the media.
Be it the government or the NGOs, we are doing something or the other on a war footing.
The villagers have worked hard to give a definite direction to a waterfall flowing through the mountains.
And that's pure Swadeshi.
This has not only stopped the damage of soil and crops but also provided water to the fields.
All of you will be happy to know that Meghalaya is the first state in the country to formulate a water policy which is beautiful in the North East.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, the crops of those crops which are getting less water are being promoted and farmers are not harmed at all.
Many fairs are held on the occasion of festivals .
Why not use these fairs for water conservation
In the fairs, people from all strata of the society gather.
In these fairs, we can effectively convey the message of saving water, organise exhibitions, and play street plays. With festivals, we can convey the message of water conservation in a very simple manner.
In fact, this month, World Children Weavers Games were held in Moscow.
This is a unique sport in which the young people who have been suffering from cancer are the ones who have come out of their lives to fight cancer.
In this competition, competitions such as NAMaji, Intelligent, Mobility, Running, Football and Table Tennis were organized.
All the 10 winners from our country won medals in this competition.
Some of them have won more than one medal in the tournament.
Sanjiv Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.K. from Telangana.
Arvind Rao, many from different parts of the country have written to me on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and have urged to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, 2019 has been a landmark year for India in terms of space progress.
Our scientists had launched the ASAT in March and thereafter Chandrayaan-2.
However, there was not much discussion on major and important events like ASAT during the elections.
With the help of the ASAT missile, we have the capacity to launch a 300-km long satellite in just three minutes.
India has become the fourth country in the world to succeed and now on 22nd July, the entire country has taken steps from Chandrayaan-2 to Sriharikota in space.
The photographs of Chandrayaan 2 enthused the countrymen with pride and zeal.
Chandrayaan-2 is special in several ways.
Chandrayaan-2 will further clarify our perspective on the moon.
But if you ask me what two big things I can learn from Chandrayaan-2, then I will say that these two things are Faith Fearlessness.
We should believe in our talent and capability, we should trust our talent and capability.
We will be glad to hear that Chandrayaan 2 is fully Indian.
He is an Indian in both heart and spirit.
The entire indigenous system is a mission.
When it comes to new areas and innovative zeal, our scientists are the best and are at the best in the world, this mission has proved once again.
The second key element is that there is no need to panic.
The manner in which our scientists, in record time and in the night, resolved all the technical issues and left Chandrayaan-2 in the space, is unprecedented.
The entire world has seen this great penance of scientists.
It should be a matter of pride for all of you. Many people are very surprised to know that even after a lot of difficulties, the time for Chandrayaan could not change.
Always keep in mind that you have to face temporary difficulties in life but you have the power to overcome them.
I am confident that Chandrayaan-2 will inspire our youth towards science and innovation.
In the end, science is the path to development.
Now we wait for the September month of the Moon, when Lander Vikram Rover Pragyan will land on the surface of the Moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I invite the students of the country, the young friends and the youth of the country to know about a very interesting competition - a quiz competition.
I urge my young friends, students, to participate in this quiz competition and make our participation more entertaining and unforgettable.
I especially urge schools, parents, enthusiastic chiefs and teachers that they should strive hard to conquer our schools.
The most exciting thing is that the government of India will take the students who have the highest marks in every state to Sriharikota, with the cost of their own expenditure, and in September when Chandrayaan will land on the surface of the moon, it will get an opportunity to witness the moment.
This will be a historic event for these winning students. For this, you will have to participate in the quiz competition, you will have to win the maximum marks.
My dear countrymen, you must have done an inspection.
Our Mann Ki Baat has provided momentum to the Swachhata Abhiyan from time to time and these practices have also inspired Mann Ki Baat towards cleanliness.
The journey that began five years ago today, with the participation of many, is setting new standards of cleanliness.
It is not at all the root in terms of sanitation that we have achieved, but the success that has been achieved in terms of cleanliness from Open Defecation Free villages to public places is the strength of the resolve of 1.3 billion Indians, but we will not stop here.
This mission is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching the story of Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has left his job in the United States and returned to India to serve Mother India.
He had taken upon himself some time ago to make Delhi not only clean but also beautiful.
He started with his team from the garbage dumps in Lodhi Garden.
With the help of street art, many parts of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
When he started showing his art from the walls of the overbridge and the school to the slums, people also got involved and in a way the sewing process started.
You might remember that during the Kumbh Mela, Prayagraj was decorated with paintings on the roads.
I understood that Yogi Ji and his team also played a major role in that.
The sound of colors and fibers will not be heard, but the message of the rainbow that is produced from them is more effective than thousand words and we also feel it in the beauty of the cleanliness campaign.
It is essential for us to develop a culture of waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making gold from garbage.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting comment on MyGov.
This was the reaction of brother Mohammad Aslam who lived in Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
He wrote, It is good to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to say that I played an active role in organizing the Bank to Village of Community Mobilization Programme in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
At the same time, there should be provision for online monitoring of the program.
I believe that this was the first such programme in which people interacted directly with the government.
Bhai Mohammad Aslam ji sent me this message and after reading it I got eager to know about the Bank to Village programme. And when I got a detailed information about this, I felt that the entire country should know about it.
This programme also tells us how eager the people of Kashmir are to connect with the mainstream of development.
Several issues related to literacy, sex ratio, health, sanitation, water conservation, electricity, water, micro education, senior citizens issues were discussed.
Friends, This program was not just a formality of the government, the officials returned to the villages all day, but this time the officers spent two days in the Panchayats and they got the opportunity to stay in the villages.
Under the 'Khelo India', sports events were organized for the children.
It also distributed sports literature, job cards of MNREGA and certificates to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The people of Kashmir have openly participated in this festival of development.
It is a matter of great happiness that in order to reach where the government officials had to go through difficult terrains and climb mountains, sometimes for one day and sometimes for one and a half days.
These officers also went to the border panchayats where there was constant fear of firing from across the border and officers also went fearlessly in the extremely sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts.
Some officers were so impressed by the reception in the village that they had stayed in the village for more than two days.
A large number of people participated in the Gram Sabhas in these areas and planned for themselves. It is a matter of great happiness.
It is also clear that people are looking at the path of development, they are constantly watching the path of development and they can never succeed in their evil designs.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatraya Ramchandra Bandra, who has been honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented the glory of Shravan month in one of his poems.
In the poem, he said, Hodige Madige is the marriage of Agadh, the marriage of Adarag Bhoomi, i.e., rains and streams of water are untouched and the earth is mesmerized by their beauty.
In the whole of India, the people of different cultures and dialects celebrate the month of Shravan in their own way.
When we look around in this month, it seems as if the earth has adorned its green shawls.
A new energy is generated everywhere .
In this holy month, many devotees visit Kavad and Amarnath Yatra, while some fast on a regular basis and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami.
It is during this period that the festival of Raksha Bandhan, the symbol of the love of sister-in-law, is also celebrated.
If we talk about Shravan month, we will be glad to know that this time more devotees have been participating in the Amarnath Yatra than in the last four years.
Since July 1, more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
In 2015, more than 60 days of this journey, more than the number of devotees who had participated in it, in just 28 days, have participated.
I especially appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey, they fill the emotions of love and affection of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I am told that in Uttarakhand too, since the start of Chardham Yatra this year, in a month and a half, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham.
For the first time after the disaster of 2013, such a record number of pilgrims reached there.
I appeal to all of you that you must visit those areas where natural beauty is not visible during monsoons.
There is no greater teacher for tourism or pilgrimage to see the beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country.
I wish you all a very beautiful and enjoyable month with Shravan, a new energy, a new hope and a new hope.
Similarly, the month of August reminds us of the uit India Movement.
I would like to make some special preparations for the 15th of August and find a new way to celebrate this festival of independence.
When we watch TV, we see only one aspect of the rains - floods, rain water, traffic jams, monsoons and other pictures. Our farmers who have enjoyed it, the fountains, the waterfalls of greenery, we have to come out with our families to see the same.
Rains, freshness and happiness bring both freshness and happiness with us.
My dear countrymen, where to start Mann Ki Baat, where to stay, it is a difficult task, but time is limited.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on Easter.
My young friends, you are busy in the exams.
Today, you are often awaiting the agreement between India and Australia.
India has won the battle against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
It is time to bring about a new revolution in the field of sports.
And you can see that an atmosphere like cricket is being created in India for football, hockey, tennis and kabaddi.
You may be aware that India would be hosting the FIFA U-17 World Football competition in 2017.
24 teams from all over the world are coming to India to play in India.
And at the same time, on the other hand, I have seen that the youth is getting increasingly attracted towards football, be it EPL or Spanish League or be it the face of Indian Superlig.
Young friends take time to watch the television in order to know about the similarity.
How will there be a competition between government, educational institutions and social organizations to connect themselves with sports
We see that all this has happened in terms of cricket.
But we have to create the same environment in other sports as well.
This is a golden opportunity to recognize India.
My dear students, you must have decided about touring during these holidays.
And I realized that the work that we did not gather in our tourism department, our cultural department was not able to do it, the state governments were not able to do it and crores of tourists of the country did it.
India is full of diversity.
Probably there is not a single district in India where I have not visited.
I specially congratulate Coal India.
And I am happy that nearly 10,000 people have visited Sawaner coal mines near Nagpur as tourists.
Some efforts are being made by both tourists and tourists.
All efforts, however, are not scientific at all.
Can we also take special care of this as well
I am sure my young friends will definitely help me in this task.
A lot of employment generation is possible through tourism sector.
India is far behind in terms of tourism as compared to the world .
But if 1.25 billion Indians decide to focus on tourism then we can attract the world to India.
A large part of the worlds tourism sector can attract our country and create employment opportunities for crores of youth of our country.
Be it governance, institution, society or citizens, all of us have to work together to do this.
Come, let us make efforts in this direction.
My young friends, I do not think it is right that such things have come to an end.
If you can't swim, you can learn to swim in these suits.
If you are not able to ride a bicycle then you can learn to ride a bicycle in these suits.
Even today while typing at computer , I do with two fingers , why should I not learn to do shaving ?
There are many skills for our personality development.
You will see that after the start of the school after the holidays, after the start of the college, you will go back to the college and tell your friend that I have studied this holiday.
My time has passed, but you have learnt a new lesson.
Friends, this will be mutually beneficial.
This time in Mann Ki Baat, many suggestions have been received on MyGov.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi, Namaskar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji.
During the summer holidays, we had told that even the chimneys suffer from heat, so fill the water in a pot on their balcony or terrace for chimneys.
I did the same and I am glad to tell you that this has made me an alliance with the symbols.
He made a phone call and reminded me of a clever act.
The last time I was in my mind and I had said that for the birds during the summer, pour water in the earthen pots outside their premises.
The actress told me that she did it throughout the year and she became friendly with many symbols.
The great poetess of Hindi literature, Mahadevi Verma, had a lot of love for the birds.
He had written in his poems, I would not let you go away, I would fill the courtyard with charity, I would give you a lot of salt and sweet water.
Let us also do the same thing as Mahadev ji had said.
I congratulate and thank you for taking into account a very important issue.
Have you ever given water to them during summers ?
Artisans, I thank you very much and you have given a sensitive subject in a very easy way.
However, this is a habit in India.
But I thank you for watching this craft from Barkai.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, You must have heard a lot about Digital India and Digital India.
Some people believe that Digital India is the world of the youth of the city.
But this is not the case.
You will be happy to know that a Kisan Suvidha App has been developed for your service.
If we download the Kisan Suvidha App in our mobile phones, it will help us to know more about agriculture and climate change.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I hope that the Kisan Suvidha App will be downloaded on their mobile phones.
My farmer brothers and sisters, For others, summer is a holiday but summer is the time of sweating for the farmers.
It waits for rain.
The pre-harvest period of agriculture is very important for the farmers.
But our countrymen should also think about what will happen to us through water.
If there is a pool, a drain, a drain of water, a drain or a tank, if there is some garbage or some encroachment, then the flow of water is stopped and as a result, the water supply goes down gradually.
First of all, if we save water in the rainy season, if we fill the ponds, if we fill the drains then it will not rain, we will lose less.
You must have seen this time that we have decided to produce 5 lakh farmers.
Emphasis has been placed on creating water resources for water harvesting through MGNREGS.
There are so many villages across the country, many progressive farmers, many alert citizens who have done this work.
However, there is a need to do more work today.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I will tell you one more thing today that the Government of India had recently organized a grand exhibition on agriculture.
I have seen how modern technology has come into the field.
However, it is still going to reach the field.
Now the farmers are also engaged in reducing the use of fertilizers.
This mantra should be followed by our agricultural sector using scientific methods.
I hope that you will accomplish your tasks of water conservation within a month or two of your tasks.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
Victory to Diabetes is the announcement of World Health Day this year.
It is said that in 2014, the number of diabetes patients in India was about 6.5 crore.
3 of deaths have been reported as a result of diabetes.
The entire world is worried about diabetes and hence on the occasion of World Health Day on 7th April, the theme of diabetes has been set.
We all know that our lifestyle is the main cause of type-2 diabetes.
If you love yoga then do yogasanas.
Otherwise do at least exercise to walk , run .
If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my India will also be healthy.
We are sometimes hesitant to conduct a health check.
And when the situation worsens, it seems that diabetes has already poured into our body.
This means that it is such a disease, which can be quickly tested.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is being done in this regard.
I appeal to you, that we should eradicate TB completely.
And that is why I urge all my countrymen to get rid of TB in order to overcome diabetes.
Babasaheb Ambedkar on his birth anniversary on April 14th.
His 25th anniversary was celebrated all over the country.
A Panchtirth - his birth place in Mhow.
London - where he studied in higher studies, Nagpur - where he took initiation.
I am fortunate to visit Mhow on the birth place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to become a good citizen.
By following the path shown by him, we can pay a great tribute to him by becoming a good citizen.
In the last few days, records will start and new records will come into existence.
It is celebrated in different states in different ways.
You can hear on your mobile phone.
Just give us a missed call.
Do a missed call, do it according to your convenience.
If you want to hear the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, you can hear it and hear it in your language.
I am glad to be with you through this medium.
My dear countrymen, many congratulations to all of you.
How can we increase the interest of sports in India's youth through this World Cup
Let us also participate in this event.
They sent pictures of some such places, they uploaded photos, they were really delighted to see them.
If you want to see something, look at it first, look at it first.
They should have a desire to reach the place where no one has gone before.
Western Coal Fields Ltd., Sawaner site near Nagpur, has coal mines.
When people go to tourist places then they buy something or the other .
Even if he is poor, he will do something, if he is rich, he will spend more.
I put forth one issue before you for thinking.
Can we add a new art, a skill in our personality, to achieve something new
Why not increase your strength ?
Do you like to paint pictures or not ?
Hey, let's start with that.
Definitely use holidays for personality development, to learn new arts and to enhance skills.
There are countless sectors.
My dear brothers and sisters, The architect of Mysore has put forth a sensitive issue before all of us.
If one of your questions asks them, they answer them, explain them to you.
And if you use it once you see what is useful for you
And if something goes wrong then you should complain to me.
Let us save water in every village.
How can we save the water drop by drop in the coming monsoon
How will the water of the village remain in the village itself
I welcome this idea.
We have made our soil sick due to excessive use of fertilizers.
But if you use the best spices then will you like to eat food
The same food will not be liked by us.
But today we have been neglected about TB.
My dear countrymen, namaskar, you are listening to my Mann Ki Baat through radio.
You will be thinking of an exam now.
I also want to join you in your journey.
I feel the same as you care about the examinations of your children.
But if we change our approach of examination then we can become anxiety free.
In the background of my Mann Ki Baat programme, I had told you to send your experiences and suggestions to me on the Narendra Modi App.
I am glad that teachers, students who have achieved great success in life, have written a lot of things to me by writing to the interests of the society.
Today, I want to talk to parents, students and teachers in Mann Ki Baat, especially through Mann Ki Baat.
I will tell you a few things about what I have heard, what I have read and what I have been told. I will also tell you about what I feel.
But I am confident that my 25-30-minute conversation with the students who are going to appear for the exam will definitely be useful.
My dear students, before I speak to you, if I start the Mann Ki Baat programme today with a renowned Opener in the world, what will be useful for them while achieving success in life
Their experiences will definitely help you.
I know that examinations will start in a few days.
Some of you might be under stress.
I have only one message.
Your parents will keep an eye on you, your teachers will keep you, other members of your family and will also keep your friends.
Wherever you go, you will ask how your preparations are going on.
How many percent of the marks will you get ?
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
In the last 24 years, there have been many difficult moments and many times there have been good moments.
But the expectation of the people has always increased and the time has passed and the expectation has also increased.
And I need to find a solution for that.
At that time I thought that I would personally expect to set my own goals.
My focus used to be on the Chandu, and since then all the objectives have been accomplished.
Friends, What was Tendulkar talking about
Don't get over the burden of expectations.
I want to make your future a reality.
What should be your time to compete with others ?
You will see that no one can stop you from moving forward. And if you succeed more than the success you have achieved earlier, you will not need to depend on someone else for happiness and satisfaction.
You will experience self-respect.
Friends, Examination is not about merit and playing with numbers.
Where did we get it, how much did we earn
Don't get stuck in this shit.
From these examinations, one can understand whether our course is right or not.
And that is why if your dream is huge and if your dream is huge then it will automatically become a celebration of happiness.
And so what will happen this year
Do not limit yourself to this .
And if you succeed in that, you will not be disappointed, you will be inspired to make more efforts with more zeal and strength.
Thousands of people have written small issues on my app and their mobile phones.
In fact, throughout the year, 365 days should be compatible with our daily routine, our dreams and ideas.
Shri Prabhakar Reddy brought to the fore one point that he urged me to sleep on time and to wake up early in the morning and wake up early in the morning.
The test must reach the centre on time, says Shri Prabhakar Reddy.
I wouldn't have dared to say this because I was not very serious about sleeping.
Many of my friends complain that I do not sleep properly.
During the examination, I would like to tell you about your sleep to appear in a stress-free state.
You will not do this .
I am sure, I will not.
He said that discipline in life is the most important reason for success.
Not only this, the daily routine also gets worse.
Therefore, do not consider anything small or small.
Make a decision, do it.
Those who are under this stress, they have a negative impact on their results.
And on the basis of the study that I have done, those people who go to the question papers with such confidence, they solve the problems with determination.
Let us learn from them the way we can achieve success by overcoming this test.
Hello, I Viswanathan Anand.
Wishing you the very best for the exam, let me begin.
I will tell you my experience of how I went for my examination.
I realized that exams are the same as the problems you are facing in your absence.
You should rest properly, you should take a peaceful sleep at night you should eat throughout your stomach, you should not be hungry and the most important thing is that you keep quiet .
All this is like the left side of the intellect.
When you are playing, you dont know what kind of profession is going to emerge, you dont know what kind of problem is going to come in the class as well.
Therefore if you remain calm and have eaten the whole stomach , you have had a good sleep then you will know that your brain remembers the right answer at the right time .
That's why it's quiet.
Do not give yourself much stress , do not be too impatient .
This is important. Take this as a challenge - can I solve this question by what I have taught me in a year
In the last moment, remind me of the most important things that you do not remember. When you are passing the exam, you will probably remember a few moments with the teachers or the students, and this will help you a lot to remember about it.
If you raise questions that seem difficult, you will come to know that these are new questions for you and when you give your exams, you will be able to solve them better.
Have a good night's sleep, don't be too confident, but don't be disappointed.
I have always seen that you were afraid that these exams go better than they were.
And you must have seen how they sit with the international talent pool.
It is a fact that it is difficult to say such things but efforts should be made.
You dont talk to friends, you go alone, you live like a commed ball, you keep washing your books till the last moment, then your mind will not remain calm.
If the water is calm, even deep things can be seen but if the surface of the water is disintegrated then nothing below can be seen.
At that time one feels the pressure inside.
Then I feel that if you take a little rest then you will feel better.
For that, I have developed a technology myself.
I breathe deeply and breathe thrice and five times deeply.
It takes 30 seconds, 40 seconds or 50 seconds to do this, but after doing this, my mind calms down and my mind is ready to understand the subject.
It is also possible that my experience will be useful to you too.
Rajat Aggarwal, who has said a good thing.
Whatever I write on my page, at least half of it every day, we should spend time in happiness with our friends and families.
And what do you do
Friends, Do not do this.
If you ever visit a place with your parents then spend at least half an hour trying to get out of the memories of your studies and examinations.
We need to understand the issues said by Rajat ji.
Friends, What can I tell you about Shanti?
Today, before you go to the exam, such a person has sent a message to you that those who are original teachers and today they have become a culture teacher.
Ramcharit Manas is trying to connect this great book with the present and spread these values across the country and the world.
Pujya Murari Bapu gave a clip to the students.
Friends, Today I want to tell you one more thing.
G.
But one thing is certain whether it is a student or a student, it is as if Yoga is a guru in the journey of developing the inner self of life.
You must pay attention to it.
I have full faith in it.
My young friends, you have a lot of interest in going to the exam centre, you want to go to Patna and sit on your backs, don't you think
Otherwise stress arises in the mind .
If you listen to those suggestions, you will not have time to repent.
I have also seen that the format of the question paper has changed and it is found to be in the hands of the paper.
Shri Rao highlighted the issue of patience in his message.
Even in the least words, the beautiful message of Kamli has been sent by Rao Saheb - you should listen to me from Bangalore.
R.
Rao Ji.
I am fully aware that there is restlessness due to competitive examinations.
Do not worry .
Let me tell all my young friends to give you the best.
But at the same time, keep in mind that there are many other opportunities available in this country.
You should decide what to do in your life and dont leave it, you will succeed.
Do not forget that you are the leaders of the world. You also have the right to live here, just like trees and mountains.
You need it for determination, dedication and determination.
These qualities will make all of you successful in examinations and other efforts.
I wish you all the very best in whatever you want to do.
Many blessings.
In the past, how does a scientist have a method of talking about issues
It takes me half an hour to say the same thing in three minutes.
This is the power of science and this is the power of a scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
The Prime Minister spoke of Determination, Determination and Digitization.
Hey, guys standing up tight.
If you stand up with courage, then fear will also be scared.
And a golden future will wait for you to be empowered with you.
Ruchika Dabas has sent a message to me.
And it is true, Sachin ji also said that positive attitude, positive attitude towards the mind, positive energy, positive energy, and positive attitude towards the mind.
Sometimes, many such things that inspire you do not think that the inspiration is given only to the students.
At any moment of life, the best of our lives, the true event inspires us a lot, gives us a lot of strength, and a new path can be paved with this inspiration in times of crisis.
In the course of the course, we read about the father of a power lamp, Thomas Alva Edison.
But friends, did you ever think about how many years they had spent in this research, several times they had to face a lot of waste, time was spent, money was spent too
Though he did not have any special education in mathematics, he added value to a variety of disciplines such as mathematics, mathematics, mathematics, astronomy, etc.
K.
Rolling himself said that this power was very important for him.
In today's era, examinations are not only for students, but also for all families, schools and teachers.
He said that parents should not overload their expectations, he added.
And seeing this, we not only want to shine, but we also like to have a hand with it.
We also want to make progress at the pace of science.
This is the reason why today is National Science Day.
For this purpose, he became the standard of Nobel Prize.
And in this memory, we celebrate 28th February as National Science Day across the country.
Inquisitiveness is the mother of science.
Every generation has to pay attention to new inventions, to attract scientific ideas and science to every heart.
New research is not possible without the involvement of science and technology.
Today, on National Science Day, new research should be promoted across the country.
My dear Sir C.
Friends, Sometimes it takes a lot of time to achieve success and whenever we succeed, our approach to look at the world also changes.
You must have heard that in the last few days, science has come to a new height.
Scientists around the world have worked hard, generations have come and contributed.
This discovery strengthened the principles of Einstein, the great scientist of the last century, and a great discovery in the field of material science.
It is a matter of great benefit to all of us, the whole world.
As an Indian, we are particularly proud of the contribution of our countrys son, our countrys skilled scientists in all these research processes.
Our scientists will strive to take this new invention further.
India will be a part of international efforts.
And my countrymen, an important decision has been taken recently in this regard.
The Government has decided to set up a Liaison Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) in India to take forward the path-breaking research.
There are two such centres in the world and the third will be in India.
India's participation will give a new strength and a new momentum to this process.
With limited resources, India will actively participate in this great scientific discovery of human welfare.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you a number, take a note of it.
You will be able to hear Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow with a missed call on this number.
May I hear your mother tongue too.
81908 81908 I repeat 81908 81908.
Friends, as your exams start, I too will have to appear before the exam tomorrow.
1.25 billion Indians will take my exams.
Just, tomorrow I got the exam that the license will start.
And when all of us succeed then only the country will succeed.
At that time, many congratulations to you.
May success and failure get rid of their stress and move forward with a free mind.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said two things.
Recently we celebrated Christmas and now we are preparing for the New Year's reception.
India is diverse.
There is a stir of festivals .
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where the economy is based on festivals.
Whether it is terrorism or global warming, whether it is natural crisis or man-made, whether it is happiness for all mankind to be happy or in peace
I am aware that I am using technology a lot and I get a lot of information about the various topics.
I always look at the portal MyGov.
People visit different places to celebrate Christmas.
Special attention is given to the convenience of the tourists in the tourism sector, however, Savaiswarkar says that wherever there are tourist places, there are dharamshalas and there are religious places, special attention should be paid to cleanliness.
And as a guest Devo Bhava, we say that when guests come to your house then we clean the house and decorate it.
Therefore, we should pay special attention to maintaining cleanliness in our tourist places and religious places.
In Bhojpura village in Sihor district of Madhya Pradesh Dilip Singh Malaviya used to live as senior artisans at one age .
I read it and I wanted it to reach you.
Dilip Singh Malaviya, a resident of Chotaya village, decided that if someone made available the toilet material in the village, he would not take the construction work, he would make the toilet free of cost.
The construction of the toilet was considered a sacred task and Dilip Singh constructed 100 toilets in Bhojpura village.
I convey my heartfelt regards to Dilip Singh Malaviya.
This country is progressing rapidly due to the hard work of many people.
When every Indian gets to know that Yoga has attracted the attention of the entire world and when the whole world celebrates IDY and the entire world is connected then we believe that this is our India.
This belief, this feeling of belongingness, this feeling is there in our minds.
The subject of cleanliness is now being discussed in a way from house to house.
This will increase the peoples participation.
The biggest benefit of this is that those government employees who are engaged in the task of electrifying every village will be satisfied. They will be happy to note that the media has taken note of the work done by them to transform the lives of a village.
If the government does not do any work and the government does not do any work, then it is their right to get those things and they should not go away.
We have to make all efforts so that the right things, the good things, the useful things of the common man reach them and reach them.
Doing so is service in a way.
I have made a small effort on my behalf.
I cant do this alone, but when I tell you that I must not do anything.
We have to reach to 1.25 billion Indians.
How can I reach without your help
We should reach out to the common man in his language and motivate him for his rights.
My young friends, in a speech from the Red Fort on 15th August, I had made a primary discussion about the theme of Start-up India Stand-Up India.
After that, the work started in every department and every account of the government.
Can India be the world capital of start-ups
In a new way, with new innovations, start-ups will be a great opportunity for the youth of our states, be it in the manufacturing sector, in the services sector or in the agriculture sector.
In every case, new ideas, new experiments, new efforts need to be made and the world will not move forward.
Start-up India, Stand-up India scheme is a great opportunity for our youth.
My young friends, on the 16th of January, the Government of India will present a complete roadmap for the Startup India Stand-Up India scheme.
But it is not at all, we have to change it as per the needs of India.
It is expected that a poor person will be able to earn his livelihood, his or her labour will be lightened and his or her work will be reduced.
I urge the State Governments to take the lead in this regard.
On 16th January, I will speak in detail about this subject.
I will always welcome your suggestions.
Dear young friends, January 12 is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Just like me, crores of people of this country have taken inspiration from Swami Vivekananda.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as the National Youth Festival since 12 January 1995.
This year, the programme will be held at Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
I am told that the theme of this year is Indian Youth of Development, Skill and Hormones.
Accessible India Day, Accessible India Day was celebrated at his school, where he expressed his feelings over the telephone.
Whenever we come to meet those people who work in the society, there are many ideas in our minds.
Now it is true that every word has its own different significance.
I would be going to the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan programme launched by the Government of India this year. However, I could not attend the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan programme due to the presence of some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially the people of Chennai.
But I was thinking about going to that programme.
Therefore, I felt that in our country we should use the word 'Divyangjan' instead of 'Divyangjan'.
These are those people who have the power of divinity, the power of divinity, and who do not have the courage to do so.
I liked this word very much.
Should the citizens of my country now use the word 'Divyang' instead of 'Divyang'
I hope that we will take this idea forward.
We have started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan on that day.
The Prime Minister said that the Government is committed to provide all possible assistance to the Divyangjans in order to ensure their welfare, and to ensure their welfare, without compromising the preventive measures.
There should be ramps in schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, railway stations, accessible parking, accessible delivery and Braille.
He was fond of it.
Let us also participate in it in our own way.
My dear countrymen, government schemes keep coming and running, but this scheme needs to be done only by artificial intelligence.
It should reach the last man in a better way.
One should not take his breath inside the file .
A few days ago, the Government of India made an effort to deliver the benefits of the scheme to the common man, the poor and the needy.
A contribution is made to the cooking gas cylinders in our country.
This amount is worth crores of rupees but we did not have the system to ensure that it did not reach the beneficiaries in time.
The government made a slight change in it.
The worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer scheme was implemented with the help of Jan Dhan Bank accounts and Aadhaar cards, and the amount of the subsidy was deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
I am proud to say that the worlds largest and successful Direct Benefit Transfer scheme has got its place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
The scheme is known as Pahal.
Nearly 15 crore LPG consumers have become beneficiaries of the Pahal scheme by the end of November.
This subsidy is being directly deposited in the bank accounts of 15 crore people.
No middlemen, no recommendation or commission. There is no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, opening of Jan Dhan accounts on the other, and on the other hand, the State Governments and the Central Government together are preparing a list of beneficiaries, linking them with Aadhaar numbers and with Aadhaar numbers.
A few days ago MNREGA, which provides employment opportunities in the villages.
There were many complaints about it.
I am convinced that about 35 to 40 schemes are now being included under Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a golden moment for Indian Republic Day.
The centenary year of the birth of Baba Saheb Ambedkar is also celebrated.
On this occasion, a special discussion was held on the Constitution for two days and it was done in a very good manner.
All the parties had a very good discussion on the sanctity of the event, the importance of the event, the essence of the event. We should continue this initiative.
What can be done on the occasion of Republic Day to connect people with power and power with the people
There is a lot of discussion and discussion about the rights given by the Constitution.
It is our sacred duty to cast votes when elections are held round the clock, large panels on the walls are written.
Why is it not that our duties were discussed at the time of voting, why not in our daily lives
On the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 26th January, there is a need to organize essay competitions, poetry competitions and lectures competitions on subjects such as duties in schools, colleges, villages and societies of the city.
If 1.25 billion Indians take one step after another in a sense of duty then it will bring a great history.
I want to know your thoughts.
Send your writings to mygov.
I want to know what the young generation of my country thinks about their duties.
And I don't talk about it at the government level.
We raise the statue of great men with great dedication but later on we are indifferent to the maintenance of these great men.
On the other hand, preparations for bathing have also started.
Festivals have their own importance in the society.
Sometimes these festivals bring joy and grief, and sometimes bring a new light.
But sometimes during these festivals if a crisis strikes, then it is very painful.
Every nook and corner of the world is receiving news of natural disasters.
News of natural calamities that you have never heard or imagined before.
We are now experiencing the rapid pace with which the impact of climate change is taking place.
The way our country has received heavy rains and untimely rains during the last few days, the way Tamil Nadu has been damaged and the other states have also been affected.
Many people died.
My thoughts are with all those families in this hour of crisis.
The State Governments are working with full force to provide relief and rescue operations.
The central government is also working shoulder to shoulder.
At present, a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I am confident that despite the crisis that has fallen on Tamil Nadu, he will start moving ahead with confidence and will continue to play his role in the development of the country.
But when we look at the crisis around, we need to bring about a lot of changes.
15 years ago, natural disasters were part of the Agriculture Department as natural disasters were limited to droughts.
Today it is changing its form.
At every level, it is imperative to increase our capacity.
For this, the government, the society, the citizens and all the small and big institutions will have to work in the direction of science.
After the Nepal earthquake, I interacted with the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif, and suggested that we should jointly study and prepare for the disaster by the SAARC countries.
I am glad that the SAARC countries have organized a workshop on Best Practices in Delhi.
A good beginning has been made.
Lakhwinder Singh telephoned me today from Jalandhar, Punjab.
"I am speaking from Lakhwinder Singh in Punjab.
We are engaged in organic farming and many are being guided by this agriculture.
One of my questions is that those people who plant dung or wheat plants in their fields, they do not know how to guide them on the causes of death of micro-bacterium in the soil and how to get rid of pollution in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh I was very happy to hear your question.
And you are not only doing organic farming but you are also well aware of the problems faced by the farmers.
Your concern is wrong, but it is not happening only in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of the people of the whole of India. And in a traditional way, we burn the residues of crops.
But the pain that you have expressed is correct.
First of all, we should train our farmer brothers and sisters in this regard and explain to them the truth about this thing that if we burn the remaining crop residue then we will be able to save the time and labour for the next crop.
But this is not true.
We destroy them but if we make small pieces of these residues then it will be a dry fodder for the animals.
Secondly, after burning it, the upper layer of the soil gets burnt.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Just think about it for a while that our bones should be strong, our hearts should be strong, kidneys should be good, everything should be fine but if the skin of the body is burnt then what will happen
Even if the heart is healthy, we cannot survive.
The way in which it is difficult for us to stay alive on burning the skin of our body , in the same way not only does the skin of our feet burn but the skin of our earth burns as well .
Moreover, if the animals are used as fodder and their land is saved then it will be beneficial to lay the fertilizer on the same soil.
The water in those pegs is enough for that crop and today their pegs have also received the price.
They are now getting income from these pits as well.
The pits that used to be used for cleaning earlier have also become a source of income and the demand for that is increasing.
Dear Fellow Citizens, The next 3rd December is being celebrated across the world as International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
The 27th of November was celebrated as the Day of Organ Donation of India.
A number of prominent personalities including film actor Ravina Tandon also participated in the event.
Organ donation saves many precious lives.
In a way organ donation provides immortality .
When an organ goes into another body then that organ gets a new life but that person also gets a new life.
What could be a better donation than this
A National Register of Patients, Organ Donations and Organ Transplants has been launched on 27th November, 2019.
I am confident that there will be greater awareness in this area and help the needy in the truest sense as this aid will not be available until the organ donation is done.
As I said earlier, 3rd December is celebrated as Disability Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped people are also brave and capable.
This happens when these people are neglected.
Sometimes they are shown compassion.
But if we change our approach of looking at them then we will come to know that these people can inspire us to live.
They can inspire us to do something.
If there is a small crisis on us then we are crying.
Then you will realise that the crisis on me is very small.
How will they lead their lives
How do we do the work
And that is why all these are inspirations for us.
Their determination, their way of living and the power to overcome the crisis is immense.
Today I want to tell him that he is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, he was shot dead by terrorists in Kashmir.
A part of the stomach and intestines has also been lost .
He also suffered severe injuries.
He had always lost his strength to stand on his feet, but Shri Javed Ahmed did not give up.
How can we improve infrastructure for physically challenged people
How can we develop facilities for the disabled persons in public places and government offices
They are working on these things.
Is life of Shri Javedji not enough to inspire every corner of the country
I specially remember the work, penance and dedication of Javed Ahmad's life on 3rd December.
As time is short, I only refer to Javed but there are several other inspirations in every corner of the country.
They are giving new light and new ways of living.
The middle class, the lower middle class, the dalits, the oppressed, the deprived classes and the exploited section of the society continue to have a constant relation with the government and the government system. And a citizen of the society sometimes experiences the bad experiences of some or the other government employees and that bad experience changes his attitude towards the government system throughout his life.
There is a reality in this too, but lakhs of people in this government work in such a great way with the service and dedication that never happens in their eyes.
Last year, we had jointly awarded the Padma Vibhushan to Bill Gates and Milinda Gates.
They do a lot of social work in India.
They are working for the poor, they have done everything they have done after their retirement, and they have done everything they have done for the poor.
When he comes to India, he praises the ASHA workers who have got the opportunity to work with them and tells them about their dedication and hard work.
He tells us all about their enthusiasm to learn new things.
A few days ago, the Odisha government honored an ASHA worker on the occasion of Independence Day.
An ASHA worker from the village, Jamnu Mani Singh, decided that no one in the village would die due to Malaria.
They went to every house, found that there was a slight fever and then reached there.
There will be many more such gems.
There are millions of people around us.
We have received them with a little respect.
Such people become the strength of our country.
How do we become a major partner in the happiness and misery of the society
I would like to congratulate all such ASHA workers through 'Jamuna Mani'.
My dear young friends, especially for the younger generation, who are active on internet and social media.
Not only this, they should show it to others as well. And it can happen that we will feel like adding something to it.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
I invite you to join us in nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is concerned about climate change.
Climate change, global warming are also a matter of concern. And before doing everything, it has been accepted as a standard.
The temperature of the earth should not increase now .
It is the responsibility and responsibility of everyone.
And the first way to save the temperature is to save the energy.
14th December is the National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
I had once said that on the full moon night, we should switch off lights on the streets and light a lamp for hours on the moon.
One should experience the moon's light.
Seeing a woman named Noorjahan in Kanpur on TV, she felt that she had not got the opportunity to pursue her studies.
But it is doing the same thing that no one might have thought about.
It is making the lives of the poor live by using solar energy.
They are fighting against darkness and are trying to brighten their lives.
She has set up a women's committee and set up a solar powered factory and pays 100 rupees per month.
That is why how our entrepreneurs are being helped
Industry, earnings, empowerment.
However, the speed at which I want to go is still pending.
But the beginning has been good.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am glad that out of 66 lakh women, 24 lakh are women and there are SC, ST, OBC, and they are trying to run their families with dignity by standing on their own.
Abhishek himself has told us about his enthusiasm.
There is a lot of news coming to me too.
Just now someone has told me that someone is in Mumbai as Shailesh Bhosale.
During my cleanliness drive, I had said that the cleanliness campaign is such that it will create new entrepreneurs and Shailesh Bhosale did it.
And I was told that in such a short span of time, they have also given back Rs. 2 lakh to the bank.
We are working on making potatoes.
All our banks should be more sensitive and they should help the poor as much as possible.
It is the people who run the economy of the country.
The economic strength of the country's economy is the people who do small things.
We want to give more strength to it.
But we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had discussed 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'.
These are things that need to be constantly awakened in social life.
The Prime Minister said, "Skills are the awards for freedom, under the "Rashtriyam Jagrayam Vyyam".
How should we plan the program
I had told you about sending such suggestions.
I was told that a lot of suggestions were received.
But I want more suggestions.
I look forward to a very special scheme.
There can be many such things.
I believe that your suggestions will definitely be useful.
But I would urge you to exercise.
In order to keep the body fit and fine its use should be done for exercise .
Then if it is the season of monsoon, then we should also adopt the habit of shaving.
Once again my best wishes to my countrymen.
Once again I am meeting you through Mann Ki Baat.
The fifth-day cricket match between India and South Africa is being played.
The name of the Cricket Malik is Gandhi-Mandela Series.
Both the teams have won each with two matches, and therefore, the importance of the last match has definitely increased.
My best wishes to all my players.
Today I want to convey my best wishes to all the friends of AIR in Kannur.
I would like to convey my best wishes that when I started Mann Ki Baat, a lot of people visited me and the 12th students from Kerala also joined the program.
Once again I would like to talk about Kerala.
A letter has been sent to me by the students of St. Mary's Appraisal School, Kochi, Chittoor, Kerala.
In the beginning, I did not understand why these kids made me the map of India with the blood of thumb.
When I read his letter, I came to know about the great message that he had given.
So that organ donation becomes a tendency and tendency.
Those girls have written to me by writing to challenge people about organ donation in their Mann Ki Baat programme.
Vasantrao Sudke, a 80-year-old boy from Maharashtra, has consistently started a movement.
He said that organ donation should be a festival.
A lot of messages also come to me from the telephone.
Devesh from Delhi gave me a message.
I think this is very important.
In our country, more than 1.5 lakh people need kidney, heart and liver every year.
But in our country of 1.25 billion people there are only 5000 transplants .
Every year, one lakh taps are needed but only 25,000 people get eyes.
When there is a need for 4 windows then we can give only one stroke.
Efforts have been made to guide the states.
Some of the States have done a commendable job in reducing paper work and expediting the efforts of such organ donation.
Today I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the top in organ donation.
Many social organizations, many NGOs have given a different direction by doing good work.
The National Organisation for Tissue Transplanting an organ transplant has been set up to give importance to organ transplant.
That is, the joy of sacrifice is the best.
Last month, all of us had seen it on TV that it was from Delhi.
Saved a life.
Dear Fellow Citizens, Now we have celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
After a few days we will celebrate Diwali.
He celebrated Eid and celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi.
But we are going to celebrate another festival in all of these, and our countrymen will be proud of it, and this will make the country proud.
India-Africa Forum Summit will be held in New Delhi from 26th to 29th October 2018.
This is the first time that such a grand event will be organized in the country of India.
54 African countries and Union Leaders have been invited.
The more the population of India, the more the population of Africans.
If the population of both the countries comes together then it will be one third of the world 's population .
And it is said that lakhs of years ago the land of both the countries was united.
Later, the Indian Ocean divided this part into two parts.
And see, it is our endeavor that people should also come together and come together.
The HRD Minister has taken a big initiative of the Government of India on this occasion.
A essay competition was organized among the children of the schools which are affiliated to CBSE, and a program to write poems was organized to increase the participation of all of them.
About 1600 schools participated.
It included schools outside India and India and thousands of school children wrote about their desire to strengthen India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the exhibition on the Mobile Exhibition of Mahatma Gandhi from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is moving from Porbandar to Delhi on the 29th of October.
The exhibition was witnessed by lakhs of school children and people from villages as well.
How great was the role of Mahatma Gandhi in the relations between the countries of Africa and India, how much was the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality on these two lands, people knew it.
Although it is the Indo-African Summit but I can see that this is the opportunity to connect people.
I congratulate Garima, and the children participating in it, and more than 1600 schools and HRD Minister.
On 15th August, I had made a proposal regarding the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Last month, a workshop was organized in Bhopal where the chief of the Adarsh village, the collector of the village, some MPs of that place, the government of India and the state government together discussed in detail the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
How new things have come to mind, some encouraging things have come to mind.
He has selected Parsi Gram Panchayat in Kunti district, Jharkhand, for the Adarsh Gram Panchayat.
In the village of Parsi, Jharkhand, a successful effort was made to awaken the masses along with infrastructure and arrangements in Adarsh village.
I congratulate the respected MP, Shriman Kriya Munda ji.
I received a similar news from Andhra.
The MP from Andhra Pradesh, Ashok Gajapati Raju ji spent a lot on Adarsh Gram Yojana and selected Dwarupudi Gram Panchayat of Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh as Adarsh Gram Panchayat.
They taught and literated about 550 adult illiterates.
Look, there is no budget, no circular, no special arrangement in the society, but what kind of big change is being brought about by the willpower of the Gram Panchayat.
However, our respect is with Mr.
Shri L.Ruwala, Member of Parliament, Mizoram.
He has chosen Khalahilang village as an ideal village. He did a special job.
This village is famous for sugarcane cultivation and jaggery.
How can we make the village an economic hub, how to market the village's products
Ruwala ji who tried to make a self-reliant village along with Adarsh village, is a congratulatory letter.
My dear brothers and sisters, Mann Ki Baat is something and will it ever happen when there is no talk of cleanliness
I would like to remind you, my dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, the media had launched a special campaign.
The way we are concerned about preventing accidents before the festival, we should do it even after the festival.
And I specifically want to congratulate the media world of India for this thing.
On 2nd October, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I joined the India Today Group for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which has been celebrated for one year.
I was looking at the steps taken by him for Clean India Awards.
How are the people who are working in the direction of One Life, One Mission
How many places are there in our country that have been kept so clean
Since the launch of the Cleanliness Mission, I have seen the e-Nadu of Andhra Telangana and especially Shri Ramuji Rao that is very old at the age of 18 years, but their enthusiasm is inspiring for any young person, not less than the youth.
They have connected about 51 lakh children in about 55-56 schools in Andhra and Telangana.
Be it public places, stations, religious places or parks, we have launched a massive campaign for cleanliness at several places.
Now this news shows the power to realize the dream of a Swachh Bharat by itself.
ABP News launched the programme Bharat Desh Hai Mera and brought awareness about cleanliness among the people and trained the people.
NDTV has started a campaign called Swachh Bharat.
In Meghalaya, where our Governor Shri. Shanmukh Nathan, has written a letter to me, mentioning the village of Mavalayanong in Meghalaya.
He wrote that for the past few years, this village has taken up the task of cleanliness.
It is said that almost every generation is devoted to cleanliness. A few years ago, he was awarded the Cleanest Village of Asia.
It is important for us to believe that our country will be clean and it will be done by the efforts of the countrymen. When we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, 100 crore people will be able to say with pride and pride.
My dear countrymen, on the 15th of August, I had said this from the Red Fort - there are a few things where there is a corruption in Thane and a home.
And that is why I was thinking that what is the requirement of internet for small jobs.
I have never heard of this thing that there is such a psychology in this world which can be known to a person in a minute or two
And with this idea, I had announced that we will stop the practice of interviewing for this small job.
My dear young friends, I would like to take pride in the fact that the government has completed all these processes and now the posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government will not be interviewed during the recruitment process.
This rule will come into force from 1st January, 2016 and we will not interrupt the recruitment process where the recruitment process is in progress, but this method will come into effect from 1st January, 2016.
My best wishes to all my young friends
I had announced an important scheme in the last budget.
Gold has become an important part of social life in our country.
Gold can become a power, gold can become an economic power.
And every Indian must contribute to it.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the gold bank and the bank will give you interest on it, just as you deposit your money and get your interest.
Earlier, he used to keep gold in the locker and rent a locker was also required.
Now keep the gold in the bank and the bank will give you interest.
Now my countrymen, can't gold become wealth
The second thing is that this bond is a paper in the Sovereign Gold Bond, but the value of that paper is gold.
You will get the same amount of money as the price of gold that you will get on the day of your return.
I am happy to say that we are bringing the gold queen.
It took nearly 70 years since the independence of Ashok Chakra, but till today we have been using the Foreign Gold ueen.
The Gold Billion Bonds are also used abroad.
In the coming weeks, we will make it available to the common man before Dhanteras We will also start the gold coins of five grams and ten grams of Ashok Chakra.
Also, 20 grams of gold will be available for gold coins.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about a new change in the direction of economic development.
My dear countrymen, 31st October marks the birth anniversary of Iron Man, Vallabhbhai Patel.
Remembering Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the PM said that the map of India is clearly visible.
This great man has contributed greatly to the unity of India.
India is full of diversity.
India is full of so many sects, many sects, many dialects, so many surroundings, so many diversity and this diversity is our beauty.
Had it not been for diversity, we would not have been able to take pride in the beauty of this festival.
Therefore, it is the mantra of unity of diversity.
Peace, goodwill and unity are the true essence of development.
In the last few years, on 31st October, there are Run for Unity programmes in every corner of the country.
Run for Unity is also a true story of development.
Pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Let us carry forward the mantra of unity.
Dear sisters and brothers, You must have been preparing for Diwali and cleanliness at home.
You must be buying new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different forms in our country.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the auspicious festival of Diwali.
Because of cracks fire starts erupting , there is a lot of harm to children .
I would like to tell every parents that they enjoy Diwali but do not let the accident happen, the child of our family should not be harmed and you must think about it and clean it.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Diwali, I will be on a visit to the UK.
The Government of India and the State Governments provide scholarships to those belonging to these sections of society, to those belonging to tribal or backward communities, who go abroad for studies.
I believe that when our children will be taught in Britain, then Baba Saheb's place will become an inspiration. Baba Saheb's message to the country is that I am excited about my visit to Britain.
Now that building becomes the property of 1.25 billion Indians, you can imagine the happiness that people like me will be associated with the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
I will have another opportunity in London to unveil the statue of Lord Vishveshawar.
Several years ago, the world needs to study the work done by Lord Visvesvara for democracy and for the Empowerment of Women.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Visvesvara to the land of London is a perfect example of how the great men of India thought about it several years ago, with a vision.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
The discussions were held with the officials of the government.
Some people write down their problems and try to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we have to learn many languages.
I got the opportunity to learn some languages but how can I learn these languages
However, I am grateful to All India Radio for broadcasting this episode in their regional languages in every state at 8 pm.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind.
On the 3rd of October this year, I got the opportunity to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
People's power is of immense importance in democracy.
There is a fundamental thought in my life and therefore I have full faith in the power of the people.
But whatever I learnt through Mann Ki Baat, whatever I experienced, I can say that peoples power is far greater than what we feel.
Our ancestors used to say that Janardan is a part of God.
From the experiences of Mann Ki Baat, I can say that the thoughts of our ancestors have a great strength and a truth because I have experienced this thing.
I used to ask people for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I used to see only two or four suggestions.
But lakhs of people were active and sent suggestions.
This is a great strength.
When people were watching this, they also felt that now the feeling of sadness, sadness about the daughters will have to be changed.
It was a silent revolution.
I had told the people in front of the tourist circuit in India - 'Incredible India', 'Incredible India' and you should send me some frolicking pictures of your journey on the trail of tourism.
Lakhs of photographs were sent from every part of India.
The government of India or the tourism department of the state government would never have thought that we have such a rich heritage.
A lot of things came up on one platform and the government did not spend a single rupee on it.
It was the people who did it.
Today, I can say with great happiness that the sale of Khadi has doubled in the last one year.
I was once saying in Mann Ki Baat that the poor mother sees pictures of a poor man who is stuck in a house, a child crying.
Shouldn't they get gas cylinders
If the government works hand in hand with this society, then the government can work as a catalyst for change in the society.
Every small issue was taken up by us and we tried to connect ourselves for the welfare of the country.
What can be a greater pleasure than this ?
I decided to do a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I requested the citizens of the country to share their questions, your suggestions and your suggestions with me through telephone.
In Mann Ki Baat, I will pay attention to it.
I am glad that more than 5500 telephones have been received from across the country - be it Siachen, Kutch, Kamrup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There is not a single place in India from where the citizens have not made a call.
This is a kind of pleasant experience.
People from all age groups shared their thoughts.
I have heard some of them myself. I was glad that my team worked on the proposals on the rest of the issues.
It may have taken you one or two minutes to make this phone call, but the questions, ideas and issues that I have received from it are important for me.
The entire government will definitely work on this.
I have come to know about the importance of radio for such blind people.
I can see it from a new perspective. And many good things he has said, good issues are enough to be sensitive to the government.
I would like to suggest to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi that through Mann Ki Baat this time, I would like to appeal to the people of India to make maximum use of the potters in Diwali.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army.
The Navy, which protects the water, land and sky, is the Army and the Air Force.
Fifty years of the war with Pakistan in 1965.
When we hear about the pride of our soldiers during the war, the pride of our soldiers, the courage and sacrifice of our soldiers, we do not even have the technology to shoot, but we can also experience the moments of their sacrifice.
Whether it is the fight of Hajiphere, whether it is in the north or in the west or the scenes of victory near Hajipire, thrill is created on the organ and the pride that is felt about the Indian army gets overwhelmed .
If you want to make history, you will have to understand the small issues.
Due to history, our relationships with our children remain intact.
If the dance associated with history is broken then the possibility of history being created becomes completely different.
A child has given an order to the Prime Minister, but in a hurry, he forgot to name his own son.
I was satisfied that I had announced the Swachh Bharat Mission on 2nd October and I can say this thing to you that for the first time since independence, there is a discussion on cleanliness in the Parliament.
There was also criticism on our government.
I used to hear a lot about cleanliness. Modi ji was talking a lot about cleanliness but what happened
I am not sorry to hear this, but it shows me a good thing that the Parliament of the country talks about India's cleanliness.
And look at the other hand, on the one hand, the Parliament on the other, and on the other hand, when both of them talk about cleanliness, there can be no such thing as luck for the country.
This movement is witnessing a rise in the awareness about thought, filth and cleanliness.
With this, the government too will have to work, it will become inevitable to do the work.
When we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in India in 2019, we should work in that direction to realise the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi from now on.
You are well aware of what Mahatma Gandhi says
At one place, he says that when it comes to choosing one of the two streams of freedom and cleanliness, I will give priority to cleanliness. After independence, cleanliness for Gandhiji was more important than independence.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men continue to inspire us.
It is not our job to evaluate what this great man was thinking.
All those who live for the country and die for the country will inspire us.
This is an occasion to remember all these great men.
On the 25th of September, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, on the 2nd of October, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri, on the 11th of October, Jay Prakash Narayanji, on the 31st of October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, I would like to mention many names.
Whatever date you take, the names of some or the other great person will be associated with that date from the point of view of history.
Especially, I once again request you for 2nd October.
2nd October marks the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi.
The work that the government could not do by spending a lot of money in the public domain was done with the help of your small work.
And that is why I once again request you to do this thing.
My dear countrymen, my mind is full of joy because of one thing.
Chandra Bose had made all the arrangements on the birth anniversary of Subhas Babu.
Chand Bose and his family took this task upon themselves and in the last week, it was confirmed that fifty thousand people of Subhas Babu would come to the residence of the Prime Minister.
Just imagine how pleasant it will be for me.
He will get the opportunity to meet Netaji's leadership and visit the Prime Minister's residence for the first time.
But I am even more happy because I will be fortunate to have got the opportunity of visiting the Prime Ministers residence in the month of October.
Subhas Babu will have more than 50 natals, family members, some of them from different countries and a whole range of issues.
It will be a moment of great happiness for me.
I would like to request the Prime Minister to motivate the young generation to register their votes, so that the youth could participate in the future, and the younger generation could help in selecting and running the government in the future.
I hope that those youngsters who have not yet registered their names in the electoral rolls will register themselves and they will also cast their votes.
I met the 7th student of Kshitij Pandey at Anars Hindu University, who teaches at 7th in Kendriya Vidyalaya, as is his skill.
Dandaga is confident of it.
When I saw her interest in physics at a young age, I thought she would read a lot.
The daughter of Sadat Patel who lives in Sunderpur, Varanasi.
Her father said, No, when she takes over the books of mathematics, she opens the entire chapter of the scriptures and the evenings.
All our families are astonished that I was really impressed.
Sometimes these kids are known for their fame but I do not know anything about Sonam.
I realized that God has given me a power.
During my visit to Kashi, I got the opportunity to meet the two children of Kashi.
Similarly, the gift of these two children will be remembered by me.
Many people are suggesting new things for me through Mann Ki Baat.
Just see, the words of Sandeep Haryana, Sir Mann Ki Baat once a month, please do it every week because it inspires me by listening to you.
Sandeep ji, what will you do from me
Once a month, I have to do a lot of hard work and plan time.
Presently, there are 1,50,000 active cases and all are under active medical supervision.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has completed one year.
You know how much we want to use Subhas Babu Radio.
He had started his radio station from Germany and had to inform the people of India about the freedom movement through this radio station.
Azad Hind Radio was launched by him in a weekly newspaper.
English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Parsi, Urdu, Hindi, Hindi, English, Hindi, English, Hindi, English, Hindi, English, Hindi, Hindi, Hindi, Urdu and all these were broadcasts in these languages by these people.
It has been a year since I was talking to the people on All India Radio.
Keep sending your suggestions, ideas and suggestions.
It also benefits the government.
Reforms are underway.
Your contribution, your contribution, your contribution is precious to my taxes.
Once again, my best wishes to you all.
The people of South India are celebrating the festival of Onam and yesterday the entire country celebrated the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Keeping in mind the issue of social security, the Government of India has started several new schemes for the common man.
I am happy that all of you have adopted this scheme in a very short span of time.
I had requested my sisters to visit these security schemes on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I have been told that since the launch of this scheme, 11 crore families have been linked to them and I have been told that almost half of these schemes have been given to the mothers and sisters.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, it has been a year since the Jan Dhan Yojana was launched in a big way.
The banking sector is also a major part of the economy and the bank friend scheme has been strengthened to ensure that this system reaches the doorstep of the poor.
Today more than 1.25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
It has also provided employment to the youth.
You will be happy to know that in this one year 1 lakh 31 thousand financial literacy camps have been organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor people.
We dont have to just open accounts.
Now thousands of citizens are eligible for overdraft facility under the Jan Dhan Yojana and have availed the same.
It is believed that the poor can get money from the banks.
I once again congratulate all of you and appeal to all those who have opened their bank accounts, to the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters, to keep your bank's relationships intact.
This bank is yours, don't leave it now.
I have brought the bank to you. Now it is your job to keep it alive.
Due to the recent incidents of violence and violence in Gujarat, the entire country got disturbed and it is natural that if something happens in the land of Gandhiji and Sardar then the entire country gets its first blow.
But in a very short span of time, my dear brothers and sisters of Gujarat, have brought the situation under control.
He played an active role in overcoming the situation and once again Gujarat started walking on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and brotherhood is the only way forward and the path to progress is by working shoulder to shoulder.
Development is the answer to our problems.
Recently, I had got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi sect.
I got the opportunity to listen to his thoughts and tell you the truth. I realized from his words that there was something to hear.
His choice of words, his method of speaking, is the simplicity of the Sufi tradition, the rhythm of music, all of which I spoke to the scholars.
I was very impressed.
Often, there is a need to reach the world in the truest form of Islam.
The Sufi sect, which has been associated with love and generosity, will spread this message far and wide that will benefit the human society and Islam as well. And I would like to tell others that we should understand the Sufi sect, the Sufi sect and the Sufi traditions.
There will be another opportunity in the coming days and I am fortunate that I have got this invitation.
Buddhist scholars from different countries from all over the world will visit Bodh Gaya in India, where global discussions will take place on the welfare and well-being of humankind.
I am glad that I have been invited to Bodh Gaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodh Gaya.
It is a matter of great happiness for me that I will get the opportunity to visit Bodh Gaya with such scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Today once again I would like to share my thoughts with you.
Even before Mann Ki Baat, I had mentioned this topic.
You must have heard me in my speech in Parliament, in public meetings, in Mann Ki Baat.
Every time I was saying this thing that the government of India is open to the discussion about the Land Acquisition Act.
This means that the situation that was there before the formation of my government has now been restored.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to assure you that Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is not just a slogan for us.
That mantra is for the welfare of the villages, the poor and the farmers.
Therefore, on 15th August, we had said that not only the Department of Agriculture, but also the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be formed.
We are implementing this decision immediately.
Two days before the war of 1965, 50 years were over and when it came to the war of 1965, the brave Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was remembered.
I salute all those who led to India's victory in the 65th war.
Such events in history will always inspire us.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi sect last week, I had a pleasant experience.
I had the opportunity to meet the eminent scientists from all over the country and talk to them for hours.
I got the opportunity to hear his words and I am happy to know that India is doing a lot of good work in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing very well.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that this was not only an inspiration for me, but also a lesson for me.
And I saw how enthusiastic the young scientists were, how many dreams were in their eyes.
Last time I had said in Mann Ki Baat that students should move towards the field of science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are many opportunities and there are many possibilities.
I would like to repeat that my young friends should take interest in science and our educational institutions should motivate students for that.
I have written about skill development.
Shri Prakash from Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu stressed on the need for good teachers for primary education.
Emphasis has been placed on reforms in the education sector.
I would especially like to tell one thing to my young friends.
In a speech from the Red Fort on 15th August, I had said that this interview is for a job at the grassroots level.
And when the letters are received for the interview, every poor family and widow will be concerned about who will get the recommendation and who will get the job
Do you not know what words are used
There was a flow of people and perhaps corruption at the grassroots level was also one of the reasons.
I had said in my 15th August speech that even for the selection of the lower level, the interview should not be done by them. And I am happy to inform that the government has taken steps to ensure that in such a short span of time it has been only 15 days.
Suggestions are being sent and the decision to not put an end to the interviews for small posts is going to be implemented almost now.
It is unfortunate that almost 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die immediately after delivery every year.
This is worrisome and frightening.
Similarly, there has been a lot of improvement in this regard.
But now we have to save our mothers and new-borns.
We watch TV on TV but dont pay attention. Newspapers are publishing on TV but we dont see it.
Along with clean water, it is necessary to keep small things at home clean.
Life is extremely valuable.
Ignoring the inadequate water and apathy towards cleanliness is not a good reason for death.
Dengue screening is done free of cost at around 514 centres across the country.
From Raksha Bandhan to Diwali, this is the time of many festivals in our country.
Please associate yourselves with the cleanliness of every festival of ours. See, this swachhata will automatically come into your nature.
I always say that we will not get the opportunity to sacrifice our lives for the country but we have the destiny of the world.
Two youngsters from our country, two brothers and sisters from Nashik, Maharashtra, Dr.
Jitendra Mahajan and Dr.
What kind of efforts are being made by everyone to take the country forward and this is what is the pride that comes after hearing this thing.
Sometimes we commit injustice to our youth due to lack of understanding.
But I have a different kind of experience for the youth.
Sometimes we learn new things by talking to them.
I met several youngsters who told me that they have taken on the cycle.
One day in a week, there are certain cycle-days.
They say that they enjoy being young and good health and environment.
In our country, attacks increase the proportion of people using bicycles in many homes and many people encourage them.
These are good efforts to save the environment and to maintain health. And today, I am happy to note that two young people of my country have unfurled the flag of India in America, so the youth of India are also thinking about it.
I specially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
The memorial will inspire us to work towards the dalits, oppressed, persecuted and exploited people.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for these two initiatives that have been honoured by Dr.
The country can be taken forward by working shoulder to shoulder.
My best wishes to all of you. Thank you very much.
This will definitely help our farmer brothers and sisters in sowing the kharif crops.
I remembered one more thing that I wanted to be happy.
There has always been a shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor people need hard things, some oil for their food and vegetables.
I am happy to note that the food grain production this year has increased by 50 percent and the oilseed production by nearly 33 percent.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this thing.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of July has been recorded in the history of our country as Vijay Diwas.
The relation of the farmers with the land of this country is also of the same soldiers.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers, one hundred of our enemy soldiers were defeated.
The battle of Kargil was not just a battle on the border but it was also a part of every city of India and every village.
This fight was fought for those mothers and sisters whose young son was fighting an enemy in Kargil.
Henna, who had put his hand on the marriage, was still missing. Such young men fought this battle, looking at their courageous young children, who seemed to be young again, with their father's finger and those kids who could not walk any longer.
It is because of their sacrifices that India can speak truly before the world.
Just a few months after our government came to power in 2014, we launched the MyGov campaign on 26th July.
We launched this website to connect every citizen with development work and to increase their participation in democracy.
And today, after a year, I am happy to inform that nearly two crore citizens have visited MyGov.
Approximately 5.5 lakh citizens responded and especially more than 50,000 citizens took time out for reporting on the PMO APPLICATIONS.
Is it right for such people that they have problems in taking out the tickets of the train ?
Although this thing looks small on the top, but no one had ever thought that the government could not even remember it.
But the government seriously considered Akhilesh's issue and today a separate arrangement for ticket booking for our disabled brothers and sisters has been implemented.
There is a lot of positive suggestions on MyGov as well as on MyGov.
One can feel that there are new winds in the governance system.
I feel a new consciousness.
In my address on the 15th of August, MyGov has started inviting me to discuss some of the issues.
Sumitra Raghavachari from Chennai has suggested a lot of things.
I believe that it is a good idea for the citizens of the country to give their suggestions on the issue of what should be done in my speech on August 15.
I am sure that you will give good suggestions.
One thing I care about is that it reaches you.
I do not want to preach anything to anyone, I do not intend to take away the responsibility of the central government, state government or local bodies.
Just a couple of days ago, I saw an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver was about 10 minutes away in a wounded condition.
Hoshakote Akshay of Bengaluru, Shri Amit Joshi of Pune and Smt. Prasanna Kakunje of Murbidri in Karnataka expressed his concern over the same.
One person dies every four minutes in road accidents.
But I appeal to the parents that their children, be it running a two wheeler or be it the teaching of security be it the security of these children from home or the family, the parents should pay attention to it.
In this regard, the government has come up with a number of new policies, including training of citizens on road safety, road mapping and providing immediate assistance to those affected by the accident.
Keeping all these things in mind, we are going to introduce the Transport and Security Bill.
We intend to take many important steps in the coming days to implement the National Road Safety Policy and the Road Safety Action Plan.
The scheme is cashless treatment for highways at Gurgaon, Jaipur, Vadodara and even at Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mandya.
This means that we will give priority to providing immediate medical assistance to those injured due to the accident, in 50 hours after the accident.
A toll free telephone number 1033 will be available across the country to inform people about the accident.
There is a need to pay more attention to the fact that there is no accident at all, because the life of one person and everyone is more important.
Sometimes I say that the staff should become Karmayogis.
I had noticed a few things in the last few days and I wanted to talk to you about it.
But how to bring Chaitanya into the work he has done
Vijay Biswal has shown his passion and talent in his work.
There is a possibility that we will talk about his picture and I have come to know about one more thing.
The entire team of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, a different mission started by the team, touched my heart.
I liked his work and I am glad that this campaign started by these officers is going to be a different thing.
But the fact that he gave a new turn to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is really important.
There is a village named Keshwara near Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh.
The people of these villages have built toilets with their efforts.
Now no one in this village is going to open for toilet and when the work of constructing a toilet has been completed, the village of Keshwara celebrated a festival of happiness.
This is an excellent example of how the values of social life change, how the minds of the people change and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
Bhavesh Deka from Guwahati has written about questions related to the North-East region.
However the people of North-East region are active .
They will go to villages, talk to the administration officials, talk to the people's representatives and the citizens.
They will try to do whatever is possible from the central government to solve the problems faced by them.
One good effort is to move east and east from Delhi. And what I say is the Act East Policy.
My dear countrymen, the success of the Mangal Abhiyan is a matter of pride and happiness for all of you.
We get to know about this news but we dont get to see it.
I would like to tell the IAS officers that they should visit a school, college and interact with the students about two to four hours a week.
This is a difficult task but we have to do it.
There is no electricity in the examination. So do not fall prey to the study of the children.
If we want to start a small business or industry in the village then it will have electricity.
In some places, you have to go to another village to charge mobile.
We will do this, we have started it.
Today I want to talk to you through Mann Ki Baat on various topics.
I wish you all the very best.
You must send your suggestions and new ideas for the 15th of August.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
I could feel that there is nothing less.
You would have heard a lot of things, you would have heard a lot of things from the families of the 130 crore Indians sitting here in a very light atmosphere.
Sometimes your things become an inspiration for our people.
You can imagine the period of holidays.
Sunday, the last Sunday of the month - at 11 a.m.
Every moment I felt that I was missing something.
And when I talk about Mann Ki Baat, even if I speak on my own, the words may be mine, the voice may be mine, but the story is yours, your hard work is yours, your valour is yours.
I was just using my words and my voice.
There was a feeling of absolute emptiness in the mind.
Once I came to my mind, the elections have been over and I want to tell you four things.
But then I thought about it, no
We have that Sunday programme and we must continue to do so.
But this Sunday, however, had to wait a lot.
Small, simple, light-hearted things also become the reason for changing the lives of the society.
In a way, this sequence gives birth to a new energy, a pure Chaitnya and in a way we have to move forward by keeping this order in mind, by giving strength to the energy of the New India.
In the last few months, many messages have come in which innumerable people are misguiding with Mann Ki Baat.
When I read these messages, I feel very happy.
This is my journey from Ahim to Vyam.
This silent interaction with you for me was in a way a part of the experience of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath during the elections.
You have the right to ask such questions.
And I can understand that you will also be curious to know the answers to these questions.
Just say, "I had a feeling of emptiness in the light of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that perhaps I would have got the opportunity to fill up this pool in the valleys of Kedar, in those single caves.
Just as many people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, similarly, your effort to strengthen a positive point is constantly being made from your point of view.
The letters that come in Mann Ki Baat and the inputs that are received are different from routines, that is, daily routine.
Sometimes the letters that you have sent to me also become the reason for inspiring me.
Sometimes, some of your words work to sharpen my thinking process.
People understand me from the challenges faced by the country and the society.
At the same time, people also tell us what is the solution to these problems.
I can see that in the letters, people question their problems and also write about the answer to that.
The answers to the questions, one or the other reveal something or the other directly or indirectly.
Mann Ki Baat is like a blessing for the country and society.
Today, my heart was filled with happiness.
Last time, I had said in the end that some people had expressed the political meaning of the meeting that we will meet in the next three-four months. People said, Modi ji has so much confidence that he is so full of confidence.
This self-confidence was not of Modi.
So this belief was the foundation of your faith.
You all became a believer.
And that is why in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said that now I will come to talk to you after a few months.
And you people have given me the opportunity to speak again and again.
In this spirit, let us begin the sequence of Mann Ki Baat as before.
The movement was not limited to prisons.
There was anger in the hearts and minds of the people.
There was a tendency in the minds of the people to lose their democracy.
When we got food from time to time, we didn't know what hunger was like.
Similarly, they understand the importance of democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country felt that during the Emergency, we were able to steal something.
Whatever we have never used, even if someone steals it, it hurts and suffers.
Some arrangements have been made in the Constitution of India and democracy is still there.
There is also a need for a solution for running a society.
Laws and rules are also required and rights and duties are also discussed.
But India's Garwan can say with pride that for us, the law is greater than the rule of law.
Democracy is our culture.
Democracy is our heritage and tradition.
And with this legacy, we grew up as a child.
That is why the country had called for an entire election not for us, but for our interests and for the protection of democracy.
The precious democracy that we have received is easily homemade.
In India, more than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
But if there is a demand for the world then I would like to say that if we leave China, then more people than the population of any other country have voted for us in India.
The number of voters cast their votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than double the total population of the United States.
More than the entire population of Europe, there are more voters in India.
You can imagine the level of resources and manpower required for conducting these elections.
Lakhs of teachers, officials and staff worked day and night to ensure that the polls were conducted smoothly.
Nearly three lakh security personnel of the paramilitary forces have fulfilled their responsibility to make this Mahayagya of democracy a success.
At the same time, 20 lakh police personnel from different states have also worked hard.
You can imagine the magnitude of the elections.
This was done in order to ensure that not a single voter was deprived of his right to vote, and to enable all eligible voters to exercise their franchise.
In remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station was set up for a single female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the Election Commission officials had to travel two to two days to reach that remote place.
In addition to this, there was a talk of pride in this election.
I convey my best wishes to the Election Commission and to everyone involved in this election process and bow down to the alert voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard many times in my face that I request you not to book.
We all can read books instead of flowers while welcoming them.
On hearing this, people have started welcoming books at several places.
I have recently received a book titled Premchand Ki Lok kahanian.
I liked this gift a lot.
However, I could not find a lot of time, but during the journey, I got the opportunity to read some of their stories once again.
Premchand has shown the true picture of the society in his stories and the picture of that period is visible in front of his eyes while reading it.
Every detail he has written, everything goes lively.
His stories are filled with the emotions of the entire India.
While reading the story of 'Nasha' written by him, my mind automatically ran the question of economic disparity in the society.
I remembered the period of my youth.
There was a round-the-clock discussion on the economic inequalities in the society.
In this story, the sensitivity of a child, the immense maternal grandmother of the child, the maturity of the thoughts at such a young age, was reflected in this story.
When a 4-5-year-old Hamid arrives at the venue with a chimney from the fair, his true sense of human compassion reaches the highest point.
The story tells us about the life stories of a poor farmer.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village situated in the dense forests of Idukki.
The primary teacher of this place, P.K.
P. Muralidharan, who runs a small tea shop.
V.
The library was started by both of them as a result of their untiring efforts.
There was a time when we had to prepare a bundle of two books and we used to take books from our village in the forest.
Today this library, along with tribal children, is working to show a new direction to everyone.
In Gujarat, the 'Vasun Gujarat' campaign has been successful.
Lakhs of people from all age groups participated in this campaign and they read books.
In today's digital era, during the time of Google Guru, I urge you to keep some time away from reading books in your daily routine.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of happiness for me that the people of our country do not just think about the present day, but also think about the future challenges.
When I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and MyGov, I came to know that many people have written a lot about the water problem.
Apart from Pawan Gauri of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have also written about the water related challenges.
May the water be like a mother, may we seek the blessings of the mother goddess and may we continue to shower her blessings on us.
Due to lack of water every year drought occurs in many parts of the country .
We save only 8 per cent of water and that is why we need to address this problem.
Just as you all have solved many other problems through public participation and Jan Shakti, similarly, 130 crore citizens of the country will find solutions to the water crisis with all their strength, with the help of everyone and with a firm resolve.
Keeping in mind the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created in the country.
This will enable faster decision making on all issues related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to do something faster.
I have written letters to the Sarpanchs of the country and to the Prime Minister of the village.
To save water, to store water and not to drop rain water, village heads should hold meetings to save rain water.
It has been resolved to save every drop of water and save rain water in every village.
In today's Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to tell you about one Sarpanch.
The people of that place have once again proved to be playing an active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the villagers, the Sarpanchs, all the people who have shown their efforts to save water.
Many structures across the country have made such a pledge for water conservation.
In a way, this entire village has got the opportunity to work.
The people of the village are now competing to build a water temple in their own village.
I have already said that collective efforts can have very positive results.
There cannot be a single formula for overcoming the water crisis across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country.
But everyone's goal is the same and that is, water conservation and water conservation.
Work is underway to improve drainage lines in Punjab.
These works will solve the problem of water scarcity.
The lives of the people of the village are being changed because of the construction of water tanks at Thimaipalli in Telangana.
Small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan have brought about a transformation.
I had read about the collective efforts made in Vellore in Tamil Nadu where 20,000 women came together to revive the Naga river.
I read that the women of Garhwal have been working together in a very good manner in the field of rain water harvesting.
Several such efforts are being made and I believe that when all of you work together and strive together, then the impossible becomes possible.
When everyone participates in the task of water conservation, the water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I have asked the countrymen for three things.
My first request is that just as the countrymen have made the Swachhata Abhiyan a movement, similarly, a peoples movement should also be started for water conservation.
Let us all resolve to save every drop of water together and I believe that water is the offering of God.
Earlier, he used to say that the touchstones of Paris were made of iron.
I say that water is fair, and a new life is created through the touch of water.
A awareness campaign should be launched to save every drop of water.
We should work towards connecting the society with the society by making the society aware.
I urge all of you to share the traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of us had the opportunity to visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Pujya Bapu, then he would have seen this place - there is another house on the other side of the house of Pujya Bapu.
Therefore, I always say that if someone goes to the Kirti temple then you must visit the water collection tank.
Let us encourage people to conserve water by making a list of best practices related to water conservation.
All of you can share your information using Jan Shakti for Jal Shakti.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude for one more thing.
He told me through Twitter that the Presidents of many countries, the Prime Minister, dignitaries, the common man, had celebrated Yoga Day in their own country.
On that day, the whole world seemed to be a happy and happy family.
Therefore, the propagation of Yoga is a great act of social service.
Why don't you recognise those who are doing such service and honor them
The Prime Ministers Award for Excellence in Yoga for Development was announced in 2019.
This thing is inspiring.
Now the subject of Yoga is going on, so Indians are not far behind in this field.
Bihar Yoga School, Munger was also honored, who has been dedicated for the last few decades for spreading Yoga.
My dear countrymen, this journey of ours is beginning today, a new spirit, a new feeling, a new resolve, a new strength, but I will keep waiting for your suggestions.
Let us meet, let us continue to speak.
I hear your feelings and keep them alive.
Sometimes he tries to live that spirit.
May you continue to receive your blessings
You are my inspiration and you are my energy.
I will meet you once again on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat next month.
Thank you very much to all of you
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
In the aftermath of the terror attack in Pulwama, the lives of brave-hearts have been shattered, and there is a feeling of grief in the minds of people across the country.
Condolences to the fallen heroes and their families.
There is a deep sense of grief and anguish in the minds of all of us and in my heart against such violent acts of terrorism. The same spirit has been instilled in the minds of every Indian and in the minds of the humanity across the globe.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives for the protection of Mother India.
Our Armed Forces have always displayed exemplary courage and valour.
They have shown immense potential in establishing peace.
It was there that he used to give a befitting reply to the attackers in their own language.
You must have seen how the action was taken within 100 hours.
The courage shown by his father, Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, in such a sad hour, inspires all of us.
We will send our second son to the army to fight the enemy and if necessary, we will fight ourselves, he said.
The entire nation salutes the indomitable courage of Meenaji, wife of Shaheed Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
He has also decided to recruit a single child in the CRPF itself.
When a martyr, Vijay Soren, who was wrapped in a tri-color in Jharkhand, his ex-boyfriend also said that he would join the army.
The courage shown by these brave-hearts is the spirit of every child in India today.
The same spirit seems to be reflected in the homes of our brave martyrs.
None of our brave martyrs is except their family members.
Be it the family of the Martyrs of Deoria or the parents of the Martyrs of Kangra, Tilakraj of Kangra or the six-year-old son of the Martyrs of Kota, the story of every family of the martyrs is a source of inspiration.
You dont need to look at the old events in history to know what sacrifice is.
These are living examples in front of our eyes.
These examples are the source of inspiration for the bright future of India.
My dear countrymen, for the past several years, we have been waiting for the National Military Memorial, and this waiting period will soon end.
Therefore, it is natural for the countrymen to be curious about it.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shriyut Omkar Shetty, a resident of Udupi, Karnataka, expressed happiness over the completion of the National War Memorial.
It is a place to preserve the saga of valour of our brave soldiers who laid down their lives to protect the nation.
I decided to build such an inspiring monument in the country.
We decided to build a National Military Memorial and ground work was also started.
Tomorrow i.e. on 25 February, we will dedicate this National Military Memorial to our army, millions and millions of people of our country.
The country will make a very small effort to repay the debts.
The place where the heart of Delhi is called, this new monument has been built near the India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I believe that if I visit this National Soldiers Memorial, it will be as sacred as visiting a place of pilgrimage, it will be in the eyes of my countrymen.
This National Military Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the country for the supreme sacrifices made by the freedom fighters.
The construction of this memorial shows the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The theme of the National Soldiers Memorial is based on a four centric circle, from the birth of a soldier to the martyrdom of a soldier.
The valour of Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the soldier.
The cycle is also a reflection of safety and security.
There is a queue of dense trees in this circle .
These trees are a symbol of the soldiers and a message of confidence to the citizens of the country that the soldiers are stationed on the border and the countrymen are safe.
When they come here to know about the valour of the brave soldiers, they will be able to know about the countrys safety, we will have to live and develop the country.
Our Armed Forces, Police and Paramilitary forces are certainly not able to contribute to the development of the country in the words of great and invaluable contribution.
I want to express my gratitude to all the men and women police personnel who are continuously working for our security.
I hope that all of you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
This will inspire other people to visit this holy place and they will also be eager to visit this holy place.
This time when I was reading about the feedback from you, I could get my attention.
He wrote that on March 3, 1900, the British had arrested Birsa Munda.
And it is a matter of Yoga that on 3rd March is also the birth anniversary of Jamsetji Tata.
Both have come from a diverse family background but have enriched the tradition, heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In Mann Ki Baat, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamsetji Tata, in a way, salutes the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have not only brought glory to Jharkhand but also to the entire country.
The entire nation is grateful to him for his contribution.
Today, who can be named as an inspiring personality as a guiding light for our youth is BhagwanBirsaMunda.
While Birsa Munda was asleep by the British, she hid herself and took her to task with a sharp touch.
Do you know why the British had to accept such a trick to capture Munda
The reason was that the Britishers were afraid of the big empire.
Lord Birsa Munda had just through his traditional bows and arrows destroyed the British government with guns and guns.
In fact, if people get such an inspiring leadership, then the collective willpower becomes stronger than the forces of the front enemy.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda not only fought with the British for political freedom but also fought for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
They have done everything in their lifestyles.
In the dark life of the oppressed and the deprived, we brought the sun light.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the age of 25 years.
The sons of Mother India like Birsa Munda have been born in every part of the country.
But unfortunately, the stories of sacrifice and sacrifice of these great people have not reached the new generation.
If a personality like Birsa Munda ji made us realize our identity, then a personality like Jamsetji Tata created a big institution in the country.
Jamsetji Tata was convinced that India must become a centre of science, technology and industry for a bright future.
Not only this, he established a number of world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jamsetji Tata and Swami Vivekananda ji had once visited the United States on board the ship and discussed a wide range of issues.
This discussion led to the foundation stone laying of the Indian Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Mr. Morarji Desai, was born on 29th February.
You all know that this date comes just once in four years.
Morarjibhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
In independent India, the record of presenting the budget for the maximum number of times in the Parliament is also in the name of Morarjibhai Desai.
At a time when there was a democratic crisis in the country, Morarji Desai took the leadership of India in that difficult time.
Morarji Desai flung himself in the movement against emergency in defence of democracy.
They had to pay a very heavy price during their old age.
At that time the government had arrested him in Turung.
When the Janata Party won the elections in 1977, it became the Prime Minister of the country.
Accordingly, the Fundamental Rights received under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution were not violated during the Emergency.
Morarji Bhai had made this amendment so that the manner in which democracy was assassinated in 1975 and such things should not happen again in the future.
Today once again I pay homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, there was a lot of curiosity among the people about the Padma Awards this year as well.
In such a scenario, the people who work selflessly for the people at the grassroots, should be rewarded and honoured.
Many people have been making positive changes in the lives of people in different ways by working hard.
Those who are selflessly working in the service of the people, in the service of the society and in the service of the nation, above all, are the Karmyogis.
These are true workers who are far away from the world of glory and do not care whether they are named or not.
He believes in the work of the Gita: Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam These messages of the Gita are in a way living in reality.
I want to talk to you about some such people today.
Khatris are trying to reach new generations through rare paintings.
I had visited former US President Barack Obama on the art of Tree of Life produced by Abdul Gafoor.
Among the criteria of Padma awards, Shabbir of Marathwada is known to be the servant of Sayyid Gomata.
The way they have dedicated their entire life for the service of the mother cow, they see the work being done differently.
Even at the age of 100 years, many people in the world are being trained in Yoga.
Jamna Tudu, popularly known as Lady Tarzan, Jharkhand, worked courageously in hand with Timber Mafia and Nakshala to save 50 hectares of forest from being devastated.
It is due to the hard work of Jamnabai Ji that now every child of the village in that area will plant 18 trees after the birth of every child.
She has worked in the direction of women empowerment and how farming can be beneficial.
Kisan Chacha has inspired 300 women of our area to join the Self Help Groups to become financially self-reliant.
This change in the list of awardees is a new image of India which is transforming.
My dear countrymen, a heart -breaking experience has just come to me and today I will tell you this place.
Nowadays, wherever I go in the country, it is my endeavor that I get the opportunity to talk to some of the beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana i.e.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme.
I am aware that this scheme is going to bring about a major change in the lives of the poor.
If a poor person is not able to get cashless treatment, then you must inform him about this scheme.
This scheme is for such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the exam season in schools will begin now.
The examinations will be between 10th and 12th in the next few weeks by different boards across the country.
My heartiest greetings to the parents and all the teachers on behalf of all the students who have passed their examinations.
A few days ago, a massive programme Pariksha Pe Charcha in Delhi was organized in the same manner as the Town Hall programme.
The programme, Pariksha Pe Charcha 2020, was launched by the Honble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi on 31st March 2020.
It was also discussed that this will be of great benefit to the students.
All the students, their teachers, parents can watch the entire recording of the program on YouTube.I congratulate all my Exam Warriors for the forthcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, there is a discussion going on about India and there is no talk about festivals, it cannot happen.
This is the reason why we have thousands of years old culture and tradition.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago I had visited Kashi and during this visit of Kashi, I had got the opportunity to spend some time with my divyang brothers and sisters.
And it was a pleasant surprise for me to hear the copy of the copy.
The youth with disabilities have shown the same way as I speak in Mann Ki Baat.
It means that people only listen and leave Mann Ki Baat.
I was really impressed by the power of that Divyang youth.
My dear countrymen, connecting with you through Mann Ki Baat is a unique experience for me.
In a way, I interact with crores of families through radio every month.
Many a time, talking to you, reading your letters or listening to your phone calls, I feel that you all have accepted me as a member of your family.
This is a very pleasant experience for me.
Friends, Elections are the biggest celebration of democracy.
In the next two months, all of us will be busy in the forthcoming elections.
I myself will be a candidate in this election.
Respecting the strong democratic tradition, the following Mann Ki Baat will take place on the last Sunday of May.
This means that the month of March, the month of April and the full month of May will go on for three months.
With a new belief, with the blessings of all of you, I will once again begin the programme to connect with you through Mann Ki Baat and will continue to talk to you through Mann Ki Baat for years.
Once again I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
He dedicated his entire life to the service of the society.
Lord Basaveshwara has taught us - , , That is, the abode of Lord Shiva is like staying in Kailashadham.
His reputation was such a scholar who had tremendous influence on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He was dedicated to providing food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge to the people throughout his life.
I have been fortunate to receive the blessings of venerable Swamiji several times.
In 2007, our former President, Dr.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for venerable Swamiji on this occasion.
This poem by Dr. Kalam Saheb, U Receiving, U Received Happiness Allness Will Bless, All Your Actions presents the life of Shri Shri Shri Shiv Kumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhaganga Mutt beautifully.
Once again, I pay my tributes to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country which is an inseparable part of our democracy and is older than our Republic I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
25th January was the founding day of the Election Commission, which is celebrated as National Voters Day, and the massive scale at which elections are being held in India, the people of the world are surprised to see that every countryman is proud of the Election Commission.
Every citizen of India who is a registered voter in our country.
No stone will be left unturned to ensure that the registered voters get the opportunity to cast their votes.
In Himachal Pradesh, even at the height of 15,000 feet from the sea level, polling stations are set up in remote islands like Andaman Nicobar Islands.
Just imagine for a single voter.
When you hear these things then it is natural for you to feel proud of the Election Commission.
This is the beauty of our democracy, that the Election Commission employees go to far-flung areas to ensure that they get the opportunity to exercise their franchise while keeping that in mind.
I appreciate the ECI for continuously striving to strengthen our democracy.
I urge the young generation to register as voters if they are eligible to vote.
At the same time, it is my duty to cast votes - this spirit should also be inculcated in us.
We have to realize this responsibility.
This should be our attitude, our attitude, our attitude.
This should be our culture.
I appeal to the eminent people of the country that all of us should join hands to register their votes or to make people aware by running a campaign to get votes.
I hope that a large number of young voters will be registered and our participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done something wonderful and unforgettable for mankind.
Our country is a multi-polar world.
One of those great men was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different manner.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I got the opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes of India's freedom struggle.
You know that many rooms and buildings were closed since independence in the Red Fort.
The construction of the Red Fort has been done in an extremely beautiful museum in the form of closed rooms , museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army .
The museum dedicated to Yaad-e-Jallian and 1857 Etine-Fitine, India's First War of Independence and this entire complex has been dedicated to the country as a Kranti Mandir.
Every brick of this museum has the aroma of our glorious history.
The stories of our freedom fighters in the museum inspire us to see them in the history.
At the same place, the British Rajvitans had played the role of Bharat Mata's heroic son Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I used to visit the Kranti Mandir of the Red Fort and the memories associated with Netaji, the family members of Netaji visited me with a very special cap.
Netaji used to wear that cap.
I allowed the hat to be kept in the museum, so that the people coming there could see the hat and get inspiration from it.
In fact, our heroes need bravery and patriotism to continue to spread in different ways to the new generation.
A month ago, I visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December.
At a function, the tricolour was hoisted at the same place where Netaji Subhas Bose had unfurled the tricolour 75 years ago.
Similarly, in October 2018, when the tricolour was hoisted at the Red Fort, everyone was surprised as it was the tradition of August 15.
It was the 75th anniversary of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled organizer.
A brave soldier who played a key role in the freedom struggle.
Delhi Chalo, let me kill you, I will give you freedom. Netaji had won the hearts of every Indian by his many inspiring announcements.
There was a demand that the files related to Netaji should be brought before everyone for years and I am glad that we have been able to do this.
I remember Netaji's entire family who had come to the Prime Minister's residence.
We all discussed several issues related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am glad that efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Be it 26, Alipur Road related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir.
If you come to Delhi then you must see these places.
My dear countrymen, today, when we talk about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered radio as an important medium of connecting with the people. Similarly, Netaji too used to be very close to the radio and he used to choose the same medium to communicate with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhas Babu started Azad Hind Radio and interacted with soldiers and people of Azad Hind Fauj through radio.
Subhash Babu had a different style of opening his radio address.
First of all, he used to say - This is Subhash Chandra Bose speaking to you over the Azad Hind Radio and as soon as he heard that a new zeal, a new energy was being circulated among the audience.
I was told that these radio stations used to broadcast news on weekly basis in many languages like English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashtu and Urdu.
In order to run this radio station, a resident of Gujarat, Mr.
Vyas played an important role.
The programmes broadcast by Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes gave a great boost to the fighters of our freedom struggle.
A painting museum has been set up in this Kranti Mandir .
An attempt has been made to present Indian art and culture in an extremely attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 centuries old paintings and art works.
The Museum showcases the best of art works of great artists like Amrita Sher-Gil, Raja Ravivarma, Avinindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy, Sailoz Mukherjee among others.
And I would like to appeal to all of you that you must visit Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you might be wondering that the art of this place is being discussed and I am telling you about the excellent art works of Gurudev Tagore.
So far, you would have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and composer.
But I would like to say that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made paintings on several subjects.
They have also taken pictures of animals and birds, they have also taken many beautiful natural pictures and not only have they done the job of drawing many human characters on canvas through art.
And the special thing is that they have not given any name to most of our pictures.
He was confident that the painter would understand the meaning of the painting himself, the meaning of his message from the paintings would be understood from his perspective.
Their paintings have been depicted in European countries, Russia and the United States.
I hope you will go and see their paintings in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have given the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Saint Ravidas ji used to give a big message in a short span of time.
He used to say - "If we go to the caste system, if we do not associate ourselves with the 'Paraddas of Hajo ketan' or with the caste system, then we dont lose anything under the leaves of banana, then we dont leave anything under the leaves of leaves or at the end of the leaves.
He used to say that if God really lives in every human being, then it is not right to be associated with him on the basis of caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas Ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
Saint Ravidas ji, through his message, tried to explain the importance of labour and labour for the entire life.
It is not wrong to say that he has told the world the true meaning of the dignity of labour.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on My Gov that I should highlight Indias space programme and its future aspects.
I would like to urge the students to take interest in space programmes and think out of the box and think out of the sky.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, when I got the opportunity to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai has been an important contributor to India's space programme.
In our space programme, innumerable young scientists of the country have contributed.
We are proud of the fact that satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students are reaching space today.
On the 24th of January, we launched the Kalam-Sat, built by our students.
Sounding rockets produced by students of the University of Odisha have set many records.
The more space missions have been launched since independence till 2014, the more space missions have been started in the last four years.
We have also made a global record of launching 104 satellites in a single space shuttle.
We will soon show India's presence on the Moon through Chandrayaan-2.
Our country is using space technology in the best possible way to protect lives and property.
Be it the cyclone or the rail and road safety, space technology has helped a lot in this.
Our fishermen brothers have been given naval devices, which are helpful in economic progress, including their security.
We are using space technology to enhance the delivery and accountability of government services.
Housing for All: Around 40 lakh households in about 23 states have been given Geo Tagging under this scheme.
At the same time, under the MNREGA, nearly 3.5 crore assets have been geo-tagged.
Our satellites have become a symbol of the country's growing capability.
They have contributed significantly to our excellent relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellite has been a unique initiative, which has also given a gift of development to our neighbouring countries.
Today, not only the developing countries but also the satellites of the developed countries are launched by India through its immense competitive launch service.
The sky and the stars are always great attraction for children.
Our space programme provides an opportunity to our children to move ahead with the limitations that they had so far faced.
Our children have a vision to not only starve, but also to explore and motivate new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that the one who plays will open up and this time a lot of young and young players have come forward in Khelo India.
Around 6000 players took part in the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
Only when the players perform best at the local level will they do the best at the global level.
In the Khelo India programme, players from every state have done well at their own level.
Life is a tremendous inspiration for many medal winners.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
The captain of the 21-year-old women's kabaddi team, Sonali Havelock, is a resident of Sataraya, a very young man went to her father and encouraged her brother and her mother Sonali's skills.
Often it has been seen that in sports like kabaddi, the girls are not getting so encouraged.
In spite of this, Sonali not only chose Kabaddi but also performed brilliantly.
A 10-year-old Abhinav Shaw from Asansol is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.

When we talk of building a New India, a New India is about the resolve of youth power.
These stories of Khelo India are telling that not only big cities are contributing to the construction of New India, but also small cities, villages, youth coming from towns, children, young sports talent.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many prestigious beauty contests.
This unique competition is called Swachh Sundar Shauchalay.
You will get to see pictures of beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media.
I urge all the Sarpanchs and village heads to take the lead in this campaign in their panchayats.
You must put a picture of your clean beautiful toilet on social media, including Mylzzatghar.
Friends, On the 2nd of October, 2014, we started the journey of making the country clean and free from open defecation.
Today, India is moving forward in the direction of becoming Open Defecation Free much before the 2nd of October, 2019, with the cooperation of every Indian, so that we can pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
Anil Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about exam and exam warriors.

For many families, the first part of the year is exam wax.
From students to their parents to teachers, everyone is engaged in examinations related work.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would have liked discussions today on this subject in Mann Ki Baat, but you will be happy to learn that after two days, on 29th January at 11 am, we will be interacting with students from all over the country through Pariksha Pe Charcha.
And many foreign students will also participate in this event.
I will certainly put some of these ideas and suggestions in front of you in the Town Hall programme.
You can also watch the same live telecast through social media and Namo app.
My dear countrymen, January 30 is the death anniversary of Pujya Bapu.
At 11 a.m., the entire country pays homage to the martyrs.
You too should pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes.
My best wishes to all of you. Thank you very much.
The year 2018 will end.
And it is only then that experience is beneficial and self-confidence for selection is also created.
What can we do to bring about a change in our lives and at the same time contribute to the society and the country.
My best wishes to you all for 2019.
You must have decided to cherish the memories of 2018.
It is also important that India will remember how 2018 as a country, as a strength of 130 crore people.
And it is also a matter of pride for all of us.
In 2018, the world's largest 'Ayushman Bharat' scheme was launched.
Electricity reached every village of the country.
Eminent institutions of the world have acknowledged that India is working at a record pace to eradicate poverty.

This year, India won a large number of medals in the Asian Games.
India has also done well in the Para Asian Games.
If I talk about the collective efforts of every Indian, then our Mann Ki Baat will be so far away that 2019 will be eradicated.
This has been possible only because of the tireless efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, in December this year, we have met some extraordinary Indians.
On 19th December, Dr. Jitendra Singh passed away in Chennai.
Dr. Jitendra Singh is also known as the cheapest treatment for the poor.
People tell us that they were ready to serve the patients.
I have read a number of articles on these websites inspiring their society.
Similarly, on 25th December, 2018, he passed away at Sulagittinarasamma, in Karnataka.
Earlier this year, he was honored with the Padma Shri.
There are many who have dedicated their lives for the welfare of the society like Jaya Chandran and SulagittiNarsamma.
While we talk of healthcare, I would like to talk about the social efforts being made by the doctors of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors in the city organize camps to provide free treatment to poor patients.
Every month such camps are organized by the Heart Lung Critical Care of this place where free treatment is provided for various diseases .
Today hundreds of poor patients take advantage of these camps every month .
The enthusiasm of these young doctors doing selfless service is really commendable .
Today, I am proud to say that Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has succeeded in collective efforts.
Some people told me that a few days ago, in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people started a cleanliness drive.
Right now I am Thebettreindia.
I am confident that more and more people will get to know about our role in transforming the society.
It is easy to spread negativity.
But, a lot of good work is being done around you in the society.
And this is happening due to the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports is an important part of every society.
When sports are played, those who watch it also get energy.
We see many things like fame, recognition and respect for sports persons.
But sometimes there are many things that are more than the world and more than the world.
I will now tell you about Kashmir's daughter Hanaya Nissar who won a gold medal in Korea's Karte Games.
He is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Having studied and practiced the taxation, she learnt the barracks and proved herself.
I pray on behalf of all Indians for her bright future.
Many good wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, 16-year-old Rajni ji was also discussed in the media about this daughter.
Rajan told her that her father had sacrificed a lot and had worked very hard to reach here.
Jasmer Singh left for work every morning before Rajani and her feelings rose.
When Rajan had expressed his desire to learn boxing, his father collected all possible resources and encouraged it.
Rajni had to use old gloves to practice even an old one because her family was financially vulnerable.
Despite all the hurdles, Rajni ji did not go out of her studies.
She also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajni ji and congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha Rani for helping Rajni ji and boosting her enthusiasm.
In the same month, a 20 year old girl from Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni has become the fastest Asian to travel the world by bicycle.
It was running around 300 kilometers of bicycles every day for 159 days.
Just imagine 300 kilometers of cycling every day
Her quest for riding a bicycle is truly noteworthy.
Whether we are inspired by such achievements or not
Especially when my young friends hear about such incidents, they also get inspired to do something after overcoming hurdles.
If you make a pledge and if you have strength in your resolve then all the problems will automatically fall apart.
No problem can be a hindrance.
When we hear about such examples, we also get an inspiration in every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, there will be many festivals like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi in January.
On the occasion of these festivals, the country will see the color of traditional dance somewhere in the country, while on the occasion of Sugi Lohri we will burn Lohri at some places.
After this the day starts to gradually increase and the season of winters start .
Many congratulations to the farmers who are our Annadata or providers.
Unity in Diversity The spirit of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is inherent in our festivals.
We can see how our festivals have become so similar to nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not different and there is only one person and community here.
A good example of our close relations with nature is the calendar based on festivals.
It has not only a festival of one year but also a knowledge of the planets and constellations.
This traditional calendar provides information as to how old our relationship with natural and astronomical events is.
The date of the festivals is fixed according to the lunar and sun calendar according to the speed of the moon and the sun.
This depends on the calendar, which is calculated according to it.
In many areas festivals are celebrated according to the position of planets .
The festivals like Gudi Padava, Chettichand, Ugadi are celebrated on the basis of the lunar calendar, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishnu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu are celebrated on the sun calendar.
River and water conservation has a special significance in many of our festivals.
Chhath is the festival of worshipping the sun in rivers and ponds.
Millions and millions of people take holy dip in the rivers of Makar Sankranti.
Our festivals also teach us social values.
While on the one hand they have mythological significance, on the other, every festival easily inspires the social fraternity.
I wish you all the very best in 2019 and wish you all the very best in your future endeavours.
My dear countrymen, there are many things in our culture that we can take pride in and can take pride in the whole world.
People from across the country and abroad come there and are associated with the Kumbh.
The Kumbh Congregation has a deep sense of faith and reverence.
At one place, crores of people from within the country and abroad have come together.
The tradition of Kumbh Congregation is based on the rich cultural heritage of our country.
This year, from the 15th of January, the world famous Kumbh Mela is being organized in Prayagraj, and perhaps all of you would be eagerly waiting for it.
Saint-Mahatma has already reached Prayagraj for the Kumbh Mela.
Last year, UNESCO has placed the Kumbh Congregation on the list of wonderful cultural traditions of humanity, this can be gauged from its global significance.
A few days ago, Ambassadors of many countries had come to see the preparations for Kumbh.
At that time, national flags of many countries were hoisted at the same time.
People from more than 150 countries are expected to visit the Kumbh at Prayagraj.
India's magnificence will be enhanced by the divinity of Kumbh in the entire world.
The Kumbh Congregation is an effective medium to discover and everybody here experiences differently.
It is a great learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself had visited Prayagraj a few days ago, and I saw that preparations for the Kumbh were going on at a very fast pace.
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited about the Kumbh.
This year, emphasis is also being given on cleanliness in the Kumbh Mela.
If you pay attention to cleanliness in the Kumbh, then its message will reach far and wide.
This year, the devotee will also be able to visit the holy shrine of Akshayvat after having a holy dip at Triveni Sangam.
This Akshayvat, a symbol of the faith of the devotees, was locked up in a fort for several years, so even if he wanted, the devotees could not see it.
But now the doors of this Akshayvat have been opened for everyone.
I would urge you that when you visit the Kumbh Mela, you must upload some photographs depicting various aspects of Kumbh and the colors on social media, it will inspire more and more people to visit the Kumbh Mela.
May this Kumbh of spirituality be the Mahakumbh of philosophy of India for Indians.
Be it the Kumbh of Artwork, the Mahakumbh of Creation.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Republic Day on 26th January, there is a lot of curiosity in the minds of all of us.
Pujya Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable bond.
It was from South Africa that Mohan became a Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi launched his first Satyagraha and stood firm against discrimination.
He also established Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, from where the voice for peace and justice was raised all over the world.
The year 2018 is also celebrated as the centenary year of Nelson Mandela, also known as 'Madiba'.
You all are aware that Nelson Mandela is considered a role model in the fight against casteism all over the world.
He had received the courage and inspiration from venerable Bapu for so many years.
He considered Bapu as his ideal.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only inspirations for the whole world, but their ideals and values always inspire us to create a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, at the DGP's conference in Kevadia on the banks of the Narmada in Gujarat, there is the world's highest statue of unity.
A detailed discussion was held on the measures to be taken to further strengthen the security of the country and its people.
At the same time, I announced the Sardar Patel Award for National Unity, in any way, to recognize and reward those who contributed to national unity.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He has always strived to uphold Indias integrity.
Sardar Patel used to believe that India's true strength lies in its diversity.
We respect their feelings and pay tributes to them through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, 13th January is the holy day of Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna, North India was his workplace for a long time and he sacrificed his life at Nanded in Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the land of karma bhumi, North India and the end of life is in Nanded.
Thus, in a way, the entire India received his blessings.
If you look at his life, you will see the image of the whole of India in that.
After the martyrdom of his father Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur, Guru Gobind Singh Ji attained the position of Guru in the 9 years of his life.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice in the form of a legacy from the gurus.
His personality was calm and simple but whenever an attempt was made to smile for the poor and the weaker sections, whenever injustice was done to them, Guru Gobind Singh made a strong fight for the poor and the weaker sections, and that is why it is said - , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Gobind Singh ji used to say that it is not right to demonstrate our power by fighting against the weak.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that the biggest service is to alleviate human suffering.
He was a great archeologist and master of many languages including Gurmukhi, Sanskrit, Farsi, Hindi and Urdu.
I once again salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are many good things in the country that are not discussed at all.
I.e. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is implementing this.
I have been working to promote safe and healthy food habits.
India will prosper only when India is clean and healthy.
Nutritive food is the most important thing for good health.
In this context, F.S.
I heartily congratulate him for this initiative.
I would like to urge all of you to join this initiative.
I would like you to be a part of it, especially to the children.
The education to tell the importance of food is important from childhood only .
My dear countrymen, this is the last episode of the year 2018 and I will meet again in the year 2019.
Life, be it an individual, a nation or a society, the inspiration is the basis for the progress of that life.
Let us move ahead with this new inspiration, new enthusiasm, new resolve, new accomplishments and new heights so that we can change the country as well.
On 3rd October, 2014, on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami, we all began a journey together with Mann Ki Baat.
He was a architect of the same kind.
There was nothing in the dhabas to get rid of the clothes.
The road side was built with a very small towel.
There was a discussion on radio at that time.
It should reach the remotest parts of the country, from the remotest corner of the country to the metro cities, from the farmers to the young professionals.
Recently, All India Radio has conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen the findings of that survey. Some of the ideas are completely different.
Among those surveyed, an average of 70 per cent is those who listen to Mann Ki Baat on a regular basis.
Many people feel that Mann Ki Baat has contributed in a big way in increasing the positive feelings of the society.
This is a reflection of the positive feelings of our countrymen.
Many people have also shared their experiences that Mann Ki Baat has generated tremendous curiosity about voluntary actions.
There has been a paradigm shift in the way people are coming forward with a lot of enthusiasm and enthusiasm for social service.
I am very happy to see that Mann Ki Baat is gaining further popularity.
But in this journey, radio has not remained the same medium.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much for calling.
The doubts that you have raised are absolutely correct.
However, if a leader was given a 'Mike' to speak, and there were millions and millions of listeners to listen to it, then what more
They studied the words that were used frequently.
The scholars have concluded that this programme is not related to politics, when I started the programme Mann Ki Baat, at the same time, I had decided that no political party should be involved in it, no government support should be given to it.
You have done a great job in fulfilling my resolution. It is from you that I got all this inspiration.
In the earlier part of Mann Ki Baat letters, online comments and calls on the audience, it is clear what the audience has expected from the phone.
Modi will come and go, but this country will remain steadfast, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will continue to be alive.
Someone writes to me from far-flung areas of the country telling me that people dont have much to do with small shopkeepers, auto rickshaw drivers and vegetable sellers.
Now a campaign like Selfie with Daughter can be started in a small village in Haryana and it can spread not only in the whole country but also abroad.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government talk.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspiration of India.
If we want to give a simple answer to the question that we have asked, we will not make any preparations.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy task for me.
Because every time I receive letters from people before Mann Ki Baat.
Called on this number, people record their messages in their voice.
Before every part of Mann Ki Baat, I try to read more and more letters and comments on my own.
And that is why when I read a letter, the situation of the writer, his feelings in his mind becomes a part of my thoughts.
In such a situation, that letter is not just a piece of paper.
In fact, this voice is mine in Mann Ki Baat, but all the examples, feelings and inspirations are from my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people who have not been able to name anything in Mann Ki Baat, but they are not angry and send their letters.
Efforts are also made to ensure that all the papers which are not able to get a place in the Mann Ki Baat programme, and the related departments are taken care of.
It is only because of their hard work that Mann Ki Baat can reach more and more people.
A team of All India Radio prepares every region for broadcast in different languages.
Some people utter a similar voice to the voice of Modi and hear Mann Ki Baat in regional languages in the same style.
In a way, it becomes Narendra Modi for those 30 minutes.
I congratulate and thank these people for their skills and for their skills.
I urge you all to listen to this programme in your local languages as well.
However, the media also took up a number of issues which were discussed in Mann Ki Baat.
There are many topics like cleanliness, road safety, narcotics-free India, selfie with dot, etc., on which the media created new ideas and shaped them into a mission and worked extensively in that field.
Without our cooperation, the journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Sometimes our fore-front is also like a lot of trouble in talking .
Apart from accepting and reacting, I prefer to understand what the person is saying.
Generally, there is a discussion about the communication gap between the elderly, the aged and the children of Kumar-Yogta.
In fact, most of the households are restricted to talking about adolescent girls and children.
The discussions covered a wide range of topics including the study of children or their habits and lifestyles as well as the living conditions of the children.
I have always been trying to ensure that whatever they are doing or how they think, they can learn new things from them.
In the end, this is the New India.
Some people say that the young generation wants to do many things simultaneously.
I say - what is wrong with this
These youth have shown the courage to ask questions and dream big and they have brought about this change.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram, Vinita ji has written on MyGov that I should talk about Constitution Day on 26th November in Mann Ki Baat.
He says that this is a very special day as we accept the constitution, it has been 69 years since we are going to enter the 70th year.
Just imagine within the next three years, these great personalities have created such a vast event.
The way these great men prepared a draft of the event at such a fast pace, this is still a shining example of early management and productivity.
The special thing in our Constitution is that rights and duties are described in detail.
The harmony between the two will take the country forward in the lives of the people.
If we respect and respect the rights of others, our rights will be protected automatically and similarly if we follow our duties provided in the Constitution, our rights will be protected automatically.
I still remember that in 2010, when we had celebrated 60 years of the Republic of India, we had organized an elephant ride in Gujarat.
Our efforts to create awareness about the Constitution among the youth and to make them aware about the important aspects of the Constitution and to connect them with the Constitution became memorable.
And let us ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, whenever we talk about the Constitution Committee, we can never forget the contribution of the great man.
O great man, the venerable Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His Mahaparinirvan Diwas is on 6th December.
It is not a new thing for India that what kind of democracy is there and what kind of parliamentary system is there.
He said that this freedom, which we have got after so many years of struggle, is priceless, and we have to protect it till the last drop of our blood.
India First is Dr.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and next year, in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv.
Guru Nanak Devji had always thought of the welfare of the entire humanity.
He has always shown the society the path of truth, karma, seva, compassion and harmony.
All State Governments and Union Territories have also been directed to celebrate this event in a big way.
Similarly, the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated across the world.
I remembered Lakhpat Sahib Guruvadar at that time.
The Guru suffered a major loss during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat.
But the way the state government has done the work of revival with the help of local people is still a model.
The government of India has taken an important decision to construct the Kartarpur corridor so that the pilgrims of our country can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Kartarpur.
But our journey will continue to do so.
The more people connect with you, the better will be your journey and everyone will be happy.
Sometimes a question arises in the minds of people as to what do I get from Mann Ki Baat
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On the 31st of October, we mark the birth anniversary of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and, like every year, the youth of the country is ready to run for 'Run for Unity'.
I urge all of you to take part in this competition to listen in large numbers.
About six months before Independence, on the 27th of January 1947, the world's famous international magazine Time published a photo of Sardar Patel.
This was the map of India that had been divided into many parts.
At that time there were more than 550 institutions in the country.
Even though the interest of the British in India had ended, they used to break this country in many parts and then leave the country.
Time magazine used to write that threats such as divisions in India, violence, shortage of food grains, inflation and the politics of power were galloping.
Later, the Time magazine wrote that if anyone has the ability to mix and wound the country with the thread of unity, then it is Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
In this series of Time magazine, there were many other aspects in the life of a man of iron.
In the 1920s, after the floods in Ahmedabad, how did he arrange rescue operations, how did he guide the Bardoli Satyagraha
He brought all the institutions together to merge with India.
Be it Junagadh or Hyderabad or Travancore, or the Rajvati-Sardar Patel of Rajasthan, due to its ideological maturity and strategic prowess, today we can see a united India.
We naturally remember the pious memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel by looking at this nation and our mother India which is bound by unity and integrity.
On the 31st of October this year, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, will be even more special. On that day, while paying homage to Sardar Patel, we will dedicate the Statue of Unity to the nation.
The statue built on the banks of the Narmada River in Gujarat is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty of America.
This statue is the highest skyscraper statue in the world.
Every Indian will be proud of the fact that the highest statue in the world is located in the land of India.
Sardar Patel, who was associated with the ground, will now enhance the glory of the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, Only yesterday, all the countrymen celebrated Infantry Day.
This is the day when the soldiers of Indian Army landed on the land of Kashmir and protected the valley from the intruders.
This historic event has a direct connection with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview by the great army officer of India, Sam Manikshaw.
In the interview, Field Marshal Manikshaw recalled his time as Colonel.
It is also the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi on 31st October.
Tributes to Indira ji.
My dear countrymen, who doesnt like sports
In the world of sports, spirit, strength, skill and stamina are extremely important.
The youth of a country with these qualities will not only be able to progress in areas such as economy, science and technology but will also flag our flag in sports.
I also had the opportunity to visit our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018.
India won a total of 72 medals in this competition and created a new record and honored India.
I was fortunate to meet all these talented Para Athletes personally and congratulate them.
Similarly, I had the opportunity to meet the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina.
You will be happy to learn that our youth have achieved the best ever in Youth Olympics 2018.
In this competition, we won 3 more medals in Mix, apart from 13 medals.
You might remember that India's performance in this years Asian Games has also been outstanding.
You see, for a few minutes, I have used this term as the best, the most magnificent one ever.
This is the story of Indian sports that is scaling new heights in a day.
India is making a record not only in sports but also in those areas which were never thought of.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakore, who won gold in Athletics for the country in the 2018 Asian Para Games.
They are Divyang from birth.
When he was eight years old, he was his father.
Later, he spent eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he used to clean the bus of DTC and work as a waiter in Delhi's road dhabas.
Today, the same Narayan is winning gold medals for India in the international competitions.
Not only this, look at the growing popularity of India's excellence in sports, India has never won any Olympic medal at the Senior or Junior level in Judo.
However, Tababi Devi made history by winning a Judot silver medal at the Youth Olympics.
A 16 year old young player, Tababi Devi, resides in a village in Manipur.
His father is a laborer and mother does the job of selling fish.
Many a times the time came for his family that they had no money for food.
In such a situation, the morale of the goddess did not subside.
And he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are countless such stories.
Every life is an inspiration.
Every young player and his insistence on sports is the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, we have successfully organized the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017.
She was appreciated by the entire world for being the most successful player.
A new record was created in the FIFA Under-Satellite World Cup.
In different stadiums across the country, more than 12 lakh people enjoyed the football matches and the enthusiasm of the young players has increased.
This year, India had the privilege of hosting the Mens Hockey Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup 2018 will commence in November 2018 and will run till 16th December.
Every Indian is playing any game or is interested in any game, he has a sense of affinity towards hockey.
In hockey, India's history has been written in gold.
Earlier India had won gold medals in several tournaments and once India was the World Cup winner.
India has also given Hockey a number of great players.
When there is talk of hockey in the world, the story of hockey will remain incomplete without these great players of India.
The world recognizes hockey wizard Major Dhyanchand.
After that, he has travelled extensively from Balvinder Singh Sinier, Lesley Gladys, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh and Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, the players of Team India are inspiring the new generation of hockey through the success of their hard work and dedication.
There is a good opportunity for sports lovers to see adventurous games .
He should visit Bhubaneswar and encourage not only Indians but other organizations as well.
During this time, along with enjoying the pleasure of sports, you can also see the sun temple of Konark, Lord Jagannath temple of Puri and several world famous places of sacredness including Chilka lake .
I congratulate the Indian Mens Hockey team for this competition and assure them that 1.25 billion Indians are standing with them and with them.
I also convey my best wishes to the teams from all over the world who are coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward for social work, volunteering for it is an inspiration and an inspiration for all the countrymen.
But in the new era, the new generation is coming forward to do this work with new hope, new zeal and new dreams.
A few days ago, I had gone to a program where a portal has been launched, its name is Self for Society, MyGov and the IT and electronic industry of the country, to motivate their employees for social initiatives and to provide them such opportunities.
Every Indian will be proud of the zeal and dedication with which he has worked for this work.
From IT to Society, I am not, I am not, I am not the age, it is the fragrance of the journey of the entire world.
If someone teaches children, if someone is a senior citizen, if someone is engaged in the work of cleaning then someone helps the farmers and there is no desire to do all this, there is a selfless spirit of dedication and resolve.
A young man learnt the wheel chair basketball to help the wheel chair basketball team of the disabled.
This is the spirit of dedication, this is the work that has been done to accomplish something.
No Indian will be proud of it
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I was watching the people's suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I saw an interesting comment from Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on Mygov. In Mann Ki Baat, please let us say that the customs of many tribes of India are the best example of co-existence with the nature.
We need to learn from the way we adopt their traditions and practices of sustainable development in our lives.
Manish ji, I would like to praise him for reading the episode of Mann Ki Baat.
It is a matter that inspires us to look at our glorious history and culture.Today, the world, especially the West, is discussing environmental protection and is exploring new ways of a balanced life.
As such, our country is not untouched by this problem, but we just need to draw attention to it. We want to see our rich history, traditions and especially the lifestyles of our tribal communities.
Connecting with nature has been a part of our tribal culture.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The tribal communities in Central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship such trees as Pipal and Arjun with reverence.
In the deserts like Rajasthan, the Vishnoi community has shown us the path of environmental protection.
They have agreed to sacrifice their lives, especially for the protection of trees, but they do not approve of the loss to a single tree.
In Arunachal Pradesh, Mishmi claims to have a relationship with tigers.
They also consider them brothers and sisters.
Tigers are seen as protectors of forests in Nagaland.
The people of the Warli community of Maharashtra consider the tiger as guests and bring prosperity to the tigers.
The Kol community in Central India believes that their destiny is linked with the tiger. If the tiger does not get food, the villagers will have to starve.
In the breeding season of Gond tribal fish in central India they stop fishing in some parts of river Kathan .
In south India, on the Nilgiri plateau, a mini-fraud community in remote areas is traditionally made up of locally available materials.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is true that the tribal community is very peaceful and interconnected, but if someone harms their natural resources then they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is no surprise that our first freedom fighter was from the tribal community.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought against the British government in order to protect our forest land.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who have done something extraordinary for the society.
This kind of work seems to be rare but in fact it has a very profound effect on changing our mindset and the direction of the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother Gurbachan Singh from Punjab.
A simple and hard-working farmer was married to Gurbachan Singh ji's son.
Before the marriage, Gurbachan ji had said that we are going to marry the bride's mother Vadla in a simple way.
There are other things in the ups and downs, we dont have to spend much.
We have to celebrate this event in a simple manner.
But he suddenly said, but I have a stand.
Nowadays, when it comes to marriage, it seems that there is a big demand for something in front of the bridegroom, which will be difficult for the bride's family.
But you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurbachan Singh was a simple farmer and what he had said was the true strength of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji had said that we will never burn our fields.
We can imagine the great social power in it.
And we have seen that there are several families in our society who change personal affairs in the context of social good.
The family of Shri Gurbachan Singh ji has set an example in front of us.
I have read one more village in Punjab in the case of Kallar Mazra, which is near the navel.
Kallar Majra is discussing that instead of burning the grain, it mixes the soil with the nakedness and for that the technology that should be used is brought in.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurbachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to all those who are doing their best to keep the environment clean and also to the people of Kallar.
You have been taking the Indian tradition of a strong lifestyle forward like a true heritage.
Just as the ocean is formed by drop-downs, it plays an important role in creating a small atmosphere of awareness and positive work.
My dear countrymen, our scriptures say - : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : , : : : : , : : , : : , : : : : , : , : : , : : , : : : : , : , : : , : , : : , : : , : : , : : , : : , : , : : , : : , : , : : , : , : : , : , : : : , : , : : , : , : : : : , : , : , : : , : : : , : : , : , : : : , : : , : : , : : : , : : : , : : : : , : :
May there be peace in life, in heart, in me, in you, in every corner of the world.
Peace: Peace: Peace. When the world talks about peace, Indias name and contribution will be remembered for it.
The 11th of November this year is of special significance for India, because on the 11th of November the first World War ended 100 years ago.
The 100th anniversary of the Constitution will complete one hundred years of great destruction and loss of human lives.
The first great war for India was an important event.
In a true sense, we did not have to pay anything directly to that war.
Yet, our soldiers fought valiantly and played a very big role and made supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when there was a war, they were no less than anybody.
Our soldiers have displayed exemplary courage in difficult terrains and adverse situations.
The only purpose behind all this was to restore peace.
In the First World War, the world saw the scourge of dictatorship.
According to estimates, nearly one crore soldiers and equal number of civilians lost their lives.
This has brought peace to the world.
The definition of peace has changed over the last 100 years.
Today, peace and harmony do not just mean war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, there is a need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, the story of our North-East is different.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is incomparable and the people here are very talented.
Our North East is known for its excellent work.
North East is such a region which has made great progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the 2018 Future Policy Gold Award for promoting sustainable food systems.
The award is conferred on the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) associated with the United Nations.
You will be happy to note that this award is being conferred on Oscar submissions.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for having won this award by leaving behind the 51 nominated policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October is over.
The weather is witnessing a massive change.
Best wishes to all the countrymen for these festivals.
I urge you to take care of yourself, take care of your health and also take care of social interest during these festivals.
This festival is an opportunity to take a new decision.
This festival should move forward in a mission mode and it should be an opportunity in our lives to make a solemn pledge.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The more progress you make, the better the country will progress.
