Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
In particular, it is not that only Indian communities take part in it.
Now the governments of many countries and the citizens and social organizations of that country are celebrating Diwali with full fervor and enthusiasm.
In a way, it is said that India is creating the country there.
Friends, the festival of tourism in the world is an attraction.
There is a lot of potential in this festival tourism.
Whatever our efforts should be, we should celebrate Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal and Bihu, whatever other festivals.
In our country, there are different kinds of festivals in every state and every region, in which people from other countries are more interested.
Therefore, the role of Indians living abroad is very important in the expansion of the festive season in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided in the last Mann Ki Baat that we will do something different on this Diwali or not
On this Deepavali, I had also said that we will celebrate the women power of India and its achievements, that is, we will respect the motherland of India.
In a few days, stories of countless inspirations came to the fore in the social media.
An app called Namo app, has called his mother as his power.
In the year 1990, when my father had spent his time, my mother accepted the gold of five children.
Today we all have five brothers in good work.
Ramesh, and my greetings to your mother.
Later, Geetika Swamiji, who is also very active in Twitter, has described Major Khushboo Kanwar as the daughter of India.
For Kavida Diwaadi, it is Bharat's daughter that gives her strength.
It is a matter of great pride for the mother that her daughter is up to the painting.
He also has good marks in the CLAT legal entrance examination.
People are sharing such information.
You must read and be inspired and like all those who are present there, share something in your neighborhood. I salute all these daughters of India on this occasion.
We are aware that the foundation stone for this has been laid by him in the 17th century.
My dear countrymen, on the 12th of November this year, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev Ji is spread not only in India but in the entire world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters are living in many countries of the world who are fully committed to the noble ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget that I visited the gurudwaras in Venuvar and Tehran.
There are many things about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, but many parts of Mann Ki Baat will need to be fully utilized.
Nanak Devji considered service to the people above all else.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji considered selfless service as priceless.
He made a strong voice against social evils such as untouchability.
The message of Shri Guru Nanak Devji spread all over the world.
He was one of those who had travelled extensively during his tenure.
He has visited many places and wherever he goes, he will win everyone's hearts with the help of his simplicity and humility.
Guru Nanak Devji undertook many important religious journeys called Udasi.
He took the message of harmony and equality from the north to the south, from the east to the west, in all directions, to the people of all places, and to the prophets and saints.
It is believed that the famous saint of Assam, Shankardev, was also inspired by him.
He undertook a pilgrimage to the holy land of Haridwar.
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji used to stay in Guru Nanak Gurudwara, a holy place of Kashi.
He has also visited the places related to Buddhist religion like Rajgir and Gaya.
In the south, Guru Nanak Devji had travelled to Sri Lanka.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had found a solution to the water crisis there.
It reminds us that Guru Nanak Ji is also a famous place in Bidar, which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Ji.
At one point of time Guru Nanak ji travelled in the north, in Kashmir and nearby areas.
This led to a strong link between the Sikh faith and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji went to Tibet and the people there accepted him as Guru.
He is also saluting the Dalai Lama in Uzbekistan.
As part of his pilgrimage, he has visited a large number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He had a place in the minds of lakhs of people, who followed his teachings with full dedication and are still following it.
Just a few days ago, Ambassadors of about 85 countries from Delhi to Amritsar went to Delhi.
They had visited the Golden Temple and all this happened on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
It was on this day that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India, was born, who was the first to unite the country.
Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to unite the people, while he had the ability to reconcile those who differed.
He's really the man of detail, who was able to look at the nuances.
He is also a specialist in organizational functioning.
He was blessed with the art of designing plans and strategies.
While reading about Sardar's work, we can see how strong his planning was.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country were present for the Congress in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the arrangements for the conference were imposed on Sardar Saheb.
He used this opportunity to repair the city's water network.
He ensured that water scarcity should not happen to anyone.
He approached the farmers and requested them to provide Khadi bags.
There was also a significant increase in fertilizer sales.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his commendable contribution to the Constituent Assembly.
He was a man of immense importance in deciding fundamental rights, so that there was no discrimination based on caste and religion.
Friends, As the first Home Minister of the country, SardarVallabhbhai Patel had succeeded in uniting the country with a unique and unparalleled effort in the field of gold writing in the pages of history.
In fact, while talking about the efforts of Sardar Patel, we only talk about his contribution towards certain areas of national integration.
As soon as this news came to Sardar Patel, he took an immediate step without delay.
Under his command, the 3rds were immediately flown, and while watching, dust was poured into the enemy's evil desire to seize hundreds of islands.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the brothers to ensure all possible assistance for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today Lakshadweep is making an important contribution in India's progress.
This is an attractive tourist spot.
I am confident that all of you will visit its beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, on the 31st of October 2018, the Statue of Unity was dedicated to the nation and the world to commemorate the memory of Sardar Saheb.
This is the world's largest statue.
It is a two-fold statue at a height of more than the statue of a free goddess in the US.
Every Indian is proud of the worlds tallest statue.
The head of every Indian is filled with pride.
I am glad that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists have come to see the Statue of Unity.
That is, every day 8500 people have seen the pride of the Statue of Unity.
It is evident that SardarVallabhbhai Patel had a conviction and dedication in the hearts of these people and he had demonstrated this thing.
Now there are several attractive centres like the Saptakkal garden, Pattampuzha garden, Vanchala, Child nutrition park, Ekta Nursery etc., which have improved the economy of the region, and have provided new employment opportunities to the people.
Friends, This Statue of Unity for the country, for the tourism sector of all the states, can be a matter of study.
We all are witnesses to the fact that within a year, a place can become a world-renowned tourist destination.
There are people of our country and people from other countries.
Transport, accommodation, guides, eco-friendly systems are developing one after the other.
I request you too, to spare some of your precious time and visit the Statue of Unity.
But at the same time, every Indian traveling with their families, please visit at least 15 places in India and stay there by night. I once again request you to stay there.
Friends, You would be aware that from 2014 onwards, on 31st October, we have been observing National Unity Day.
This day gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our nation at any cost.
On the 31st of October, a Run for Unity is being organised every year.
It will include all sections of society, all sections of society.
In this regard, the Run is being conducted not only for physical as well as mental and emotional wellbeing, but also for the unity of India and for India to scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the country with the motto of Unity.
This mantra of unity is like a virtue in our lives and in a diverse country like India, we have to strengthen this mantra of unity at every stage, at every turn, at every stage and at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very constructive and vigilant in strengthening the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around, we will see many examples of those who are engaged in sustained operations to promote mutual harmony.
But sometimes the efforts of the society, its contribution and the memory board disappears at the earliest.
Friends, I clearly remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court had given its verdict on the issue of Ram Janmabhoomi.
But when the verdict on the Ramjanma Bhoomi was delivered, the then government, political parties, social institutions, society, representatives of all religions, saints and monks expressed their views in a very peaceful and impartial manner.
This is an attempt to reduce the pressure in the environment.
Those days, those moments remind us of our duty.
This is an example of how Unity is the strength of the country.
There are also 1.25 billion Indians who benefit from it.
But there is a pleasant experience and interesting experience.
I heard that I felt that I should not share it with you.
Just imagine... the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature is below zero by 50-60 degrees.
Life in the air is in some name only.
In such an alarming situation, living in the midst of so many challenges is nothing less than a mighty act.
In such a tough situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders but also running a clean Siachen Mission.
On behalf of the people of India, I express my appreciation and gratitude to the people of the country for this wonderful duty of the Indian Army.
It is difficult to make anything out of the harsh winter there.
In such a scenario, it is very important to develop and arrange garbage.
What kind of eco-system is there that lives of rare animals like snow leopard and rare animals like ibex and brown bears.
My dear countrymen, festivals are a time to create a new awareness in the lives of all of us.
Moreover, on Diwali, particularly to buy something new, and to bring something out of the market, there has been little in every family.
I had once said that we should try to buy local things.
What is the need to go to the local level if we get the necessary meaning in our village
What is the need to go to the district if there is one product in the block level
The more we try to buy local products, the more Gandhi 150 will automatically become a great opportunity.
I once again appeal to you people that we should buy some or the other thing from the clothes worn by our weavers and the clothes made by our weavers.
In addition to conveying my best wishes on Diwali, I also appeal to you people that we will be more interested in buying local products.
We have to realise how important we can make our contribution in fulfilling the dreams of Gandhiji.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of Diwali.
On Diwali, we kindle a variety of crackers.
But sometimes it burns because of our carelessness.
It hurts.
Therefore, while protecting you too, I urge you to celebrate and celebrate the festivals.
Best wishes on Deepavali in many ways.
Thank you very much.
He is always ready to express his happiness and support for our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1.25 billion people of India celebrated the Vijay Diwas of Paramparagat Parv.
We were reminded of the surgical strike in 2016. Our soldiers gave a strong counter-attack in the proxy war that was waged against our nation.
Our soldiers have organized exhibitions at various places in the country to show what our strength is for the citizens of the country, especially the youth.
Look how worthy we are, how our soldiers risk their lives and protect our countrymen.
One day, like Paramparagat, reminds the youth of the glorious heritage of our military forces.
And it inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in an event in Jodhpur, the brave land of Rajasthan.
It has now been decided that those who are striving to contribute to the peace and development of our country, our army will give them a strong response.
India has always been committed to peace and has been committed to it.
In the two world wars of the twentieth century, more than one lakh of our soldiers made their supreme sacrifice for peace, even if there was no link between those wars.
This is also an act of valour understood by our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Over the years, our brave soldiers have been wearing blue helmets and playing an important role in maintaining peace in the world.
My dear countrymen, things related to the sky will be different.
In this way, it is no surprise that the Indian Air Force has attracted the attention of every citizen of the country by displaying its might in the skies.
They have given us a sense of security.
In the run-up to the Independence Day Celebrations, the Air Force is one of the most eager and eager people to participate in the parade, in which our Air Force will showcase their might and prowess, with the incredible spirit of adventure.
We are celebrating Air Force Day on 8th October.
In 1932, when our Air Force, which had launched six pilots along with 19 Airmen in a small number, is today among the most courageous and energetic Air Force of the 21st century.
I convey my best wishes to all the air warriors and their families who have served the nation from the core of my heart.
In the year 1947, when the Pakistani army launched an unprecedented attack, our air force decided to protect Sri Nagar from the attackers, then landed the Indian military's weapons and ammunition on the battlefield at the right time.
In 1965, the Air Force responded strongly to the enemies.
Who would have known the struggle for Bangladesh's independence in 1971
In Tiger Hill, the enemy hiding places, all night bombarded them and covered their soil.
The nation is grateful to the Air Force for its proactive role in rescue and relief operations as well as in disaster response operations.
Their spirit of cooperation is so strong that we can overcome challenges such as storms, cyclones, floods and forest fires to our nation and our peoples.
The Air Force has set an example in creating gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of every sector for women.
Now, on the 15th of August this year, I had made an announcement from the Red Fort that women should join the Air Force, and that they should become permanent officers with short term work.
We can say with pride that the contribution of female power is increasing not only in terms of male power but also in terms of male power to the armed forces of India.
Women are empowered, but now they are becoming weapons.
My dear countrymen, in the past, a naval officer, AbhilashTomy, was struggling with life and death.
The entire country was concerned about how to save Tommy.
You know that Abhilash Tomy is a very courageous officer.
As an individual, he was the first Indian to travel on a small boat without any modern technological help.
For the past 80 days, he has been moving forward to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the south of the Indian Ocean without slowing its speed in the sea.
He was a wonderful example of courage, determination and bravery. A few days ago, when I brought the aspiration out of the sea, I had a telephone conversation with him.
I've already met Tommy.
I pray for the good health of AbhilashTomy, whose courage, courage and resolve, his determination to fight, will surely inspire our youth.
My dear countrymen, on the 2nd of October every child of the country knows what importance it holds for our country.
Another highlight of the event is 2nd October 2018.
Since then, on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we have organized several events all over the world.
Gandhijis thoughts have inspired the whole world.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another important work of a salutary brother, which the countrymen should know.
In 1941, Gandhiji began to write a few thoughts on the Constructive Programme, i.e.
Later, in 1945, when the struggle for independence was intensified, he prepared a set of those ideas.
He put forth his ideas to the countrymen on a range of subjects such as the welfare of the farmers, the villages and the workers, the protection of the rights, cleanliness and the spread of education.
This is also called Gandhi Charter.
Everyone has experienced this in the most unique form of his personality.
He instilled in every person the feeling that everyone is very important and important to the country.
His greatest contribution to the freedom struggle was to turn it into a mass struggle.
In the freedom struggle, every section of the society, every section of the society, had come forward to take up the challenge of Gandhiji.
There is a saying in it that: "I give you a shield, whenever you feel suspicious, whenever you feel suspicious, keep this measure as to whosoever is poor and weak, look at that person, remind him of his face, listen to your mind, ask him what kind of work you have to do, and what kind of benefit that person will benefit from it.
This will brighten everyone's life and future!
My dear countrymen, this shield of Gandhiji is equally important today.
Today, the rising middle class of the country, their increasing economic power, their purchasing power.
Even if we go to buy something, can we remember the grain for a moment?
Can you remember the fireman's protective armor?
May there be happiness in whose face
Who will benefit directly or indirectly from your purchase
If the poorest of the poor gets the benefit, then my happiness will become stronger.
Remembering Gandhi Jis mantra, when we all buy something in the days to come, when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, when we buy everything, and when we buy it, then it is good for any of our countrymen, especially those who have thought of making it, who have invested their money, who have sown their skills, all of them should get some kind of profit.
He could not even know how this would happen - but this happened and India got independence.
Just like this, today we can feel that how a big contribution can be made in the economic development of my country, in the economic empowerment of the poor, in the power to fight against their poverty.
But today this is the true patriotism, and I think this will be the karyanjali that we can offer to the farm.
He used to say that these are all very difficult and every thread of which must be used.
And it came to pass, that, behold, there was a snare of the country, and of the people of the land, and of the people of the land, and of the people of the land, and of the people of the land, which had a small figure.
We will celebrate Shastri ji's birth anniversary with a venerated brother two days later.
His words Jai Jawan Jai Kisan are the hallmark of his great personality.
As a result of his selfless service to the nation, in less than a year and a half, he was able to present the mantra of success to the soldiers and farmers of the country.
Crores of people joined this movement and I got the opportunity to serve the children of Ambedkar School in Delhi in cleanliness.
The foundation of that school was laid by respected Baba Saheb.
On the 15th of this month, all kinds of people from all over the country joined this service.
Organisations also made their contribution with great zeal.
School children, college students, NCC cadets, NSS, youth organisations, media persons, corporates etc., all have done a great job of cleanliness.
I express my heartfelt appreciation to all the countrymen who want cleanliness for their contribution.
Come on, let's hear a phone call.
But if you didn't call it a fortune after the construction of the toilets, then it could have been possible that the attention of the people associated with this movement could not be drawn to the people.
I express my special thanks to you.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in our country but in the entire world.
This time, India has been organising the world's largest Swachhta Conference in a historic way.
At the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC), health ministers and experts from all over the world are coming together to share their experiences and experiments related to cleanliness.
The closing ceremony of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October this year, on the occasion of the inauguration of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Anna Hazare.
The Constitution drafted by Babasaheb Ambedkar contains several provisions to protect the basic rights of the poor.
Inspired by this vision, NHRC was established on 12th October, 1993.
The Commission will complete 25 years in a few days from its inception.
It not only protects human rights but also enhances the dignity of human beings.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, the leader close to our hearts, used to say that human rights are not foreign principles for us.
The symbol of our National Human Rights Commission has been engraved with the motto Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah, which comes from time immemorial.
The Commission has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
This 25-year journey has created an atmosphere of hope and optimism among the countrymen.
It provides a platform for a healthy society to believe in better democratic values.
Today, along with the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions are also functioning.
As a society, we need to understand and practice the importance of human rights and this is the source of progress for all.
My dear countrymen, in the month of October, the birth centenary year of Jai Prakash Narayan ji and Rajmata Vijayraj ji is beginning.
All these great men have inspired us and we will remember them.
On the 31st of October, the birth anniversary of Sardar ji comes, and I will talk about it in detail in the next Mann Ki Baat, but today why do I want to mention about him today, that for the past few years, on the 31st of October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb is being celebrated in every small city, every village and every village of India.
This year too, we have to make efforts to organize a Run for Unity in our villages, neighborhood, cities and cities.
The movement for unity is the best way to think of Sardar Ji because he worked for the unity of the nation throughout his life.
I appeal to all of you that on the 31st of October, through the Run for Unity, we should strengthen our efforts to connect every section of the society, every unit of the country with the thread of unity, this will be a great tribute to him.
Mann Ki Baat: August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious day.
Raksha Bandhan is a celebration of love and faith between brothers and sisters.
This festival is also a great example of social harmony for centuries.
The country's history is full of stories that have connected two different regions or religions with the thread of faith of the people.
A few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is to come.
The entire atmosphere is filled with the sounds of the songs like elephant, horse, palanquin and Jai kanhiyalal gi, Gobinda - uinda govinda .
It is the joy of Sri Krishna's devotion.
Our youth is making preparations for Dahee-Handei in many parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami.
My heart is filled with thanks to sister Simai, who has put forward a great thing.
Friends, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, we are also celebrating the auspicious occasion of Chiravana Poornima.
I convey my best wishes to all those who are committed to further improving this great treasure and bringing it to the common man.
There is an importance for every language.
India is proud of Tamil language as the oldest language in the world.
Similarly, we all Indians are proud that from Vedic times to today, Sanskrit language has played a major role in spreading knowledge.
The treasure house of wisdom in every field of life lies in Sanskrit and its literature.
Be it science, technology, agriculture, well-being, astronomy, architecture, mathematics, management, economy or environment.
You will be happy to know that the people of Batur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit as the language of litigation.
There is a possibility of making 200 prefixes, 22 prefixes, i.e. subfix and an infinite word of society.
Therefore, it is possible to accurately describe any one sense or point of view.
Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, we always remember him.
On his birth anniversary, we celebrate Teachers Day across the country.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the occasion of Teachers Day.
At the same time, I convey my best wishes to the teachers for their dedication in science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, this monsoon has brought hope to our hard working farmers.
In some places, it is natural to receive even more rainfall than other places.
We all saw how badly the lives of people had been affected by the terrible floods in Kerala.
Even though we cannot fully compensate for their misery but I am confident that 1.25 billion Indians are standing shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of grief.
I pray that those injured recover at the earliest in this natural calamity.
Everyone is taking a pledge to reduce the difficulties faced by the people of Kerala and to share their sorrows.
We are well aware that the soldiers were the heroes of the rescue mission in Kerala.
They left no stone unturned to save the people trapped in the flood.
Air Force, Navy, Land Force, Border Security Force, Central Industrial Security Force and Rapid Army have played a major role in this mission.
Especially during this time, I would like to mention the hard work of the National Disaster Management Force (NDRF).
Yesterday itself, the festival of Onam was celebrated, and this festival of Onam should give strength to the nation, especially Kerala, and they should rise quickly from the impact of this disaster, and we should also appeal to all of us to speed up the development journey of Kerala.
Once again, I express my gratitude to all the countrymen, to the people of Kerala and to all the people affected by the disaster in the country. The entire country stands with you in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions for Mann Ki Baat.
I had to see what the people of the country have written a lot about - , That is, our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Keerthi from Ghaziabad, Swathi Vatsa from Sonipat, Pravin from Kerala, Dr.
Several people like Swapan Banerjee, Akhilesh Pandey from Kathihar in Bihar have appealed to me to speak on the diversity of Ataljis life in the form of Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov.
On the 16th of August, the nation and the world were saddened by the passing away of Atal ji.
He resigned from the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, he has been away from radical politics for the past decade.
He did not appear in the news, he lived away from public life.
Though the New Year is a big gap, the nation and the world have seen that this decade has not changed in the minds of common Indians since the 16th of August.
The love, pain and sadness that Atal ji had for him, these have added to the country's vastness.
In the last few days, Atal ji's great dimensions have been manifested in front of the country.
He was remembered and remembered as a Parliamentarian, an enlightened writer, a great orator and a peoples mind.
The nation will always be grateful to Atal ji for bringing good governance in the mainstream.
But today, I would like to touch upon one more dimension of Atal ji's broad personality and the political culture that Atal ji had given to India, his efforts to change it and his efforts to institutionalize it, will be of immense benefit to India in the coming days.
It's sure.
India will always be grateful for the 91st constitutional amendment in 2003.
This transformation brought about two significant changes in Indian politics.
First, the number of Ministers in the States should be only 15 of the total number of MPs.
Secondly, under the anti-party law, he increased the size of one-third of the previous membership to two-thirds.
At the same time, clear guidelines were laid down to ensure the dismissal of members of the party workers.
For decades, it has been the political culture that has formed a large body of ministries in India, which has been established not only to share the work but also to retain the political leaders.
Atal ji changed this situation.
His actions have resulted in savings of money and expenditure.
Further performance also improved.
This was possible only by a prophet like Atal ji. A healthy tradition began to flourish in our political culture.
Atal ji is a true patriot.
During his tenure, it was changed at the time of the presentation of the budget.
Earlier, as per the instructions of the British, the budget was presented at 5.00 pm.
In 2001, Atal ji shifted his budget from 5 p.m. to 11 a.m.
Similarly, today you can see that there is a discussion going on between the central government and the state governments at the same time.
On this occasion, I also pay my tributes to Atal ji on behalf of all of us.
When there is a discussion about the Parliament, it is being discussed about freezing, shouting and postponement of the House, but if something good happens then it is not much talked about.
A few days ago, the Monsoon Session of the Parliament concluded.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and that of Rajya Sabha was 74.
All the Members of Parliament tried to make the Monsoon Session of Parliament more productive than the difference between the parties which led to the passage of 21 Bills in Lok Sabha and 14 Bills in Rajya Sabha.
The Monsoon Session of the two Houses will be remembered for social justice and welfare of the youth.
During the Session, several important Bills pertaining to the welfare of youth, backward classes and communities were passed.
This process will help in achieving the objective of social justice.
The amendment to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Amendment) Bill, 2018 was also passed.
The Act will further protect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.
Moreover, to prevent the atrocities of those who commit crimes, hope in the minds of those who are brought down.
No civil society can tolerate injustice being done to women.
The nation is not prepared to tolerate those who commit sexual abuse.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill and imposed severe punishment.
You might have read a few days ago that a court in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh had tried the case within two months and had sentenced the girl to death for two of the accused who had been subjected to sexual abuse.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had completed the trial in just five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have given speedy disposal of such cases.
The Act will go a long way in preventing crimes against women and girls.
As we move forward in the interest of the nation, we can bring about a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
This time in the Monsoon Session, people came together to create a better model.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
Today, the attention of crores of countrymen has also been on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Watching peoples newspaper, television, news and social media for the first time every day is what Indian soldier has won.
The Asian Games are now being held.
I would like to congratulate all the players who have won medals for the country.
I also convey my best wishes to the players who are going to take part in the upcoming events.
India's players have made outstanding achievements, especially in the field of shooting, wrestling and wrestling but our sportspersons have been winning medals even in the most outstanding disciplines of the past, such as the Wushu Competition and the Boat Competition.
These are not merely medals but testimony to the hopes and dreams of Indias sports and sportspersons.
This is a very positive sign for our women as well as for the increasing number of medals for the country.
As such, our youngsters under the age of 15-16 are included in the medal winners.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
We all have seen the construction of houses and buildings with bricks but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago, the temple of Kailashnath in Ellora, Maharashtra, has been erected as a magnificent, wide and magnificent temple.
The land of India has been a testing ground for engineering.
There have been many engineers in India who have achieved something that could not be imagined and have provided examples of wonders in the engineering world.
Millions of farmers and common people are still benefitting from the Krishnaraj Sagar Dam built by him across the river Cauvery.
He is revered in these parts of the country as well as in the country as a mark of respect for him.
We observe 15th September as Engineers Day in his memory.
The way he was shown, the engineers of our country have made a mark for the entire world.
When we talk of the wonders of the engineering world, we recall an incident when a devastating earthquake struck Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
When I was working there as a volunteer servant, I got the opportunity to visit a village where I had to meet a old lady who crossed the age of 100 years.
He was making fun of me and called this park in my house, in Kutch area.
He added that this house has seen three earthquakes in my house.
I myself have suffered three earthquakes.
I understand them in the same house itself.
But there will be no impact anywhere.
It was my heart-to-heart that how the engineers of that period constructed buildings in accordance with the local conditions and how the people were able to live safely.
As we celebrate Engineers Day today, we must think for the future.
The world is being affected by natural disasters.
Let us meet in Mann Ki Baat, let us speak in Mann Ki Baat, let us take the country forward with our minds, let us be united.
With this spirit, my best wishes to all of you.
Thank you.
Let's meet again.
Mann Ki Baat: July 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
India's vastness, diversity, but sometimes it shows its diversity.
But why should we blame the rains
As a result, sometimes nature expresses its anger.
Therefore, it is our responsibility to be nature lovers, to protect nature and to preserve nature so that it automatically develops a discipline in the gifts of nature.
A few days ago, a natural calamity was such that it attracted the attention of the entire world and stirred the mankind.
It usually takes a few hours to enter the cave.
But that day's play was different.
After going a long distance inside the cave, suddenly the water stopped at the entrance of the cave as a result of the storm.
They stopped the exit route.
They stayed in the cave for 18 days, not two days, not a day, but on a small rock.
Just imagine how this small kid used to spend every moment while dying out of his eyes.
On the one hand, they were trapped in the vast majority, on the other, the entire human society was united and expressing the divine nature.
People from all over the world were praying for the safety of these children.
It is not that parents should not suffer, neither tears should flow in the eyes of the mother.
Across these difficult conditions, he showed so much courage and enthusiasm in a dark cave full of water, while the whole world was amazed by the fact that they did not let their hopes go down.
This incident tells us that when humanity is united, miracles are happening.
But there is a need for us to remain calm, stable and aim at it and work tirelessly.
A few days ago, the beloved poet of our country, Neeraj ji had left us all.
He has a special feature - faith, self-confidence and determination.
The months of July-August are months of great importance to farmers and youth.
Because these months they are the peak season for colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Sathyam are coming out of school and joining colleges.
For the months of February and March, examinations are for question and answer, but April-May are the months of holiday and are deciding the course of examinations, the course of life which should be taken, the job which should be done.
In July itself, the focus of the youth has shifted from questions to cut-off marks, a crucial period.
The attention of the students goes away from home and goes to the students' hostels.
The students stay away from the parents hut and join the campus of the professors.
I am confident that my young friends will be very excited about the beginning of college life.
It is for the first time that we leave our homes, leave our villages, leave a safe environment and start moving on our own.
For the first time, so many youngsters have come out of their homes and set a new direction for their lives.
Many students will join their colleges and some will join.
Whatever I want to say to you, be calm, enjoy your inner self completely in your life, there is no doubt that books are essential, it is important to read, while at the same time keep on looking for new things.
There is a special value for old friends.
It is a very wise thing to choose new friends at the same time, to practice, and to pursue friendship.
You can learn some new things, some new skills and new languages.
My best wishes to all the youngsters who have started a new game.
While talking about the college season, it was revealed that Asharam Chaudhary, a student from a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, has overcome the difficult challenges of life and has achieved success.
He has been selected in the first batch of medical course at AIIMS, Jodhpur.
His father worked as a sanitation worker and managed his family.
I convey my best wishes to him for his success.
How many such students of poor families have made their untiring efforts to overcome these difficult situations
Their achievements inspire us. Kushi's father from Nagpur is a driver in a school bus, Karthik's father from Haryana is a watchman, Ramesh Sahu's father works at Chingel Sulai in Jharkhand.
Likewise, Anushka Banda, a divyang girl from Gutka, has been affected by a fine muscular atrophy from her birth....
They are the ones who have broken the barriers of faith, and made the world look back.
If we look around, we will find many such examples.
For there is a good thing in every corner of the land, which fills my heart with energy, and gives me inspiration:
While talking about such youth, I am bringing to your notice about Neeraj ji, that is the meaning of life.
I wish to listen to the song of Neeraj ji's poetry. I wish to illuminate the entire world. I want to remove the atrocities of the people from the flowers.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes went on a news item and it was written that two youngsters had fulfilled Modi's dream.
While studying it further, it has been understood that today our youth is trying to bring about a change in the lives of the common man by using technology intelligently and positively.
I was interacting with Indian youth in San Jose, the city of America, once known as the centre of technology.
I had urged them to think about how they can use their skills for India.
I had made an appeal to you all about how your knowledge and skills could be used for the foreign countries.
Two IT experts from Raebareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji accepted my challenge and started a new initiative.
Using their skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji created an app called SmartGaon app and intelligent villages.
This app connects the villagers to the world and also enables them to access any information and information on their mobile phones.
The residents of Raebareli, Panchayat Chairperson, District Magistrate and District Collector have created awareness about the use of the app.
If you look closely at this event, then we have to keep in mind that these young people are living in America, living in the midst of their lifestyles and their feelings.Even if they had left India several years ago, they had understood their village very closely, they understood the challenges and were emotionally attached to their village.
This is the reason why we have been able to understand the needs of the village well and work accordingly.
There is a natural tendency within every Indian to do something for their country, to do something for their own country, to do something for their own village and their roots.
But sometimes this feeling is somewhat dim due to the compulsions of time, distances and circumstances, and if there is a spark in it, then this feeling immediately takes hold of them and draws them towards the past days.
Bandarpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before the Aadi Ekadash, pilgrims are going on a pilgrimage to Bandarpur with their teeth.
This is called Vaari, in which lakhs of devotees take part.
Dnyaneshwar Swamis and Dukaram Swamis are singing 'Vital-Dollal,' singing, singing, singing, singing, and dancing, and acting in the music of 'Paunderpur.'
Pilgrims get the opportunity to visit the place where they call it Vittoba or Pandurangan.
The Lord will protect the interests of the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
Devotees from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are full of devotion and devotion.
Going to the Vittoba temple in Bandarpur, its magnificence, beauty and spiritual bliss are all unique experiences.
I appeal to all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat that if you get the opportunity, you can experience the Pandharpur War once.
Many great sages like Gyaneshwar Swami, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas Swami, Tukaram Swami are still guiding the common people of Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against superstition and the tradition of these great men is giving inspiration to every corner of India.
We get a great message about the importance of song, song and dance, harmony, love and brotherhood.
Just as there was a great tradition of the great saints who had presented themselves at the feet of the Lord, similarly there were great men who had dedicated themselves at the feet of Mother India and they had brought their lives to her.
Such a great personality is Lokmanya Tilak who has made an indelible mark in the minds of many Indians.
On the 23rd of July, we mark the birth anniversary of Tilak ji, on the 1st of August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and self-confidence.
He was filled with the power and wisdom of pointing directly to the mistakes of the British rulers.
SardarVallabhbhai Patel was greatly impressed by Lokmanya Tilak.
On the occasion of Lokmanya Tilaks death on 1st August 1920, Patel resolved to build a memorial for him.
When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, he immediately selected Victoria Garden in the name of ueen Queen of the United Kingdom to establish the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
The British were aware of this act, so the ruler continued to refuse permission.
It is interesting to note that after Sardar Patel took over, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got a good human being but also got rice, which is why it is possible to build a statue of Tilakji.
My dear countrymen, the speciality of this statue is that it is a rare statue to see the statue of the Lord in which the statue of Lord Buddha is seated on a chair, and the statue of Lord Buddha is inscribed on it.
I am sharing with you the time spent by the British.
It was due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak that there was a tradition of celebrating social Ganesh Utsav.
From this we can understand that our ancient heritage and our brave heroes of history are still deeply attracted by our younger generation.
Today, in almost all the streets of many cities, we can see bows to the hero.
I also wish that there should be a separate competition in every city for the eco-system, where prizes should be given, and a wider publicity should be made about the atmosphere-friendly Ganesh Chaturthi between MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
I will definitely take your ideas to the people.
Every Indian, every goodness and the fruits of development should reach to him.
This will build a New India.
On the same day, 23rd July, 50 years after the birth of Tilak, another son of Mother India was born.
He dedicated his life to the cause of the countrymen to breathe the free air.
I am talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
No young person in India will be attracted to these inspiring words. - , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Chandrashekhar Azad's valor, freedom and resolve inspired many young people.
Azad risked his life but he did not bow to the foreign rule.
In Madhya Pradesh, I got the opportunity to visit Chandrashekhar Azad's village, Alirajpur.
Once again I express my heartfelt condolences to these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak and Chandrashekhar Azad.
Just a few days ago, at the 400-meter run in the World Athletics Championship in Finland, Hima Das, a veteran Indian farmer and daughter of a farmer has won a gold medal.
Ekta Biyan, another woman from the country, has e-mailed her letter from Indonesia, where she is now preparing for the Asian Games.
"I am extremely proud of the fact that at any point of time in the life of our bravehearts, it is a moment of great pride for me that I have done this thing by holding the tricolour on the global stage."
Once again, we are all proud of you.
You have made the nation proud.
In 2018, the Grand Finale of the World Cup for Persons with Disabilities (Tunisia) in 2018 won the Gold and Bronze medal in 2018.
His achievement is that he turned the challenge of disability into a means of success.
The road accident in 2003 led to the collapse of the body of Ekta Bhaiyan, but he did not lose heart, strengthened himself and achieved the desired goal.
A differently abled man, Yogesh Kathia, has won the Gold Medal in the Grand Finale at Berlin and Sunder Singh Gurjar has also won the Gold Medal in the tournament.
I salute Ekta Bhaiyan, Yogesh athuniaji, Sunder Singh ji and all of them for their self-confidence and selfless thirst and convey my best wishes.
You need to move further, play more, shit up.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is full of events and celebrations in the history, but sometimes due to the weather, diseases also keep stepping into their homes.
My best wishes to you all for the health and patriotism of all of you on this August, and for many festivals that have taken place through centuries.
Once again, we will definitely meet in Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat , June 2018
A few days ago, a historic cricket match took place in Bengaluru.
You all know that I refer to the Test Competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that this is the first international test match for Afghanistan and the historic test match for Afghanistan with India.
President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan also took me on the tag and said, The people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I express my gratitude to our friends in India for establishing a platform to showcase their talent.
Rashid represents the most outstanding aspects of Afghanistan.
This will be a memorable one for all.
I consider this as a special one for the first time, irrespective of whether it is a memorable one or the other.
The Indian team has done something for the whole world.
We can understand the character of the players from this event.
This shows that sports is a wonderful way to connect the world and to bring out the skills and talent of our youth.
My best wishes to both the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that in the future, similarly, we will be able to play and develop with each other in the spirit of sports.
My dear countrymen, on the 21st of June, when we celebrated the 4th International Day of Yoga, the whole world participated in it.
I am told that for the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic event for Yoga was organized in which a large number of women performed the asanas.
On the highest peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China have joined hands with Yoga.
And some of them that were in the Submarine, were in the ship also, and were in the ship, learning of yoga.
Similarly, some soldiers used to practice yoga at the snow-clad mountains of Siachen.
Our air warriors, in the middle, performed yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the ground and put everyone in awe.
What is to be noted is that they did not do it while they were sitting in the plane, they did it as they were floating in the air.
Yoga has been practiced everywhere - schools, colleges, offices, parks, high-rise buildings and playgrounds.
One scene of Ahmedabad touched the heart.
About 750 divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in one event and together they practiced yoga and gained global recognition.
Yoga has done the work of connecting all the people of the world without any restrictions on caste, religion and geography.We have lived for centuries with the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam or the Oneness of the World.
And more people will make it a part of their lives.
The memory of the doctors comes to us when there is a crisis.
But on this day, I express my gratitude to the doctors for their service, dedication and achievements.
Our doctors have carved a niche for themselves all over the world due to their skills.
While being skilled and hard-working in the medical sector, our doctors are well known for solving complex medical issues.
India is a rich country of history, such as a day or month, where there is no historical event.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on the 28th of this month.
You know why Kabirdas had gone to Maghar.
Sant Kabirdas Ji put emphasis on social harmony, peace and brotherhood through his verses, poems and poems.
This was his objective.
This is what we see in his work, and this is the same inspiration in today's world.
Listen to one of his sisters - Kabir, Soy Beer Hai, Joe Jeanne Burer, Joe Par beer, Na Janaki, So Kabeer, Man Beer.
Kabir had laid special emphasis on social harmony.
What does he mention in Doha?
There is sin where there is greed and shame.
He is also a Jadi na bhuchso saathu geeta, puchi ligie.
Do not ask the saints what their caste is, seek wisdom from them.
His appeal to the people is that instead of casteism, people should be accepted and respected with their wisdom.
His thoughts continue to affect us even today, in spite of centuries.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji used to say that the service done to the poor and the needy is a service to God.
Wherever he goes, there is a lot of work that he has done for social good.
Here, all the castes, all the sects, all the sects and all the sects can come and eat and Guru Nanak Devji had introduced the cooking system as Langar.
The year 2019 will mark the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
I want all of us to take part in it with enthusiasm and zeal.
The Indian Freedom Struggle is so long, wide, so deep and full of sacrifices.
There is another history associated with Punjab.
The 100th anniversary of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 2019 is a turning point in the efforts of the Government to malign humanity.
My dear countrymen, Raman Kumar from Rohini, Delhi, on the Narendra Modi App, on 6th July, Dr.
Raman, first of all I express my gratitude to you.
I am delighted to see your interest in India's history.
Syama Prasad Mookerjee on his Punya Tithi, which means on 23rd June.
In 1937, Dr.
It is also known to some that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore spoke in Bengali at the convocation of Kolkata University on the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
It is noteworthy that this was the first time that the British had addressed the convocation of Kolkata University in Bengali on the occasion of the convocation.
From 1947 to 1950 Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first industrial minister of the country of India. Rather, he laid the foundation stone of industrial development of India and if he had laid a strong foundation stone then it was not a miracle.
In the first industrial policy of independent India which was launched in 1948, an indelible mark of his thoughts and visions was revealed.
Dr.
Mukherjee's dream is to make India self-reliant in every sector and to make it self-reliant.
He wanted India to give full attention to the medium and small scale industries, industries, textiles and cottage industries while promoting big industries.
He set up the All India Handloom Board, All India Handloom Board, Khadi and Village Industries Board during the period 1948 to 1950 to provide financial and institutional support for holistic development of MSMEs.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee is his contribution.
He was passionate about the development of West Bengal.
It is due to his understanding, intelligence and constructive work that a large part of Bengal has been saved and is part of India.
In the last few weeks, I have had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video conference.
There was an opportunity to go beyond files and learn directly from them about the change in life.
When an ordinary man was aware of it... his simple words, his language, his episode, gave him a heart beat.
Women from remote villages are providing services from pension to passport to senior citizens in villages through the Common Service Centres.
In Chhattisgarh, one of the sisters has collected and produced and sold ceremonium.
Like Anjjan Prakash from Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are also running Jan Aushadhi Kendras, they are also going to the villages of nearby areas to deliver affordable medicines.
School children from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues like waste management in the Tinkering Lab at their early age.
In the whole event, I heard and felt the power of the country, the power of the dreams of a New India, the power of a New India, and the power of the resolve of a New India, more than the success of the government.
Instead, there are some people in the society who do not talk about disappointment, do not let their anger over inability, do not inspire hopelessness, do not seek the path of unity, do not seek the path of diversity.
In such a scenario, when the common man talks of events in his life with a new hope and a new enthusiasm, I do not think this as a tribute to the government and a victory to it.
The story of a small girl from a small village in far-flung areas has become an inspiration for 1.25 billion countrymen.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people joined this video bridge and you have given me a new energy.
Once again I would like to express my gratitude to all of you.
If we look around us, I have always seen that something good will definitely happen in our eyes anywhere.
There are people who understand good things.
We can also smell good.
In the past, one thing attracted my attention, it was a very unique combination.
On the one hand there are professionals and engineers while on the other hand there are farm brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
Farmers connected with it, worked on projects, made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Through this trust, experts and engineers trained the farmers on how to do organic farming and what crops can be grown along with one seed in the fields.
Today, they are not only producing vegetables but also selling their vegetables through this trust for a better price.The farmers who produce grains have also been associated with it.
I am glad that these youngsters, who are associated with the world of professionals, engineers and technicians have left their circle, joined the farmers, connected themselves to the villages and made their way to work together with the fields and crops.
Friends
Your youth is really inspiring for any young person.
The other youth of the country will definitely visit their websites and listen to their works closely. They will also get inspiration from how they can work in different sectors of the society in their respective areas.
One nation one tax has become a dream for all the countrymen and one nation one tax has been realized.
I would like to convey my appreciation to the States for implementing the same tax reform.
So far, 27 GST meetings have been held, people with a variety of political considerations, people from different states participate, and states with different priorities participate.
Before the implementation, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is being levied on this system.
The success of the GST currency is a celebration of currency measures.
On arrivals, the checkpoints have come to an end, the movement of goods is going on at a fast pace, which has resulted in time savings as well as substantial profit in the logistics sector.
Maybe the world's biggest tax reform.
In general, such a big reform, such a large country, as such a large population, was considered to take 5 to 7 years to complete it.
This is a big victory, and the 125 crore countrymen have achieved this success.
Best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat: May 2018
Hello.
Once again I got the opportunity to meet you all through Mann Ki Baat.
I think you all remember that a team of 6 women commanders of the Indian Navy has been on a sea trip for months.
They travel around 22,000 seas across different oceans and many seas.
This is the first time such a journey has taken place in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet these women gems and listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate them for their bravery, their valour and their outstanding work towards upholding the honour of the Navy and the importance of the nation. I once again congratulate them for proving that the women of India are no less than the world.
Who doesn't know the spirit of adventure.
Over the centuries, Everest has emerged as a challenge for mankind and has faced a challenge for the brave-hearts.
On May 16, a group of 5 tribal students from a Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhruve, Pramesh Ale, Umanand Madvi, Kavidas Kathmode, Vikas Soyam have climbed the highest peak of the world.
The students of Ashram School started their training in August 2017 in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youth were selected under the training programme of Shaurya Abhiyan.
As a token of their name, they made the nation proud on Everest.
My heartiest congratulations to the people of Chandrapur School and my young friends.
Similarly, a 16-year-old Indian girl from India, Shivangi Padak, has reached Everest peak from Nepal and is a young Indian woman.
Many congratulations to Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj ji and his daughter Diya will join the first father and daughter of India to reach Mount Everest.
It is not that some young people are climbing on Everest peak.
On the 19th of May, more than 50 years old Sangeetha Baghel ji climbed Mount Everest.
Some of those who climb the Everest show that they have the capability and the ability to climb the Everest.
In the last few days, under the Swachh Ganga Mission, a group of border guards climbed the Everest peak, but when they came down, they brought the garbage along with their hands.
This is commendable, but it highlights their efforts towards cleanliness and the environment.
For years, people have climbed Everest and many of them have won.
I heartily congratulate all the brave soldiers, especially the women.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, when I talked about Fit India two months ago, I could not imagine the response to it so much.
I didn't even think that people from all walks of life would support it.
When I talk about Fit India, I agree that the more we play, the more the country will play, the more it will play.
In the social media, people are sharing videos related to fitness Challenges, they are taking one another and challenging each other.
Today everyone is coming together with this Fit India movement.
Be it the film fraternity, sports persons or the common man of the country or be it the soldiers or be it the teachers of the school or be it our fitness in the neighbourhood, India too is committed.
I believe that getting rid of this challenge will not only help us keep ourselves fit but will also motivate others to develop fitness.
Savvy Yadav, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that sports played in the streets are a part of every child's life and today they are getting closer.
In particular, these games have been an important part of the summer holidays.
At the time of graduation, after dinner at night, without worrying about anything, children will play for hours together.
Some of these games witnessed the participation of the entire family.
The games ranged from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Kittypul, Bambaram, Koli, Icepai, thief police, Kannamochi, Go-koh.
Yes, they may have been called by different names at different places.
For example, the 7 Stones (7 Stones) in one part are known by various names like Lahore, Pittu, Sadolia, Diggory, Sadodia etc.
We can see the unity and diversity of our nation in these games.
One sport is being known in different names at different places.
I belong to the state of Gujarat, where I know about a game called Somal-Isto.
It is played in an 8 square board with a blade or poultice.
This has been played in almost all the states.
It is called 'Saukabara' in Karnataka, 'Atu' in Madhya Pradesh, which is called 'Bhagatali' in Kerala, 'Sampal' in Maharashtra, 'Thampal' in Tamil Nadu, and 'Sanga Po' in Rajasthan.
I don't know how to speak in every state language, but only after playing the game I came to know that we have played the game.
Is there any of us who don't run a lizard or a lizard?
It is known by various names in various parts of the country .
It is known as Kottibilla or Garabilla in Andhra Pradesh, Gulebari in Odisha and Vititalu in Maharashtra.
When everyone is in the air, when everyone is playing, we are able to express our unique qualities without any hesitation.
You can see that many children are angry but at the time of playing they become very active.
They express themselves, they appear deeply, and the childishness that is hidden within them is revealed.
Determination of goals, how to reach out to mind, how to develop team spirit and how to help each other.
I can see that these days we are using our traditional games to improve the overall governance and mutual skills in training programmes related to business management.
From children to the elders, when everyone is playing together, there is a gap in the generations to come, it disappears faintly.
At the same time, we are able to understand our culture and traditions.
Many sports create awareness about the society and the environment.
They can make animation films, play in the streets and in the streets, and see these games that seem strange to our new generation. They will also play and develop.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of June, India will officially host the World Environment Day Celebrations.
This time the theme is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I request all of you to understand the significance of this theme and take a decision to avoid the use of polythene and low quality plastics and try to minimize the negative impact of plastic pollution on nature, on wildlife and on our health.
Enter the WED-INDIA 2018, the World Environment Day website, where a lot of suggestions have been given in a very interesting way - see, know, and try to adapt them to your daily lives.
When there is a severe heat, when there is a flood, when there is no rain, when there is an unbearable cold, everyone becomes experts, talk about global warming, climate change, etc.
In the last few weeks, we have seen dust storms in many parts of the country and heavy rains as well. This is not a natural phenomenon.
This has led to the loss of lives.
All this is mainly the result of the change in the climate.
Our culture and our traditions have not taught us to fight against nature.
We must live in harmony with nature and be connected with nature.
Throughout his life, Gandhiji had put forward this thing at every step of his life.
We will not only plant trees but will also arrange for the maintenance of trees as long as it grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
Yoga for unity and a harmonious society has been the message that the world has once again experienced for the past few years.
Yoga helps to create a mind-set by practicing Yoga and it always protects us like a father.
For instance, it is like a mother in a child, and mental peace becomes our enduring friend.
With the continuous practice of yoga, mouth becomes our children, mother becomes our sister, mind is our brother, earth is our bed, knowledge is our hunger.
If all these qualities are the friends of a person, then the yogi puts an end to all kinds of fears.
I once again appeal to all the countrymen to take forward the tradition of yoga and to build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is the 27th of May, the birth anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Panditji.
He is the hero and hero in May this month.
In 1857, during the same month of May, our countrymen displayed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers have gathered together against injustice and have displayed their valour.
The sad thing is that for a long time, they used to call the events of 1857 as riots or the mutiny of soldiers.
In fact, it is not just an attempt to reduce that event but it is an attempt to malign our self-respect and self-respect.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote without any fear that the year 1857 was not just a riot, but the first war of independence.
Several freedom fighters along with Savarkar celebrated their 50th anniversary at the India House in London.
He is an expert in handling both arms and weapons.
We generally thank Veer Savarkar for his valor and his struggle against British imperialism.
But apart from all this, he has always been a great poet, social reformer and a great social reformer.
I remember how our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji used to say about Savarkar ji.
He was not only an enlightened poet but also a courageous revolutionary.
Best wishes for the bright future of our daughters, who are full of hopes and aspirations.
If you are determined to achieve something then you will be able to achieve it by overcoming all the obstacles.
T from the slums of Cuttack, Odisha, is the story of some people who have dedicated themselves to fulfilling the dreams of others as their own.
Prakash Rao was theirs.
You will be surprised to know that today, an ordinary person selling tea is lighting lamps in the lives of more than 70 children.
It provides all facilities like education, health and food to all school going children.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his untiring efforts, his dedication and direction in the lives of the poor children.
He has removed the darkness in their lives.
Who knows not the scripture, Tamso, or Ma Jyotirgamah?
But if there's a person who has done that, he's T.
His life is an ideal for all of us, for society and for the entire country.
There may be such inspiring stories around you.
In a few days from now, we will be waiting for the arrival of the postman.
I hope that all of you will celebrate this great day with great enthusiasm and this time a great reward will be given to the children.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries, including India, participated in this event.
How many arrangements have been made, when thousands of players from all over the world take part, then imagine what kind of atmosphere is there.
Encouragement, expectation, encouragement, desire, aspiration and determination can there be a situation where one who is not affected by this
India has achieved an unprecedented feat.
The award of medals is a matter of pride for the soldiers, but it is a moment of pride for all the citizens of the country.
Enthusiasm and enthusiasm are inspiring.
We are all connected together with the same spirit.
I have no words to express this feeling.
But I want to share with you the things that these players have told me.
What is special is that for the first time many things have happened in this regard.
This time, all the Indian contingents have won medals at the Commonwealth Games.
Manika Batra has won medals in all the games she played.
She was the first Indian woman to win a gold medal in the Table Tennis Championships.
India won a high gold medal in the shooting event.
Sachin Chaudhary won the medal in the Commonwealth Games and India's only Para Power Lifter.
And why the competition was so special this time that most of the winners were women.
Women players have excelled in sports, be it a gun, a gun, a gun, a gun, or a gun.
The final match between the two Indian heroes - Saina Nehwal and B.
V.
It took place between Sindhu and Sindhu.
I was asking you to join Fit India and come to leadership.
I am happy that the people have been associated with it with a lot of enthusiasm.
Many people have written letters expressing their support for this, sharing important issues related to their fitness and Fit India information on social media.
Sasikanth Bonsley shared the film he took in a swimming pool, and wrote that my body is my weapon, water is my separation, my world is swimming.
Do you know what Ruma Devnath has written? After the morning walk, I feel happy and healthy.
For me, fitness is a combination of smile. When we are happy, we have to smile.
After seeing all this, it is good to see that many famous people are also inspiring our youth in very interesting ways for Fit India.
The film star Akshay Kumar has given a video in a tweet.
His other video has become more popular, in which he is playing with the people.
Many youngsters are connecting with the Fit India efforts and sharing their experiences.
Not only this, try to connect with your city, your village, your area, your school, your college, every age group, men and women with Yoga.
You will be deeply impressed by how to enjoy holidays, where to go.
I invite you to work a new term today:
I can see that many youngsters are spending their time learning something new.
The importance of summer training is increasing and the youth are also engaged in exploring this, so training is a new experience.
Outside the four walls, one gets the experience of living in a new dimension by crossing the written work and computer.
My young friends, I urge you to do a great training.
The three Ministries of the Government of India - Sports, Human Resource Development, Drinking Water and Sanitation - have jointly organized the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
You can visit MyGov portal and register to participate in the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I believe that our youth will take this mission forward for cleanliness further.
You must send your information, you must send photos and videos.
Come on!
We will get a chance to learn from this holiday, to experience a new experience.
Just a few days ago, the youth of Delhi was showing something about some of them in India and they were working on providing education to the poor children.
These young people have stepped up a massive campaign of providing education to the street children of Delhi and children living in slums.
They started this innovative work because the condition of the children sitting in the street or working in the street.
This campaign, which started with 15 children in the slums near Geeta Colony in Delhi, is connecting 2000 children in 12 places in the capital today.
The youth, teachers and those associated with this movement have been working round the clock in their daily schedule for these people and they are working round the clock to bring about a change in the society.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become an inspiration for the farmers of the country.
Due to their collective efforts, they not only enriched their position but also the future of their region.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, in particular, crops such as oats, cucumbers, corn and parley are grown.
Due to hilly terrain, the farmers were unable to get the right price.
They formed a cooperative in Munnar village, where they built a factory to prepare biscuits.
Keeping in mind the farmers sentiments, the administration has linked it with the National Rural Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are being included not only in about 50 Anganwadi Centres of Bageshwar district but also in Almora and Kausani.
Due to the hard work of the farmers, not only the annual income of the organization has reached 10-15 lakh rupees but it has also created employment for more than 900 families and people have also stopped coming out of the district.
Everyone talks about it but is it not our duty
Don't we think that water conservation is the responsibility of the society
It should also be the responsibility of every individual.
How can we save every drop of water in the rainy season
Our ancestors have done this thing for centuries.
They have given priority to the importance of every drop of water.
They have come up with innovative ways to find out how to save every drop of water.
If one of you had the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu, you would have noticed that some of the temples have great inscriptions related to water conservation, water harvesting and drought management.
Large inscriptions are found everywhere, like Cheranama Devi, Mandirpatti, Pudukottai etc.
Let us not forget that today, many of the learning centres are known as tourist destinations, which are living examples of our ancestors in the water conservation mission.
Adalaj in Gujarat and Rani Keiav in Patan have been declared as a world heritage site in the education, science and culture of the United Nations, which can be viewed with their excellence.
In the months of April, May, June and July, we have the best opportunity to save the rainy season, as much as we are ready in advance.
The budget of MGNREGA is being spent on water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, everyone has been making their own efforts in the direction of water conservation and water management.
An average expenditure of Rs 32,000 crore has been incurred on water conservation and water management, over and above the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme every year.
Talking about the year 2017-18, out of Rs 64,000 crore spent, about 55 was spent on water conservation and water management, which is about Rs 35,000 crore.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefited by such water conservation and water management works.
The 7000 people working under this project have worked hard in seventy days and have revived the Kuttapur river of Kerala.
Ganga and Yamuna are water-laden rivers, but in some parts of Uttar Pradesh, for example in Fatehpur district, two rivers Sasur and Kadri have dried up.
The district administration faced a huge challenge in land and water conservation activities under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.
With the help of about 40-45 villagers, these drought-hit Susur-Kaderi rivers were revived.
Have you seen the success of a grand project - be it a bird or a farmer or be it a farmer or be it a village
May, June and July are coming, and I once again request you to take some responsibilities towards water conservation and water management and we will also do some projects and we will do something.
My dear countrymen, before Mann Ki Baat, I receive messages from all sides, letters and phone calls.
Ayyan Kumar Banerjee from Devodola village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal has written a comment on MyGov. While we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year, many people did not know the philosophy of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore's Peaceful, Beautiful and Eternal Life.
Please discuss this matter in Mann Ki Baat programme so that people can get a chance to know about it.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was a perfect embodiment of wisdom and wisdom, and his writings had an indelible impression on the minds of all.
Rabindranath Tagore is intelligent, multi-faceted, but we can experience that every moment a teacher was alive inside him.
He, who has the knowledge as the responsibility to impact it to the students, is responsible for teaching the same to the students.
I am not a Bengali, but I used to wake up early in the morning in my childhood and in Eastern India, radio broadcasts will start fast and in Western India it will start late.
When one gets an opportunity to hear these poems, Anandloke, Akuner, Boroshmoni, there will be a great inspiration in the mind.
Rabindra Sangeet and his poems must have lived here.
My dear countrymen, the holy month of Ramzan is going to start in a few days.
The month of Ramadan is being celebrated with great difficulty and with great respect throughout the world.
On the social side of Nun, it is said that when a person is hungry, he feels hungry and if he is thirsty, it is the feeling of thirst for others.
This is an occasion to remember the message and message of the Prophet Muhammad.
The lesson we learn from his life is to walk on the path of equality and fraternity.
Once a man asked the prophet about what he was doing in Islam, he said.
The envoys who presented their credentials were: - 1. Food for the poor and the needy - Whether we know, or do not know them - 1.
His Highness the Prophet believed in wisdom and compassion.
If you have something more than your requirement, then give it to the person you need, said Prophet Nabi, the prophet, and that is why the gift in the month of Ramzan has been given a lot of importance.
People are donating their lives to the poor on this holy month.
The prophets of the prophets say that no man is rich because of his pure soul, but because of his wealth.
Lord Buddha is an inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Baba Saheb provided energy to crores of people on the brink of subjugation through the constitution, be it the victims or be it the oppressed or the deprived section of the society.
There can be no better example for compassion than this.
Lord Buddha was one of the greatest qualities of renunciation and renunciation of people.
In many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, the Buddhist tradition is connected with the roots of Buddha.
This is the reason why we have been developing Buddhist tourism infrastructure, which connects the important places of South-East Asia with the best Buddhist destinations in India.
Today, there are conflicts and sorrows everywhere in the world and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to dispel hatred and compassion.
I convey my best wishes to all those who believe in the teachings of Lord Buddha and those who believe in the principles of compassion and respect for Lord Buddha spread all over the world.
I seek blessings from Lord Buddha for the entire world so that we can fulfil our responsibility of building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
You must have heard of the images of Laughing Buddha when you talk about them, it is said that this smiling Buddha would have been blessed, but very few people know that Lord Buddha is associated with an important event in the security history of India.
You can imagine the connection between Buddha and Indian soldiers.
The Indian diaspora around the world has given a new confidence to them.
That day is a Buddha Purnima.
On 11 May 1998, India conducted a nuclear test at Pokhran, Rajasthan on its western border.
In a way, India has demonstrated its strength in the field of science and technology.
That day is the day when the power of our armies was engraved in gold in the history of India.
Lord Buddha showed the power of Antarma as a necessity for peace.
Similarly, if we are strong as a nation today, we can be peaceful with all.
It was on this day that we declared to the world that India, under the leadership of the great scientist, was able to achieve new goals and peaks every day.
We can see that the journey which Atal ji had started, the new happiness that will take forward, and the new happiness that will take place in front of us.
My dear countrymen, we can once again join Mann Ki Baat and talk about many other things.
Mann Ki Baat: March 2018
Today is the day of Ram Navami.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious day.
We could see the power of 'Ram Ram' in the life of a venerated brother at every moment of his life.
On the 26th of January, all the leaders of ASEAN countries came here and brought a cultural group along with them.
It is a matter of great pride that most countries have presented Ramayana before us all.
That is, Rama and Ramayan are equally inspiring and affecting not only India but also the ASEAN countries in this region of the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, like every time, all of you have received letters, emails, telephones and ideas in a big way.
You have heard of Komal Thakkar, who has started working online on MyGov, and have read it.
It is a pleasure to be with the computers and also to see their inspiration for Sanskrit.
I have asked the concerned departments to inform them about the efforts being made in this regard.
I appeal to all those who are associated with the work related to the culture to listen to Mann Ki Baat, to advise on how to implement the idea of Komal Ji.
Kansyam Kumar from Barar village of Nalanda district (B), Bihar, I read the comments they wrote on the Narendra Modi App.
You have expressed concern over the decline in ground water levels, and this is certainly a matter of great importance.
You have also requested animals and birds to keep drinking water during the summer.
Shakalji, I convey your feelings to all the lovers.
He has requested the youth of the country to ask about the health of the person.
He feels that our youth are physically weak compared to Asian countries.
Yogi ji, this time I want to talk about health in detail with everyone - about a healthy India.
All of you, the youth, can join hands and carry out a campaign related to a healthy India.
During the visit of the President of France to our country last days, the visit of President of France to Kashi has touched my heart and has touched my heart, said Prashant Kumar of Varanasi.
I would urge you to please click the link, re-tweet them, and also bring them to your friends.
In the background of my book 'Exam Warriors', Anna, Jayesh and many children from Chennai, they have written to me their thoughts on the gratuity cards.
I would like to tell Anaka, Jayesh and all the children that as soon as I saw your letters, all the fatigue of that day disappeared as the snow.
So many letters, so many phone calls and comments I could read from, so many of them are touching my heart.
If we want to talk about these things only then I will have to say these things for months.
This time most of the letters have been written by the children and they have written about the examinations.
They are sharing their holiday plans.
In the summer, concerns have been raised about water for animals and birds.
A letter has been received from the farmer brothers and sisters about the farmer's festivals and activities in the entire country related to agriculture.
Some citizens have had positive suggestions on water conservation.
During festivals, our festivals, our cultures, and our traditions go hand in hand with each other.
It means that things of the mind get changed according to the weather and the fact is that our Mann Ki Baat has changed the weather of life for many.
Why not change
In these matters of yours, in your experiences and in these examples, there is so much inspiration, so much energy, so much harmony, and the desire to do something good for the nation.
These include the power to change the environment of the entire nation.
When I got the opportunity to read your letters, I came to know how Ahmad Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karimganj district of Assam, had set up 9 schools to teach poor children with his deepest wish.
Because of lack of timely treatment 13 years ago, a taxi driver from Kolkata, Saitul Laskar's sister dies.
He resolved to set up a hospital in his mind so that no poor person should die due to inability to come to the treatment.
In order to achieve this goal, he sold all the jewels from his house and donated money.
Many of the passengers traveling in his taxi made a generous donation.
An engineer sister donated her first month's salary.
In this way, 12 years later, after collecting money, Saitul Laskar made a tremendous effort.
Today, because of his hard work and commitment, a 30-bedded hospital is being built at Punni village near Kolkata.
Many such inspiring sources are now becoming familiar and symbolic of my country.
Today, when we take the name of India with great respect, the wonderful works of Mother India are behind it.
Today, this belief has arisen in everyone's heart, in the youth, in women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class and in the middle class.
We can progress, our country can progress.
An atmosphere of self-confidence and optimism has been created.
This self-confidence, this positive sentiment will fulfill our dream of a New India and will further strengthen our resolve.
My dear countrymen, the coming months will be of great importance to our farmer brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why a lot of letters have been received related to agriculture.
This time when I have been watching the video of discussion with the farmers on the Kisan Channel for the farmers of Doordarshan, I feel that every farmer should associate himself with the DD Kisan channel, and he should see that he should implement the same in his fields.
Whether it be Gandhi ji or Lal Bahadur Shastri ji or Lohia ji or Chaudhary Charan Singh ji or Chaudhary Devi ji, everyone has considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and the lives of the people.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji too often talks about the importance of tree, plant and plant protection and better agricultural system.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has said that to ensure better income for our farmers, better irrigation facilities and increase the production of food and milk should create greater public awareness.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh urged the farmers to use new technology and innovate, and stressed on the need of the hour.
Recently, I had visited the Krishi Vikas Mela in Delhi.
While talking to our farmer brothers and sisters, scientists there, I had a pleasant experience in knowing about the experiences related to agriculture, understanding the experiences related to agriculture and the innovations related to agriculture.
But the thing that had a major impact on me was the hard work of Meghalaya and the farmers there.
This low land area has done a great job.
In 2015-16, our farmers of Meghalaya have achieved a record production in comparison to the last five years.
If the goal is set, if it is inspired, if the resolve is deep then it can be achieved and it has been achieved.
Today, technology is also helping the farmers in their hard work and that is why farmers are getting a lot of strength.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a major decision has been taken to provide fair price for the farmers.
Besides, the work on agricultural marketing reform in the country is progressing at a rapid pace to ensure that the farmers get the right price for their produce.
Efforts are being made to connect regional markets and wholesale markets in the village to the world market.
The APMC and e-NAM platform will be integrated on a pan-India basis with 22,000 rural markets, where farmers do not have much distance to sell their produce.
That is, in a way, such a system is being developed from the farm to any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
How should the nation celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our resolve. In addition to this, 1.25 billion people of the country can come together shoulder to shoulder and pay their respects to Gandhiji in the most excellent manner.
Can we organize new events
Can we develop new ways
I appeal to all of you to share your thoughts on this issue through MyGov.
What could be the sign of 'Gandhi 150'
What can the slogan be?
Please write to me your views on this.
Today, the country has crossed the routine approach in the field of health.
All the work related to health in the country has been done by the Health Ministry in the past, but now all the departments and ministries - be it the Ministry of Health, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Women and Child Development or State Governments - have been working together for a healthy India.
Preventive health is not only cost effective but also simple.
The more we are aware of preventive health, the better it is for the individual, the more for the family and the society.
Cleanliness is the first requirement of life to be healthy.
We are also committed to be a nation, and as a result, health care has doubled to nearly 80 in the last four years.
In addition, extensive work is being done in the direction of setting up of health centres across the country.
Yoga has made a mark in the entire world with a new energy in the form of preventive healthcare.
Yoga ensures physical fitness and health.
This is the result of the efforts made by us that today Yoga has become a mass movement and it is present in every house.
Less than 100 days left for the upcoming International Day of Yoga on 21st June.
In the last 3 International Yoga Day, people from all over the country and around the world participated with great enthusiasm.
This time also, we will ensure that we keep on practicing Yoga with our family and friends.
It should be further popularized in all age groups such as children, youth and senior citizens by adopting new interesting ways.
In fact, TVs and electronic programs all over the country are providing various programs related to yoga throughout the year.
But can we create awareness about Yoga as a mission from now on to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a yogi.
But some people have turned me into a Yoga practitioner by their creativity and I have created 3D videos like Yoga training.
Efforts are being made at large scale to make healthcare accessible and affordable to all.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras are being opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
More new centres are being opened.
I appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat that you must bring the information about Jan Aushadhi Kendras to the needy people.
This will be a great service to them.
Heart stent rates have been reduced to 85 percent for heart patients.
The rates for knee implants have also been fixed and have been reduced to 50-70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families i.e. about 50 crore citizens will be treated and about 5 lakh rupees will be spent for the family in one year.
The number of medical seats in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
New AIIMS hospitals will be opened in many states to ensure better treatment and health facilities to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts.
By 2025, the country has set a target of getting rid of TB.
Today, Make in India and Make in India mission has been successfully implemented in the country.
On that day, Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt of India as an industrial power. His vision today inspires all of us.
Today, India is emerging as a bright spot in the world economy and the largest FDI destination in the world is coming to India.
The world is looking at India as a hub for investment, innovation and growth.
Baba Saheb had a firm belief in self-reliance.
He did not want any person to spend his time in poverty.
Moreover, he did not think that their poverty would be removed if something had been distributed to the poor.
Today, MUDRA Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India initiatives, innovators, entrepreneurs and youngsters from our youth have come up.
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports of the country.
New ports are being built on various coasts of India and the infrastructure of the old ports is being strengthened.
Most of the discussions in the 40 were around the World War II, the emerging Cold War and the partition of the country.
During that period, Dr. Ambedkar on the one hand laid the foundation for the spirit of Team India.
He spoke of the importance of Federalism, and stressed on the need for Centre and State Governments to work together for the progress of the nation.
Today we have adopted the mantra of Competitive Federalism - Competitive Federalism - Competitive Federalism on all aspects of governance.
And most importantly, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar has been an inspiration for crores of people like me in the backward classes.
He has shown all of us that there is no need to be born in a big family or a Seeman family for progress and the dreams of those born in poor families of India can be realized and efforts can be made to fulfil those dreams.
But the painting of New India is completely different.
I request you all to participate in this movement with great enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, in the next few days, there will be festivals like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi.
It is a day to remember the Jayanti of Lord Mahavira, his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavira who gave us the message of Ahimsa will inspire all of us.
Greetings on Mahavir Jayanti.
As soon as we talk about Easter, I remember the inspiration of Lord Jesus Christ and his message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and kindness are always there.
In April the festival of Baisakhi is celebrated in Punjab and western India .
On the same day, the festival of Judgment and Satuwain in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and Poila Baisa in West Bengal are celebrated with great happiness and joy.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for all the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat in February 2018
Today I am starting Mann Ki Baat with a phone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions about science, some have written letters.
Even if the sea is blue, we all know that there is no colour in the sea due to our daily experience.
Have we ever thought that why do you look like a river or a sea?
The same question arose in the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This question has created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk of modern science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
The name of Satyendranath Bose has been given to his well-known microbe, which is called Boson.
A few days ago, I had attended the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Mumbai.
It is interesting to know about the wonders being done in the field of science.
This artificial intelligence is helping in the development of robots, (B) machines and equipment for carrying out specific operations.
Today, machines are making their intelligence more robust through machines.
This technology can make the lives of the poor and the poor better.
In this programme related to Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists to think about how AI can be helpful in making the lives of our Divyang sisters and brothers easier.
Can we learn more about the occurrence of natural disasters through Artificial Intelligence
Can we help the farmers in their crops
Can Artificial Intelligence help us track and detect diseases using modern methods of healthcare
A few days ago, I had gone with the Prime Minister of Israel to inaugurate the I-Create Project in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young man who had developed a digital device.
He said that if those who are unable to speak, write about what they want to speak through this device, then the device changes it into a voice, just as it does when they talk to each other.
I think we can use artificial intelligence in such ways.
Science and Technology is of a neutral value.
There is no self-esteem for this.
No machine will work as we wish.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered a light bulb, had failed in many of his experiments.
Once he was asked about this, he said, I have found 10,000 ways in which I cant produce a light bulb.
That is, Edison has changed his failures into his own force.
Today, it is not only a coincidence that I am in Auroville, the land of Maharshi Aravind, but also of mine.
As a revolutionary, he challenged British imperialism, fought against them, and raised many questions against their rule.
As a great rishi, he questioned every aspect of life.
He also found out the answers and showed the way to the human society.
The sense of knowing the truth and asking questions again and again is important.
This is also the true spirit behind the quest of the scientists.
Why dont you live until you know what, how and how many questions.
My best wishes to our scientists and all those associated with science on National Science Day.
Ravindra Singh from Pune has written on the NarendraModi App on Occupational Safety.
He said that safety standards are not so good in factories and construction sites in our country.
In his Mann Ki Baat address to the Prime Minister on the occasion of National Security Day on 4th March 2020, the Prime Minister has appealed to the people to spread awareness about the safety and security.
While we talk of public safety, two things are very important - one being vigilant and the other being prepared.
Security is two-way, one is important in times of disasters and the other is essential in everyday life.
It is difficult to achieve this in times of disasters if we are not aware of the safety and security of our day-to-day lives.
Beyond this, these sentences do not have much use in our lives.
When we look at natural disasters, most of the losses are due to some mistake.
If we become aware and follow the necessary rules, we will be able to save our lives and protect our society from the greatest dangers.
We may have seen that many sentences have been written on security in our workplaces, but we have also seen that they are not correct.
I urge the Municipal Corporations, Municipal Corporations, who have firepower, to train them in schools once in a week or once in a month.
There are many natural disasters in this country, and the chemical and industrial man-made disasters that we have experienced.
Today, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is leading the country in the field of disaster management.
Volunteers have been trained and named as risk-keepers in flood-prone districts.
Till 2-3 years ago, thousands of lives were lost due to the heat wave.
Thereafter, NDMA organized training workshops on heat wave protection and mass awareness campaigns.
The contribution of all was a good result.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat wave decreased to about 220 as compared to what was expected.
If we give priority to security, it shows that we can be safe.
We have to become a risk-driven society.
We have been on a multi-faceted plane and have been providing security related notes at the beginning of our flight.
Well, was there a way of reporting?
This is our experience in every field of life.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, under the Swachh Bharat Mission, emphasis has been laid on wealth from waste to wealth and waste to energy in the villages.
The initiative taken for this purpose has been named as GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources i.e.
The purpose of the Gobar-Dhan program is to clean the villages, to make the animal dung and crop residues in the fields as well as to make them into solid and natural gas, thereby generating wealth and energy.
Some European countries and China are using animal dung and bio-waste for energy production.
But India is not fully engaged in this field.
Now we are progressing in this direction under the rural scheme of Swachh Bharat Mission.
It has been decided to improve the production of natural energy through animal dung, agricultural waste and kitchen waste.
Under the Gobar-Dhan scheme, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India should be encouraged and seen as a source of wealth and wealth without merely looking at the waste and dung.
There will be possibility of new employment opportunities in the areas of waste collection, transportation and sale of natural gas.
A web-based online trading platform will be set up to effectively implement the Cobar-Dhan scheme, connecting farmers with buyers and help them get the right price for their crops.
My dear countrymen, till date we have been hearing about some kind of festivals like music festival, food festival and film festival.
But a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh where the first garbage festival of the state was organized.
Inspired by Raipur, other districts also organized garbage festivals for their participation.
Everybody shared innovative ideas related to cleanliness in their own way, held discussions, arranged museums.
A festive atmosphere was at the centre of cleanliness.
It is a wonderful thing, especially school children took part in it with great enthusiasm.
I congratulate the Municipal Corporation of Raipur, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the administration of the state and the people of Chhattisgarh for organizing this festival in a very innovative manner.
Every year we celebrate 8th March as International Womens Day.
Several events are being organized in our country as well as around the world on this occasion.
The Nari Shakti Puraskar is conferred on women who have done exemplary work in various fields over the past few days.
Today, the country is moving in the direction of women-led progress, beyond women's progress.
I am reminded of Swami Vivekanandas words on this occasion.
Today, it is the duty of all of us to ensure that the contribution of women in every field of social and economic conditions is equal.
Today, our women power is displaying self-confidence and self-confidence in its work.
It is our dream of a New India where women are powerful and sharers of all round development of the country.
Starting from 26th January this year, in just 20 days, these women have constructed 1.77 lakh toilets and have set an example, including about one lakh women groups.
The women of Jharkhand have proved that they have the ability to convert this into the nature of the common man by strengthening the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and the cleanliness culture in the lives of the common man.
Brothers and sisters, Two days ago I came to know about the news that how happy they had been about electricity in three villages of Elephanta island after 70 years of independence.
I was surprised to know that despite being such a prominent tourist destination, even in Mumbai, electricity has not reached there for so many years after independence.
For 70 years, in the 3 villages of the island of Elephanta - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sendbandar - darkness was removed from the lives of people in the dark.
My best wishes to the administration and the people there.
Say what could be a better time to illuminate the lives of the countrymen and to bring happiness and happiness to their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, Just a few days ago, we celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
The month of March is the lush green fields, the macabres that enhance the beauty and comfort of the moving crops, these are the specialities of this month.
At the same time, the festival of Holi, which is coming this month, is also close to our heart.
On 2nd March, the festival of Holi will be celebrated with great fanfare across the country.
On the occasion of Holi, the importance of colours, the importance of Holi is also important because on this day, we are burning all the evils in the fire.
This is an auspicious time for us to forget all the differences and participate in the happiness of each other and to advance the unity and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Prakash Tripathi ji has written a long letter on the Narendra Modi App asking me to talk about all the things in it.
Kalpana Chawla died on February 1, 2018.
Though today they are not with us because of the Columbia space shuttle mishap, they have inspired the youth of the world.
In this way, I express my gratitude to Prakash Ji for his letter on the occasion of the death anniversary of Kalpana Chawla.
It is a matter of great sorrow for all of us that at such a young age, Kalpana Chawla has lost her life, but she has left a message across the world, especially to thousands of women of India, that there is no limit to female power.
It is a matter of great happiness that today women in India are making rapid strides in every field and are upholding the pride of the nation.
The world is astonished by the fact that the respect for women in our country, their contribution to the society, and their contribution has made the world astonished.
This speaks at length about the importance given to women in our society.
That's why they have given the status of women power in our society!
It is a testimony to the fact that women power has always inspired us and has brought glory to the nation's dignity, the power of Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee, the wisdom of Akka Mahadevi, Mirabai, the power of Ahilyabai Holkar, the power of Rani Lakshmibai, the power of the Lord which had been revealed to us at the end of the Vedic times.
Prakash Tripathi has given many more examples.
Our Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the spirit of adventure in the fighter aircraft Su-30 and the Indian Navy's women crew at INSV Tarini, led by Vartika Joshi, that is on a world tour.
Three brave women like Bhavana Khana, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become fighter pilots and are undergoing training on Sukoy 30.
You're absolutely right.
Today, women are not only progressing in all spheres but are also leading the way.
Today, for the first time in many fields, women's power is gaining record and is establishing a milestone.
In the past, the Honble President took up a new initiative.
In their respective fields, the President met a group of exceptional women achievers.
These women achievers of the country like the first female captain of the merchant vessels, first female shooter by passenger train, first female fire fighter, first female bus driver, first woman to reach Antarctica, first woman to touch Mount Everest have set an unprecedented feat by breaking down the age-old traditions of our women-power and society.
They have proved that with the help of hard work, grit and determination, we can overcome all odds and build a new path.
They are not only the people of their times but also the people of the generations to come.
They have filled up a new enthusiasm, a new inspiration.
A book has also been written about the women achievers and the women who have come first in the country to know about these women power and to inspire them through their lives.
This book is available on the NarendraModi App in the form of e-book.
Today, the power of women is playing a significant role in the positive transformation that is taking place in the country and society.
Today, while talking about the empowerment of women, I want to mention about a railway station.
You can imagine the connection between a railway station and the empowerment of women.
All employees are women at Madunga Railway Station in Mumbai.
This time, after watching the Republic Day parade, the important thing that many people have mentioned on Twitter and other social websites is about the bike running unit of the Border Police Force, and all of them are women.
They understood the adventures, which surprised guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today our women power is leading.
Self-reliance is emerging.
I am reminded of the wonderful work done by our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, who have given a new example.
While talking about tribal women, there is a definite vision in everyones minds - forestry, paths, women carrying heavy loads on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women power, have created a new scenario in front of the country.
The Tandedwara area of Chhattisgarh was hit by Maoist militants.
Violence, repression, bombs, guns and bullets have created a terrible atmosphere here.
In an atmosphere of terror, the tribal women are becoming self-reliant by driving rickshaws operating in batteries.
In addition to this, the protection of environment is also being strengthened.
I also congratulate the government administration here, they have played a significant role in the success of these women, from providing financial assistance and training to them.
Elimination of obsolete laws and adaptations of necessary changes.
For centuries, continuous efforts have been made in the country, individually and socially, against social disruption.
A few days ago, an interesting initiative was taken in Bihar.
In Bihar, a human chain program of more than 13,000 kms was organized to root out social evils.
Through this mission awareness was created against the evils of child marriage and dowry.
The people of the state decided to fight against dowry and child marriage.
Children, elders, enthusiastic young people, mothers and sisters all came forward and joined themselves in this movement.
From the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna to the border of the state, this human chain is connected without any hindrance.
If the people of all sections of society get the fruits of true progress then our society should get rid of these evils.
We all swear that we will together bring these evils out of the society.
Let us build a New India, a strong and capable India.
In the last few years, people have been writing to me about this thing and they have been telling me about it.
I have also seen several videos and social media related to the beneficiaries of this scheme.
I am glad that he had got the darshan and the idea that others should get it.
The objective behind this scheme is to make health care affordable and to promote ease of living.
Medicines available at Jan Aushadi Kendras are cheaper by 50 to 90 on commercial basis.
The medicines used by the common man, especially those which need to be taken on a daily basis, are economically beneficial to the senior citizens, which in turn increases savings.
The generic medicines bought here, i.e., the same kind of medicines, are as per WHO standards.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today, the central government has established more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi stores across the country.
This has not only ensured availability of medicines at affordable prices but has also opened up new avenues of employment for the individual.
Affordable medicines, the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) are available at AMRUT stores of the hospitals.
The only objective behind all this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country, so that they can build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Mangesh from Maharashtra is sharing a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That photo attracted me a lot.
One of them, along with his grandfather, took part in the cleanliness drive of the river Morna.
The citizens of Akola had taken up the task of cleaning the Morna river in connection with the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Though the river Morna has been a river flowing through the river for 12 months, it has now become monsoon.
One more sad thing here is that the river is full of wild and thirsty.
I was told that this cleanliness drive was going on till 20th January, 2018 and this mission will continue on every Saturday morning till the river becomes completely clean.
This shows that if someone decides to try and do something, then it is not possible for him to achieve it.
A big change can be brought about through the Jan Andolan.
I congratulate the people of Akola, its district and municipal administration, all the citizens who have participated in the mass movement, these efforts of yours will inspire other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, discussions are underway on the Padma Awards, which are being conferred by the President tomorrow.
Newspapers and television are attracted to it.
It is a matter of great pride for you to be amongst us and receive awards and recognition without any recommendation.
Now, it is not necessary that a person should be respected, but his actions are his identity.
He has been making sports material from garbage for 40 years so that he can inculcate scientific temper among the children.
His effort has been to ensure that children do scientific experiments with useless items.
For this, he has gone to 3000 schools across the country and has been encouraging the screening of video films made in 18 languages.
Look at what a wonderful life, great dedication!
The life of Sitava Jyotirlinga in Karnataka is similar.
She is no mean to call her "Women's Empowerment".
He has played a major role in transforming the lives of countless women over the past 30 years.
From the age of 7, he dedicated himself as a deodar and devoted his whole life to the welfare of the deodars.
Not only this, he has also worked tirelessly for the welfare of the underprivileged women.
You must have heard of Bajju Shyam ji from Madhya Pradesh, he was born in a very poor tribal family.
Though he did simple things for his livelihood, he had a great interest in the art of traditional tribal art.
It is because of this inspiration that today he is respected not only in India but in the entire world.
His paintings are exhibited in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, UK and Italy.
He was honored with the Padma Shri award for his talent in foreign countries.
The life of the tribal women of Kerala, Lakshmikutty ji, may surprise you a lot.
Lakshmikutty is a teacher at Kallar, even today he lives in dense forest, in a hut surrounded by Paniyala.
After the snake's death, she is well-equipped to produce the drug that needs to be used.
Laxmi Ji continues to serve the society through his medicinal knowledge.
He has been identified as an unknown person and has been honored with the Padma Shri award for his contribution to society.
Today I would like to mention one more thing that Subhasini Mistry, a 75-year-old from West Bengal, has been selected for the award.
Subhashini Mistry, who built a hospital, washed utensils in many homes and sold vegetables.
Today, the hospitals built due to his hard work are providing free treatment to thousands of poor people.
Sometimes such people should be invited to schools and colleges and also to share their experiences.
The society should make some efforts to go beyond the awards.
My dear countrymen, on the 9th of January every year, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
On the same day, Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the inalienable bond between Indians in India and Indians across the globe.
This year we had organised a programme for overseas Indians in which MPs and mayors from all over the world were invited.
Indian Diaspora in Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States participated in the event.
Some of them have made their mark in various fields like cyber security, Ayurveda, music, poetry, research on climate change, Indian literature and they have made a mark for themselves.
Some people have been truck drivers, some have built gurudwaras, some have built mosques, which means wherever we are, they have brought reform in some way or the other for the country.
I also express my gratitude to the European Union for recognizing the outstanding Indian Diaspora and for the remarkable work they have done for reaching out to the people around the world.
In today's time, we can clearly see how true the teachings of Anna ki Baat are.
What else can we pay for a greater tribute than this if we decide to walk on the path of our brother
My dear countrymen, I extend my best wishes to all of you for the year 2018 and seek answers from you.
Throughout the year, we have shared many things.
Your numerous letters, ideas and thoughts for Mann Ki Baat have always given me a new energy.
A few hours later, the year will change, but our sharing will continue as usual.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
Many good wishes to you all for the year 2018.
A few days ago, on the 25th of December, people from all over the world celebrated Christmas.
We can also see the essence of service mentality in Biblical.
This shows us what the importance of service is.
In our country, we are talking about the despicable nature of 'do gaz doori' i.e.
It is said that 'Seva Paramo dharma' means 'service is the highest virtue.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh jee.
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji, whose courage and sacrifice inspires us all.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had preached the great values of life and had lived his life for the rest of his life on the basis of those values.
A guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, Guru Gobind Singh ji worked with all these contributions to inspire the people.
He waged a war against oppression and injustice.
In this struggle, he had to lose many things in personal life.
But he never gave up his mind to be emotional.
Every moment of his life he gave the message of love, sacrifice and peace.
What kind of specialty have you ever seen
I had the honour to be a part of the 350th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Gobind Singh in Patna Sahib earlier this year.
Come, let us learn from the life of Guru Gobind Singh ji's great teachings, his inspiring life and seek to improve our lives.
Those who were born in the year 2000 or later in the 21st century will start becoming eligible voters in the year 2018.
I welcome the voters of the 21st century, the voters of New India, as the Republic of India.
I convey my best wishes to these young people and I appeal to all of you that you should go and register yourself as voters.
All over India, it is for you as voters of the 21st century.
By making a positive difference in the lives of lakhs of people, the vote is a big impact.
You will not be the only one who has the power to vote.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk about our glorious youth, who are 18 to 25 years old, who are determined and empowered.
I consider them as the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the spirit of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of India, the youth of New India, the youth of India, the youth of New India,
I am confident that our dream of a New India will be realized by the talent and strength of these powerful youth.
When we talk of a New India, we should be free from casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
It should be free from filth and poverty.
There should be equal opportunities for all in New India and everyone's aspirations and aspirations should be fulfilled.
In New India, peace, unity and harmony should be our guiding forces.
My young people of New India, come forward and explore how to build a New India.
Can the youth of the age group of 18 to 25 sit together and discuss the New India, find ways and prepare plans
Can we imagine how we can accomplish our resolutions before 2022
Can we discuss the dream that our freedom fighters dreamt of, building India
Gandhiji transformed the freedom struggle into a peoples movement.
My young friends, it is the need of the hour that we should create a peoples movement to build the highest India of the 21st century, a peoples movement for progress.
How to achieve success through determination
Today, there are so many new opportunities before the youth.
Starting from skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth is coming forward and are getting success.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, I had spoken about the importance of positivity and positive thinking.
There is also a case in English - Pessimism leads to awareness, optimism to power.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to all of you to share the positive moments of 2017 and to welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am glad that a large number of people have responded positively to the social media platforms, MyGov and the Narendra Modi App.
Lakhs of tweets have been posted on Positive India hashtag (), which reached out to more than 150 crore people.
In a way, this spread of positivity has started from India to the whole world.
The incoming tweets and responses are in fact inspiring.
It was a pleasant experience for me.
Some of you, my fellow countrymen, have mentioned some of the events of this year which had a positive impact on their minds.
Some people are sharing their personal achievements.
My name is Menu Bhatia.
I live in Packet One, Face One from Mayurvihar, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
She wanted to read.
For this, I needed a loan, and this has become very easy for me, and my daughter was able to pursue the course.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I'm living in the dock.
My husband had paid an accident of one rupee a month.
Unfortunately he lost his life in the accident.
We know of the worst situation at that time.
We got a lot of benefit due to the help of the government and we got a lot of relief.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
The National Highway was constructed in 2017 through BHINNAAR village.
As a result, our roads have become very good and our businesses have started growing.
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja. I live in Satganj area of Shahjahanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish (BEVANI) Bewani.
Since there is water shortage in our area, we have been dependent on the army's drinking water pipeline for the last 40 years.
Now a water tap has been set up for us alone...
This is our biggest achievement in 2017.
Many of the actions taken in their respective positions are resulting in a positive change in the lives of many.
In fact, this is the New India that we are building together.
Come, with these little happiness, let us begin a new year, let us start a new year, let us take a pledge from positive India to make a positive India.
When we talk of positive thoughts then I feel like sharing one thing.
I have heard about the story of the inspiring story of Anjam Bashir Khan Cuttack, who has done an excellent job in the State Civil Services Examination, Kashmir.
He has emerged from the bond of extremism and insurgency and has been a specialist in the Kashmir state's Civil Services Examination.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990, the terrorists had burned his home.
When terrorism and violence were over, his family was forced to flee the soil of their ancestors.
He never gave up hope.
He set his own path - the path to serve the people.
He came out of bad circumstances and drew his own victory story.
Today, he is an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but for all of India.
Anju has also proved that the atmosphere is so bad, but through positive actions, we can dissolve and dissipate clouds.
Last week, there was an opportunity to meet some women from Jammu and Kashmir.
The moments that I have spent with those women have inspired me. This is the strength of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country.
Every year, crores of devotees come to this world famous temple to receive the blessings of Lord Ayyappa.
But the Sabrimala temple is an example of how cleanliness can be turned into a culture, how to find a way to solve the problem and how to convert public participation into a power.
B.
Vijayan, a police officer, launched an action plan called Punnam Gardens, under which Swachhta Abhiyan was launched to spread awareness about cleanliness.
This Punya Tithi Garden mission, which has progressed so much in Sabrimala, has become a part of Sampriya for every traveller to visit.
There, along with hard work, a firm resolve related to cleanliness also goes hand in hand.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October, 2014, on the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, all of us took a resolution on the occasion of Gandhiji's birth anniversary.
He spent his entire life in this work and made efforts for this work.
On the occasion of his 150th birth anniversary, we had decided that we will dedicate to him the India that he had dreamt of, a Clean India, and we will contribute in that direction.
Efforts are being made in the entire country in the direction of cleanliness.
There has been a widespread change in rural and urban areas with the help of Jan Bhagidaari.
The Swachh Survekshan 2018, the worlds largest survey, is scheduled to be conducted from 4th January to 10th March 2018, to measure the quality of cleanliness achieved in the urban areas.
This survey will cover about 40 crore people in more than 4000 cities.
The survey will have estimates of Open Defecation Free (ODF) cities, waste collection, transport vehicles, scientific waste processing, behaviour change efforts, capacity building and innovative initiatives for cleanliness and peoples participation in this task.
According to this study, different groups will go to cities and conduct research.
Citizens will be able to speak and receive answers from them.
They will also review the usage of the Swachhta App and the development of various service centres.
Whether all the institutions are being set up in the cities to make the city's cleanliness natural and natural.
It is not just the government that has to implement cleanliness.
Every citizen and civil society has a big role to play in this.
On the basis of this survey, when the standards of cities are set, if the population in your city is more than 1 lakh, then the national level and if there is a population of less than 1 lakh, then it will be ranked at the local level.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one thing with you through this programme.
It has been brought to my notice that if a Muslim woman wishes to go on a Haj pilgrimage, she will not be able to go on a Haj pilgrimage without Mehram or her male guardian.
When I heard about this for the first time then how can this happen
Why this discrimination had arisen.
For years, injustice has been done to Muslim women, but there has been no discussion on this.
Such a rule does not exist in many Islamic countries.
But Islamic women of India have been denied this right.
I am happy that our government has focused upon it.
Our Minority Affairs Ministry has taken necessary steps to end this legacy that has been there for 70 years and has done away with it.
Today, I am happy that Muslim women, who are not even a male protector, can go to Haj without Mehram and this time more than 1300 Muslim women have applied to perform Haj without Mehram (male companion) and women from different parts of the country, from Kerala to North India have expressed their interest in going to Haj.
The Ministry of Minority Affairs has been directed to ensure that all women applying for Haj without Mehram (male companion) are allowed to go for Haj.
I am confident that Indias developmental journey is progressing rapidly due to the strength of our women power and their skills and is going to make further progress.
Our sustained effort should be to ensure that women have equal rights and opportunities for men and they can progress on the path of development at the same time.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic day for all of us.
But the next year will be remembered on 26th January, 2018.
India will also be the Chief Guest at the Republic Day celebrations of 2018 in ASEAN.
This year, not a single person, but a few prominent guests will grace the occasion.
This has not happened in the history of India.
The year 2017 has been excellent for ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years of its existence and in 2017, Indias partnership with ASEAN reached 25 years.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that on 26th January, these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will be participating here.
It is rare that someday or the other, there will be no festival.
Now we have celebrated Christmas and the next New Year is coming.
May the coming New Year bring immense joy, joy and prosperity.
Let us all move forward with a new zeal, enthusiasm, new inspiration and a new resolution and make the country progress.
Makar Sankranti will be celebrated in the month of January as the festival of Uttarayan in January.
This is a time when we are connected with nature.
In fact, every festival of ours is associated with nature in some way or the other, but in our culture of diversity there is a habit of celebrating this magnificent event of nature in different ways.
While the joy of Lohri in Punjab and northern states is rising, it is expected that Khichdi and Til Sankranti will come to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
In Rajasthan, it is said that the names of 'Sankrand' in Rajasthan, 'Magg-bihu' in Assam and 'Pongal' in Tamil Nadu, all of which have their own special qualities, they have a special significance for them.
All these festivals are celebrated from 13th to 17th January.
Though nominally different, their underlying philosophy is - the link between nature and agriculture.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, my dear countrymen.
We will meet again in 2018.
Mann Ki Baat is September 2019.
It is doubtful if there would be any Indian citizen who does not respect him or who does not respect him.
He was older than us and was a witness to various phases and periods in the country.
Not only the people of our new generation, this is a great learning experience for all of us, you are a great inspiration for all of us, even after you have done away with so many achievements in your life, you have always been the main inspiration for the development and hard work of your parents.
I've had this feeling so dear.
Really, I don't want to give you any trouble.
Because, I know how active you are, how much work you've got, I'll see and see.
Modhi ji: Yeah.
Modi ji: Because of your love, we were very happy.
Modi ji: I am also grateful for your continued interest in me.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you on my auspicious birthday.
Modi ji: When I came to Mumbai this time, I thought of talking to you.
We will celebrate the festival of Navratri, Mahaotsavam, Karba, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Deepawali, Baiya Duj and Satpuja.
In many cities, many NGOs and youth start-ups are engaged in this work.
They gather all the clothes, sweets and food items in their homes, then they go and collect them in search of the needy, and do it without any publicity.
Can we, this time, in this festive season, drive away the darkness of light, with complete awareness and determination
The smile on the faces of many poor families, the joy of your happiness in the festive season, your face will shine further, your light will shine and your Diwali will shine further.
My dear brothers and sisters, On the auspicious occasion of Deepawali, devotees are welcomed in the house, giving a lot of fervor and a lot of life.
We have traditionally welcomed them.
Will this time we welcome the pilgrims in a new way
In our culture, we worship women as gods, because women are considered to be the givers of good fortune.
Can we organize programmes to honour women in our society, in our villages, in our cities
We can organize public events.With their hard work and hard work, the women who have achieved success amongst us, in our families, in our society, in our country.
Cant we organize programmes to honor and honor these daughters of India on this Diwali
We may have women who have done many extraordinary things.
Someone may be trying to spread awareness about cleanliness and health, some may have been engaged in some social service, some as a doctor, an engineer, or a teacher for poor children.
As a lawyer, he may have been trying to fight for justice.
Our society must identify such women and be proud of them.
Just as we all have been running a selfie-based movement with a daughter all over the world, similarly we will carry forward a movement called Bharat Ke Lakshmi.
Encouragement to Mother India means to ensure a better life for the country and the people.
My dear countrymen, I had said this in advance about Mann Ki Baat, which gives me the opportunity to interact with a large number of unknown people.
Recently, a student from remote Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Thaang had written an interesting letter to me.
I belong to Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
Some people asked me if you had read the book by the Exam Board this time when my results came in.
I had said that I had not read that book.
But after returning home, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times.
After that I had a pleasant experience.
Thank you very much for writing my letter.
And I thank you very much for telling me about the shortcomings at the time of reading.
I will obey your order and walk.
What is your experience in your daily life
Once again I express my gratitude to my young friend from Arunachal and to my student Alina Thaang.
My dear countrymen, you would be aware of the constant events of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and TV, of the absence of rest and of the discussions.
This time, in the US Open Competition, how much the success was spoken about, the speech of Medwede, the second in the final race, was also discussed.
I also heard a lot of talk on social media and then saw the dance.
In 23 years, Dane Medvede's simplicity and maturity were an asset to everyone.
If there was another person at this time, he would have been sad and disappointed, but there was no difference in his face, instead he used to smile in everyone's mind and mind through his words.
His address was welcomed by all the visitors.
In one event, the courage of the winner and the victory of the winner had awe of the mind.
If you tell me that you have not heard Matwede's speech in Dane so far, especially the youth, please go and see and listen.
There is a lot to learn from all sections of the society and from all ages.
These moments are beyond victory and defeat and there is no point in winning.
Life is a success, and our scriptures tell us this thing in a very special way.
The thoughts of our ancestors are truly multi-faceted.
Mani Ganjana Samyojana: Janaya Loksya lotasana Anandam: It means that if a person gets the status and service of a person, then he cant win the heart of anyone
In fact, this young athlete has won all hearts of the world.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, the thing that I am going to say now is for your personal well-being.
But if we stop them from waking up early, then it can be very safe.
I want to keep this spirit in mind, especially to the younger generation.
You all are well aware of the fact that intoxication given by tobacco is very harmful to health and it becomes very difficult to get rid of that habit.
Tobacco users are more prone to diseases like cancer , diabetes , blood pressure , etc.
It affects the growth of the brain more due to its practice in childhood.
But today, I have come to share a new thing with you.
You are aware that now there is a ban on e-cigarettes in India.
E-cigarettes are different than normal cigarettes. It is a kind of electronic device.
E-cigarette absorbs nicotine liquid substance and produces a type of chemical smoke that causes nicotine as well.
We all are well aware of the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but the misconceptions about e-cigarettes are widely spread.
That is, there is no danger from this e-cigarettes.
Like other cigarettes, there should not be any foul smell, so they mix a sandy soluble substance in it.
In our neighbourhood, we may have noticed that if a father continues to smoke, if he continues to smoke, the other person in his house will be driven away from smoking.
His effort will be to ensure that no one in the family smokes.
He knows how much harm the body is caused by smoking and tobacco use.
The person who is caught smoking smokes, he knows this very well.
But this is not the case of e-cigarettes.
People dont have much awareness about e-cigarettes.
They are not fully aware of the danger, as a result of which, in some cases, e-cigarette, a sludge, enters the house peacefully.
In fact, e-cigarettes have several harmful substances that result in serious health hazards.
If someone in the neighborhood smokes, then its smell will betray us.
It's just because it doesn't want every family's dreams to be trodden down on their feet.
Avoid any misapprehensions related to e-cigarettes.
Come, let us together build a healthy India.
Yeah, you don't remember about Fit India.
Fit India does not mean that one has to go to gym for two hours in the morning or two in the evening.
There is a need to stay away from these things.
I believe that you will not feel the bitterness of what I say, but it will certainly be good for you.
They did not live for themselves, they sacrificed themselves for others.
One such person is to be honored in Vatican City on October 13.
Sister Mariam Thresia, in her less than 50 years of life, worked for the welfare of humanity, is an example for the entire world.
He had a special association in the field of social service and education.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for not only India, but for the entire world today, as we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians have once again taken the pledge to free them from the scourge of the 130 crore Indians.
In the direction of environmental protection, India has been leading the world in a way, and today the eyes of all countries are on India.
I am confident that all of you will be able to participate in the liberation movement from the 2nd of October at the same time.
In many places, people are making their own contribution to the mission in their own unique ways.
But a young person of our country has organized a very unique movement.
When I was careful about his work, I phoned him and tried to find out about his new experiment.
For the first time when I heard this saying - 'Ploging', it was new to me.
Probably this term may be very useful in foreign countries.
Hello Mr. Ribbuman, Namaskar, I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
My heartiest greetings to you.
If 130 crore countrymen have taken one step in this direction then India will move forward by 130 crore steps towards the direction of freedom from single use plastic.
Once again, Thank you very much to you all.
And many congratulations to you and your team for this new idea.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, the country and the world are working on the preparations made for the 2nd of October, but we want to walk the path of Gandhiji's 150 path.
We want to bring about a change in the welfare of the country in our lives.
I would like to remind you of one thing in advance.
Although I will talk about it in detail in the next Mann Ki Baat, but why do I talk about it in advance today, there is no chance for you to participate in the preparations
You all will remember that on October 31, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was celebrated.
On that day, all the children, the elders, thousands of people from all the schools and colleges in India, millions and millions of villages of India should take part in the Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, all of you might remember that on the 15th of August I had spoken to the Red Fort asking you to visit at least 15 places in India by 2022.
There should be at least 15 places, if possible, one or two buildings to stay there.
I once again request you to visit some 15 places in India, as holidays are coming on the occasion of Diwali and people are definitely going to visit there.
And all these things have happened only because of your cooperation, especially because we understand the importance of tourism.
My dear countrymen, once again, many good wishes to you all for various festivals in a diverse India.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to communicate with my young friends in Karnataka.
The Times team's Vijay Karnataka newspaper published a magazine on children asking children to write to the Prime Minister of the country.
They published some selected letters in that magazine.
When I read those letters, they were nice to me.
Keerthi Hectade from North Karnataka, while appreciating the Digital India and Smart City programme, said that there is a need to change our education system and today there is no country in the classroom where children are interested in knowing the nature.
If we provide information about nature to the children then they will be helpful in protecting nature in the future.
The child of Rita Nadaf from Lakshmaneswara is the daughter of a soldier and is proud of her.
While you are the daughter of a soldier, it is no surprise that you are proud of yourself. What is the story of Irfana Begum from Kalpurki that her school is 5 km from her village
Ladies and Gentlemen, I am glad that a newspaper has taken this initiative, and I have got the opportunity to read these letters.
For me, it was a kind of experience.
My dear countrymen, today is 26/11.
Our Constitution Day is on the 26th of November.
In 1949, today, the Constitution of India was adopted in the Constituent Assembly.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They tried hard for three years to abrogate the Constitution of India.
Those who read those debates, and how their dedication to the nation was reflected in those debates.
Do you know how hard they have worked for a diverse nation by enacting a constitutional law
They did it with a sense of understanding and far-sightedness, while leaving the country free from slavery.
It is the responsibility of all of us to build a New India with the power of this constitution and with the clear vision of those who gave the Constitution.
Our Constitution is very wide.
There is no aspect of life that is not seen in it, it is not about nature.
It is the duty of all of us to follow the Constitution without letting go of it.
Be it citizens or rulers, we have to move forward by understanding the spirit of the Constitution.
The objective of the Constitution is to ensure that there is no contribution from anyone.
Today, it is natural to remember Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on the Constitution Day.
17 different committees were formed to discuss the important issues of the Constituent Assembly.
The draft committee is one of the most important groups.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Constituent Assembly.
He was playing an important role.
Today, we are feeling the pride of giving the Constitution of India, the indelible mark of the effective leadership of Babasaheb Ambedkar in building it.
He ensured the welfare of all sections of society.
On the occasion of his death on 6th December, as always, we remember him and pay tributes.
And it shall be remembered that Babasaheb's part was in the land, to make it self-reliant, and strong.
On December 15, SardarVallabhbhai Patel was his immortal day.
From being the son of a farmer to being the son of a Iron Man, Sardar Patel did an extraordinary job of bringing the nation together.
Sardarji was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was a member of the Advisory Council of Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
Even though it is our Constitution Day 26/11, how can this nation forget the 26/11 that took place nine years ago
The nation remembers and pays tributes to all those who lost their loved ones, police and security forces.
This nation will never forget their sacrifice.
Terrorism is spread all over the world today, something happens on a day, it happens in a very horrible form.
We have been victimized by terrorism for the past 40 years.
Our innocent people have laid down their lives for thousands.
But a few years ago, when India was talking about terrorism on the world stage, many people did not take it seriously but today when terrorism touches the country, the world governments are facing a big challenge for terrorism.
This is the goal of destroying the human forces.
Therefore, not only India, but all the humanitarian forces of the world must come together and defeat terrorism.
This land that was born to Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Gandhiji, has given this land to the world of non-violence and love.
Terrorism and terrorism are trying to weaken and undermine our social fabric.
Therefore, it is the need of the hour to remain vigilant about the human race.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of December, all of us are going to celebrate Navy Day.
Indian Navy protects and protects our coasts.
I convey my best wishes to all those associated with the Navy.
You all are well aware of the fact that our culture has emerged on the banks of the river.
Be it the Indus, the Ganga, the Yamuna, the Saraswati, our rivers, the sea, the economy and the war are both important.
This is our gateway to the whole world.
Their Navy played a major role in the expansion of the Chola Empire and making it an economic super power.
The Chola Navy's invasions and many examples of research visits are still available in the literature of the society.
Most of the world's marines had allowed women to go to war.
But in the Chola Navy, about 800-900 years ago, a large number of women had played an important role.
Women were also involved in war.
The Chola administration had technical know-how on ship-building.
When we talk about the Navy, can Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj not talk about the might of his navy?
The sea-affected Konkan coasts were dominated by Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj's empire, Sindhu Durga, Murud Janjjera, Swarna Durg, etc. were situated on the seashore or were surrounded by sea.
The responsibility for the protection of these forts lies with the Maratha army.
The Marines comprised large ships and small ships.
His marines were capable of attacking or defending any enemy.
Couldn't you talk about the Martiya navy and talk about Kanoji Angre?
It was he who took the Marine Navy to a new height, and set up marine naval bases in many places.
Sumitra ji immediately undertook the rescue and rescued many fishermen from drowning and handed them over to Bangladesh.
In May this year, when Sri Lanka was flooded, three ships of our Navy immediately reached there and helped the government and the people of that country.
In June, when the Government of Papua New Guinea sent us an urgent request for assistance, our navy helped the fishermen on their fishing boats.
Our Navy has always made the country proud, be it providing medical assistance to Fiji, providing immediate relief, or extending humanitarian assistance to neighbouring countries in times of distress.
We, the people of India, have always brought respect and pride to our security forces, be it the ground forces, be it our navy or the air force, the courage, bravery, courage, bravery and sacrifice of our soldiers are synonymous with the veneration of every citizen.
A peaceful life of 1.25 billion Indians is due to the sacrifices made by our soldiers for the cause of our youth.
Every year on December 7, we observe the flag day of the Armed Forces.
Throughout this week, the flags will be placed on all small and big people.
A movement to honour the soldiers in the country will be launched.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flags of our military forces.
This money is being spent for the welfare of the soldiers and the families of the martyrs for the welfare of the injured and for their rehabilitation.
You will be able to know about a variety of ways to contribute to the economy.
Come, let us use this opportunity to work towards boosting the morale of our soldiers.
We will also contribute to their well-being.
My dear countrymen, 5th December is World Soil Day.
I want to tell our farmer brothers and sisters a few things.
All the food we eat is connected to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is connected to the soil.
Just imagine what would happen if this rich soil is not there in the world to produce.
Trees will not flourish, how can human life be possible
How do microorganisms develop
The farmers of this country have given a lot of importance to their lives in terms of devotion to soil, also respecting it with scientific zeal.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that the farmers of our country, who are associated with tradition, who are devoted to modern science, who are striving and who are committed.
When I went to Boranj area of Dohu village in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, I heard about the farmers there.
Earlier, the farmers here used chemical fertilizers without any quantity, which affected the soil health.
On the other hand, the production capacity of the soil gradually kept slowing down and the income of the farmers increased.
In 2016-17, the yield of winter crops increased by 3 to 4 times every acre, from 4 to 6 thousand rupees per acre.
Moreover, there has been an improvement in the quality of soil.
Due to lack of usage of fertilizers, there has been an economic saving.
It gives me great happiness, my farmer brothers and sisters have come forward to implement the suggestions given on the soil health card and when they see the results then their zeal increases further.
The farmer brothers have begun to understand that if we have to focus on the magnificence first, if we take care of the mother Earth then we will take care of all of us on this land.
There are more than 10 crore soil health cards available to our farmers across the country, so that they are able to understand their land well and sow.
We bow down to the mother earth but have we ever seen how much damage her due to the use of urea on her
It has been demonstrated in all types of scientific methods that excessive application of urea has a serious impact on the Earth.
When the farmer is the son of a mother earth, how can he be patient if he is ill with earth disease
This mother-son relationship must be once again awakened.
Can we take a pledge that our farmers, sons of Mother Earth, the children of our soil, will we reduce the urea they use to the extent that it will mark 75 years of independence in 2022
We have also started experiencing global warming and climate change.
There was a time before Deepavali when the Cold Chains started.
But even in such a situation, there are some examples of what kind of results are being created by those who are awake all the time.
An 8-year-old differently-abled boy from Madhya Pradesh, Dussher, has tried to keep his villagers out of open defecation.
This 8-year-old boy can't speak, but he has his weapon of living.
He got up at 5 a.m. and went home to his village, clapped, and awakened them to not to defecate in the open through signals.
Due to this kid who went to 30-40 houses every day and taught about cleanliness, Kumhari village was freed from the habit of defecating in the open.
This young man is engaged in the work of providing inspiration for cleanliness.
This shows that I have no age or limit for cleanliness.
Whether it is small or large, whether it is male or female, cleanliness is essential for all and everyone needs to contribute in the cause of cleanliness.
You might remember that our Divyang sportspersons had won 4 medals during the Rio Olympics very well and were also present in the World Cup for the visually impaired.
There are many types of competitions going on throughout the country.
In the past, the 17th National Paradigm was organized in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang sisters and brothers from different parts of the country who came from different parts of the country, participated in this event and displayed their skills.
One of them is a 19-year-old Joker from Gujarat, who doesn't have 80 percent of his body muscle, but look at his adventure, mind and hard work.
As a result of his skills, he will now be trained at the Centre of Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, when he was one of the 32 Para Swimmers selected by the Sports Authority of India for 20-20 Paralysis.
I salute the young Joker, and convey my best wishes.
Today special attention is being given to the accessibility and opportunity of the differently-abled.
A few days later, the festival of Id-e-Milath-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
This day was the birth of His Majesty the King of Bhutan, His Highness the King of Bhutan.
Greetings Prime Minister, I am talking to Neeraj Singh from Kanpur.
I request you all to share 10 of the best of the things that you have said throughout the year in Mann Ki Baat.
They say, Are there not elders in our villages? let them never forget sorrow, let not the joy forget.
We calculate this year-on-year, we start looking at it and we are working on it with the results of which we plan for the next year.
We are once again trying to recall the interesting events of the past year in the media.
There is a positive thing in it, and there is a negative thing in it.
But when we spend time in 2018, cant we not just remember the good things, do we not remember them
I would like to tell you one thing - if you have heard and seen, if you have shared 5-10 positive things then there will not be a feeling of goodness.
Can you make a contribution in this
Can we share 5 positive experiences in our lives this time
It may be a photo, a short story or a small video through which we invite all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a clean environment and welcome it with good memories.
Let us recall the inspiring stories of others.
Let us remind ourselves of good things and create a conducive environment.
Good things give us the strength to do good things.
We will put together the strength and impact of this joint venture.
In my next Mann Ki Baat, I will certainly try to bring these positive things to the people of our country.
My dear countrymen, next month, in the Mann Ki Baat of Mann Ki Baat, I will be with you again.
There will be opportunities for exchange of many things.
Celebrated six days after the festival of Diwali, the festival of Sath Puja is one of the festivals celebrated with different names and customs.
Traditional appointments are allowed in each case as to what to eat and what to wear.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also boundless during this festival.
The entire house is being cleaned before the pooja, and together everyone is involved in the cleaning of rivers, lakes, water tanks, places of worship and holy places.
It is a celebration of the values of Sun worship or Sat-worship, protection of environment, disease prevention and regulation.
The feeling of annihilating the soul lies at the back of this tradition that demands Prasada and this evil character can be a major obstacle to the path of progress.
It is natural that all of us are proud of this great heritage of India.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat has been appreciated and criticised.
Let us take the example of Khadi and handloom.
As soon as one hears that there has been so much sales in a shop, one feels very happy and happy.
About 680 percent of the sales of Khadi gifts have been recorded on the occasion of Diwali.
There is an increase of about 90 percent of the total sales of Khadi and handicrafts.
This shows that today, the youth, the elderly and the women of all ages are wearing Khadi clothes and handloom clothes.
I can imagine how good it will be for the families of the weavers, for the poor and for the families of those who work in handlooms.
Shri Rajan Bhatt has written to NarendraModiApp that you should share my experience of Deepavali with the security forces and tell me how they are celebrating the festival of Diwali.
You all must have celebrated Diwali with great enthusiasm.
For me, this time too, Diwali brought me a special experience.
Once again, we had the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with our armed forces at the border.
This time, it was an unforgettable experience to celebrate Diwali with the security forces in the Gujjar area of Jammu and Kashmir.
I bow to all the countrymen and the security forces of our country for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our security forces have been fighting against many difficult and difficult situations in the border areas.
Whenever we get the opportunity, whenever we get the opportunity, we need to know the experiences of our security forces and listen to their adventures.
Many of us may not be aware that our security forces are engaged in several important tasks not only in our border areas but also in maintaining peace throughout the world.
They are proud of India as a peacekeeper in the world.
For us, we walk the path of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' i.e.
India has always put pressure on gender equality.
It may appear to be a small change in the upper dimension, but it expresses a delicate temper.
If I say that Indias biggest contribution is in the field of several things, then it is - - , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .
India has always had a positive role in UN peacekeeping operations.
Till August 2017, Indian soldiers have served in about 50 operations in 71 peacekeeping operations across the world.
These activities have taken place in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan, across all parts of the world.
In Congo and South Sudan, Indian Army has provided medical care to more than 20,000 patients.
Only a few people know that India was the first country to send a women police force under the United Nations Peace Keeping Mission in Liberia.
This work of India is an inspiration for all the countries of the world.
Only then did all the countries start sending their women police forces.
It is a matter of pride for all that India's contribution is not only in peace keeping but also in training those who are engaged in peace keeping of about 85 countries.
Our brave pacifists from this land where Gandhiji and Gautama Buddha lived have brought a message of peace and harmony across the world.
Peacekeeping is not an easy task.
Our security forces have to go to difficult places.
I live in different people.
It has to be understood in a variety of circumstances and different cultures.
We have to change ourselves according to the local needs and circumstances.
When we think of him, the hearts of all the countrymen are filled with pride, the Paramveer Chakra Award is the same.
In 1989, 72-year-old man was appointed as the Corps Commander for Operations in Namibia and he dedicated his services towards ensuring the independence of Namibia.
As ambassadors of peace, India has always spread the message of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Noble in Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda gave her the name Nivedita.
Nivedita means her complete dedication.
In the later period, he dedicated himself to his name.
Yesterday is sister Nivedita's 150th birth anniversary.
He was inspired by Swami Vivekananda, who renounced his life and dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was deeply affected by the injustice done to the British rule.
The British not only enslaved our country but they also tried to keep us as slaves.
The work of instilling a inferiority complex in our minds is going on in a way that degrades our culture.
Sister Nivedita restored the pride of Indias culture.
He took up the task of raising the awareness of the nation and uniting the people.
He went to different countries of the world and gave a voice against the false propaganda about the principles and principles of freedom.
The famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramaniam Bharati has described the revolution of innovation in the poetry of the new age group and their balance of balance.
It is said that the inspiration for the story came from his sister Nivedita.
Sister Nivedita has also helped a great scientist Jagdish Chandra Pollution.
He has collaborated to publish and disseminate Boses research through his articles and conferences.
One of the most beautiful features of India is the completion of one spiritual and science.
Sister Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose are outstanding examples of this.
In 1899, there was a terrible plague in Kolkata, in which thousands of people died.
Sister Nivedita, who did not care about her health, started the work of cleaning canals and streets.
He might have lived well but he engaged himself in the service of the poor.
Inspired by this sacrifice, they started making their contribution in the service of the people.
He taught a lesson on the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is surprising to hear that diabetes affects children too.
In the olden days, such diseases are called treason, which means these diseases are only for the rich and the healthy.
Such diseases were rarely seen in young people.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today we know that these diseases are lifestyle related problems.
One of the main reasons for this disease at a young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in food habits.
It is also important for the society and the family to focus on these.
If you think about these things then you will feel that there is no need to do anything extraordinary.
We should naturally try to change our old habits and do small things in the right way.
Children should be engaged in the habit of playing in open fields and people of the family should be made aware.
If possible, the elderly in the family can join these children in sports.
Children can develop the habit of climbing stairs instead of life-size.
After dinner, everyone in the family can walk with the children for a while.
Yoga is especially beneficial for our younger brothers and sisters to have a healthy lifestyle and avoid lifestyle disorders.
Before starting school, you will be able to practice yoga for the first 30 minutes and you will feel how beneficial it will be.
Why I say that it is easy to learn and why it is easy to do it anywhere.
This requires no special equipment or field.
Several studies have been conducted on the fact that yoga is very useful in preventing diabetes.
The study is being carried out at AIIMS and considering the results available so far, they are very encouraging.
We will not only treat Ayurveda and Yoga as therapy but will also make them a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, in the field of sports, there have been many good news in the last few days.
It is because our soldiers have played a great role that we have succeeded in winning the Asian continent over the past decade.
Earlier, India had won the Asian continent in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to all the team, to all the helpers, on my behalf and on behalf of the people of the country.
After hockey, India has also received good losses in badminton.
Srikanth is a badminton star and has made India proud by winning the Denmark Open.
This is the third victory of the Super Series Premier after Indonesia Open and Australia Open medals.
I congratulate our young athletes for their achievements and for making India proud.
Friends, This month, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup was launched by the FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
Teams from all over the world came to India and all of them displayed their skills in the football field.
I also got the opportunity to watch a dance performance.
Sportspersons and visitors were enthused.
The entire world is watching this great event of the World Cup.
I was surprised to see such a grand event, the strength of all the young soldiers, the enthusiasm and the desire to do something.
All the teams have shown their best when the world has started successfully.
India may not have won, but India's young players have won the hearts of all.
All the countries of the world including India enjoyed this grand festival and attracted football fans of all the World Cup players.
There are signs that the future of football is bright.
I once again congratulate all the players, their supporters and all the sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, when I see the number of people writing about Swachh Bharat, when I want to respect their feelings then I will have to present Mann Ki Baat on daily basis and I will have to dedicate every Mann Ki Baat towards cleanliness.
Some people are sending a photo of the efforts of small kids and some are sending information about the efforts of the youth groups.
At some places, any innovation related to cleanliness or any officer's untiring efforts are being made to get the news of the change.
In the past, I was given a detailed report on the story of a revival at the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
There, a non-governmental organization called Ecological Protection Organization, through its entire team, used to clean the fort of Chandrapur.
The movement which lasted for 200 days, involved in the task of cleaning the fort without any break, without any break.
A series of 200 days.
As soon as you look at this, your disappointment becomes optimistic.
This clarion call for swachhta is a wonderful example of swachhta, beauty, social action and constant effort.
Fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of all of us, the people of the country, to keep our historical traditions safe and clean.
I congratulate the Ecological Protection Organization and their entire team and the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of November, we will be celebrating the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak ji.
Guru Nanak Devji was not only the first Guru of the Sikhs, but also the guru of the world.
He talked about the interests of the entire human society and equally exploited all the castes.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
He gave a message of equality in society, not only limited to words, but also acted in his actions.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji has given 3 messages in his life of usefulness - proclaiming the name of God, strives and helps those who need it.
Guru Nanak Devji had written a holy book Guru Granth, taking his teachings out of his mind.
We will celebrate the coming year 2019 as the 550th birth anniversary of our Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Let us make efforts to move forward on the path of his teachings and message.
My dear countrymen, two days later, on 31st October, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
SardarVallabhbhai Patel's specialty is that he was not only an expression of the idea of change, but also an expert in the process of implementing it and finding it difficult to implement it.
He was a specialist in the conduct of thought.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had a great responsibility in uniting India.
At the outset, he ensured that crores of countrymen should be brought under the ambit of the same constitution only.
His ability to resolve gave him the ability to overcome all obstacles.
This slogan of Sardar Saheb is still an inspiration for our New India and is relevant today.
This is the reason why we observe his birthday as National Unity Day.
His contribution in giving a unified form to the nation is unparalleled.
A Run for Unity is being organised all over the country on the birth anniversary of SardarVallabhbhai Patel on 31st October, in which many children, youth, women and people from all over the country are going to participate.
I urge you all to take part in this Run for Unity, and join each other in the celebrations of mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali, with a new determination, with a new resolve, you all have started to engage again in your daily lives.
My best wishes to you all for your dreams and also for your success.
It has been three years since Mann Ki Baat began to speak to you on Akashwani.
Today is the 36th.
In a way, there are allegations of India's positive power, the feelings, desires and expectations everywhere in the country, but Mann Ki Baat has given me a unique opportunity to interact with the feelings of the people.
You might have noticed that I had never said that it was the voice of my mind.
Be it e-mail, telephone or be it mygov, or be it NarendraModiApp, all these things are available to me.
In some cases, the personal-related disorders, sometimes the social problems etc., attract attention.
I take half an hour of your life once a month, but people are sending me information about Mann Ki Baat for 30 days a month.
I am grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country in such a short span of time.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered the words of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Since then, I have received a lot of letters from every corner of the country. Many social organizations, many young people have been engaged in the work of making food-free.
While watching this, Selfie with the daughters not only from India but from all over the world has become a huge movement.
This is not the problem of the social media.
A new self-confidence and a new pride for every girl child has become an occasion.
Every mother wanted to have a selfie with her daughter.
Every woman has a feeling of importance for herself.
Recently, I attended a session of the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
Wherever you visit, I have requested the traveler to send you pictures of incredible India.
Millions of films came from every corner of India, in a way it became a huge asset for the people working in the tourism sector.
Every moment of the country's journey on the right path is dedicated.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something positive for the welfare of others, for the welfare of the society and for the progress of the nation.
In this three year movement of Mann Ki Baat, I learnt, understood and learnt from the people of the country.
This is the biggest capital and greatest power for any country.
There has been an increase in the sale of Khadi Khadi, which has led to an increase in employment in the homes of the poor.
A substantial discount is being offered on Khadi from 2nd October.
I once again request you to take forward the movement related to Khadi and strengthen it further.
When we buy Khadi, we have to keep in mind the feeling that the lamp of Diwali will be lit in the homes of the poor.
We have to do this so that the poor of our country gets strength from this process.
The increasing interest towards Khadi has inspired the people who work in the Khadi sector, those associated with Khadi in the Government of India and those who are associated with Khadi in a new way.
The idea is how to develop new technology, how to increase productivity and how to introduce solar equipment.
For 20-30 years, they have started thinking about how to revive the old tradition which had disappeared from the practice.
In Uttar Pradesh, the Sevapuri Khadi Ashram at Sevapur in Varanasi has been closed for 26 years and now it has started functioning with a new theme.
That is, from the 2nd of October, on the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, just 15 days before the 2nd of October, we had decided to participate in the cleanliness drive across the country.
We will unite the minds of the people through cleanliness.
Our Honble President inaugurated this task and the nation was one of them.
Today, the elders, the men, the women, the cities and the villages are connecting themselves as part of this cleanliness mission.
I had promised that we will take a pledge and we will succeed. This cleanliness mission is moving in the direction of achieving success with our resolve, it has spread in front of our eyes.
Everyone is making it their own, helping them and making their own contribution in this direction.
Sportsmen, film fraternity, academicians, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, police personnel and soldiers are connecting with this movement.
People ask for cleanliness in public places and there is a kind of pressure that is being felt to keep the workers there clean.
This time I had to look at another thing - it is a matter of cleanliness, and it is another thing that we do not keep awake and do not pollute.
At the same time, it is important to carry out a mission of thinking that cleanliness is our nature.
Several competitions related to Swachhata Hi Sewa were organized during this time.
More than 212 crore children participated in essay competitions.
Thousands of children drew their own imagination and painted it.
While talking about cleanliness, I do not forget to express my gratitude to the media.
They have taken this mission forward with a lot of cleanliness.
They have played a big role in creating a positive environment by connecting with each other in their own style.
We can clearly see how the electronic media and newspapers of our country have been doing great service to the Swachhata Hi Seva movement.
A few days ago, someone told me about Bilal Dar, an 18-year-old from Srinagar.
The biggest lake in Asia is near Srinagar, where he has been evacuating plastic, polythene, used bottles and garbage.
He also earned income from it.
Since his father died of cancer and died, he added cleanliness to his life.
Whether young or old, Bilal Dar is a source of inspiration and inspiration for all those who are interested in cleanliness.
This October marks the anniversary of our many great men and women.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhi ji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, on the birth anniversary of 11th Prakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji.
This year marks the centenary of Nanaji and Deen Dayal ji.
When Nanaji Deshmukh left his political life and joined the Gramodaya Movement, it is important for us to respect his work related to Gramoday at this time of his centenary.
When the former President of India, Abdul Kalam used to talk to the youth, he always used to talk about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
He also went to the villages to see Nanajis work with great respect.
Like Gandhiji, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Ji would also talk about the last person in the society.
Deen Dayal Ji will remember how to change the lives of the poor, the deprived, the oppressed and the deprived section of the society through education and employment.
When we think of all these great men, it is not a privilege for them, why do we think of these great men, when we think of them then the way ahead becomes clear.
In every city of the country, this Run for Unity is organised on a large scale and the weather is comfortable according to it and it is necessary to get the opportunity of iron like Sardar Saheb.
Have they not united the country?
We should also participate in the Run for Unity and take the mantra of Unity forward.
We naturally say that unity in diversity is India's achievement.
While we are proud of diversity, did you try to experience this diversity
Once again I would like to tell the people of the country, especially the younger generation that we are alive.
Enjoy the diversity of our India, feel it, look at it.
You can see that this diversity of our country is going to be a school for the development of a unique feature within you.
There is a feeling of going anywhere in the country and around the holidays, Diwali and Diwali.
People in North India do not know what is there in South India.
Those living in the West do not know what is there in the East.
Do you know how diversity is there in our country
If you look at the speeches of Gandhiji, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam, then one thing is very well known - when they visit India, there was a new inspiration to see, understand and dedicate their lives for it.
All these dignitaries visited India completely.
Before their performance, they tried to understand and know India.
They tried to live and see India among themselves.
Can our various states, communities, groups, their habits, their traditions, their manners, their food practices, and their beliefs be understood by the students as students or not
The value chain of tourism lies in making us a student and not just going through the journey.
I have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts in India.
The dream of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' has come true.
How many types of food are there
In the whole of your life, if you have every kind of food every day, then there will not be any chance of eating the same food again.
This is the greatest strength of our tourism.
During these holidays, not only are you going out of the house but you are also going for change, you should go out with the purpose of knowing and understanding things.
Your life will be fulfilled through these experiences.
Your vision will be broadened.
Tell me, who else can be a bigger Asan than your experiences
If you go this time too, you will take my mission forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share your photos.
Please send your photos to Incredibleindia.
If you meet the people there, send their photos as well.
There is an idea in my mind - to give a boost to the tourism sector in India, what are the 7 best tourist destinations in your state - every Indian should know about those 7 places in your state, if possible then go to those 7 places.
With the help of this, can you provide any information about this
Can we express it on the NarendraModiApp
Can we do this in a Credible India
If a large number of people from a state say this thing then I would like to inform the government about the seven places in each state in general and the kind of publicity that has been given.
That is, in a way, how can we take forward the tourist places with the views of the people
Similarly, you can imagine that the places where you have visited all over the country, of which you have the best 7 places, other people should visit this place and get information about these places. You must send those seven such places on MyGov and on NarendraModiApp.
Come, join me.
From October to March this year, you can become a catalyst in encouraging the country's tourism sector.
I'll call you.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch my heart.
I'm a man like you!
The events of the past few days might have touched your attention - the people of the country would have seen a wonderful example of women power and patriotism.
The Indian Army has been blessed with two brave soldiers - Lieutenant Swathi and Money - these are extraordinary heroes.
Why I say that they are extraordinary, they have lost their lives in the service of Bharat Mata.
When the world emerges at such a young age, you can imagine their mood
But the martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadik's wife, Swathi Mahadik, stood firm on the ground in the face of these difficult conditions and joined the Indian Army.
He trained hard for 11 months and joined the army and was involved in fulfilling his husband's dream.
Similarly, financial Dubey's husband, Mukesh Dubey, was serving as a slave in the army, who sacrificed his life in the service of the motherland, whose wife, Nidhi, filled with the frustration of joining the army, joined the army.
There is no doubt that every citizen will have respect for this mother power and these heroes of our country.
My dear countrymen, amidst the festival of Navratri and Diwali, there is a great opportunity for the younger generation of our country.
FIFA Under-17 World Cup will be held here.
I am confident that football is the echo of all sides.
The interest in football is going to increase for every generation.
Everyone should participate in this game to the extent that there are no football players in any school or college ground in India.
Come, as all the countries of the world come to play on Indian soil, let us make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, Navratri is going on.
It's time to worship Mother Durga.
The atmosphere is full of pure happiness.
All around there is a spiritual atmosphere, a festive atmosphere, a devout atmosphere.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to the countrymen and pray to Mother Barashakti, that the aspirations of the common man of the country should be fulfilled and the country should scale new heights.
The country should have the capability to face every challenge.
The nation should move forward at a fast pace, when India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022, the efforts to fulfil the dreams of the freedom fighters, the determination of the 125 crore countrymen, the relentless hard work, the super power and spirit, by completing 5 years of programmes for a New India, we should move forward with the blessings of Mother India.
My best wishes to you all.
Participate in festivals and spread slander.
This is the land where Buddha and Gandhi were born, the land where Sardar Patel was born with complete dedication for the unity of the nation.
For centuries, our ancestors have respected the values of life and non-violence, in our minds.
Ahimsa Paramodharma: We have heard and heard this sentence since our childhood.
This diversity is not seen only in food habits, habitats and clothing.
This diversity is seen in every activity of life.
You must have seen that all our festivals have been organized according to the schedule of nature.
All these things are directly related to nature.
Many of our festivals are associated with farmers and fishermen.
Today, while talking about the festivals with you, I would like to say - , michami tragedy for all of you.
The Jains celebrated the Samvatsari festival yesterday.
The festival of Purushan is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
Samvatsari comes on the last day of the celebrations.
This is, in fact, a wonderful tradition.
The day of Samvatsari marks forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
The festival symbolizes the era of unity, equality and cleanliness.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
Now the festival of Onam is celebrated in Kerala.
Onam festival of Kerala is one of the most colourful festivals of India.
Now our festivals have become a source of attraction for tourists.
I would like to tell the countrymen that be it the Navratri festival of Gujarat or the Durga festival in Bengal, these have become an attraction of tourism in a way.
Our other festivals also provide an opportunity to attract foreign nationals.
Let us think about what more we can do in this direction.
Id-ul-uha will be here in a few days.
At the same time, in the New India, festivals should also be a source of cleanliness.
Festivals and Swachhta are associated with family life.
Preparation of the festival is to focus on cleanliness and hygiene.
Although this is not a new thing for all of us, it is important to change it in a social way.
They paint colors, someone puts a vegetable color, someone puts a piece of paper on it.
Every family is doing a lot of work.
In a way, for the first time in this Ganesh festival, a massive exercise on environmental awareness has been started.
Three years ago, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission and three years are going to be completed by 2nd October.
Its positive results are coming out.
The toilet area has reached nearly 67 percent from 39 percent.
The people of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind have shown a great example of cleanliness, an example that inspires everyone.
If the efforts made with dedication and commitment towards cleanliness become our eternal nature then what peak can our country achieve
When we get the opportunity, where will we get the opportunity
But we all have to join this movement.
We think that this is a kind of preparation that was made before Deepavali, or the preparations that were made before Navratri or the preparations that were made before the Durga Puja.
We will do physical service.
Let us work together on holidays, on Sundays.
We will go to the adjacent habitations and go to the nearby villages, but we can do it as a mission.
I appeal to all NGOs, schools, colleges, social-cultural-political leaders, government officials, district collectors and panchayat leaders - 15 days before the birth anniversary of Gandhiji on October 2, 2018, we will create an atmosphere of cleanliness which in reality is the 2nd October of Gandhiji's dream.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
After the construction of the toilet, your name and the name of the person whom you helped in the construction of the toilet can be recorded in it.
My friends from the bottom of society can take up some constructive campaigns and you can create an inspiration to ensure the work at the ground level.
The Swachhta Pakhwada will be organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation on the theme - Victory in Cleanliness and Competition, Short Film making and Painting Competitions.
In this, you can write articles in many languages, there is no age limit.
You can produce a short film and produce it on your mobile phone.
It should be a 2-3 minute short film that will inspire cleanliness.
I invite all of you to join this movement related to cleanliness.
When we are celebrating the 2nd of October after 15 days of the Swachhata Hi Seva movement, then see how clean we can be and how clean we can be when we see the venerated Bapu, he added.
Millions of people write letters, give information, many are giving news through phone, and this is a great treasure for me.
This is a great opportunity to understand the minds of the countrymen.
The more you wait for Mann Ki Baat, the more I wait for your messages.
I am thirsty because every aspect of you provides me an opportunity to learn.
Yes, I too have made such a mistake.
Sometimes we dont even know how much things change naturally if we do wrong.
Prime Minister, I am talking to Aparna from Pune.
I'd like to talk to you about my friend:
She's always trying to help everyone, but one of her actions makes me nervous.
Once I had gone to the shopping complex with her.
She spent 2,000 rupees without any difficulty in buying a garment, then spent 450 rupees and bought Beatsa;
But the auto driver who used to come to the premises was seriously involved in a deal worth 5 rupees.
When she bought a vegetable on her way back, she made a deal at every vegetable price and saved 4-5 rupees.
I have a lot of trouble.
We buy things in big places without asking any question. We are fighting for the money of retail for our brothers and sisters who work hard and live.
After listening to this phone call, I am sure you will be astonished as well. You may be sure that I will not be able to walk like this anymore.
Have you ever thought about what would happen to the poor
My young friends, the entire country is going to celebrate 29th August as All-India Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of the hockey player, Major Dayanand ji.
His contribution to hockey is unparalleled.
I remember this thing because the youth of our country should associate themselves with sports.
Sports should become a part of our lives.
As we are the youngest nation in the world, we have to showcase our young talents in sports fields as well.
What else to say is that sports play for fitness, a conscious mind and personality development.
Sports is a way of connecting minds in a way.
I would like to assure the young generation of our country that they should move forward in the field of sports and that in today's computer world, the playground is more important than the computer.
I can play all the footballers in the computer, but I've seen football in the field.
You can play cricket in the computer, but in the field, play under the sky, its a matter of joy.
Once when all the children go out of the house then the mother will come back.
How this has changed in today's time when children come home, sitting in a corner, watching cartoons or getting drowned in mobile cameras
If there is any record in the field of sports, if any child of the country has talent, then they can get their details or videos on this portal.
The portal will be launched tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports to train selected and budding sports persons.
In India, the FIFA Under-17 World Football Cup is being organized from 6th to 28th October.
24 teams from all over the world are going to play in India.
Let us welcome young guests from many countries through sports, let us experience sports, let us create such an environment in our country.
While talking about sports, I would like to share with you about the events that touched my mind during the past weeks.
Six such women are working in the Navy.
Their feelings and motivation is an inspiration for all of us.
These 6 female assets are travelling in a small boat INS TARIN and are attempting to cross the seas.
The name given for this exercise is Navika Sagar Parikrama, i.e.
They will return to India after a gap of several months around the world.
Sometimes people spend about 40 days in water.
Sometimes one may have to spend about 30 days in water.
This is the first time in the world that six of our women are travelling in the sea with courage amidst the waves of the sea.
I too am making a special arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App and you are preparing to read it.
You must read it because it is a story full of courage, a story full of self-realization, and I am happy to share with you the experiences of these women's wealth.
My heartiest greetings and good wishes to these women.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Teachers Day on the 5th of September.
The former President of our country, Dr.
This is the birth anniversary of Radhakrishnan ji.
Although he was the President of the Republic, he kept himself a teacher throughout his life.
He always wanted to be a teacher.
He was devoted to education.
Although he was a lawyer, a statesman and the President of India, every moment he was a living teacher.
I remember him.
This time as we celebrate Teachers Day, shall we all take a pledge together
Due to his efforts, the events that have been successful in bringing about a change in the lives of every teacher will definitely be there in the life of every teacher.
If we make social efforts then we can bring about a change in the country and we can play a big role in that.
Let us learn to change, let us carry this mantra forward, let us come.
Anna's condition.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Institute of Research at the Howard University.
As an analyst, I have a special interest in financial inclusion and related social schemes.
The question I would like to ask you is, in 2014, when you had started Jan Dhan Yojana and in 2014, today, when three years have passed, whether India is financially more secure, whether its power has increased or whether this power expansion and facilities have reached our women, farmers, workers, villages and the hungry people, tell me, what is the point of view
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been asked about financial inclusion which has been the subject of discussion not only of India but of experts from all over the economic world.
On August 28, 2014, I had started this project with a dream in my mind.
With the launch of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana on 28th August, 2020, it will complete three years.
30 crore new families have been linked to this scheme and bank accounts have been opened.
This is more than the population of many countries of the world.
Sometimes, if money is lying in your hands, if it is in a bag, if it is in a house then you will feel like spending the money.
Through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, 65,000 crore rupees have been deposited in the banks by our poor.
In a way, this savings for the poor will be their strength in the future.
Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana provides insurance benefits to those who have opened their bank accounts.
Today, a new hope has arisen in the lives of the poor by paying a very simple fee of Rs. 1, 30 and Prime Minister Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana.
If the poor faces a problem in several families due to the payment of one rupee, if the family head dies, then that family gets Rs. 2 lakh.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, the Start Up Scheme, the Stand Up Scheme, has been able to provide loans to crores of youth irrespective of their caste, creed, class or class, youth who have studied on their own feet. Under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, the bank has been able to get money without any collateral.
They are not only standing on their own feet but are also engaged in successful efforts to provide employment to one or two people.
When some people from the banking sector had come to meet me in the last few days, they had said that they had got inspiration from a study on the benefits of the common man due to Jan Dhan Yojana, insurance schemes, RuPay card and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I will make every effort to bring these things to your notice.
These include media persons as well as events that make full use of them.
They can also interact with such people and give a new inspiration to the new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again, I extend my heartfelt condolences to all of you.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address in the 4th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 31.03.2020 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Rainfall is a time of plundering the hearts of the people.
Animals, birds, plants and nature all flower in the rainy season.
But sometimes when it rains, and when it rains, we come to know that what kind of destructive power is there with the water.
Mother Nature gives us life, nurtures us all, but at times there are natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, and their terrible appearance causes a lot of destruction.
Changing weather and climate change are also having a negative impact.
In the last few days, some parts of India, particularly in Assam, North East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and parts of Bengal, had to face natural calamities due to heavy rains.
Full surveillance of flood affected areas is being done.
The State Governments are also making great efforts to help the flood affected people.
Social organizations, cultural institutions, and sensitive citizens who are serving us, are also making every effort to help the people in this situation.
Farming, animal husbandry, infrastructure, roads, electricity and communication systems are also affected.
In particular, in order to compensate the loss of crops and crops of our farmer brothers and sisters, we have made schemes for the quick completion of the demand for compensation to the insurance companies, particularly the crop insurance companies.
In addition, 1078, which is a 24-hour and operational aid system, is fully operational to deal with the flood situation.
People are making their own efforts in this direction.
Before the start of monsoon, training was conducted in a large number of locations and the entire Government machinery was put on standby.
The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams were mobilized.
They were trained in disaster response mechanisms, in what to do, in what to do, in what not to do, in determining volunteers, creating a peoples organization and working in such situations.
Now the weather is predicted earlier, technology has grown and space science plays a major role in predicting it, and this gives us an almost accurate forecast.
Slowly, according to the weather forecast, we should make our actions better and also save ourselves from the impact of disasters.
Whenever I am getting ready for Mann Ki Baat, I can see the people of our country engaged in preparing themselves for it.
This time, there have been a lot of letters and phone calls regarding the Goods and Services Tax.
Even today, people have expressed their happiness and expectations about this Goods and Services Tax.
Listen to this phone call: Namaste, Prime Minister, I am talking to Garg from Gurugram.
When a month has passed, are you expecting the results?
In this regard, I would like to share your thoughts, thank you.
It has been almost a month since the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax.
I can see how this new system has impacted the transport and services sector.
Goods are also reaching faster.
Despite this facility, it has added strength to the economic momentum especially.
Due to the separate tax structure which was earlier there, a large majority of the transport and service sector used to spend only on maintaining resources and documents, and in every state they had to establish new bases for themselves.
Goods and Services Tax - Good and Simple Tax - this tax, which I have said, has really made a very positive impact on our economic system in a very short time.
The speed at which the change has been brought about, the speed at which the innovations and the new records have been made, all these things have created a new hope in the entire country.
This will become a model study in many of the world universities.
This is because, in such a big way, such a big change, with the involvement of crores of people, the successful implementation of this system in such a big country, can be considered a great success.
S.D.
All States have a role and responsibility in implementation of the GST.
All decisions and decisions have been taken in a unanimous manner by the Centre and the States.
What was the price of a particular commodity that was mentioned through the app, how much was it done before the system, how it was after the new system, all these things are available on your mobile phones.
This is a historic victory, a historic achievement.
This is in a way a social reform movement.
I salute the crores of people of the country who have made such a great effort possible and have made it a natural success.
My dear countrymen, the month of August marks the anniversary of the revolution.
Naturally, we have been hearing about this thing since childhood and the reason is that the Non-Cooperation Movement was started on 1st August, 1920.
Later, on 9th August, 1942, the uit India Movement began and we consider it an August Revolution.
Next year, on 15th August, 1947, the country became independent.
In a way, many events in the month of August are particularly connected to the history of liberation.
This year we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But he made the slogan of 'Quit India'.
Only a few people know that Yusuf Meherally.
Our new generation should know what happened on the 9th of August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of the country associated themselves with the freedom struggle, and the historical pages of those who linked themselves to the atrocities, should inspire us to build a glorious India.
What else can be a bigger inspiration than the sacrifices and dedication of our freedom fighters
The uit India Movement is an important struggle of the Indian Freedom Movement.
It was this struggle that made the entire nation, free from the British rule.
It was during that period that every corner of India, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every village, every city, every educated or illiterate, every poor or rich person, everyone came together shoulder to shoulder and participated in the uit India Movement against the British rule.
People's anger was at its peak.
Hundreds of thousands of countrymen listened to Gandhiji's call and took the struggle forward by following the mantra of Do or Die in my heart.
Millions and millions of youth of the country sacrificed their studies and books on the freedom movement.
The saga of independence was heard and they moved forward.
The contribution of the great personalities like Lohia and Jayprakash Narayan was immense.
In the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920 and the uit India Movement of 1942, two different dimensions of Gandhi Ji were reflected in both.
The dimensions of cooperation are different: In 1942, as much as the desire for independence, a great man like Gandhiji had to put forward the mantra of do or die.
The freedom struggle, which started in 1857, continued till 1942 every moment in some part of the country.
This long period of time had created a desire for independence in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was determined to do something.
Generations have changed, but there is no relaxation in the resolve.
People continued to come, engaged themselves, travelled, new ones came, they were associated with themselves, they tried to keep the British rule out, they tried to keep them away from the country.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle had created a new stage and it took this situation to its peak in 1942.
In 1947, within 5 years, the British had to leave the country.
From 1857 to 1942, the demand for independence had reached all the people.
This five years from 1942 to 1947, when it became a manifestation of the will and determination of the people, these five years have resulted in the liberation of the nation.
These 5 years are the years of your determination.
Now I want to connect you with this account.
In 1947, we achieved independence.
Today we are in 2017.
It's been almost 70 years.
The governments came here.
Institutions grew, changed, flowered and developed.
Everyone has tried their own way to get the country out of its problems.
Efforts were made to increase employment in the country, to eliminate poverty and to develop development.
Efforts were made in their own way.
Success has also been achieved.
On the 15th of August this year, we should celebrate the 15th of August as the best day to celebrate, and on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the independence of the country in 2022, we must have achieved the success of this solemn pledge.
On the 9th of August, 1.25 billion people of this country, on the 15th of August, in the memory of the revolutionary day of the 125 crore people, on the 15th of August, as an individual and as a citizen, I will do this as a family, as a society, I will do this as a city, I will do this as a government department, I will do this as a government and I will do this as a government.
Crores of people must take a pledge.
Efforts should be made to fulfil such resolutions.
Just as the five years between 1942 and 1947 were a decisive year for the country's independence, similarly, these five years from 2017 to 2022 will continue to be years of determining the future course of India.
Five years from now, we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of our independence.
Every citizen, every social organization, every local body, every school, every college, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every citizen, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every institution, every citizen, every institution, every institution, every institution,
May this pledge become a success in the next 5 years, the Prime Minister said.
What goal should we achieve as a country
As an individual, what can be my contribution in that
Using technology, come forward with videos, Posts, Blockchains, articles and new ideas.
Let us make this movement a peoples movement.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address in the 4th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 28.03.2020 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
This quiz competition is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to make them aware of the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am confident that you will spread and disseminate this message well.
My dear countrymen, on the 15th of August, as the Prime Servant of the country, I got the opportunity to talk to the nation from the Red Fort.
I'm an instrument.
I myself have read them and on the 15th of August I will try to express them as much time as I have.
I was accused in front of me that the speeches delivered by me on August 15 last three times had been a bit longer.
I try to make rules for myself and I don't know if I can or not.
But I have a desire to try this time as to how to make my speech brief.
I can see if I get success or not.
My dear countrymen, I would like to talk to you about one more thing.
India's economic system consists of a social economy.
We should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals, are not just occasions for joy and happiness.
Our festivals and celebrations are also a movement for social renaissance.
But besides this, every festival of ours is directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
A few days later, Raksha Bandhan, Krishna Jayanti, Pillayar Chaturthi, Chaudha Chandra, Anant Chaturdasi, Durga Puja and Deepavali will come together.
They connect the individual and the society.
The normal journey between the two is continuing.
Ah, that is, an opportunity to move forward from the position of 'I' to 'I'.
As an economy, several families have started making Rakhis as small cottage industry even months before the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Various types of rockets are being developed from cotton to silken threads.
But today people have started liking homemade rockets as well.
It is directly related to the poor artisans who make small lamps.
But today while talking about festivals and the economic condition of the poor related to these things, I also want to make it clear about the environment.
Sometimes I see that the countrymen are more aware and positive than I am.
Over the last one month, conscious citizens have been writing letters to me about the environment.
You should talk about the environment-friendly child before the birth of the child so that the desire for the child on the soil could be increased.
First of all, I express my gratitude to such a conscious citizen.
At the same time, it is our commitment to create eco-friendly and clay making child revolutions to protect the environment.
This time I have said a lot in advance:
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the various festivals to come.
A few days ago, our women had done a wonderful job in the Cricket World Cup for women.
This week, I got the opportunity to meet all of them.
I was very happy to interact with them, but I could feel the burden on them that they could not win the World Cup.
This pressure on their faces covered the crisis.
I gave them a different estimate from my side.
Look, today's time is a media world, expectations are increased, the way the success is not achieved, it becomes angry.
If the players of India fail, we have seen the anger of the country on those players.
Not only this, they praised and honoured the accomplishments of these women.
In fact, the youth of our country, especially women, are engaged in several things to make the nation proud.
Once again, I convey my heartiest congratulations and best wishes to the young community, especially to our women.
We all have to take the country towards new heights, take it and take it to new heights.
Come on, let's travel together and do something.
Let us move forward with the hope that the future of the country will surely be better.
Many good wishes.
The weather is changing.
It is very likely to become gale wind speed reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph over eastcentral Arabian Sea.
No matter how difficult it may be in life, no matter how difficult it may be, we can feel that there is a positive change in the mindset of all of us in personal life, in public life and in the coming days.
The poor of the country is spiritually associated with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
There is a word called juggarnaut in English which means a special chariot which cannot be stopped by anyone.
It was only when we saw it in the dictionary that this term Jagarnaud was derived from Jagannath's Rath Yatra.
When we look at all these things, we can understand how the world has embraced this greatness in its own way.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on the auspicious occasion of Jagannath Yatra. I bow down to Lord Jagannath on the auspicious occasion of Jagannath Ji.
Come, let us together take inspiration from these sacred festivals and share the joys of happiness and take the country forward on the path of development.
In this holy month of Ramazan, a very inspiring event has come to our attention in the village of Mubarakpur of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
There are about 3500 Muslim brothers and sisters living in this small village along with their families. There are a large number of Muslim brothers and sisters.
In this month of Ramzan, the villagers decided to collectively build a toilet.
Therefore, you people have said that you can spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for the change of this holy occasion of Ramzan in the interest of society.
We are aware that in our country, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already declared themselves free from open defecation.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have been declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my special gratitude to the administration, administration and the people of these five states.
We know that if we want to do something good, whether it is for personal or social life, we must work hard for it.
If we think that our signature is bad and we should correct it then we should be careful for a long time and try to do it.
Only then will it become a physical and mental habit.
Similarly, some other bad habits have naturally become ours.
We should draw the attention of everyone.
Let us remember once again the inspiring events.
I am glad that today cleanliness is not confined to the government level.
It has become a movement of the people's society.
This happened in the Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
What is its goal?
In 100 hours, toilets will be constructed in 10,000 households in 71 Gram Panchayats.
My dear countrymen, the message that the people and the government together have succeeded in constructing 10000 toilets in 100 hours is a matter of happiness for you.
They are coming in, through letters and Akashwani.
Remembering the Emergency, on 25th June, the Prime Minister described the Emergency, as one of the greatest milestones in the history of democracy.
Prakash Tripathi jis awareness of democracy is commendable. Democracy is not just an institution, it is a culture.
At the same time, we have to take forward the good things of democracy.
On the 25th of June 1975, it is a dark night and no one can easily forget it.
No Indian can dismiss it.
The greatest leaders of the country, including Jai Prakash Narayan, were jailed.
Today, the students of the world and the civil servants of the people of the world are making continuous efforts to spread awareness and to remind them of that difficult time again.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
One year after the Emergency was declared in the country, Atal ji wrote a poem describing the situation prevailing in the country at that time.
We have to make this tradition even more robust.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian feels proud by standing head on.
On the 21st of June 2017, the whole world was yogic.
People from water to mountains welcomed the sun rays early in the morning through yoga.
Yoga was not there earlier, but today everyone has joined the thread of Yoga and Yoga has become a bridge to connect the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have converted this opportunity into their own opportunity.
More than 4,000 people participated in Yoga at Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and 2,400 metres above sea level in Machu Bichu, the world heritage site of Peru.
In the Harare of Afghanistan, India's Afghan friend, engaged in Yoga at Salma Dam and created a new gram of love for the friend.
Even in a small place like Singapore, 70 places have been organized and they have taken up this campaign for a week.
This time again, Yoga has made the world a record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, nearly 55 thousand people have together done yoga and have created a new world record.
I also got the opportunity to study Yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time, Yoga has become a good opportunity in the rainy season.
Even in Siachen, 20, 25, 40 degrees Celsius, our soldiers are engaged in Yoga.
Our Army, BSF, ITBP, CRPF personnel, CRPF personnel, CRPF personnel, CRPF personnel and CISF personnel are all doing their duty and Yoga practice.
Since this is the 3rd International Day of Yoga, I had requested the families of the three generations to share the message of Yoga with me.
Some TV channels also carried the matter forward.
A lot of people have sent me photos and some of them have been compiled through the Narendra Modi App.
Hon'ble Prime Minister, I belong to Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
Anil Sonara.
Sir, I recall what you had recently said in Kerala that instead of bouquet at various places, we should give good books as a souvenir.
Can we do anything to implement this idea throughout the country, sir
I liked it a lot.
I am reminded of one thing that escaped from my memory.
This is because when I was in Gujarat, we used to develop a method that we should not offer flowers any more, provide books or welcome them with a handkerchief.
We will also give Khadi handcuffs because it will give a boost to the Khadi.
When I was in Gujarat, it had become a habit. But when I came from there, this habit of getting rid of it has become a reality.
But when I went to Kerala, once again I got an awareness.
But when we provide books, in a way it becomes a part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
We can also welcome Kedar kutcha, and how many poor people have benefitted from it
Reduction in expenditure also works in the right manner.
These things have a great historical significance.
Last year when I was in England, Queen Elizabeth Mother of England invited me to the banquet in London.
He said in a loud voice that Gandhiji had lit a lamp in his eyes, and when he was married, Gandhiji gave me the gift of this handkerchief.
Many years have passed, but Elizabeth Rani kept the handcuffs of Gandhiji safe.
One of Gandhijis little love has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
These habits do not change in the night, and because of this, they are also subject to criticism.
At the same time, efforts should be made to engage in such interactions.
For this, if I go anywhere, if someone brings a bouquet then I will not refuse to accept it.
The criticism will rise, we have to repeat, and gradually a change will take place.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister of the country, there are a lot of offices.
Even if I have to be immersed in the files, I am making a habit, that is, by reading some of the letters that I have received, I am giving an opportunity to connect with the common man.
There are a variety of letters and a lot of people write letters to me.
I feel that a few days ago, there was a need to share a letter with you.
Therefore, under the Mudra scheme, I have started the work of getting money from the bank and buying some goods from the market.
Meanwhile, my focus has been on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), Government of India.
Whoever wants to provide something to the government, whoever wants to sell it, whether it is electric bulbs, garbage dumps, sanitation, chairs, tables, etc, they can register themselves on this platform.
It has been made mandatory for the government departments to visit the platform and buy the goods at a lower price, considering the quality of the goods they offer.
In such a scenario, all the departments of the government are being taken care of who is registering on e-GeM.
Due to lack of middlemen, the goods are available at cheap rates.
This is an opportunity to give a boost to entrepreneurship.
It has a transparent nature, it has empowerment as well as an entrepreneur.
I wish that all those who want to sell their products to the government, they should register themselves on this portal in large numbers.
My dear countrymen, while we are proud of Yoga, our achievements in space science have also touched our hearts.
The greatest specialty of India is that while our legs are placed on a land connected with yoga, we are fulfilling the dream of seeing a distance from a distance.
In the past, India has made great strides in sports and science.
Today, India is seeking its success not only on the earth but also on the moon.
Two days ago, ISRO successfully launched 30 Nano satellites along with Cartosat-2 satellite.
In addition to India, these satellites include about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
This Nano-satellite mission of India will be helpful in the field of agriculture and in the field of natural hazards.
Crossing 1000 days is an important milestone in our scientific journey.
Now we can see that our youth are making great strides in the field of sports.
Apart from education, they also realize their future in the field of sports.
The country is proud of our sportspersons, their efforts and their achievements.
Recently, India's Badminton player, Ktampi Srikanth, won the Indonesia Open Championship and made the country proud.
I heartily congratulate him and his team for this achievement.
T.
Sports plays a major role in overall governance development.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If the children of our family are engaged in sports, then we should give them an opportunity.
They should not be forced to leave the field, shut in the room and study.
Let him study, let him progress, but if he has more talent and interest in sports, let him inspire the school, the college, the family, and the neighbourhood.
Everyone should dream of participating in the next Olympics.
Once again, my countrymen, the period of rainy season and the festival of festivals is the time to experience new things in a way.
Once again, my best wishes to you all and I join you in the next Mann Ki Baat.
The heat of summer this year is an unforgettable experience.
At the same time, we are looking for rain.
Today, as I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has begun.
On the auspicious occasion of Ramazan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the people of the Islamic community.
In the month of Ramadan, prayer, spirituality and devotion have been given considerable importance.
It is a matter of pride for 1.25 billion people of our country that India has all the religions of the world.
We should be fortunate that our ancestors have given us this great tradition.
There are those who believe in God, there are those who deny God, there are those who worship idols, and those who oppose the worship of the statue.
The art that unites us with a variety of ideas, a variety of forms of worship and a variety of traditions.
Be it religion, process, philosophy, traditions, all these things give us the only message - peace, unity, harmony.
This holy month of Ramadan will help us to move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you.
I am glad that a lot of people have registered their backs.
Everyone wants to share their experiences with me personally.
The Prime Minister said, "I am speaking at the Akshaya-Gatial.
I decided to study in the holidays, when the habit of reading has almost disappeared from me.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I realized that how many sacrifices and struggles had to be carried out for India's independence, how many freedom fighters had suffered from the torture of the prisoners.
I appeal to you that the life of Bhagat Singh, who had made the biggest achievement at a very young age, inspired me and you should send a message to the present generation about this thing.
I am glad that the younger generation is eager to know about our history, about our freedom fighters and about the physical, material and spiritual sacrifices made for this nation.
Innumerable men have lost their youth in prisons.
Several youngsters touched the roof with joy.
It is because of their unspeakable sorrow that today we are able to breathe the wind of a free India.
Those great men who had spent all their time in the freedom struggle had written books, had studied, had done a lot of work, their writing too had played a major role in India's independence.
Several years ago, I had visited the Cellular Jail in Andaman Nicobar.
Today is Veer Savarkar's birthday.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote the book Maji Janmade in prison.
He wrote poems on the prison walls.
They locked him in a small room.
Do you know what atrocities were committed by the freedom fighters
I got the urge to visit the Cellular Jail after I had read the book Majiji Janmade- the book written by Savarkar.
There is an audio-visual demonstration which is very inspiring.
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, known as Kalabani, sacrificed their youth in the solitary confinement cell, belonged to all the states, speaking in all languages of India, and faced many hardships.
My dear countrymen, 5th June is the first Monday of the month.
Well, what does it mean to connect with nature
For me, we have to connect and connect with us.
To connect with nature is to create a better planet.
Who can express it better than Gandhiji.
Gandhiji once said - One must care about a world one will not see: It is our duty to take care of the world we cannot see, the world we cannot see.
You too must have experienced that nature has the power to me.
Sometimes you would have come with a lot of tiredness, so if you spray water on your face then think of what kind of freshness you have received
When our body is formed by the famine then a new energy comes in contact with the famine.
That is why, on the 5th of June, the global movement of connecting with nature, we have to become a movement to connect with us.
The Vedas have shown the Earth and the environment as the basis of energy.
In a way, the Vedas give us complete guidance on the environment, a book that is thousands of years old.
: - : - Mother Earth: - , - , , , : , , : , , : , , : , , : , : , , : , : , , : , , : , , : , , , : , , : , , : , : , : , : , , : , : , , : , , : , : , , , : , , , , : , , , , : , , : , , , , , , : , : , , : , , : , : , , , , , : , , , , : , , ,
It has been said in the scriptures that cleanliness in our possession is due to the earth.
In our country, there are many festivals, many cults - those who have no faith - those who have no faith - those who have no faith - those who have no faith - those who have no faith - those who have no faith - those who have no faith - those who have no faith - those who have no faith - those who have no faith - those who have no faith - those who have no faith in nature, those who have no faith - those who have no faith in nature.
However, we need to understand it in contemporary terms and in contemporary contexts.
There are several news reports coming to me from the states.
In almost all the states, a massive campaign of tree plantation has started immediately after the rains.
Crores of trees are being planted.
This time too, we have to give more importance and contribution to tree plantation during this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has become a day of global recognition.
In the form of World Yoga Day, everyone in the world is celebrating it.
In a short span of time on 21st June, it has spread across the globe and is connecting people of the world.
On the one hand, while the world's separatist forces are showing their worst face, India's biggest gift to the world is Yoga.
Through Yoga, we can connect the world with one another.
Just as yoga connects the body, mind, intellect and soul, similarly it can connect the world with Yoga.
Today, because of the life style, because of the emergency, due to the increasing responsibilities, due to stress, life is becoming increasingly difficult.
We see this situation in our youth as well.
Yoga can help us to lead a stress-free life while taking incompatible medicines and passing the days.
Yoga is the perfect guarantee for both health and fitness.
Yoga is not just an exercise.
If we want to experience such internal travel by body, mind, thought and practice, then it is possible only through yoga.
Two days ago, letters have been written to all the governments and leaders of the world on the occasion of Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some contests and prizes related to Yoga.
Slowly the work is going on in this direction.
I have been given advice and I congratulate those who have given this basic suggestion.
This is a very interesting thing.
I have been asked that on the occasion of the 3rd International Yoga Day, three generations of the family will come together to practice Yoga.
Three generations of people like grandfather, mother-father, son-in-law can do yoga and this can be done.
Tomorrow, as tomorrow, it will be a pleasant combination, and a new dimension of yoga.
It will be tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow's film that will guarantee a bright future.
I invite you all.
Since the International Day of Yoga is still three weeks away, start the practice from today itself.
You too, for your part, share the topics related to yoga, spread and connect with the people.
In a way, this is a pre-existing health care mission.
I invite you all to join this movement.
Since then, I have been touring different parts of India.
I have seen that some people are very careful about what Modi has done.
An interesting phone call came to me, and I didn't think of what it said.
But I thank you for giving me such a different perspective.
I hope that this phone call will also make you feel the same.
Namaskar Modi, I am speaking from Naina from Mumbai.
Wherever you go, the people there are paying more attention to cleanliness. I have often seen it on TV and social websites.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, the people who have listened to your invitation have started making cleanliness a mass movement.
On the one hand, there has been awareness about cleanliness among the children as well.
I have seen that many times their elders are spitting in the streets.
After the launch of the cleanliness campaign in the Ghats of Kashi, you have received inspiration from you people and it has taken the shape of a glorious form.
You are right, wherever I go, the government machinery performs the task of cleaning, but today cleanliness is also happening at the community level.
Sufficient cleaning is being done 5 days, 7 days or 10 days before I go.
A few days ago, I had visited Kutch in Gujarat.
A massive cleanliness drive was organized there.
I didn't connect this thing, but only after I got this phone call, I realized that yes, this thing is right.
It is indeed heartening to note that all other preparations made to welcome the Prime Minister have been made by the Muslims, but the importance of cleanliness is commendable.
This is a matter of happiness for anyone who wants cleanliness. It is inspiring.
I convey my warm greetings to all those who are strengthening the cause of cleanliness.
Someone has given me an advice.
That's a funny suggestion.
The idea is fine but I have to think about it.
What is the need for a movement is right, it is better that I remove so many tons of garbage from the garbage instead of gifting it.
The Government of India, with the help of the State Governments, has decided to organize a massive campaign on waste management with the help of city representatives.
On World Environment Day, June 5th, around 4000 cities in the country will have access to solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of garbage are to be placed, one in green, the other in blue.
Two types of effluents discharges one liquid discharge and a dry discharge.
We have to follow the rules, we have to place garbage in 4000 cities, we have to put dry waste in a blue basket, we have to put liquid waste into green dustbins.
In case of toilet waste, vegetable waste, residues of food, eggs, leaves of trees etc., all of these wastes should be kept in the clean dustbin.
When we remember the greenery of the fields, we remember what to do with the green garbage dumps.
The second category of waste is paper sludge, card boxes, iron sludge, glass bottles, cloths, plastics, polythene, broken caps, rubber objects, metal etc. all these are to be reused in dry garbage dumplings and are to be recycled in machines.
A few days ago, one thing had fallen into the ear, and the Versova beach in Mumbai, which is considered an unclean beach, has now turned into a clean and beautiful beach.
United Nations Environment Programme - UNEP gave Afroz Shah a huge award for this work.
He is the first Indian to receive the Champions of the Earth award.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days and months, there have been articles on newspaper, TV channels, and on social media about the three years of the present government, discussions and analysis are underway.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of a major servant.
A number of surveys have been carried out and a number of opinion polls have come up.
I see these as very healthy symptoms.
In the last three years, every speech was delivered.
People from all strata of society have also studied it.
This is a very important function of the democratic system.
The responsibility of the governments to answer the questions of the people in a democracy should be based on my clear and precise opinion and the work done by the people of the Mahesars.
I would like to express my gratitude to all those who have spent time, who have taken a keen interest in our work, who have given their suggestions, who have given up their grievances, and who have given up their work. I consider these things very important.
I also express my gratitude to all those who have made significant contribution in this regard.
There is a chance of reform only when those crimes are committed, when they are exposed.
Whether it is good or less, whether it is bad or bad, whether it is good, whether it is good, whether it is good, whether it is good, whether it is good, whether it is good, whether it is good, whether it is good, whether it is good, whether it is good, whether it is good, whether it is good or not, whether it is good, whether it is good or not, whether it is good or not, you can make progress.
Constructive criticism strengthens democracy.
This quest and research is very important for an enlightened nation.
My dear countrymen, as an ordinary citizen like you, as an ordinary citizen, as an ordinary citizen, everything that is bad is bad, just like any ordinary citizen has affected me.
Some people see Mann Ki Baat as a dialogue, some criticize it from the political perspective, but when I started it, I didnt even think that Mann Ki Baat will change me as a member of every family of India, I feel it after a very long experience.
I am told that I am talking about the things in the house while sitting at home in the middle of some family.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and all the dignitaries present here who have laid down their golden time and gave importance to the Mann Ki Baat.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given me a new dimension.
While some of our friends were engaged in the work on Mann Ki Baat, I had sometimes spoken to me.
I have been indebted to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, the next time we meet, there will be rains in all parts of the country, the weather will change, the results of the exams will come, and learning will begin again.
Come, let us together, in this environment, love nature and move forward.
My best wishes to you all.
Every time such powerful inputs are received in Mann Ki Baat, detailed reviews are being done on behalf of the Government.
What kind of complaints are there, what is the experience of the people
We generally see that it is the nature of human beings to provide advice to others.
When we travel in trains, in buses and when someone gets coughing then it is our nature to give advice and advice to someone to do it.
In the beginning when Mann Ki Baat had been suggested, suggestions had been given to many people that it could be a habit but when we tried to approach it, I was really delighted to be in the flood.
When I mentioned this then on the Narendra Modi App, on MyGov, all the people of the country used to come up with innovative ways to ensure that food is not wasted
I have not even thought that the younger generation of our country has been engaged in this work for a long time.
We have been aware that some social organizations have been doing it for years but the youth of my country is engaged in it.
Many people have sent me videos.
Roti banks are run in many places.
People are donating their roti in the bank, they are supplying vegetables to people who need it, they come and receive it.
The person who gives happiness, the buyer does not need to consider himself low.
This is an example of how to work in collaboration with society.
Today is the last day of the month of April.
The institutional day of Gujarat and Maharashtra is coming in the month of May.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both states are constantly striving to scale new heights of development and have contributed to the progress of the nation.
In both the states, there has been a continuous presence of great personalities and their lives have inspired us in every field of the society.
Remembering these great men, let us resolve to raise our states, our nation, our society, our city, and our family to a new level by 2022, when we mark 75 years of independence.
We have to make that pledge a reality and we have to move forward with the cooperation of all the citizens.
I once again convey my best wishes to the people of both the states.
There was a time when climate change was a matter of concern only at the level of academicians and seminars, but today, in our daily lives, we experience this and it is a matter of great wonder.
Nature has changed the course of its performance.
In the months of May-June, we are experiencing the temperature in our country in the months of March-April this year.
While I was looking at the people's suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, most of the suggestions were about what we should do during the summer.
Although all things are known and not new, but at the right time it will be very useful to think again.
Prashant Kumar Mishra, D.
They said that water should be kept in the balcony and on the upper floor.
I have seen that even small kids in the family are doing this thing very well.
If they ask why they should fill the water, they would leave it ten times in a day, if there is water in the pot.
And they would not only come and drink water, but would also be careful to see if they would come and drink.
It may appear as a game, but in reality, the young minds are getting a wonderful experience of compassion.
In our country, living in harmony with birds and nature is natural, our nerves are connected, but at the same time it is important to strengthen the efforts at the community level.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, it took 100 years for the Dharmaguru Syedna Sahib of the Dawoodi Bohra community.
He lived for 103 years.
In order to celebrate his 100 years, the Bohra community has organized a massive campaign to protect the gurus through the Purhani Trust.
It was also included in the Guinness World Records book.
Sometimes we forget to hear that whosoever comes to our house like a milkman, a vegetable vendor, a postman, who drinks a lot of water in this summer heat.
My young friends, I would like to share some of the things with you.
Sometimes I feel that many of our younger generation want to live in a comfortable place and in a carefree environment.
Mothers keep them in a safe and secure manner.
There are other people in this kind of affection, but most of them are in luxury circles.
Now the exams are over and you must have made plans to spend the holidays.
After the heat is gone, the summer holidays will be a bit more pleasant.
I offer three suggestions to make good use of the holiday, out of which only three are special if you implement it, but I try to do something of it.
Get a new experience, try and achieve a new skill, come and decide to go to a place where no one has heard or seen, where no one has known or known.
New places, new experiences and new skills will be available.
Testing must be positive, come out of your luxury circle.
We belong to the middle class families and belong to a happy family.
In the evening, take your parents and kids and take other games and go to the habitation area of the poorest of the poor.
You will feel the joy of playing with the poor children of that place so far while playing with you people.
Have you ever thought how big a change would happen when such poor children who are living in the society get the joy of playing with you
If you go once you want to go there again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many voluntary organizations are engaged in the service.
You should connect with Google Guru for 15 days or 20 days and connect with any other organization.
Sometimes summer camps will be held, governance development camps will be held, various positive camps will be organized, so that you can connect with them.
After attending such camps, after being selected for free, as a service, teach the poor people that you have learnt and no opportunity to learn.
You can teach them how to do it.
While technology is considered to be a means to reduce distances and to cut down borders, the harmful effects of these things are tearing my mind.
Six people are sitting in one room in the same house but they could not even imagine the distance between them.
Why?
Everyone is immersed in technology.
Social nature is a good value, social nature is a power.
The other thing I have said is about skills.Do you want to learn something new
Sometimes there is a fear that our younger generation is becoming a robot.
Our younger generation lives in machine-driven life Friends, the dreams that we dream of rising up in life, are all good things.
But we should not interfere with the human elements within us, we should be careful not to leave our humanity behind.
Can we not pay any attention to skill development
A little away from technology, we are trying to spend time with us.
If you don't know how to swim then you can learn swimming, learn painting, do not come out very well, but you can learn magic in paper!
The feelings within you will begin to reflect in it.
You will feel that all these skills and activities will not only give you happiness, but will also remove the shackles that have kept you on one side.
Do something differently, friends
This is your opportunity to make your lives easier.
After completion of all the examinations, when I came to a new stage in your career, if you thought that I had learnt all these things then that opportunity was not available to you.
Therefore, I would like to tell you that there is a magic learner and you can learn a ticket table.
Please do this to your friends.
If there is something you dont know, try to learn it, it will definitely benefit you.
Enlighten the positive energy inside you, which will provide a wonderful platform for development.
I share with you what I have seen in my experience. Friends, we cant imagine how many things we can learn in the world.
There are many new places, new cities, new villages and new areas.
Don't worry about traveling too much.
Go to one place and spend 3-4 days there and then go to the next place and spend 3-4 days there.
This will give you a lot of things to learn.
Friends, This time the Indian government has given you a very good opportunity.
The new generation has almost made cash transactions.
Whatever you are engaged in, but you can earn through this scheme, do you know about a scheme of the Government of India
But one can recommend this to another.
You can link the other people with it and if a new person makes three transactions through it then you will get an income of 10 rupees for that.
The government will add 10 rupees to your account.
If you add 20 people in a day, you will get 200 rupees in your stay in the evening.
Traders can also earn through it and students can also earn through it.
The scheme will remain open till 14th October, 2018.
You will be contributing towards making a Digital India.
You are the protectors of New India.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Saluting the Prime Minister, I am speaking from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I'd like to talk about the rotating red light.
I dont want to get stuck in the traffic jam and I dont need to wait for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this decision taken by you people.
The government's decision to remove the red light is an institutional step.
But this culture that has been instilled in us must be rooted out.
If all of us work together with awareness then this can be overcome.
When I say that, my aim is clear - Every person is important, every person is important.
If we accept the importance of 1.25 billion Indians, if we realise the importance of 1.25 billion Indians, then it will be a great strength to realise even the greatest dreams.
We all have to do this together.
This year we are celebrating the 1000th anniversary of the 125 crore countrymen, the 1000th birth anniversary of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.
For some reason, we were trapped inside the pits, we were very small and we used to think more about centuries.
Centuries in other countries of the world are also considered important.
Just imagine.
Even today, it is so difficult to break down the social conditions
How could it have been a thousand years ago
It is known to some that Ramanujacharya had unleashed a great struggle against the caste system against the bitterness of the society, against the feeling of being exalted and oppressed.
He embraced and performed those whom the society considered to be untouched by evil, through their actions.
A thousand years ago, he started a movement to enter the temple and successfully entered the temple.
On 1st May, the Government of India will release a postal stamp to commemorate the memory of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.
I respectfully bow down to Saint Shri Ramanujacharya and offer my reverence to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, the 1st of May is an important one.
Labour Day is celebrated in many parts of the world.
When it comes to working day, there is talk of labour and workers, and naturally I am reminded of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
We are grateful to Baba Saheb for the facilities and the respect that he has received from the workers today.
Baba Sahebs contribution in the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb and Saint Shri Ramanujacharya, we have got the opportunity to remember the great saint and social reformer of Karnataka, Jagadguru Basaveshwara who lived in the 12th century.
It also got the opportunity to release a volume of his speeches.
In the Kannada language of the 12th century, he spoke deeply about the working and working people.
In Kannada, he has called Gaya Kave Kailas, which means that you can achieve Lord Shiva's Kailas only through hard work, i.e.
When we talk about the working people, it is natural for Datopantha Thangadi to think about them.
My dear countrymen, a few days later, we are going to celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world celebrate it as a festival.
The thoughts of Lord Buddha are relevant in view of the world's violence, war, destruction and armed conflict.
The life of Ashoka in India is an excellent example of the rise of Buddha by breaking down the war.
This great day of Buddha Purnima is celebrated by the United Nations on the occasion of Vesak Day.
The festival is scheduled to take place in Sri Lanka this year.
On this auspicious day, I pay my tributes to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka and pay my respects to him.
We particularly speak for our neighbours.
We want our neighbours to be connected and they should move forward.
There are many possibilities.
On 5th May, India will launch the South Asia Satellite.
The capability and the facilities in this satellite will significantly help the economic and developmental activities of South Asia.
This is a perfect example of our quest for South Asia.
In every corner of the country, many families are in the process of preparing for the selection of their children.
Today is the 26th of March.
It is a matter of pride for us that Rabindra Nath Tagore and his thoughts are with all of us.
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 was unleashed, at that time Rabindranath Tagore was one of those men who raised their voice against the massacre.
The massacre had a profound impact on the mind of a 12-year-old boy.
Three days before that on 23rd March the British had hanged Bhagat Singh and his brothers Sukhdev and Rajguru .
When this tragedy happened on 23rd March, the faces of the martyrs Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were filled with happiness and joy. There was no fear of death.
They gave all the dreams of life as a sacrifice for the freedom of Mother India.
All of us are inspired by these three things even today.
We cannot put the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
The entire British Empire was trembled at the sight of these three.
They were imprisoned and sentenced to death, but the British were worried about how to deal with them.
Several years ago, when I got the opportunity to visit that place for the first time then I could feel a kind of shock on that land.
Whenever there is an opportunity, I appeal to the youth of the country that they must visit Punjab, visit the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Lord Basaveshwara.
It was a period of widespread independence and intensification.
On the one hand, soldiers like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were inspiring the youth for the revolution.
About 100 years ago, in April 1917, Gandhi ji celebrated Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the century of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in Champaran, Gandhiji's ideas and the method of Gandhiji's struggle for India's independence were demonstrated.
This was a turning point in the journey of freedom struggle, especially from the point of view of the ways of struggle.
It was the period when Gandhiji's ideas and methods began to show a profound influence on Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha and Mill Work in Ahmedabad.
In 1915, when Gandhiji returned from abroad, in 1917, he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot judge Champaran Satyagraha keeping in mind Gandhiji.
Just imagine, one who returned to India in 1915 had just two years of experience.
He highlighted the amazing power of Gandhi Ji through Champaran Satyagraha, the ability to know the pulse of the Indian society, the power to inspire the poor and illiterate people against the British, and to invite them to the arena of struggle.
We can learn from him how to start public life, how to work for it and how Gandhi Ji worked.
The great leaders of that period like Rajendra Babu and Acharya Kripalani were all sent to Gandhi Ji's village.
He learnt how to connect with the people, and connect with the people, to the freedom struggle.
Today, we are moving ahead in the 21st century, who doesnt want to change India today, who doesnt want to change the country
This aspiration of 1.25 billion Indians, their efforts for transformation, will prove to be a strong foundation for building a New India.
New India is not a government scheme.
New India is the challenge of 1.25 billion people.
This is the spirit of 1.25 billion Indians that together build a New India.
A desire, a desire, a resolve, a thirst, is within the hearts of 1.25 billion Indians.
They are engaged in such a work in a peaceful manner like a penance maker.
Many people go to the hospital every day and help the patients.
As soon as the news is asked, there are many people who go for a ride and donate blood.
There are many people who know about the good work that someone is eating when he is hungry.
Our country is a land of many such precious and precious gifts.
People are called 'Making' service, this is everything in our nervous system.
If we look at this thing as a whole, if we look at it in an integrated manner then how great this power is.
When we talk of a New India, it is natural to get into criticism of this idea, it is natural to accept it in a democratic manner.
But if 1.25 billion countrymen resolve, if they decide their path, if they start taking steps one after the other, then the dream of 1.25 billion people of the country of building a New India will begin to grow at a time when we will see the dream of building a New India.
It is not necessary that all things should be included in the budget, the government's plan or the government's money.
That is, I would like to say that every citizen of the country, as a citizen, should perform his or her duties, and work with a sense of responsibility.
Why dont we take this journey of self-reliance as a good governance with discipline and determination
I invite you to take part in this journey.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to you.
In the last few months, a large number of people in our country have participated in the Digital Payments Mission.
Post demonetization, digital payment system has shown many improvements.
When we started the BHIM App in just 2-3 months, about 6.5 crore people have already delivered it.
My dear countrymen, we have to move forward in the fight against black money and corruption.
Can 125 crore countrymen fulfill this year's promise of 212 lakh crore digital transactions
In order to implement this, we can digitally pay the school fees, we can digitally charge the ticket bookings of tickets for trains or airplanes, we can purchase medicines digitally, we can use the cheap food shop, we can use digital payment methods.
In the past, several events have been organized for the Digi-dhan celebrations to spread awareness among the masses.
A pledge was made to conduct 100 events across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
70,000 merchants won prizes.
Everyone was determined to take this task forward.
A grand procession is also being organized.
I am confident that we will create awareness about BHIM App as soon as we are able to complete the remaining period of Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
Our contribution has to be made in reducing the use of cash.
My dear countrymen, every time I request you to give me suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, you give me a variety of suggestions.
But I can see that in your suggestions, you are always putting extra pressure on cleanliness.
This river passes through the Rispana bridge and runs around my house.
We have tried to spread awareness among the people who travel to and fro against the pollution of the river, but this did not benefit from it.
I request you to send a team from your side and spread awareness about this matter through newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, Look at the pain in the mind of a student studying in class 11.
I see this as a good sign.
Awareness has also been generated since the launch of the cleanliness campaign.
Everyone has made a positive contribution to it.
This has developed into a mass movement.
The hatred against filth has been increasing.
Be it awareness, or be it positive contribution or be it movement, there is a lot of importance for them.
The work is difficult, but it has to be done.
I am confident that this feeling of belonging to the new generation of the country, to the boys, to the students and to the youth is a sign of goodness.
Today in my Mann Ki Baat, whatever you have heard of Gayatri, I want to tell all of them that this is the message that has been given to all of us.
My dear countrymen, from the beginning of Mann Ki Baat, I have had a lot of suggestions about wasting food.
We all know that when we eat at our homes and public events, we eat more than necessary food in our layers.
Have we ever thought about the damage caused by the remainder of our lives
If we do not spare the rest, how much will it help the poor to feed
However, the apathy shown in this regard is a great treason against the society.
This is injustice done to the poor.
On the other hand, if the food is not wasted, the savings will be made and the family will benefit economically.
It is a good thing to think socially, but it is a good thing to look at as a family.
I want to be more aware about this thing.
I am aware of some young people who are running the campaign by creating a mobile app.
If there is food left over, they will be informed that they will be able to collect the surplus food and distribute it to the needy.
The youth of our country are making efforts to ensure that food is used in a better way.
You can meet such people anywhere in every state of India.
You can see the ways to bring about change.
They always say that those who are aware about the health of the body, keep the leaf below and fill the stomach a little less.
7th April is the World Health Day.
The United Nations has set a target of universal health coverage by 2030.
According to a study, more than 350 million people around the world are suffering from depression.
To friends, tell your parents, brothers and sisters, to the teachers and tell them what is inside you.
Have you ever thought about why they are doing this thing
You must understand that they are in the first phase of stress.
Stress is the need of the hour to deal with mental and physical ailments.
Just as diabetes provides a healing platform to all kinds of diseases, similarly, stress increases our ability to fight against difficult situations, self-reliance and decision-making.
If you are unable to speak openly to your loved ones then involve people in service with a sense of service at some place near you.
Take full care of them, take part in their happiness, you will be able to see your own sadness.
If you try to understand the sorrows of others, if you do that with a sense of service, then a self-confidence develops within you.
By connecting with others, by doing selfless service to others, you can easily bring down the burden in your mind.
Similarly, yoga is also a good way of keeping your mind healthy.
You should start making efforts right from now on.
Make sure lakhs of people participate in 'Yoga'.
If there are any suggestions in your mind on the 3rd International Day of Yoga, you must send me your suggestions through the mobile app and guide me.
You can create songs and creations related to yoga so that people's understanding can increase.
Today I want to talk to the mothers and sisters about one thing and today we have talked about the health thing.
In the past, the government has taken a major decision.
The number of women going to work in our country is increasing day by day and their contribution is increasing, this is a welcome thing.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of April, the holy month of Ram Navami will be celebrated on the 9th of April, Mahavir Jayanti and the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on the 14th of April.
May the life of these great men inspire us and commit ourselves to building a New India.
This is the time when the crops start growing after the rainy season and the farmers will get the benefit of their hard work.
In many corners of our country, this new year is celebrated in many ways.
My New Year greetings to all of you.
The ice age is now disappearing.
The spring season has witnessed its arrival in the lives of all of us.
After the fall, the trees have started fluttering, the flowers blossoming, the forests, gardens and everything is blooming green.
Not only the flowers, but the fruits also shine in the story of Adhawan.
Manganini's cages are being seen in the spring season.
The yellow flowers of mustard in the fields give hope to the farmers.
The auspicious flowers of flowers and the festival of Holi symbolizes the arrival.
These moments of climate change have been described beautifully by Amir Khusru.
The fields flourish, the beetle flourish, the flower flower flower, the cows flower, the cuckoo cuckoo hump, and the environment will be smooth when the nature blossoms, and the man also enjoy the sweetness of this atmosphere.
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi are a celebration of happiness in the lives of mankind.
In an atmosphere of love, brotherhood and humaneness, we will complete the month of equity and we will be ready to welcome the new month of Chaitra Chaitra.
The period of spring is two months together.
Whenever I hear your suggestions before Mann Ki Baat, I express my gratitude to the lakhs of people of the country for sending a lot of suggestions to me.
I thank you all for contributing in every way, be it in Twitter, Facebook or through letters on Narendra Modi App.
Shoba Jalan said that many people are unaware of the achievements of ISRO in the Narendra Modi App.
He further asked you to inform about 104 satellites and the interceptor missile.
Shobaji remembered the example that brought glory to India.
Our scientists have made India proud on the world stage.
We all know that in the last few years, ISRO has been successful in achieving several milestones.
ISRO has achieved a new world record in the space sector a few days ago, after the Mars Orbiter program was successfully launched.
104 satellites of many countries have been successfully launched at the same time as India.
This is a historic achievement not only for ISRO but also for the entire India.
ISRO's low-cost space program has become a wonder for the whole world, and has praised the success of Indian scientists all over the world.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 satellites is of great importance - Cartosat-2D, is India's satellite, its images, mineral resources identification, infrastructure, development assessment, and planning for urban development.
In particular, our new satellite Cartosat-2D will be helpful to my farmer brothers and sisters in understanding the number of water resources in the country, how much they can be used, how much they should be kept in mind.
As soon as we arrive, our satellite has sent a few films.
It has started working on it.
It is a matter of great happiness for all of us that all these activities have been led by our young community scientists and our women scientists.
This outstanding contribution of young scientists and women scientists is a matter of great pride for ISRO's success.
On behalf of my countrymen, I express my heartfelt appreciation to all the scientists of ISRO.
Keeping in mind the service of the people, keeping in mind the service of the nation, your aim is to pursue space science as it is today, to keep it intact, on a day-to-day basis, several new achievements are being made.
Congratulations to our scientists and their entire team, but everything is fine.
In the defence sector, India has successfully tested a missile interceptor missile.
This is a big achievement in the field of defence.
You will be happy to note that the world has only four and a half countries with this technology.
Indian scientists have achieved this.
Even though there is a missile coming to attack India from a distance, its strength is that our missile capability is capable of destroying it in the air.
When we see a new technology, when we see a new scientific achievement, our people feel happy.
In the universe, the human mind has been trying its best to know the laws of creation.
New science and new technology are born out of this.
Every technology has created a new era in every new scientific form.
Dear youngsters, While talking about the hard work of science and scientists, I have often spoken in Mann Ki Baat about the need for our younger generation to draw inspiration from science.
The nation needs many scientists.
Today's scientists become the factors of a steady change in the lives of generations to come.
None of the sciences jumped from heaven in perfect condition.
Gandhiji used to say that all scientific achievements are enriched by experience.
It is a matter of great pride that our young scientists, who are working hard to find the truth, should appreciate the thirst, perseverance and sacrifice, he added.
The need of the public is to understand how to adapt the principles to the system, how to use the tools and how to use the technology so that it can become an important contribution to the common man.
In the past, NITI Aayog and Indias foreign department organised a unique competition on the occasion of the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in a unique way.
In 2005, there was a lot of trouble in Mumbai due to heavy rains, floods and sea fury.
Whenever there is a natural calamity, firstly it is the doors of a poor house.
Both of them decided that they should find a solution to this problem, they should not only save their homes from floods but also develop a house that protects those living in the house from water-borne diseases.
I could see a lot of such innovations.
I want to say that many people are making such contributions in the country.
Our society is also becoming a technology driven society.
In a way, technology is becoming an inseparable part of our lives.
In the past, more emphasis has been given on Digi-dhan.
People are gradually moving from cash to digital transactions.
Digital inflation is growing rapidly in India as well.
Young people are making digital payments over their mobile phones.
I see this as a good sign.
In our country, in the past few days, the Lucky Grahak Yojana, the lucky consumer scheme, the Digidhan Vyapar Yojana, the Digidhan Vyapar Yojana and the Digidhan Vyapar Yojana have received a huge response.
About two months ago, every day 15000 people received a reward of Rs. 1000.
Through these two schemes, digital procurement in India is becoming a peoples movement and the entire nation has welcomed it.
It is heartening to note that so far, under the Digi-dhan scheme, more than 10 lakh people have received prizes, more than 50,000 traders have received prizes, more than 1.5 crore rupees have been received for those who have taken the initiative.
Under this scheme, more than 100 traders have received a reward of Rs.
More than 4000 traders have received a reward of Rs. 50,000 each.
Farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, home-based students and people from all walks of life are connecting with them in a big way.
When I looked at this thing, it was found that not only the youth but the elderly also participated in it, including the youth of the age group of 15 years and senior citizens of the age group of 65-70 years.
Santosh from Mysore has expressed his happiness on the Narendra Modi App and he has said that he has received 1000 rupees through the lucky customer scheme.
But I would like to share with you what is important in his writings.
Santosh ji, your name and your work are also a matter of happiness for all of us.
You have done a great job of inspiring people.
Sabeer, a 22-year-old car driver from Delhi, has started using digital transactions in his business after demonetization, and has received a reward of Rs 1 lakh under the Government's lucky customer program.
Today he is driving a car and in a way he has become the ambassador of this scheme.
He will also share information on digital payments with all passengers travelling in his car.
He has been very enthusiastic about sharing his views and encouraging others.
Pooja Nemate, a young friend of Maharashtra, is a postgraduate student who shares her experiences with friends about how her family uses RuPay card and e-wallet and how they enjoy it.
Come to the leadership of this movement.
You take it forward, it has an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
All those who are associated with this task, in my view, are new warriors against corruption.
In a way you are a fighter of honesty.
On the 14th of April, a grand collection of awards will be held.
It is still about 40-45 days left.
Can you do one thing in the memory of Babasaheb Ambedkar
A few days ago, Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary was passed.
To commemorate him, you must teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
This time, on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, may the BHIM App be of great importance.
I would also like to mention this thing that we have to strengthen the foundation stone of Baba Saheb.
You must ensure that the BHIM App reaches the lives of 1.25 billion people of the country by reaching home and connecting everyone with it.
Due to the impact of this mission in the last 2-3 months, there has been a boom in many cities in many cities, in many villages and in many cities.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Agriculture is the hallmark of our country's economic system.
The economic strength of the villages is strengthening the economic speed of the country.
Today I want to share a pleasant message with you.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and have filled the storehouse.
Due to the hard work of the farmers of our country, this year there has been unprecedented production of crops.
All the indicators tell us that our farmer brothers and sisters have broken the old records.
Every day we have started to celebrate Pongal and Baisakhi festival.
This year, we have received more than 2200 lakh tonnes of revenue.
This is 8 more than the last record of our farmers.
So, this is a wonderful achievement.
I especially want to express my gratitude to the farmers of the country.
There is another reason to thank the farmers that apart from producing traditional foods, they have also grown a variety of pulses, because there is a lot of protein in pulses.
The farmers of my country have heard the voice of the poor, they have cultivated a variety of pulses in about two hundred and ninety hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is a great service to the poor of my country, to the farmers.
I offer my special thanks to the farmer brothers and sisters of the country who have made a record in collecting pulses for my request and listening to one application.
My dear countrymen, in our country, through the government, by the society, by the organizations, by the organizations, through the campaigns, everyone is moving towards cleanliness.
In a way, everyone is becoming aware of cleanliness in some way or the other.
The government is constantly working on it.
In the last few days, under the chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, senior officers from 23 State Governments were present in Telangana.
The seminar was not held in the closed chambers of the weekend in Telangana, but it was the implementation of the significance of cleanliness at the ground level.
On February 17-18, a sanitization training was conducted in Hyderabad.
Officials explained how toilets in 6 houses have been purified, cleaned and disposed off, and how they can be reused.
How comfortable is the toilet to use this new method, from making it clean to clean, there is no problem, no problem, no psychological block or any obstacle.
Just as we clean the toilet, similarly we can clean the toilets.
On an average, a twin-pit toilet for a family of 6 members - will be filled in about 5 years.
After this, the waste can be easily removed and returned to the second basket.
The more things are highlighted in it, the more it will be beneficial.
Even in the government, various departments have been regularly organising Swachhta related meetings for Swachhta fortnights.
In the first meeting to be held in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs will jointly strengthen the Swachhata Mission.
In the second meeting of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will jointly take forward the Swachhata Mission in the last two weeks of March.
Whatever citizen of our country does a good job, the whole country feels a new energy and self-confidence.
In Rio Olympics, we deeply appreciate the bravery of our talented sports personnel.
This month at the end of the T20 World Cup for the visually impaired, India defeated Pakistan and became the second consecutive World Cup and brought glory to the nation.
Once again I congratulate all the team for this thing.
We are proud of the achievements of our differently abled friends in the country.
I have always believed that our differently abled brothers and sisters are highly skilled, determined, accomplished and passionate.
Every moment we have to learn from them.
Whether it is in the field of sports or in the field of space science, the women of our country are not averse to anyone.
They are moving forward in an equitable manner and are bringing glory to the nation through their achievements.
In the last few days, our women players have won a silver medal in the Asian Rugby Seven Summits.
Congratulations to all these brave-hearts
World Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March.
In order to give importance to the girl child in India, awareness in family and society should be increased and understanding should be increased.
Today, this is not just a government scheme.
It has emerged as a mission of social understanding, education for all.
In the last two years, this scheme has connected the people's society, it has kept thinking about this important thing in every corner of the country, it has changed the thinking of the people about the decades old habits.
When we hear the news that a daughter is born, then we feel very happy when we fall into the ears.
In a way, a positive attitude towards the girl child has become due to social harmony.
I have been told that due to a special drive in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, Baliya Vivah has been stopped.
So far, more than 175 Baliya Visas have been banned.
The district administration has started a bank account in the name of more than 55-60 thousand girl children under the Sukanya Samriddhi scheme.
According to the Convergence Model, in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been included in the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme, and in addition to the Gram Sabhas being organized, efforts are being made to adopt orphaned girl children through the district administration and to ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a mission is being run for the education of the daughters of every household in every village under the scheme of door step door step.
In the state of Rajasthan, our child, our school, our school, the mission is being implemented to re-emergize the girls who are in half the school, and to re-emergize them.
I am saying that the campaign of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has been carrying out various forms.
This entire movement has become a peoples movement.
This is in sync with the new ideas.
This is being modified as per the regional requirements.
I consider this as a good sign.
On the occasion of Womens Day on March 8th, we must remain in solidarity. The powerful, the women of India, they are neither too weak nor too weak. My dear countrymen, sometimes in Mann Ki Baat, you all get an opportunity to talk about something or the other.
You have come together positively.
I am getting a lot of things to learn from you.
I am overwhelmed by the feelings of the poor people, the condition of the villages and the conduct of the world.
Mann Ki Baat: August 2019
Under no circumstances should there always be a recession in the society, our ancestors well established the system of monsoon cycle, economic cycle and social life.
In the last few days, we have celebrated many festivals.
Even after thousands of years, every festival brings in a new spirit, a new energy and a new energy.
Sometimes he took up the mountain, sometimes he took up the task of removing the leaf from the meal, that is, we can feel a freshness in every work done by him.
And that is why today when I am talking to you, my thinking is going on with two mohans.
One is Mohan who carries the Sudarshan Chakra, the other is Mohan.
Mohan, who took the wheel of Sudarshan, fled the bank of the Yamuna river, and went to the sea coast of Gujarat, and settled in the city of Dwarka, but Mohan, who appeared on the sea shores of the sea, came to the banks of the Yamuna and breathed his last in Delhi.
As per the circumstances of the Sudarshan Chakra, Mohan used his intellect, his duty, his ability, his thoughts to avoid war and live in conflict, thousands of years ago.
At the same time, the brave-hearts who fought on the path of freedom had given a new shape to the freedom struggle to achieve the country's independence, to protect the human values and to empower the basic elements of governance and to give a new shape to the freedom struggle.This has been a unique turning point for the entire world, which is still unique even today.
We can learn from the life of Lord Shri Krishna what is the importance of selfless service, what is the importance of knowledge, what is the importance of carrying forward with smile amidst all the ups and downs of life.
Today, while talking about festivals, India is celebrating a very big festival.
Not only India, but the whole world is talking about it.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On the 2nd of October 1869, at Porbandar on the seashore, an era was born, not an individual, in a small house called Keerthi Mandir.
This has given a new turn to the whole of human history and created a new record.
One thing had always been associated with Bapu, in a way it was a permanent part of his life, it was - service, service and duty towards service.
If we had seen all his life, he would have engaged himself in the service of the people of those communities in South Africa who were suffering from discrimination.
He served the oppressed farmers in Champaran.
If someone needs help at any point of time then he will be able to serve at any point of time.
He not only strengthened the service, but also strengthened the spiritual well-being associated with service.
But at the same time, the experience of self-reliance in good pleasure and good health lies within the services.
We can clearly understand this through the life of the farm.
For Gandhiji, personal, social, human and human are all.
Whether it is the Phoenix Farm of Africa or the Tolstoy Farm, or the Sabarmati Ashram or the Wardha, he has always strengthened the social integration of every region in a different way.
I consider myself fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit many important places associated with water and to pay my tributes there.
When there is a society, there is a strength for it and in this event of Gandhi 150, there should be social expression and service.
The aim should be to have a good mind-set, to have a good intention, to be harmonious, to serve with complete dedication and to provide a continuous happiness experience.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I had gone beyond Gujarat.
The name of Salt Satyagraha was a turning point in the freedom struggle.
In Dandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to the water.
I appeal to all of you that you should visit any place related to Mahatma Gandhi.
Several events, competitions and exhibitions are planned in the coming years.
But on this occasion, I would like to share a very interesting thing with you.
This time, an interesting display of Gandhi Jis memories will also be showcased at the India Pavilion at Venice Beennel.
Of these, the area of Haripura is interesting.
You might remember that it was during the Haripura Congress conference in Gujarat that the incident of Subhas Chandra Bose's election as the President was recorded in the history.
There is a very beautiful past in these art areas.
In 1937-38, before the Congress's Haripura conference, Annal invited Nandalal Bose, then chief minister of Shantiniketan's Kala Bhavana.
Gandhiji wanted the art of living in India to be showcased through the art of art and exhibition at the conference.
And this is the very hand of Nandlal Bose that enhances the beauty of our Constitution.
Nandalal Bose visited the villages near Haripura and painted the paintings to show the rural life in the end.
There were serious discussions in Venice about these priceless works.
Once again, with the best wishes on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I hope every Indian takes a pledge.
We have to do something for the country, for the society and for the country.
This is the best and true tribute that we can do to the farm.
Ladies and Gentlemen, In the last few years, we have been running the Swachhata Hi Seva movement for 2 weeks before the 2nd of October.
This time it will start on 11th September.
In the run-up to this movement, there is enthusiasm among all sections of society.
My dear brothers and sisters, all of them have tied up with a sign board in their shops, they have written that when they come out of the house, they should come out with a cloth.
This will save money and our contribution in protecting the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when we mark the 150th birth anniversary of Anna Hazare, on this occasion, we should dedicate to him an India free from open defecation and at the same time lay the foundation for a new peoples movement against black money.
I appeal to all sections of the society, to every village, to every village, to every village, to every town, to bow down and to bow down before them. In a way, this year, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, we should celebrate the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mother India, with the aim of liberating this Mother India from filth.
I also appeal to the private companies that you should come forward to remove all the solid wastes that have been collected in the right way.
They can be recycled.
Fuel can be prepared through these.
But there was a lot before.
Today, I want to touch something more important than a Sanskrit phrase.
Even though it was written centuries ago, does it know how important it is today
The fools call stone carvings as gems.
Food has always been given great importance in our culture.
So much so, we have made even the knowledge of food scientific.
A balanced, nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and children, because these are the foundations of our society.
Under POSHAN Abhiyaan i.e. Poshan Abhiyan, nutrition is becoming a mass movement in the country through modern means.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once a thing was brought to my notice.
There was a massive movement of grains in Nasik.
In these, the Anganwadi brothers and sisters have collected the grains from the people in their harvesting season.
These cereals are useful for hot food prepared for children and women.
This ritual is performed when the child is being given solid food for the first time.
Not liquid food, solid food.
This is a wonderful effort, which can be implemented everywhere.
In many states, people have started a movement called 'Dhithi Bhojan'.
Whether it is the birthday of a family or a festival or a memorial day, the family members prepare nutritious food, go to anganbari by preparing a tasty food, go to schools where all the families offer their own food and feed the children.
They share their happiness, and when such happiness is shared, it does not diminish.
With the spirit of service, the spirit of joy is a wonderful union.
Friends, We can further strengthen the strong fight against malnutrition in our country through these small things.
Due to lack of awareness today, the poor and self-reliant have been affected due to malnutrition.
We will celebrate the month of September as a nutrition mission throughout the country.
You must associate yourself with it, get information and add new ideas to it.
If you have brought one or two people out of the problem of malnutrition then we can bring the country out of the problem of malnutrition.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I had a lot of confidence that a single question would be asked about this thing.
And in the last few weeks wherever I went, whenever I met people, Mann Vas Wild was being talked about.
I had never imagined that I would get such an opportunity to be present in the minds of the youth of the world.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
Whenever as the Prime Minister, whenever I get the opportunity to visit, or the situation due to Yoga, if someone in the world is sitting or in size, they start questioning me for 5-6 minutes.
Till now, I have not been able to discuss Yoga in the form of a global leader, this has been my experience all over the world.
But now we have a new experience.
Whoever I meet or whenever I get the opportunity to visit, they talk about the subject related to forest life, they are engaged in discussions related to environment.
This programme is being telecast in 165 countries in their own language.
But one more interesting thing is that some people ask me something with some difficulty. Modi ji, you are speaking in Hindi, Bear Grylls dont know the language of Hindi, how did you talk to them so fast
Is this done after that?
Look, there is no secret in this.
The reality is that technology was fully used to communicate with Bear Grylls.
After this event, a large number of people have started discussing about Jim Corbett National Park with me.
You too must visit places associated with nature and wildlife.
I have said this thing in the past and now I say this thing again that you must visit the North-Eastern states in your life.
Your life is vast.
Your thoughts will be huge.
In the past months, I have had the privilege of releasing a survey of wild animals.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
Tiger numbers in India stand at 2967.
A few years ago, it was only half their number.
Tiger related summit took place in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010.
In this context, concern was raised about the number of tigers in the world, and a pledge was made at the end.
This commitment is to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India, because we are fast reaching the targets here, we have doubled the number of tigers left here in 2019 itself.
India has not only increased the number of tigers but has also increased the number of protected areas and community reserves.
When I released the data related to the tigers, it was a reminder of the lions in the Keer forest of Gujarat.
I had been there as the Chief Minister and at that time the habitations of lions in the forest of Keerar were decreasing.
Their numbers continued to decline.
We took one step after another in the jungles of Keer.
In 2007, we decided to appoint women police officers there.
We have developed infrastructure to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk of nature and wildlife, we only talk about conservation.
Therefore, it is necessary that we not only protect our forests, flora and fauna, but also create a conducive environment for them to survive in a better way.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic address of Vivekananda on September 11, 1893
This young monk of India, who raised the human society from sleep all over the world, has left a shining image of India in the world.
The same world which saw India as a slave, on the 11th of September 1893, at the words of Swami Vivekananda, changed the way India saw the country.
Come, Swami Vivekananda ji had seen any form of India and whatever power Swami Vivekananda had seen in India, let us try to live and show it to us.
It is within us, everything is there, we will move forward with self-confidence.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate 29th August as National Sports Day.
It will be yours to have a very interesting campaign for the children, the elderly, the youth and the women.
But I'm not going to say anything about their delicate points today.
I want to spread awareness about fitness in your mind. For a strong India, for our country, we together decide some goals.
I am confident that all of us will be able to get rid of the negative consequences - whether living at home or outside our homes, or on social media platforms.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
On the 26th of January, we celebrated our Republic Day with great fervor and enthusiasm throughout the length and breadth of the country.
In a way, the Constitution of India, the duty of the citizens, the emphasis that we have on democracy, in a way it is a cultural festival that raises awareness of the future generations about democratic responsibilities.
But still there is not so much wide and deep-rooted debate over the rights and duties of citizens in our country.
Tomorrow, January 30, is the day of our auspicious festival of lights.
On the 30th of January, at 11 a.m. on the 30th of January, we will all spend two minutes of silence and pay tributes to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the nation.
As a society and as a country, paying homage at 11 a.m. on 30th January at 11 a.m.
It may be for 2 minutes but it has a social character, a commitment and an expression of our concern towards the martyrs.
We have naturally shown respect for the army and the security forces of our country.
I congratulate the jawans and their relatives who have been awarded various medals for their bravery and valour on the occasion of the Republic Day.
These medals include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I especially appeal to the youth that you can do one thing that you are actively working on the social foundations.
You can find two good words on the website about the soldiers who have been honored this time and share them with your friends.
When we get to know about the courage, valour and bravery of those soldiers then we will be surprised and excited.
On the 26th of January, while on the other hand, some of our soldiers, who are in the security of our country in Kutch, have died due to snowfall.
I salute and pay my respects to all the soldiers who laid down their lives.
My young friends, you all know that I have been continuously chanting Mann Ki Baat.
The four months of January, February, March and April have been challenging for every family.
Even if a child is selected in the house, the entire family will suffer from the burden of examinations.
I always feel like coming out of this situation and that is why today I want to talk to my young friends in detail.
I want to ask you how to make such a situation happy.
Though Creator had asked this question, I know that this question lies in your minds.
Exams should be a happy occasion.
The examination period for most people is a period of stress.
You must decide whether you consider this as a happy time or whether you feel pressured time or not.
Those who consider it a period of stress, they feel sad - , , , , , , , ,
Therefore, it is my belief that you should take the exam time as a festival and a festival.
When the festival or the festival comes, then the specialty within us is revealed.
The entire family should work as a team and play their part in making this festival a success.
There will be a change while you keep looking.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there is only one test in these 3-4 months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to make this 3-4 months celebration, in accordance with the tradition and family conditions of every person in his or her own way.
If you were happy and happy, if you were face to face with a renewed sense of humor, you would feel a sense of religiosity.
You will get a glimpse of what the teacher said in the classroom a year ago.
It will not only stop the thinking but it will also become a burden.
We cannot imagine how many very useful things will suddenly come to mind if there is mental stress, if we forget things, if we are breathless.
It is not that you have no knowledge or hard work.
But when pressure is exerted, then your knowledge, your knowledge and your knowledge will sink and the pressure will cover you.
That's why a happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet, and I would say that a happy mind is the key to high marks.
There are times when I think we will not take the exams in the right perspective.
It's not the lecture for your life.
It is not the choice of how you have lived your life, how you live and how you live.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great example of inspiring all of us.
He went to the Air Force and failed.
Marks have become more important.
This is the reason why competition has increased and there has been a lot of stress in the minds of the students.
At this stage, I would like to share your views on the current course of education and its future.
If you believe in these things, then the marks and the winds of the wind will sink deep behind you.
It is necessary to know what is the state of my knowledge till yesterday and where I have reached today.
I have given this example that if we talk about the world of sports then it will be in mind immediately.
Most of the victories are in their lives because the players compete with themselves.
You take the life of Sachin Tendulkar
For 20 years, he has been able to break many milestones and has set a new record by moving away from the previous record which he had created every time.
His journey of life is wonderful because he has gone a long way in overcoming challenges on his own by abandoning competition with others.
Friends, In every field of life, you will have to appear in the exam so that you can study for 3 hours at the time of 2 hours
You might have decided that you should get up early in the morning and it may have been delayed but can you get up at the time of the decision taken now
And that is why I request you all to leave yourselves competitive and make yourselves challenging.
It should be kept in mind that how I was earlier, how I was going ahead and how I was working better.
If you approach from this point of view then you will be able to understand the change that is taking place in you.
S.
Sunder, it's absolutely right to tell you.
Even today, if you look at those who ask me questions, those who give me advice, you might have noticed that the number of women is high in them.
When we see how many mothers are aware about the future of the children in their homes, and how they are doing constructive work, we find that they make things easier.
Keeping in mind the skills you have, you should be a guide and as much as you have done, you should spare time.
Once you become used to accepting, most of your problems will end.
The expectations of parents and teachers are the hallmark of their problems.
Adopting what remains is the way to solve the problems.
Expectations make the road even more difficult.
You will be able to recover from the burden.
In a way, we go and see the patient and create a fear about the disease.
I want to tell the parents that we too, sometimes create such a fear in our children.
Have you ever felt the need to create a happy atmosphere during the exam days
You will see that the entire environment is changing.
I got a wonderful phone call.
He didn't want to mention his name.
You will be able to understand why he does not want to mention his name.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I do not want to mention my name because of one of the things that I have done in my childhood.
Once the habit of insurance is inculcated, the thirst for learning in life will cease.
A phone call came in, Hello, Prime Minister, my name is Monica, I would like to ask you two questions about my exams.
The common idea is that if students focus on sports, then there will be a lack of focus on education.
This basic idea is wrong, this is the root cause of the problem.
If you want to make a complete development, there is a life beyond textbooks, which is too vast.
This is the right time to live and learn that life.
Even if it takes only 5 minutes, take a little rest.
You can feel that your work is not difficult.
I don't know if everyone doesn't like it or not, but this is my experience.
When I speak on the platforms during the elections, sometimes my voice will refuse to cooperate.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long you sleep.
Till now, I have not even thought that there is a connection between my sleep, my speech and my voice, and he has given me the basic treatment.
If we understand the importance of such basic things then we will get many benefits.
Don't do that, otherwise your family is going to be angry with me.
If you don't notice the day your score comes out, I'll be right in their eyes.
Please don't do this.
It is a great effort to keep the mind, mind and body active.
Well, my young friends, as you are busy in arranging for your exams, I am talking about something, perhaps I believe that what I have said today will give you rest.
But I also request you not to burden me with what I have said.
If you can, please do it and do it if not.
Remember the resolution you have made, believe in you, go to the polls, my best wishes to you all.
Let us turn this challenge into a celebration of every challenge.
Then there will not be a challenge or a challenge.
Keep this mantra in mind and move forward.
My dear countrymen, 1st February, 2017 marks the completion of 40 years of the Indian Coast Guard.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to the officers and the soldiers of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride for us that our Coast Guard comprising 126 ships and 62 aircraft is the 4th largest Coast Guard in the world.
The mantra of the Coast Guard is Vayam Raksham.
In keeping with this objective, the Coast Guard is awake day and night in adverse circumstances to protect the coastal areas and coastal areas of the country.
Many may not be aware that in the coastal guard of our country, there are not only men but also women who are standing shoulder to shoulder and performing their duties successfully.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard, who are pilots and observers, are also on the move.
As the Coast Guard is the world's biggest issue today, I extend my warm greetings to the Indian Coast Guard on its 40th anniversary.
Vasant Panchami is the biggest festival of Saraswati in our country.
This is an opportunity to praise education.
Not only this, it is a time to inspire the soldiers.
This is an inspiration for me to make me a part of the spring.
I extend my warm greetings to all my fellow citizens on the auspicious occasion of Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in the Mann Ki Baat of Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani has always given new colors and new colors to new dimensions in accordance with her creative potential.
After the completion of my Mann Ki Baat in the last two months, they have broadcast Mann Ki Baat' in regional languages.
This is a warm welcome.
I have had a great opportunity to walk with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, Namaste, Greetings to you all on Christmas Day.
Today is a day to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Several wealthy people came and contributed wealth.
In the end, a poor widowed mother came and gave her two cheque money.
Today, on their birth anniversary, we pay our emotional tributes.
Just two days ago, I got the good opportunity to launch several development projects in Varanasi, the land of Malviya ji.
I laid the foundation stone of the prestigious Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Centre to be set up will be a boon to the people of not only Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is also the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna, former Prime Minister and respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country will not forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we have also made the country proud in the field of nuclear energy.
As a leader of the party, as a Member of Parliament, as a Minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji's unique contribution made him an example.
Today, on the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I offer my heartfelt greetings to him, and I pray to God for his good health.
As a worker, I had the great opportunity to work with Atal ji.
My thoughts are with him in a green light.
Today, on the auspicious occasion of Christmas, the people of the country are getting the benefits of two schemes as a gift.
In a way, both of these can be considered the beginning of new projects.
Be it a village, a city, a city or a city, be it a school or a school, be it a school or a school or a school, or be it a family or be it a cashless transaction, all over the country is eager to know about how to do a cashless business or how to buy things without cash.
Everyone wants to learn from each other the ways and means.
Similarly, Digidhan Vyapar Scheme has been launched to encourage traders and on 25th December, 2017, Christmas Prizes will be given to 15,000 people in a cluster manner.
This scheme is going to start today for 100 days.
Every day 15,000 people will receive a thousand rupees each.
Digi's business plan is mainly for traders.
The business of the traders is pleasant, and an excellent opportunity for the traders.
This scheme is designed to focus on all sections of society, especially the poor and lower middle class.
The people who buy things worth Rs.50 to Rs.3000 will get the benefit of this thing.
This is not the case for those who buy more than Rs.3000.
Even the poorest of the poor can buy and sell goods using USSD, futurephone and easy phones and all of them will be benefitted from this scheme.
People in rural areas can buy or sell goods through AEPS and win prizes.
Today, there are about 30 crore RuPay cards in India, of which 20 crore are of poor families and Jan Dhan account holders.
These 30 crore people will be able to participate immediately in this award.
I am sure that the people of the country will take a pledge in this manner and will be eager to receive the necessary information from the youth around them.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to see that awareness about how to use technology in the country, how to pay the money electronically and how to pay the money online is spreading at a rapid pace.
Cashless business has registered a growth of 200-300 in the last few days.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to carry this forward.
The traders know very well how big this decision is.
Income tax exemption has been granted to those traders who make digital transactions and who are paying online instead of using cash in their business.
I congratulate all the states and union territories of the country.
A committee headed by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu, has been formed and is reviewing the progress of various projects.
At the same time, the governments have also started and are implementing several schemes in their own way.
I am told that the State Government of Assam has announced a 10 tax rebate on digital payment for property tax and business licence.
50,000 from the Government if the branches of rural banks carry out at least two digital transactions by January to March, 2020 with 75 of their account holders.
The committee has announced a reward of Rs. 5 lakh from the government to the villages that have achieved 100 digital payments by March 31, 2017 as the best panchayat for digital payments.
Several organizations have been successful in taking forward digital transactions for the rural poor farmers.
It is interesting to note that 27 percent of sales this year have shown an increase in GNF's fertilizer sales over the previous year.
They are not only getting 80 rupees and 80 rupees but are also getting 50 rupees but they are also deprived of the facilities of insurance and health.
But now money is being paid in a cashless way.
Our country is a young country.
Technology is our hand-in-hand art.
A country like India should be ahead of all the countries in this field.
Our youth have made significant progress through start-ups.
This is a golden opportunity for making digital films.
We need to add so much strength to this sector that our youth can offer new ideas, innovative techniques and new ways of doing business.
At the same time, we have to associate ourselves with the movement to get rid of black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I request you every month, every month, before Mann Ki Baat, to give your suggestions and your suggestions.
Under this, tens of thousands of letters have been received in consultation with MyGov and NarendraModiApp, of which 80-90 percent are related to corruption and black money eradication and currency withdrawal.
After seeing all these things, I feel that they can be classified in three ways in general.
Some people have written in detail about the difficulties and difficulties faced by the citizens due to withdrawal of currency.
On the other hand, they mentioned how, when such a great work, so much work and work is being done in the interest of the nation, so many sacred works are being done, how many new ways are being adopted by the people in the process of evacuating and irreversible actions.
My dear countrymen, you have written so many letters to me and have thanked me for this.
This way of bringing black money under control is commendable.
While it is true that all of us citizens are facing difficulties, we are all on the verge of fighting corruption and our cooperation in this war is a matter of happiness for us.
We are fighting a war against corruption, black money and so on. Gurumani Cavalry recorded his comment on the Mygov platform.
Gurumani Keval ji has written a voice that resonates in every corner of the country.
They are truly transformative factors, agents of change.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the people who have not only suffered many difficulties but have also made a strong reaction to some people who are trying to lead the people in the wrong direction.
A great effort was made to spread the religious thread against corruption, black money etc.
Not only this, many people jumped on the floor, used their creativity and intelligence to break the impressions of those who spread rumours, and brought forth the truth.
When 1.25 billion people of my country are connected with me, can there be something impossible
If there are the blessings of the Mahesh people, will it not be an asset for the blessings of the Isan
I express my gratitude to the countrymen, I salute them, the people of this Mahayagya are participating in the fight against corruption and black money with full zeal.
I look forward to a detailed discussion on the ongoing war against corruption and black money in the Parliament for political parties and for funds to be given to the political parties.
Had the sittings been held in the House, it would have certainly been a matter of discussion.
It is absolutely wrong to say that those who raise rumours that political parties have been exempted in every way.
Those who have not been able to work in the direction of corruption and black money, they are spending their entire time and have been searching for the government's grievances.
There is also a question as to why he has often changed the rules.
This government is for the people of Mahesar.
The government is making efforts to keep listening to the suggestions from the public.
When they come up with new strategies, we also have to adopt new ways to defeat their evil thoughts.
In this battle of Vagaman and Kotakkon, an end must be made for corrupt, corrupt practices and black money.
On the other hand, there have been letters from a number of people about the kind of bad practices that are being followed and the kind of new ways that are being used.
On this occasion, I express my heartfelt gratitude to my dear countrymen.
The Government has created an e-mail address separately for sharing such information.
In addition, you can also send to MyGov.
The government has also tied up with the government to fight against all kinds of evils like the evils that you people point to.
When your cooperation doesn't end, it's very easy to fight.
The third type of letters are also in large numbers.
"Modiji, do not hesitate, do not hesitate, do not worry about how much serious the effort should be made, but if you decide to travel and put your feet on the road then there is no talk of reaching the conclusion or retreat."
My dear countrymen, even in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said that our farmer friends had made tremendous efforts and had broken the records of the past year in the field of seed even during these times of crisis.
From the point of view of agriculture, this is a clear sign.
Be it the labourers, farmers or youth of this country, the efforts of all of them are providing a new strength to the country.
A few days ago, on the World Economic Forum, India has made its name a matter of pride for many sectors.
It is the result of the continued efforts of our skilled countrymen that India has progressed on the Global Rankings through separate indices.
Indias ranking has gone up in the World Bank report on Ease of Doing Business.
India has jumped 32 places in the World Economic Forum Report on Global Competitiveness.
We have moved up 16 places in the Global Performance Index of 2016 and moved up 19 places in the World Bank's Infrastructure Service Index of 2016.
Several other reports point to the same assessment and India is growing at a rapid pace.
My dear countrymen, this time, the anger of the countrymen has been heard over the session of Parliament.
There has been anger at the functioning of Parliament everywhere.
The President and the Vice President openly expressed their displeasure.
But even in such a situation, one feels happy when some good things happen.
Even in the midst of the passage of the Parliament, the attention of the country has not returned to this noble task.
Brothers and sisters, I am happy and proud to say that the government's efforts have been made keeping the objective of the development of Divyangjan in mind and a bill related to it has now been passed.
I express my gratitude to the members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for accomplishing this task and express my gratitude to the people of the country for the crores of Divyangjans.
This Government is striving for the welfare of Divyangjans.
Personally, I have also been trying to increase its speed to take this objective forward.
My aim was to ensure that the Divyangjans get their rights and dignity.
By winning 4 medals at the Paralympics, our differently-abled brothers and sisters have strengthened our efforts and hopes.
They have not only brought glory to the country through their successes but have also brought the people to the marvelous sea through their talent.
Our differently abled brothers and sisters, like other citizens of the country, are our precious assets and precious resources.
With the enactment of this Act in the interest of Divyangjan, there has been an increase in the availability of employment opportunities for Divyangjan.
The limit of reservation in Government jobs has been increased to 4.
Special provisions have been made for education, facilities and complaints of persons with disabilities through this Act.
In the last two years, 4350 camps have been set up for the disabled persons and from the fact that 580,000 differently-abled brothers and sisters have been provided equipment at a cost of Rs. 352 crores you can understand how much the government has been with the disabled.
A new law has been enacted based on the spirit of the United Nations.
Earlier, the differently-abled people were classified into 7 categories but now we have made it into 21 and 14 new categories have been added.
It is for the first time that some differently abled people have got the opportunity to get justice.
For example, Thalassemia, Parkinsons are associated with the affected people as well as those who are born with malpractice.
The Indian cricket team has won the 4th prize in the Test against England.
The performance of some of the young men is commendable.
Our national youth, Mr. Karuna Nair, hit 3 percent.
KL Rahul scored 199 runs.
The Test Captain Virat Kohli did not only speak well but also led a good leadership.
The Indian Cricket Team of Spinner is headed by Dr.
Aswin's name was declared by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2016 as the Cricket of the Year and the Best Test cricketer.
Many congratulations to all of them and my best wishes are with you.
After 15 years, we have received very good news in the field of hockey.
Junior hockey team won the World Cup.
This accomplishment is a very good sign for the future of India hockey.
Last month, our women too have done well.
If the Indian womens hockey team won the Asia Championships, a few days ago, Indias female hockey team won the bronze in the Asian Games for those under 18.
Like every year, this time on Diwali, I once again celebrated Diwali with the soldiers and went to the border areas of China.
I have celebrated Diwali at the peaks of Himalayas with ITBP, ITBP, BSF and Army personnel.
I go every time, but the experience of this Diwali is unparalleled.
People have not only sent information but also connected with the mind.
One person painted poems, the other made films, the other made cartoons, the other made the video.
That is, every house is like a place where soldiers live.
When I saw the letters, I was told how much imagination and emotions were there in the minds of the people.
One of the soldiers had written to me - Prime Minister, to all of us soldiers - every festival like Diwali and Holi is celebrated on the border.
We will spend every moment in the thoughts of the security of the country.
Yes, however, the idea of a house gets reflected in the days of the festival.
But to tell the truth, this time there was no such thing.
On this day of festivities, let us not feel that we are not at home.
Sometimes we feel that along with 125 crore Indians, we are also celebrating Diwali.
My dear countrymen, on this auspicious occasion of Deepavali, may the experiences of the soldiers and the security forces of our country be lost with some moments
I appeal to all of you, as a society, as a country, to inculcate this spirit in us, and to inculcate this spirit in us, whether it is a festival or a festival or a festival or a happy occasion, in some way we should remember the soldiers of our country.
When the entire country stands shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, the strength and strength of the force will increase by 125 crore times.
Some time ago, all the leaders of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had come to meet me.
They belong to the Panchayat Sammelan in Jammu Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 leaders from different villages of Kashmir valley.
I had the opportunity to talk to them for a considerable period of time.
They had come to talk about some things related to the development of their villages, some had come up with some demands, but when the discussion started, it was natural that the environment of the valley, the law and order situation in the valley, the future of the children were different things.
The way these village leaders spoke with a lot of love, open-mindedness and a sense of belonging touch the heart.
When I was talking about the schools in Kashmir then I could feel the pain and sorrow of the countrymen as well as the heads of the villages.
And they thought that the schools were not burned, and the future of the children was made a fire.
After returning to your homes, I requested you to pay attention to the future of these children.
I am very happy that all these leaders who came from Kashmir Valley fulfilled their promise to me very well.
They went to the villages and spread awareness among people who were far away from the villages.
A few days ago, 95 per cent of the children of Kashmir participated in the board examinations.
The participation of such a large number of girl students in Board examinations indicates that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development through education for a prosperous future.
While conveying my best wishes to those students for their inspiration, I convey my best wishes to their parents, relatives, their teachers and all the village leaders.
Dear sisters and brothers, This time when I was asking people for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, everyones suggestions came to the fore.
All of them asked me to speak in detail about the Rs. 500, 1000 notes.
In my address to the nation on the 8th of November at 8 pm, I spoke about the launch of a transformative program in the country.
I have publicly said that the time when I took this decision before you, this decision is not an ordinary one, it is a difficult one.
But the more important the resolution is, the more important it is to implement it.
I am aware that in our average life, many new innovations are going to face difficulties.
Even at that time, this decision is huge and it will take 50 days for us to come out of its impact and only then will we be able to move towards normalcy.
The effort to get rid of all the diseases that we have been carrying for 70 years cannot be easy.
I can very well understand the difficulties you face.
The currency of 500 and 1000 rupees, such a large country, so many notes, millions and crores of rupees, this resolution - the entire world is watching this thing very closely, and every economist is watching this thing very much.
India has immense faith in the 1.25 billion people of India, and the 1.25 billion people of India have a solemn pledge to fulfil their pledges.
Throughout the country, all sections of the Central Government, State Governments and Local Bodies, 1.30 lakh bank branches, lakhs of bank branches, over 1.5 lakh post offices and over 1.5 lakh bank agents participated in the work day and night with dedication.
In the midst of a variety of pressures, they all worked together to make this nation a part of its mission and to bring about a massive transformation.
As a result, it is evident that India will succeed in this task.
I can see that despite all the difficulties, everyone is working in the banks and post offices.
When it comes to humanitarian matters, they are travelling a little more.
One told me that an old man was injured in an accident in Khandaa.
Suddenly the money was needed.
I am happy to learn that when this thing was taken to the notice of the banking personnel present there, he had personally visited the house and deposited the money and did not face any difficulty in the treatment.
Many such unprecedented incidents take place every day on TV, in the media, in the media, in the media and in the media.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the friends who have contributed and worked on this great boat.
But if the evil has spread to such an extent, even today, evil practices have become a habit.
Even now, they are thinking that this money, this black money, this money, this money which is not in the account, this money can be taken by looking for some way or the other.
They are trying to save their money by making the poor seducing, speaking words of desire or seducing, putting money into their accounts, buying some or the other job from them.
What I want to say to such people today is that the law takes care of what you want to do and what you want to do if you do not change or change the law, whether you respect the law or not.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
When the name of the poor comes in the records, then when he comes to the investigation then he does not do anything to get hurt due to your sins.
A very stringent law on Benami property has been enacted and is going to come into force and there will be a lot of difficulties in that.
The government wants to ensure that our countrymen do not face any kind of trouble.
I live in Tharali village of Tharali Dhaluka in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
You have taught a good lesson to the black money holders and the corrupt through 500 and 1000 rupees notes.
If this step had not been taken then there would never have been a better time for every citizen of India.
That is why I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
There is a lot of enthusiasm among the people to work by getting access to the government through the media.
When the common man of my country finds out what a wonderful talent has, there is immense joy and pride.
Even if you have old notes, if you want to eat, do not worry about money, do not just go back from here with hunger and go out with food, whenever you have to walk on this path, you must pay the money.
People go there and eat food and after 2-4-6 days they return the money after traveling through that route.
This is the power of my country, in which the spirit of service and sacrifice is reflected.
During the election, I used to talk about tea and it spread to the entire world.
People from many countries of the world have started talking on the occasion of tea.
But I didn't know that the wedding would take place during this tea-sing.
On November 17, a marriage took place in Surat with a tea-seller conversation.
In Surat, Gujarat, a woman used to drink only tea for those who came for her house marriage, did not celebrate any other festival, did not make any feast, there was no money shortage because of demonetization.
The demonstrators also considered it an honor.
Bharat Maru and Taksha Parmar of Surat have shown great enthusiasm through their marriage that they have contributed to the massive fight against corruption and black money against corruption.
While many blessings are given to Bharath and Takshasa on Navratnai, I convey my best wishes to you for turning the auspicious festival of marriage into a Mahavratri and turning it into a new opportunity.
When such difficulties arise, the people make the best solutions.
Some people have benefitted immediately through this movement.
In the days to come, the country will be benefited, but some will soon be benefited.
When I asked about what had happened, I received some information from small towns.
But this time, due to this decision of 8th, everyone was running to pay their old notes.
3000-3500 crore has been collected in 47 city units during the corresponding period of last year.
Where is 3000-3500 crore rupees, where is 13000 crore
Now these municipalities have received 4 times the money so that the sewage system is created for the poor, the water supply system is created and the Anganwadi centres are established or not
There are many such instances where direct benefits are visible.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages, our farmers are the strong pillars of our economy.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, every citizen of the country is adapting itself in times of crisis.
But today I want to salute the farmers of my country.
Just now I have been examining the data related to the seeding of this season.
Be it wheat or pulses or oil-seed crops, I have an account till 20th November. The sowing has increased in comparison to the same period last year.
Despite difficulties, the farmers have found a way out.
The government has also taken several important decisions, in which emphasis has been given to the farmers and the villages.
Under the Mudra scheme, efforts were made to provide loans to them.
Crores of rupees have been given to the common man under the Mudra Yojana because crores of people are engaged in such small industries and lakhs of crores of rupees are giving a boost to the business.
Today, I would like to tell my brothers and sisters who are doing small business, using this as an opportunity, you can enter the digital world.
You can also download the app from the banks through your mobile phone.
Your contribution can be very big in creating a cashless society. You can use the entire banking system through mobile to increase your business. Today, we can run the business in many ways, without having to deal with the notes.
There are technical ways, they are safe and fast.
I only want you to contribute to the success of this mission and I am confident that you will take the lead in this transformation and you will be able to provide such leadership.
I am confident that you will also be able to do the business of the entire village with this technology.
I would like to tell my hardworking brothers and sisters that you have been subjected to a lot of injustice.
One of the pay set in the paper is that the money that is paid in your hands is different.
You have to get your wages in full and no one has to give a share.
You should not be subjected to cruelty.
If money is deposited in your bank accounts, you too will be able to purchase goods through a small mobile phone so that you can pay the money in the shops nearby. There is no need for a smart phone.
Therefore, my worker brothers and sisters, I specially request your contribution in this scheme because I have made such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the farmers, for the labourers, for the oppressed and the deprived sections of the society and for the welfare of the poor.
Today I specially want to talk to the youth.
In India, 65 per cent of people are below the age of 35 years.
I know that you have contributed a lot in taking this forward in a constructive way.
Gentlemen, you are my real soldiers, you are my true comrade.
We all have a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India. This is a golden opportunity to take the country towards economic heights.
My young friends, can you help me
You will be aware of the App that is, what is the App, what is the online banking system, what is the banking system through computer, and you are aware of the registration of tickets through computer.
These things are very simple for you and you are also using them.
But today, the great work that the country wants to do, is a society without our dream, with no money.
It is true that a society without a hundred percent cash transaction is not possible.
But why should we not make a beginning to make India a less cash society
Once you start off from this less-cash society, the goal of a society where there is no cash transaction will not be far away.
I am confident that you will never let me down because all of us are eager to change the lives of the poor of India.
You are well aware of the opportunities that have been created today for the launch of digital banking services or for the launch of mobile banking services for a cashless society.
Each bank provides online facility.
Wallet's direct product is e-purse.
A variety of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, the number of RuPay cards that have been issued to crores of poor families of India has gone up by more than 300 after the 8th of this month.
Like the prepaid card on the mobile phone, the banks are also getting the prepaid card to spend the money.
UPI is a wonderful platform for business so that you can buy things, send money and get the money.
This task is as easy as you send information on whatsapp.
Today, even a non-curricular person has been aware of how to send information on whatsapp and how to forward it.
Not only this, technology is very simple to make this job a big smart phone.
Cash transfers can also be made through a phone with common facilities.
Be it the vegetable seller, milk seller, newspaper seller, tea seller, or the salesman of power, it can be used without any hassle.
I have put pressure on efforts to further ease this process.
All banks are engaged and doing so.
Now we have done away with the additional fee for online business and we have ended all such taxes related to cards by strengthening the concept of a cashless society.
My young friends, even after all these things, this is unknown to a whole generation.
I am sure that all of you are actively involved in this great work.
I have been watching the creative stories of whatsapp, the verses, the poems, the tuns, the cartoons, the new imagination, the comedy.
And when we look at the creativity of our younger generation despite challenges then what is happening to me is that even in the battlefield, it is the only thing on earth that is the speciality of this land.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I once again say that I need your help and I am confident that you, millions and millions of young people of this country will do this work.
Today, I want to assure you that you will be a part of a cashless society.
Provide all the technology for online expenditure on your mobile phones.
You have to lead the cashless society, the inspiration that comes from the network of currency, the movement to liberate the country from corruption, the movement to liberate the people from black money and the movement to liberate the people from difficulties.
If you teach people how to use RuPay card once then the poor will give you blessings.
Within a month, we will be able to stand up as a new India. You can do this work through your mobile phone.
Go to 10 houses per day and connect 10 houses per day.
I invite you, come, your support is not enough, we will become the soldiers who make this change, we will bring about change.
We will move forward in this war that will free the country from black money and corruption.
This country has produced a great revolution.
My dear young people, I once again request you to carry forward this movement.
I call upon all of you, every school, college, university, NCC and NSS to take up this task on a community and individual basis.
We will take this task forward.
There is an opportunity for all of us to serve the country with great service. We should not let go of this golden opportunity.
My dear brothers and sisters, Today is the birth anniversary of one of the greatest poets of the country, Harivansh ji, and today on the birth anniversary of Harivansh ji, Amitabh Bachchan ji has given a slogan to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
You might have noticed that the most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji, is taking forward the cleanliness mission with great enthusiasm.
HarivanshJi, Dr.
I pay my respects to HarivanshJi as well.
I express my gratitude to Amitabh ji for joining the Mann Ki Baat of Mann Ki Baat and for leading the cleanliness mission.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your emotions continue to keep me connected with you through your letters, through mygov and Narendra Modi App.
Now Mann Ki Baat will be broadcast at 11 AM, but it will begin soon after it is completed in regional languages.
Thank you very much.
Deepavali is being celebrated everywhere in India with fervor and enthusiasm.
India is a country of 365 days, a country of some or the other corner of the country.
But one thing we can see clearly is that the entire journey of the festivals of India, its spread, its depth, and the acceptance among the people, all these things are connected with the essence of the mantra - moving towards an individual society.
Festivals reflect responsibility on trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds etc.
Now we celebrate Sundays holidays, but you must have seen that the previous generations, be it the working class, or the fishermen, had observed holidays on the day of full moon and new moon.
Science has proved that what kind of change is there in the sea water on the day of full moon and new moon days, what kind of impact is there on nature.
It affects the human mind.
That is, in our country, we have a tradition of celebrating holidays with grandeur and science.
Today, we are celebrating the festival of Deepavali, as I have said earlier, every festival of ours is teaching, imparting knowledge.
This festival of Diwali is also a message for us that we should move from darkness to light.
This is not a sign, but a darkness, which is not without light.
The darkness of superstition, the darkness of illiteracy, the darkness of poverty and the darkness of social evils.
If we are able to get rid of the darkness of darkness and the lack of an individual, then this is the purpose of spreading the light of Diwali.
One thing is very well known to us that if you go to any corner of India, be it the house of a very rich person or be it the house of a poor man or be it the house of a poor man or be it the festival of Diwali or be it the festival of Diwali then you can see that there is a cleanliness campaign in every family.
Cleanliness is visible in every corner of the house.
He would have kept his soil shining, but he would have kept his soil clean.
On the occasion of Canadian Prime Minister Deepawali, he is sharing his film with the lamp through Twitter.
The Prime Minister of the UK had hosted a reception in London for the entire community, on the occasion of Diwali.
The city of England, which does not celebrate Deepavali with great celebrations, is also not there.
Singapore's Prime Minister shared a film with great pride across the world at Instagram.
Do you know what that film is?
The film is about 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament wearing Indian attire and standing by the Parliament.
All this has been done on the occasion of Diwali.
The thing that I would like to say is that Diwali is the festival of lights it is a big day that inspires the people of the world to move from darkness to light.
News about accidents, fire and premature death during Diwali are worrying.
There is another problem - doctors are going to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers and there is a dilemma that unites them with one difficulty.
I especially appeal to the parents and the guardians that while the children burn crackers, the elders must also stay with them, be careful that there is no mistake, and dont panic.
Deepavali is celebrated in our country for many days.
It's not a one-day thing;
Govardhan Puja, Bhai Dooj and Lap Panchami are going on in such a way that it is going on till the glorious festival of Karthik Poornima and in a way it is a long time.
In addition to this, we are also celebrating the festival of Deepavali and engaged in the preparation of the preparations for the worship of Sat.
In the eastern part of India, the festival of Chhath-Pooja is a big festival.
In a way, it is a big festival, it is celebrated for four days, but its a special feature - it gives a great message to the society.
It is difficult to calculate the difference between man and man, whether directly or indirectly.
This sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers and the security personnel of our Armed Forces is in my mind.
I would like to share one thing from the world of these feelings - let us dedicate this Diwali to the security forces.
I called upon the countrymen to participate in a movement called Sandesh2 Soldiers, that is, news for the soldiers.
I would like to bow down to the brave soldiers of the country, no citizen who is neither proud of the soldiers nor of the security forces.
The media has also turned this festival into a day of gratitude to the soldiers.
When we are in a mood to celebrate, if we think about them at that time then a new energy also emerges in those memories.
One message also provides a multi-dimensional power and the country is also doing it.
And some drew pictures, and cast lots, and made cartoons.
I can imagine how proud these moments are for the soldiers of my country.
Several things have been identified in the hashtag Sandesh2 Soldiers.
I would like to read the poetry written by Shri Ashwani Kumar Chauhan.
Ashwini ji writes: I am celebrating the festival, I am smiling, I am celebrating the festival, I am enjoying it, I am smiling, I am smiling, these are all because of you, today I am saying this.
I wish you and the people of the country the very best.
My dear countrymen, at a time when soldiers are full of soldiers at their native place and in a nearby house, a sister Shivani sent a phone call to me.
Let's hear what the soldier's family wants to say.
Greetings Prime Minister, I am delighted to be addressing the nation on this auspicious occasion.
Along with the army officers and soldiers, their families and their wives make a lot of sacrifices.
In a way, even the entire military community has received a very good news.
My dear countrymen, a soldier is found not only in the border but at every stage of life.
You must have heard that Himachal has been freed from the habit of defecating in the open.
Vikas Thakur is a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh and belongs to Badana.
Our soldiers from the ITBP went to their village for the vacations.
He visited the village panchayat and was discussing about the construction of toilets in the Gram Panchayat.
It was found that some families were unable to build toilets due to liquidity constraints.
He immediately took out his cheque and handed it over a cheque of Rs.57,000 to the Sarpanch of the Panchayat, Rs.1000 each from the 57 houses where there is no toilet, from my side to every family, build 57 toilets, keep the village of Padana free from the habit of defecation.
Vikas Thakur Ji has done this thing that he has provided 1000 rupees each to 57 families and has given a new energy to the Swachh Bharat Mission.
This is the reason why Himachal Pradesh is free from open defecation.
Similarly, in Kerala too, I want to express my gratitude to the youth for this thing.
Immediately, NCC cadets, NSS volunteers and engineering students came together to decide on building toilets.
They carried all the material like brick, cement and cement that were required to build toilets on their shoulders and went to the forest all day long.
They built toilets in the village through their hard work. These young people freed the small villages of remote forests from the habit of defecating in the open.
That is why Kerala is going to become an open defecation free state.
The state of Gujarat has declared more than 150 people in all municipalities and municipalities have been freed from the habit of defecating in the open.
10 districts have been declared free from this habit.
But generally these things are not taken care of.
The old project and the new project are under implementation and the coming project will be expected to be completed in a similar manner.
In our country where there is a gas stove, where there is electricity in any house, they do not need kerosene.
But the people who are concerned about the government, the people who are concerned about it, the people who are being supplied with kerosene, they are supplied with gas and electricity, and the middle class is getting the opportunity to earn money.
Look at the big change that will be there, black market will be stopped, it will be beneficial for the environment, our foreign exchange will be saved and people will be benefitted.
Yes, there is no doubt that the middlemen and the currency holders will suffer.
My dear countrymen, Gandhiji has always been a guiding light for all of us.
In every case, his claim that wherever the country goes, how to travel, determines the standard.
It is the need of the hour that we should focus on the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step after the other so that they can be freed from the difficulties.
Whatever our old thinking is, we should free the society from the difference between man and woman.
Now there are toilets for girls and boys in schools as well.
It is a good time for our daughters to become a nation without discrimination.
Immunization is being done on the part of the government but even then lakhs of children get rid of vaccination and become victims of diseases.
Mission Indradhanush is being run for children who have been left out of vaccination, which gives children the power to get rid of serious diseases.
We have been in the 21st century but the darkness of the villages is no longer confined to the villages. A massive campaign of providing electricity to the villages is progressing successfully.
Even after so many years of independence, how would her health be when she used to cook food on firewood and 400 cigarettes.
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore families from smoke and we are moving on the path of success.
Small traders, small traders, vegetable sellers, milk sellers and retailers are getting credit for interest on loans from mortgage companies.
MUDRA Yojana, Stand-up scheme and Jan Dhan Yojana are successful movements to get rid of the creditor for interest.
Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) through Aadhaar enables direct benefit transfer to the beneficiaries.
A good opportunity to get rid of the customers in the lives of common people.
We have to fulfil our minds through the memories of our ancestors.
But a phone call from Punjab, it hurts, it touched my heart. Prime Minister, Namaste, Sir, I am speaking from Punjab.
Sir, on 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel had worked throughout his life to unite the country, he had succeeded in this goal, he had united everyone.
Indira Gandhi Ji was assassinated on that day itself, as is the misfortune of the country or what else to say.
After that, all of us know very well what kind of incidents have happened in the country.
I would like to know your views on how to stop such unfortunate incidents.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not only of a human being.
After Chanakya, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had done the work of uniting the country.
Sardar Patel made efforts for unity, because of his primary aim, and because he was angry with many, yet his path of unity was not far from the goal.
But on the birth anniversary of the same Sardar, thousands of Sardars, the families of thousands of Sardars, were murdered after the assassination of Mrs. Indira Gandhi.
The atrocities committed against the Sardars on the birthday of that great man, who spent his entire life for unity, are hurting all of us, on one side of history.
But despite these difficulties, we have to move forward with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the biggest strength of the country.
Unity in diversity is the strength of India, it is the strength of India, it is the strength of India.
Every generation has a duty and every government has responsibility in every corner of our country to seek an opportunity for unity and to advance the principle of unity.
We will also stay away from separatist ideologies and divisions and will also protect the country.
Sardar Saheb has given us an integrated India and we all have the responsibility of making it a grand India.
The mantra of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' is the strong foundation of unity.
The journey of Sardar Saheb started only in the farmers' struggle.
He is the son of a farmer.
Today we have heard the name of Amul.
Everything in Amul is familiar with India as well as abroad.
But only a few can understand that due to Sardar's vision, the formation of the milk producer cooperative union was made.
We have a living example of how Miller and Amul were established in 1942, how Sardar Saheb had worked for the welfare of the farmers.
I pay my respects to Sardar Ji.
Wherever we may be, on the 31st of October, we will remember Sardar Saheb and resolve for unity.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Kartik Poornima falls on this auspicious occasion.
Guru Nanak Dev's teachings are not only for the entire humanity, they are not only for India but also for the entire humanity.
The message of Guru Nanak Devji is - , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , :
Peace, unity and harmony are the core mantras.
In every case of Guru Nanak Devji, the purpose of liberating the society from the evils of diversity, superstitions and vices was inherent.
May your dreams, your resolutions be successful in all possible ways.
In the past, we have lost 18 soldiers of our country when a terrorist attack has been unleashed in Uri region of Jammu Kashmir.
My tributes to all the brave soldiers who laid down their lives.
This cowardly incident has shaken the whole country.
There is a lot of grief and anger in the pulse of the people.
This loss is not only for the families of those soldiers who lost their children, lost their brothers and sisters.
The entire country is experiencing this loss.
Therefore, my countrymen, even today I say this thing before you that the criminals will be punished they will not be able to escape the punishment.
My dear countrymen, we have immense faith in our army.
They will defeat every conspiracy due to their bravery. The 1.25 billion people of the country will display their courage in leading a peaceful and peaceful life.
We are extremely proud of our army.
Today, I specially want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the enemy forces of the country.
As they begin to understand the truth, they are beginning to distance themselves from the evil forces and walk on the path of peace.
It is the desire of every parents that schools and colleges should start functioning at a fast pace.
For the past few days, business has started doing well.
We know that peace, unity and harmony can be the solution to our problems, it can be our path of progress and our path of development.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that if we discuss peacefully and resolve on every issue and find a way out, then we will be able to provide a better direction to the future generations of Kashmir.
It is the responsibility of the security of the citizens of Kashmir.
The administration has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I also request the security forces of the country that we have the capability, power, law and order and the rules and regulations that are there in our law and order system that are there to ensure a peaceful life of the common man of Kashmir and that we should follow them in a proper manner.
Sometimes those who think differently from our point of view offer new ideas.
A young man, who is a student of class 11, has given me a different idea.
After the terrorist attack, my mind was more concerned about it, I felt the desire to do something, but I could not find the way to do it.
Harsh Vardhan I am happy that you have thought positively at such a young age and at such a young age.
But Harshavardhana has a great respect for the anger of the people of the country.
This is an expression of the feelings of the people of the country.
Yes, you have put forward a positive approach.
But you know that Lal Bahadur Shastri ji led the country during the 1965 war, this was the feeling that was there in the entire country, this was the feeling that was there, this was the feeling that was the dream of patriotism.
There was a commitment of every citizen to do something or the other.
At that time, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried to give the country these feelings in a very noble manner.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and encouraged the common man of the country to work for the service of the nation.
Every citizen must make another attempt to express patriotism between the lusts of the bombings, which Lal Bahadur Shastri put forward.
While Gandhiji was leading the freedom struggle, at a time when the freedom struggle was deeply cherished, he was successful in providing a platform to the society for constructive work when it needed another platform.
Let us and our army fulfill our duties, let those in charge of the administration discharge their duties, let us make some positive contribution in the spirit of patriotism, let us make our nation reach new heights.
My dear countrymen, Karthik ji has said on the Narendra Modi App that the history of our sportspersons who had gone to participate in the Para Olympics is a victory of Humanity.
Varun Viswanathan has registered on the Narendra Modi app that our sportspersons have done a great job and you have requested this in your Mann Ki Baat address.
Not only for both of you, every citizen of the country has got an emotional connect with the players who took part in the Para Olympics.
Beyond sports, this para Olympics and the achievements of our sportspersons have completely transformed the humanitarian perspective and the vision that we see the differently-abled.
I will never forget the words of our victorious sister Deepa Malik Ji after winning the medal.
This time, 19 players, including 3 women from our country, took part in the Para Olympics.
As compared to other sports, when differently-abled people play games, their physical fitness and their talent in sports is a bigger thing - mental determination and determination.
Mariyaappan Thangavelu won the Gold Medal in the Games.
Mariyaappan lost his right leg just at the age of five.
Even poverty could not hinder his resolve.
He is not a resident of a big city, but a middle class family and a rich family.
He crossed a difficult life at the age of 21 and went on to win a medal without bothering about physical hardships, with only grit and determination.
While they have stirred up our emotions, they have also changed the perspective that we see the differently-abled.
Can anyone imagine that people with disabilities can break the status of regular Olympics?
This time it happened.
Abdul Lathepkar from Algerian side, in the race for Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) 1.
Once again I express my heartfelt appreciation to these players and I say that in the coming days, India will move forward in the direction of making a positive plan for the Para Olympics and for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a very different experience in the Navsari of Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
A mega camp for Divyangjan was organised by the Government of India in which several world records were created.
I had to meet a little girl who had no eyes on her, and Gauri Shardul her name was a small child who had come from the remote forest area of Nangk district and had a mental state throughout the epic.
And it came to pass, when she had told me part thereof, that the people were astonished, when I told it before the congregation.
I believe that the Government of India has achieved a world record in Navsari.
The process of hearing impaired 600 Divyangjans with hearing aids was carried out within 8 hours.
It took place in the Guinness World Records book.
It is a matter of great pride for our countrymen that three world records are being created by Divyangjans in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on the 2nd of October, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
On that day, I had said that cleanliness should become our normal, it should be the duty of every citizen, it should be seen as a filthiness.
Today, on the 2nd of October, on the occasion of completion of two years, I am sure that there has been a awareness of cleanliness in the hearts of 1.25 billion people of the country.
Similarly, when we say that we will take one step towards cleanliness, everyone has made an effort to take one step.
That is, 1.25 billion feet of the country are moving towards cleanliness.
If the direction is right, then the results will be good.
Be it the common man, the rulers, the government offices, roads, buses or railway stations, schools or colleges, places of worship, hospitals, children and the elderly, the poor, the farmers and the women of the village have all contributed to the cleanliness.
Media friends have also done a positive job.
This progress is not enough, we still have to make progress.
It's very important;
This is the reason why about 2 crore 48 lakh toilets have been constructed so far while talking about rural India. This is the reason why more than 212 crore toilets have been constructed so far.
In the states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, the practice of open defecation will soon be brought to an end.
Recently, when I visited Porbandar, the birth place of Gandhi ji in Gujarat, I was told by the officials that the day will end the practice of defecating in the open on 2nd October.
Come, people, let's take a pledge and make progress.
Especially my young brothers are using technology completely today and I want to present a scheme before them.
The Government of India has arranged a telephone number 1969 to know how the Swachh Bharat Mission is in your city.
You can take full advantage of it, especially the younger generation.
The Government of India appeals to the corporate world to come forward and share your contributions.
Support the profession of young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
We can make use of the clean India partners, Swachh Bharat fellows in the districts.
If this Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is stopped by the governments, progress will not be made, cleanliness will not be fulfilled naturally.
Wealth from waste is also important.
Therefore, along with the cleanliness mission, we have to move towards the direction of waste to fertilizer.
The fertilizer companies have been asked to buy compost made from the waste.
The farmers who want to engage in organic farming should find a way to get this fertilizer.
Whoever wants to improve his land, whoever is interested in the welfare of the land, whoever has suffered a lot due to chemical fertilizers, even if there is a small amount of the requirement of this fertilizer, this fertilizer should be given to him.
Amitabh Bachchan has been instrumental in this task as a business ambassador.
From all over the country, the ministers, the chief ministers, the mayors and the commissioners will come together to discuss and deliberate on cleanliness.
What can be achieved by technology
What can be a financial model
All these things are being discussed.
I have been constantly watching the latest news of cleanliness coming up.
One day I read a newspaper that students of Gujarat Technical University had gone to 107 villages to create awareness about the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has prepared a Calendar for one year in its Ministries.
Each department should focus on cleanliness for 15 days.
In the coming month from October 1 to 15, 2018, all three departments of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayati Raj and Ministry of Rural Development are jointly developing and implementing the Swachhata-related programmes on the borders.
In the last two weeks of the month of October, from 16th October to 31st October, 2017, three more ministries - Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs - will implement the Swachhta Mission in their respective jurisdictions.
I appeal to the citizens that if your work is related to these sectors, then you too should join it.
You might have noticed that today a cleanliness drive is going on.
First, a survey was conducted in 73 cities about how cleanliness is in place, which was presented to the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with a population of more than 1 lakh, now their way, in every city, we are lagging behind, we are confident of moving forward the next time.
There is a competition about cleanliness.
We have to give as much contribution as the citizens can to this mission.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri will be celebrated.
It has been two years since the Swachh Bharat Mission began.
I have been asking Gandhi ji to start Diwali and buy Khadi clothes at least.
Once again I would like to request every family to buy a Khadi fabric so that the lamp in the homes of the poor could be lit.
On Sunday, the 2nd of October, as a citizen, cant we do anything related to cleanliness
I request you to physically join me for 2 hours and 4 hours and share a photo of it with me on the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, share that video.
With the efforts of all of us, this movement will get strength and new momentum once again across the country.
Remembering Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji, let us pledge to do something for the country.
The response from the people of the country to my request to abolish the Gas Subsidy in the recent past has been one of the most encouraging sources in the lives of the country.
This is a mission to collect food and clothing to the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers took to the streets, donated old toys for the families, brought them to the Anganwadi of the poor people.
Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji explained the political ideas through which lakhs of workers like me have been working.
The centenary of Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji, who gave the political ideas related to the roots of India, the culture of India, the tradition of Indian culture, the political philosophy of that process and the philosophy of humanism, begins today.
Sarvajan Hitai, Sarvajan Sukhai, Everyone's Welfare and Everyone's Happiness is his contribution.
Gandhiji spoke of the well-being of the last man.
How can we bring the fruits of development to the poorest of the poor
In one word, Deendayal has put forward the entire economic plan in which every hand has a job, every land has water.
The country should celebrate his birth centenary year as a welfare year for the poor.
The focus should be on social and government, and on how to bring the fruits of development to the poor.
I remember with great respect the revered Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay who was an inspiration for all of us and a source of inspiration for all of us.
The common man of this country is encouraging me.
What are the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of this country
It has been revealed in Mann Ki Baat that everything in my mind and mind is recorded in Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for putting in your best efforts to broadcast my thoughts and convey them to all languages.
They compiled letters after Mann Ki Baat and gave suggestions and made them sound at the doors of the government, highlighted the shortcomings of the government, Akashwani prepared special programs with such letters, invited representatives from the government and set up a platform for resolving the issues.
Mann Ki Baat has not only stopped for 15-20 minutes but has also created a new opportunity for social change.
What else can be better than this?
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all those who have contributed in this success, and I salute them.
My dear countrymen, next week, Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadashmi will be coming, the arrangements for Diwali will begin and a different kind of atmosphere is there throughout the country.
This is the time for energy efficiency and the unity of society is the strength of the country.
Be it Navratri or Durga Puja, we will consider worshipping this Shakti as a way of social unity.
Keeping in mind the ideals of peace, unity and harmony, let us take the holy days of Navratri and Durga Puja to take the country towards new heights.
Let us celebrate Vijayadashmi as Vijayadashami.
This day is being celebrated across the country as National Sports Day.
He was awarded the Gold Medal for India at the Olympic Games held in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
At that time it took only 10 minutes to complete the game.
Thyanand said that in those 10 minutes I put three rods and I put the rod in retaliation for the wound.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a time for Mann Ki Baat, many suggestions are available on Mygov.in and on NarendraModiApp.
They are of a variety.
But this time, I have made the most of the demands that I be sure about the Rio Olympics.
It is very encouraging to see the interest of the people in the Rio Olympics, and the pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to talk about it.
Even beyond cricket, the people of India are so eager for sports, so much awareness and so much information.
Sachin has written a request to you, this time, you must talk about 'Sindhu, Sakshi' and 'Dipa Karkar' in Mann Ki Baat.
One of these women is from North India, one from South India, one from East India and the other from one corner of India.
It seems that the daughters of India have accepted the responsibility of bringing pride to the country.
On MyGov, Mr. Shekhar Tagore wrote that we could have done even better in the Olympics.
He further said, Respected Modi sir, I congratulate you for the two medals won by us in Rio.
There is a need to go a long way in sports.
Our parents are focused only on studies today.
Even in the society, they still look at sports with the point of view of timing.
We have to change this attitude.
There is a need to encourage society.
Who can do this work better than you
Similarly, Shri Satyaprakash Mehra has also written on NarendraModiApp. Mann Ki Baat had called for emphasis on the need for extra-curricular activities.
In a way, the same spirit was reflected in the writings of thousands.
It is true that there is no alternative to the fact that we are unable to work according to our expectations.
We have got two medals in the medals tally.
For the first time in many cases, India's players have shown considerable talent, even if they do not receive medals.
In the shooting, our Abhinav Bindra has secured 4th position and he has lost his medal in a very short span of time.
Similarly, the tennis events took place on the lines of Sania Mirza-Rohan Bobana.
We have done well in the Athletics section this time.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babu got the title of the Trek Field competition.
For the first time in the last 36 years, men have been successful in achieving a go-out position in the hockey match.
Vikas Krishna Yadav reached the final stage in boxing, but he could not get a bronze medal.
Many soldiers, for example - Adhist Ashok, Tattoo Pongal and Athanu Das, have performed their duties.
But my dear countrymen, we need to do more.
But if we continue to act as we have done so far, perhaps we will have to be disappointed again.
I have announced the formation of a committee.
The Government of India is deeply concerned about the kind of activities that are taking place in the world.
Action plan will be drawn on the areas in which we can work well.
We have to prepare our plans with a vision of 2020, 2025 and 2028.
I appeal to all the interested Indian citizens to send their suggestions to me on the NarendraModiApp.
Let the State Governments send their suggestions after the deliberations.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teachers Day.
I was able to learn a lot with these little boys.
For me, the 5th of September is not just a teacher's day, it is also an education day.
But this time when I had to visit the G20 Summit, it seemed that today I would like to express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat.
The teacher's place is as important as the place of mother in life.
We have seen teachers who are more concerned about us than us.
They have dedicated their lives for their disciples, for their students.
Today, I see Gobind Singh ji as a great teacher beyond being a sportsman.
On Teacher's Day, I salute Bullela Gopichand ji for his penance and his complete dedication towards sports and the nature of joy he has with him in the success of his teachers.
The contribution of teachers in the lives of all of us has always been felt.
On September 5, 2017, the former President of India, Dr.
Radhakrishnan's birthday:
Whatever he had achieved in his life, he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only this, he always says that a student inside a good teacher never dies.
It also contains references to the books it read during that month and quotes from them.
He would have said that what I did throughout the month was not correct in his view.
Even today he is teaching me in his classroom.
Even today, he is providing me with a kind of distance education.
When I see his signature at the age of 90, I wonder how he can write so many pearls in this old age.
Because my signature is so bad that if someone has written beautifully then there is a lot of respect in my mind.
Just like my experience, you might have experienced it.
Whatever good you have got in your life by your teachers, if you call it universality then there will be a change in the perspective that we see teachers, it will be an honor.
It is our responsibility to raise the dignity of teachers in the society.
If you have a photo taken with your teachers, if there has been any incident with your teacher, if there is any motivation related to your teacher, then you must share it on NarendraModiApp.
It is a matter of great value for the students to see the contribution of the teachers of the country.
But when we talk of Vinayaka Chaturvedi, it is natural that our memories of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak are alive.
Lokmanya Tilak's gift is a tradition that celebrates the festival of Vinayaka Chaturvedi socially.
He changed the religious discourse through the Victory Parade, into a day of national awareness, and became a day of social culture.
VinayakaChaturthi discussed all the questions that touch the lives of the society, which have led to a new awakening and a new development in the society.
Moreover, the mantra given by him - 'Swaraj is our birthright' should be the focal point, and the strength for the freedom struggle should be there.
Today, not only in Maharashtra but in the entire country, it is not being celebrated socially.
They discuss public issues, conduct essay competitions, and compete in drawing the kolam.
The scenes would have shown artistic exposure to the society.
In a way, the campaign to spread awareness among all, is being carried out through a socialized platform like VinayakaChaturthi.
Lokmanya Tilak ji has given us the honor of our birth rights.
But now we are in a free India.
Come on, I'll call you.
It is true that celebrations are the forces of society.
They give a new lease of life to the individual and the society.
Life without celebrations is not possible, but it has to be changed according to the need of the hour.
I can see that this time many people have written about Vinayaka Chaturvedi and Durga Puja.
They are concerned about the environment.
Shri SankaranarayanaPrashant had said, Modi ji, you must understand through Mann Ki Baat that you do not use the idols made by the plaster of Paris.
He and many others have expressed their concerns that the statues made by the plaster of Paris are not environment-friendly.
I appeal to all of you that we should use the statue of a child made of clay or the statue of Durga, to restore our old heritage.
Lord Ganesha removes all obstacles.
In such a situation, we should not create a statue of Lord Ganesha that makes us uncomfortable.
I don't know how you take what I say, but I don't just say that, many people say that.
A sculptor from Pune, Shri Abhijeet Dotballe, a founder from Kolhapur, Nirik Mitra, Vikyan Prabodhini, Nisrak Kata from Vidharpa, Gyan Prabodhini from Pune, Kirgavasa from Mumbai, RAA Raja.
Many such organizations and individuals are making great efforts to create earthen statues. They are also campaigning for it.
It is also a social service that does not pollute the environment.
The Durga Puja is yet to take place.
And for the families that do traditional idols, there is employment through these molten images.
We will take a resolution that the environment will be protected as they will be done on the soil of our ponds and rivers.
Mother Theresa, who had served the poor of India, is now going to be given the title of Saint, but it is natural for all the people of the country to feel proud.
We have got the opportunity to learn something from the saints, sages, as well as the monks every moment.
We have received something from them, we are learning more, we are understanding the good things.
My dear countrymen, when progress is a mission, how big a change it will bring about
People's power is seen in the form of strength.
In the last few days, the Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments, has made a successful effort to create a clean Ganga and to clean the Ganga with the people.
On the 20th of this month, the leaders of the villages living on the banks of the river Ganga had called for a meeting in Allahabad.
And they had men, and women.
My best wishes to all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have done this great job.
I also express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Ministers of the five states who have helped in connecting the peoples power to the holy river Ganga by taking an important step.
My dear countrymen, there are a few things that touch my heart sometimes. There is a special respect in my mind for those who create such an opportunity.
On 15th July, 2017, 1.1. from more than 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh.
More than 2.5 million students wrote letters to their parents socially.
Some people had written to their parents in English, some in Hindi and some in the language of Chhattisgarh that they should have toilets in their homes.
They had demanded that a toilet be constructed. Some children had written this year that even if you dont celebrate my birthday, it is not okay but you must also build a toilet.
The work was done by children between the age of seven to seventeen years.
In Koppal district of Karnataka, there is a 16-year-old Malamma who has made a satyagraha against her family.
These things he did not do to achieve himself, to wear good clothes, to eat sweets;
The grip of daughter-in-law Malamma is that she wants a toilet in her house too.
Look at the magnificence of the village leader Mohammad Shafi, he has arranged Rs. 18,000 and he has built a toilet within a week.
But everyone is connected in some way or the other, everyone is making a positive contribution.
I also appeal to the TV channels to make such short films and organize competitions.
There's no need for a big studio to produce a film and a big camera.
In today's time, you can use the camera in your mobile phone to produce a film.
Our Honble President Pranab Mukherjee had inaugurated a new program called Akashwani Matri Channel in Kolkata.
Many people will be able to question the President of the country about the launch of a radio channel.
Bangladesh is our neighbour.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are living together with the same cultural heritage.
Here, Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Bidar radios will be across the border and people from both sides will be happy to hear the Akashvani which will be telecasting programmes on each other.
Connecting people with people is also a great contribution of Akashwani.
This was inaugurated by the President.
I also express my gratitude to the people of Bangladesh who are associated with us in this task.
I congratulate the friends from Akashwani for their contribution in foreign policy as well.
My dear countrymen, all of you might have made me the Prime Minister of the country, but I too am a man like you.
That's why sometimes some emotional events drench my mind.
Such emotional events provide a new energy and a new inspiration to the people of the country, which inspires them to achieve something.
A few days ago, a letter came to me touching my heart.
It was written by a mother, about 84 years old:
Had he not asked the retired teacher not to mention his name, I would have mentioned his name.
I also quit the subsidy when you asked me to quit the subsidy on gas, and I forgot about it.
For me, the letter written by the Prime Minister of India is equivalent to the Padma Shri award.
Ladies and Gentlemen, You are well aware of the fact that I have written a letter from my side to all those who have rejected the gas subsidy and have made an effort to hand over the subsidy to those who have rejected it.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
My dear countrymen, last year we were hit by the drought but this August has caused a lot of havoc.
There have been flooding again in some parts of the country.
The State Governments, the Union Government, the Local Bodies, the Social Welfare Organisations and the citizens have made concerted efforts.
But in the midst of these tragic floods, some things are remembered.
In August this year, we will recall the impact of the power of working together, and of walking shoulder to shoulder.
In August 2016, the opposition parties, the 90 parties across the country, and all the political parties in the parliament together passed the GST.
Congratulations to all the political parties for this achievement.
This is a wonderful example of what all the political parties can benefit from moving together.
Similarly, all the political parties of the country came together to discuss the Kashmir issue in one voice regarding the situation in Kashmir.
The message was delivered to the world, to the separatist forces, and to the people of Kashmir.
After discussing Kashmir with all the political parties, one thing was revealed that if I want to suppress it in two words then it is the unity and love of the people.
These two words embodied the original mantra.
Whoever dies in Kashmir, whether it is the life of a young man or the life of a security force, it is ours, it is ours, it is the faith of all of us, the faith of 1.25 billion people, the confidence of the village leader and the faith of all the Prime Ministers of the country.
In order to create unrest in Kashmir, the front-runners of small children have to be answered for some day in response to these unblemished children.
I believe in 1.25 billion people of the country.
Yesterday morning, I got the opportunity to spend a few moments with the youth of Delhi. And I hope that in the days to come, the enthusiasm and zeal of every young person in the country will increase.
We all know that in a few days, the biggest Kumbh of the World Games is going to be held.
The word 'Rio' is going to be retarded in our ears.
Yesterday, in Delhi, the Government of India had organised the Run for Rio detachment, play, play, play and develop a wonderful system.
In the coming days, wherever we may be, we will try something or the other to encourage our sportspersons.
I am ready to do this work from your side.
The Prime Minister of the country is ready as a postman to convey his best wishes to our sportspersons.
Come, let us all, in the coming days, honour each and every player, and encourage his efforts and do whatever he can.
Today as I am talking about the Rio Olympics, I read a poem written by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of love of poetry from Punjab Central University.
Similarly, many other poets may have written poems in this context, some might have made them mesmerized, some might have done this thing in every language, but today I want to share with you the poetry written by Surajji.
Let gold be of brass, and of brass of gold be of brass.
Surajji, I dedicate your feelings to all these players and I convey my best wishes to you from my side, to the 1.25 billion countrymen, to fly our flag proudly in Rio.
Mr.
But whenever Abdul Kalam ji is named after him, there is a future picture of India which is capable of science, technology and missile.
In that way, what efforts are being made by your government to fulfil the dreams of Abdul Kalam
At the same time, if we want to make our footsteps music, then research and innovation must also become the life of technology.
If research and innovation are not created then technology will become a burden on us as well as on how to drain the stagnant water.
If we do not do research and innovation, if we rely only on the old technology, then in the changing times, we will be put to an end.
Therefore, the government has been making several efforts to inculcate the spirit of science in the minds of our young people, of technology and of research.
That's why I say Let us aim to innovate, we aim to innovate.
When I call it 'AIM', it means 'Atal Innovation Mission'.
If we want to create the next generation of innovators then we should connect our small entrepreneurs with this scheme.
Therefore, the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
10 lakh and Rs. 10 lakh will be provided for maintenance in the next 5 years where such centres are being set up.
Similarly, innovation is directly linked to the incubation centre.
If we have a strong and robust incubation centre, then we have a system that will help in creating innovations, conducting tests for start-ups and integrating them.
While it is necessary to set up a new hubs, it is also important to strengthen the old ones.
Our day-to-day life is marked by problems in our eyes.
Now we have to find technological solutions.
As Atal Grand Challenges, we have made an appeal to the younger generation of the country to come up with the help of technology, explore and innovate wherever there is a problem in your eyes.
The Government of India would like to encourage and give special awards to the technology that has been identified to solve our problems.
When we talk about the Tinkering Lab, we are happy that more than 13,000 schools have applied and we are talking about the creativity of the centre and more than 4000 non-academic organizations have come forward to set up such centres.
I am sure that the real tribute we can pay to Abdul Kalam for his research, innovations and finding solutions through technology to the problems we face in our daily lives and making it easier to get rid of our difficulties.
The more our younger generation pays attention to these things, the more important their role is in designing the modern India of the 21st century, this will be the true tribute we can pay to Abdul Kalam ji.
My dear countrymen, there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a time when there was a lot of concern about drought.
The State Governments and the Central Government are working together shoulder to shoulder with each other to help the flood victims.
Rainfall at the centre of all our economic activities and agriculture remains the focal point of our efforts.
Sometimes the diseases that trouble us all the way of life also frighten us.
But if we wake up, if we move, then the way out of it is easy.
Let's take the fever of dengue.
We can protect ourselves from dengue fever.
Even though the government, hospitals and doctors all have done their work, we should not allow dengue to occur in our homes, in our areas, in our families and in our families. This is what I request you all to do.
My dear countrymen, I would like to draw your attention to one more issue.
If life becomes so emergency and fast, then sometimes it becomes timeless for us to think about ourselves.
You can get relief if you want for a few moments, but you should stop the habit of using antibiotics without recommendation.
If the doctor has recommended that 15 antibiotics be taken within 5 days, please finish the recommendation on the date of the doctor's advice.
If we leave it half way that we are no longer in need, it is beneficial for the microbes and they become even stronger.
We call it antibiotics in medicine, therefore how much antibiotics and how to use them, it is also important to follow the rules that they take.
The government is committed to preventing antibiotics.
You must have noticed that the antibiotics that have been sold recently, a coat of red color has been developed on the bed, and this has made you aware, and you should take care of it.
When we talk of health, I want to add one more thing to it.
The health of pregnant women in our country is sometimes a cause of great concern.
Every year about 3 crore women are pregnant in our country, but some mothers die during childbirth, some children die during childbirth.
Sometimes both mother and child die.
Even though it is true that there has been a decline in the mortality rate of mothers in the past decade, we are still unable to save the lives of pregnant mothers.
No matter what kind of risk during or after delivery, any type of anaemia, labour-related infections and high blood pressure will be the driving force for their life.
Keeping all this in mind, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission in the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan i.e.
My medical brothers and sisters, cant they dedicate themselves in this work for the poor for 12 days in a year
Many people have written letters to me in the past.
I believe that you will definitely join it.
My dear countrymen, today, the entire world is concerned about climate change, global warming and the environment.
There is a lot of discussion going on between the people of the country and the world.
India has strengthened this idea for centuries.
In the song, Lord Krishna says: 'Sarvavrukshanam' i.e.
It is said that there is no plant that does not have any medicinal properties.
The example of Sonal, a woman from Pune, attracted my attention.
On the mountain of Mahabharata, trees are said to be performing the responsibilities of Makadsheel even in heaven, whereas Sonal has accepted the challenge of fulfilling not only the wishes of his parents but also the wishes of the entire society.
Janner of Pune, Maharashtra, Khandu Maruti Mahatre, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Taluka.
Many people are making efforts in this direction.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, during the month of Bhadra, I have seen a large number of pilgrims coming to the temple of Amba Devi there.
Once a social service organization has provided a tree house to those who worship the temple and if they go and plant it in your village then mother-in-law will continue to give you her blessings.
Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims who came and planted hundreds of thousands of trees that year.
Even temples can start a tradition of planting trees in the rainy season instead of Prasad.
This can lead to a peoples movement related to tree plantation.
I once again request my farmer brothers and sisters, Why dont we grow coconut trees instead of planting trees and destroying our lands at the borders of our farmlands
Today, in India, we have to import single tree for manufacturing things like house, chair etc. from abroad.
The government has created a peoples movement and Rajasthan is a desert area.
Even there, a massive forest festival has been celebrated and a resolution of 25 lakh trees has been taken.
The planting of 2.5 million trees in Rajasthan is not a small thing.
Only those who know about the land of Rajasthan know how big this is a challenge.
Andhra Pradesh has taken a decision to increase green cover to 50 by 2029.
Even in Gujarat, Van Mahotsav is a very popular heritage.
This year, in Gujarat, several projects have been undertaken in the areas of forest cover, forest cover, forest cover, forest cover and so on. Of these, several crore saplings have been planted.
International agreements have been signed in several areas, such as diplomatic/diplomacy, trade-related discussions, security-related interactions, etc., on foreign visits.
But for me, South Africa's journey is in a way comparable to that of a Thalass.
It is natural that when we think of South Africa, the memories of Gandhiji and Nelson Mandela should be raised in mind.
When the words of Ahimsa, love and forgiveness of the world falls in the ears, the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela appear before us.
As part of my visit to South Africa, I had to visit the Fonix complex and the place where Gandhiji lived was known as Sarvodaya.
I got the good opportunity to travel to the Petersberg station where Gandhiji used to sow the seeds of Mohantas in which he used to travel.
This time, I got the opportunity to meet many great men who sacrificed their youth for the sake of equality and equality.
Nelson Mandela fought shoulder to shoulder and spent 20-25 years in prisons.
In a way, they had sacrificed their entire youth. I had a great opportunity to see the great personalities like Ahmad Kadada ji, Lalu (CHEBA), Siba ji and George Bezos ji and Ronnie Castors who are close to Nelson Mandela.
While I was talking to them, when I was listening to their prison experiences, there was no bitterness or bitterness in their minds.
The spirit of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas is the way forward for a brighter future.
Come, let us take pride in thinking of these Indians who have lived our basic mantras of life even in South Africa.
Recently, I read in a news article that a woman trapped in fraud and fraud email lost 11 lakh rupees and finally committed suicide.
My thoughts are with his family and well-wishers in this regard.
I want to know what your views on such fraudulent emails are.
A new strategy of using technology is spreading all over the world.
How technology plays a major role in the economic system, its misuse is increasing.
At the time of retirement, at the time of marriage for a daughter, one day there was a miniscule one day, you have received a huge reward from abroad, and to achieve this, it was mentioned that if you pay Rs.2 lakh to the bank for the customs duty, then this person also took Rs.2 lakh from a person who had worked hard in his life and sent it to an unknown person.
Whoever creates a fake letter pad, who gets your credit card number, debit card number, and cleans your bank account with the help of technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, it is a digital fraud.
I want to protect ourselves from this scourge, I want to be vigilant. If such letters come in, we should immediately share them with our friends and help them spread awareness.
My dear countrymen, in the ongoing session of Parliament, I have got the opportunity to meet many of my countrymen.
I had a pleasant experience in such a meeting.
Some students from Aligarh also came and met me.
Enthusiasm ran away from the girl students, who had brought a huge album, making them happy on their faces.
They brought with them the pictures that had beautified the Aligarh railway station.
They have built a flat garden built by plastic bottles at the railway station and have created a new image for the station.
If you too have the opportunity to visit Aligarh, then you must visit the railway station.
I have been receiving such information about several railway stations in India that the people of those areas are using their local art forms on the walls of the railway stations.
One can feel a new spirit.
This is an example of how peoples participation can bring about change.
I congratulate all those who are engaged in such a task in the country, especially my colleagues in the field of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, in the rainy season, the season of many festivals begins in our country.
You will also celebrate in your homes and publications.
Raksha Bandhan is a celebration of the unique bond between rich and poor.
As in the previous year, cant you give Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of the country during the period of Raksha Bandhan
Think about it, brothers and sisters, Give your sister a gift in life, in a way that is truly safe.
Why could we have hired a woman to cook food in our homes or to do domestic work, or she could be the daughter of a poor mother
Is it not possible for them to gift Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
My dear countrymen, many of us would have been born after the independence of the country.
We can create such an environment.
Independence Day is not an event of governments, it should be of the people of the country.
Like Diwali, we should celebrate this festival as our festival.
I want us to do something positive along with the concept of patriotism.
You can tell it to the people of the country and I call upon you to speak clearly from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
It is not my wish that the views expressed from the ramparts of the Red Fort remain the Prime Minister.
It should be the feelings of 125 crore people from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
Many people plan to do so during the holidays.
Awareness is spread in many villages.
A few days ago someone told me that the village panchayat of Hevre Bajar in Ahmadnagar district of Maharashtra and the villagers there used to address the water problem in an emotional way.
There may be several villages that want to save water but after talking to the farmers, the entire harvesting pattern has been changed.
They decided that the crops that use excess water, be it sugarcane or banana, should not grow such crops.
Whatever is easy to hear is easy, but this is not easy.
But look at my farmer brothers, they left immediately after they said that sugarcane should not be planted because sugarcane needs more water.
Completely, they did not cultivate fruits and vegetables, i.e., only those which require very little water.
Today, they have been successful in their own efforts to tackle the problem of water through various initiatives like sprinkler and drip irrigation, rain water harvesting and water recycling.
Well, I've talked about a small village, Hivre Bajar, but there may be many such villages.
I convey my best wishes to those villagers for the outstanding work that you have done.
Someone told me about the Korwa GORVA village panchayat in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh.
I think that when the Indian government transports water to Laddus through trains, it will become a message for the world.
It is a human nature to feel that if a good news comes from one place or the other, whatever difficulties are being experienced, then it is human nature to feel that if a good news comes from one place.
When I heard the news that there is a possibility of rainfall from 106 to 110 this year, then I feel like there has been some very happy news.
Even though it is still time for rain, news of good rainfall has also added freshness to it.
But my dear countrymen, the information that there will be good rainfall, it provides an opportunity and presents a challenge as well.
Can we start a campaign to save water from the village
Farmers need soil, it helps them to grow their crops.
Why not pour soil on the lakes of the villages on the plains
While the soil health of the fields will increase, the water storage in the reservoirs will also increase
What if the empty cement sacks, empty pebbles, fill the stone and soil and lock it in the drain paths?
I have always said this thing that whenever we go to Porbandar, the birthplace of Bapu, we can see several places there, and one of them is worth seeing.
That is, it is important to know as to how the ponds were built under the house more than 200 years ago to save water.
His concern is very natural because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments came forward, several projects were started, money was spent, and as a result of this, it is natural that such a question arises in the minds of crores of people of the country like brother Kumar Krishna.
Those who believe in religion consider Ganga as the gift of a house.
The Ganga itself gives us work and the Ganges gives us the strength to live for all of us.
The way the flow of the Ganges flows, it also accelerates the economic activities of the country.
A Bhagirathi brought us the Ganga, but we need crores of shepherds to save it.
We cannot succeed in the work without peoples participation. Therefore, all of us should become change agents for cleanliness and cleanliness.
We have to tell this thing again and again and remember it.
Several efforts are being made by the government.
Efforts are being made to seek the full cooperation of those states which are situated on the banks of Ganga.
Efforts are being made to bring together the social and hygiene organizations.
Several steps have been taken to clean the surface, to clean the area and to prevent industrial pollution.
Every day solid waste is collected in large quantities through canals.
In the coming days, many more such programmes will be implemented to remove the garbage and the people living along the banks of Ganga and Yamuna will immediately experience the benefits of this project.
I feel that this will also have good results.
I am glad that some officials have told me that the exit from the silos in the states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh has been successful in the last few days in terms of zero liquid discharge. This gives me immense pleasure.
The expulsion of black liquire from paper plants has almost come to an end.
This shows us that we are moving in the right direction and there is an increase in awareness.
Even if someone from the far-flung southern part of the country meets the banks of Ganga, it is essential that the Ganga will not become clean.
This is a matter of faith of the people and it will definitely bring success in cleaning the Ganga.
People are donating to clean the Ganga.
This system is being implemented in a very beautiful way.
My dear countrymen, today is the 24th of April.
We celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on April 14th and today we are celebrating the 24th of April the Panchayati Raj Day.
This is a good coincidence that the day of birth of an honorable person who gave us the Constitution of India, the day of his birth, and the very large villages of the Constitution, in the spirit of integration of these two, the Government of India, in cooperation with the State Governments, worked on a mission from Gramodaya to Bhartiya Uday for ten days from April 14 to April 24.
Today, on 24th April, I am going to celebrate the Panchayati Raj Day in Jharkhand, where our majority tribal brothers and sisters live, this mission has created a great awareness.
How to strengthen democratic institutions at village level in all corners of India
How to make the villages self-reliant
How the villages will develop their own development plans
Several programmes in several villages of India could have taken place in ten days, but this could have been less.
My best wishes to all the state governments and the village leaders who have used this opportunity as an opportunity for the development of villages and villages in an innovative way in the most fundamental way.
There is awareness in the villages as well, that is the guarantee of the rise of India.
The source of Bharat Uday is in village Uday.
Therefore, all of us are paying attention to the development of the village and we have achieved the desired results.
There has been a need for improvement in the education sector over the past several years.
Today, if there is one dream for parents in every family then it is that they should provide quality education to the children.
The idea of home, vehicle, etc. is all the same later.
This spirit has been manifested in the minds of the people of a country like India. This is the biggest strength.
Therefore, I appeal to all the parents that they should take time and talk about the school's procedures in a comprehensive manner.
If you get up in mind then go to school and ask the teachers themselves.
This awareness must go a long way in reducing the many shortcomings of our education system and making it possible for peoples participation.
In our country, all the governments have paid more attention to education and every government has made its own efforts.
It is also true that the focus of our people has been on setting up educational institutions, expansion of educational institutions, establishment of schools, colleges, admission of teachers, and maximum number of children going to school.
In a way, the attempt to spread education was a priority, and it was also necessary.
But there is a need to focus more on the development of our education system than on the importance of expansion.
We have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Our primary aim is to provide good education to all through the mission of education.
It is true that we have to make a long journey.
But if the 1.25 billion people of the country decide, then a long journey will be possible.
It is very important that we have to bring about fundamental changes as suggested by Sharmila Ji.
India's universities should also become globally competitive universities.
The more the emphasis is on education, the more emphasis is on skills the more it is on education the more important the role of technology is going to be in education.
I am confident that distance education and technology will make our education easier and in a short span of time its results will be visible in the eyes.
Prime Minister, Namaste, I am speaking from Bijnor to Mona Karna.
In today's era, sports is more important than education for the youth.
There is a need to have a team spirit, a team spirit and a good leader and this will lead to their overall development.
I can say this through my experience because I was in the structure of the Bharat Sculptor which has a great impact on my life.
This required greater integration.
They have given me a lot of satisfaction, they have got a lot of enthusiasm, they have to do something.
I am aware of the fact that I was once a witness to the National Cadet Corps (NCC) and a new vision was created through such institutions.
In my childhood, I had experienced the benefits, we have to fill a new energy and give a new impetus to these institutions.
This time I have put some things in front of them.
In this season, I asked our youth and all the organizations why should not they be engaged in a great job of saving water.
How many blocks and how many districts can we prevent open defecation.
My dear countrymen, today I have to talk about things that all of us need to think.
I see this as a shocking thing.
You will be aware of the political situation in our country as to which party would provide so many gas cylinders that was the subject of discussion during the last several elections.
On the other hand, economists were pressing for reduction of subsidies, which led to the formation of several groups that gave suggestions and conclusions on the reduction of subsidies.
The expenditure of these teams was crores of rupees.
But today I feel proud of the people of my country.
But if you look at the accounts, more than 80 percent of these 1 crore people went to the distributors, queued up, they gave up their subsidies in a written form.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government exempts some tax from the tax system, there will be a lot of praise on television and news papers throughout the week.
Because they have forced political leaders to think in a new perspective.
Even this one event has forced the economic experts of the country to think in a new perspective.
Even the world's economists who offer a variety of possibilities, this is beyond their point of view.
You should think about it at some point or the other.
The abandonment of subsidies by one crore families and the availability of gas cylinders in their place to one crore poor families, and the savings that accrue to one crore families by the abandonment of subsidies, while being a matter of common concern for the people, is an extraordinary thing.
I appeal to all the political leaders that wherever we are going, we should certainly say something with confidence in the people.
You will get the results that you cannot even think about.
We have to move in this direction.
For example, I had a feeling of why we should conduct a face-to-face examination for the 3rd and 4th rank staff and why we should not trust their marks on them.
I also feel like announcing that there will not be a ticket checker on some trains.
Lets trust the people of the country and see how many such tests can be done.
Once we trust the people of the country, there will be immense benefits.
This situation has not been created by any political leader but one crore families of the country.
A person named Ravi has written a letter to me - Good news every day is a good news day and tell your officials that every day there is a good news.
In every newspaper and in the media, bad news is being created.
Is there no good thing in our country with 1.25 billion people
A few days ago, a newspaper had also sent a letter to me saying that we will not even publish a bad news on Monday and will only publish a positive message.
What is the reality is that there is a positive news environment.
Everyone feels that good news and real news should be available to everyone.
Whatever a famous person gives the best information, how beautiful words he makes it, even if he describes it in a beautiful way, he gets more benefit through good news.
Good news is an indicator of good work.
The more we strengthen the good, the more we reduce the place for evils.
If we light the lamp then the darkness will automatically depart, and surely it will be removed.
You can also contribute in that.
Ravi, you have given me good advice, but please do not be angry with me.
Let us join hands in constructive efforts, share positive thoughts and take positive action.
Kumbh is the specialty of our country.
The Kumbh Mela can be a tourist attraction.
Many people around the world were unaware of the fact that millions of people had gathered here on the banks of the river for several days.
The festival comes to an end in a peaceful and peaceful environment.
These events have achieved the highest standards in a systematic and systematic manner in terms of programme management and peoples participation.
I have been watching for the past two days that many people have been welcoming films related to the Simhasta Kumbh Mela.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India and the tourism departments of the state governments to organize a photo competition in this regard.
You can also ask people to show them the best pictures.
This can definitely be done.
I was told that when the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh met me, special attention was paid to cleanliness.
Cleanliness is not only during this festival but also from there people should carry the idea of cleanliness in their minds.
While accepting that Kumbh is a festival of spirituality, I believe that this too can become a social opportunity.
We can use the Kumbh Mela to spread the message of how we can enhance our love for water, how we can admire water, and how we can spread the message of water conservation.
Mann Ki Baat: July 2019
It seems to me that you can tell me, but even then, I am seeking to dedicate your ideas and your expressions with the help of Mann Ki Baat.
You might remember that last time I had talked about a book on the stories of Premchand ji and had asked you to share your thoughts on it through the Narendra Modi App.
A large number of people have expressed their views on subjects such as science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and lifestyle etc.
Others have asked me to talk about many other books.
I will definitely talk about some other books.
But now I have to accept that I do not have enough time to read more books.
But I am told that we have to carry forward the experience of the last one month.
Friends, what I have said about water conservation in Mann Ki Baat is true but even before this, the subject of water conservation touches your heart, it seems to me that it is very dear to the common man.
If there is one thing that has stirred the whole country in a few days, it is water.
Several efforts are being made to effectively deal with the water security situation in the country.
People are sharing information on traditional methods.
The media has also stepped up several innovative water conservation movements.
I am very happy to know that Meghalaya, the most beautiful state in the North East, has prepared a water policy for itself.
I convey my best wishes to the state government.
In Haryana, agriculture is being encouraged to grow crops such as low water use and no impact on farmers.
Why dont we use these fairs for water conservation
Friends, Some things in life fill our hearts with enthusiasm.
That too, especially the achievements of the children and their achievements, inspires us and instills a new energy in us.
The things that I am saying now can bring you pride and enthusiasm together.
We all are well aware of the fact that a word cancer can make the world tremble.
While dying is waiting at the door steps, these 10 children have not only driven the cancer out of their struggle for death, but have also praised the country for their wonderful work.
This month, in Moscow, World Children's Winners Games were held as World Child Winners.
The contest included competitions such as shooting, shooting, swimming, driving, football and table tennis.
These 10 winners of our country have won medals and some of them have won more than one medal in this tournament.
My dear countrymen, I have full faith that Chandrayaan 2 will be out of the sky and that India's victory in space will be a moment of joy and pride for you.
Sanjeev Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daka from Kolkata, P.K.
Many people like Arvind Rao have urged people from different parts of the country to speak in Mann Ki Baat about Chandrayaan 2 on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov.
In terms of space, the year 2019 has to be the most glorious year for India.
Our scientists launched A-Sat in March and thereafter Chandrayaan-2.
We could not speak much about the great significance of A-Sat in the electoral arena.
But the A-Sat missile is 300 km above the Earth in just 3 minutes.
On the 22nd of July, the entire country witnessed a proud moment when the golden jubilee of Chandrayaan-2 was celebrated.
Chandrayaan 2 is unique in many dimensions.
Chandrayaan 2 will further strengthen our understanding of the Moon.
Even in our lives, we will face temporary setbacks.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to present information about a very interesting competition to the students and the younger generation of the country and invite our youth to participate in this quiz competition.
Space science, India's space programme and science technology will be the hallmark of this competition.
For example, what needs to be done in the launch, how the satellite is placed on the orbit, what information do we get from the satellite, what is A-Sat, many such things will take place in this competition.
The contest will be held on 1st August, 2018 at MyGov.
I invite my young friends and student wealth...
I appeal to all the schools, parents and enthusiastic teachers to work hard to make your school a success.
I encourage all the students to join it.
The most interesting thing about this is that the Indian government will take the highest number of students in every state to Sriharikota at its own cost .
They will also get a chance to witness the Chandrayaan-2 landing on the surface of the moon in September.
Our Mann Ki Baat has provided momentum to the Swachh Bharat Mission on many occasions.
Similarly, efforts for cleanliness have also inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that began five years ago today, with the help of everyones participation, has set new benchmarks for cleanliness.
I am not saying that we have achieved the ideal of cleanliness but the success of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan from open defecation to public places is the strength of the resolve of 130 crore countrymen.
But we're not going to stop with this.
This mission is now moving from filth to beauty.
A few days ago, I had to learn about Yogesh arani ji and his team through the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who has left his job in the US and has returned to serve Mother India.
Just a while ago, he had made Delhi a challenge not only to be clean but also to be beautiful.
He joined his team and began his work with garbage dumps in the Lodhi Garden.
You might remember how the streets of Prayagraj have been decorated with paintings on the occasion of Kumbh.
I also came to know that Yogesh Saini his team had shown his hand in the same place.
We have experienced this in the beauty of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
It is essential that the principle of wealth from waste should be strengthened in our society and this should become our culture.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I had read an interesting comment on MyGov.
This was registered by Mohammad Aslam ji, a resident of Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
I like Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy to note that in my state of Jammu and Kashmir, I have made a positive contribution in the mission of uniting the society and in the return of the village.
The project was organized in June.
I think this is the first project that will directly involve the people with the government.
To make this project more interesting, many more things have been added to it.
Under the Khelo India programme, sports events were organized for the children.
They were given sports equipment, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes certificates.
In a way, this event, the festival of development, the festival of public participation, is a good festival of public awareness.
People have participated in a large number in this development festival of Kashmir.
While it is a matter of great happiness that the work on this mission of returning to the village was done in the villages, the government officials climbed all the difficult terrain and took a walk of 1-2 days to reach such remote villages.
The officers also visited the border villages along the border and the Satasavataram Border where they travelled without any fear to the tense areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts.
When their reception was so impressive that they spent more than two days in these villages.
It is quite easy to organize Gram Sabhas in these areas, to ensure a large number of peoples participation and to formulate their own schemes.
New determination, new zeal and amazing results.
It also makes it clear that those who want to sow obstacles and pessimism in the journey of development will never be successful.
My dear countrymen, the great sages who won the Gnanpith award, Dattatrayya Ramchandra Penthre, had written in one of his poems about Marikalam.
People from different cultures and languages across India have been happy to celebrate their own life.
If we look around in this season, the earth will look like a green cover over it.
There is a new energy flowing all around.
In this holy month, many devotees take refuge, take part in the holy month of Amarnath pilgrimage, many eat up fasts and wait for festivals like Janmashtami, Nag Panchami with great enthusiasm.
Raksha Bandhan is also a celebration of the love and affection of our brothers and sisters.
When we talk about Marikalam, you will be happy to know that more than four years ago, devotees have taken part in the Amarnath Yatra this time.
Since 1st July, more than 3 lakh devotees have performed darshan in the holy Amarnath cave.
This time more than the number of people who took part in the 60-day Yatra in 2015, this time it has been reduced to just 28 days.
I would like to express my special appreciation to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality, which is behind the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who have returned after completing their journey, they are all attracted towards the hospitality of the people of the state and towards the feeling of hospitality.
All this will be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
Even in Uttarakhand, this year's Chardham Yatra has started, out of which more than 8 lakh devotees have come to Kedarnath temple only in just one and a half months.
For the first time since the terrible natural disaster of 2013, a record number of people have travelled in the pilgrimage.
I appeal to you that you must visit some places of beauty during the rainy season and enjoy it wherever you are in the country.
No one can have a bigger Asana than tourism or pilgrimage to see such places of beauty in our country and feeling the feelings of the people of our country.
May this beautiful and vibrant month of Marikalam, usher in a new energy, new hopes and aspirations among all of you.
Similarly, in August, we are commemorating the uit India Movement.
On the other hand, there is heavy rainfall in different parts of the country and people of the country have been affected by floods in many parts of the country.
When we watch the rains on television, we get to see only one view - floods, flooding water, traffic stops.
I will be back after a month's wait.
Today, the people of Christian communities around the world are celebrating Easter.
Today, while India is dancing with Australia, I congratulate both the contingents.
24 teams from across the world are participating in India, India won Gold in 1951 and 1962 Asian Games and India secured 4th position in 1956 Olympics.
Unfortunately, over the last few decades, we have been placed at the lowest level in the rankings.
Today, our position in the FIFA ranking has fallen so much that it is difficult to even give up.
In today's era, there is an increasing interest in football among the youth of India, be it EPL or Spanish League or the Indian Super League.
The youth of India is watching TV to know more about football.
At the same time, we can take this opportunity to try to take football to every village and every street.
If the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup is such an opportunity, then in this year, we should try to fill a new enthusiasm, a new enthusiasm, a new spirit of football among the youth around the world.
I consider this as an opportunity to brand India globally.
My dear students, you would have planned to visit tourism on holidays.
Very few people go to foreign countries and most of them travel to their states for 5 days or 7 days.
Some people leave their states and go to other states.
Is there any doubt that I am not a district in India
Tourism has a huge potential in creating our lives. Now the youth of India are more interested in visiting tourism, their enthusiasm is increasing.
People do not travel by the old style or road, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
I think this is a good sign.
There is a case in our area that if coal is turned out to be black, then others will run away on their own.
But I am glad that we have set up a tourist circuit with the same coal.
This is just the beginning, so far, more than 10,000 people have experienced the eco-system of coal mining near the village of Sawaner near Nagpur.
It provides an opportunity to see something new.
Can you make your contribution in cleanliness while going to other places during this holiday
This may not be very scientific, but what happens is true.
Can you also work as a tourist with a strong combination of the concept of cleanliness in the tourist centre
Tourism in India is far behind in comparison to the world.
But if 1.25 billion people decide that we will strengthen our tourism sector then we will attract the world.
Let us try to move in this direction.
My young friends, I don't think that holidays have come or gone.
Think from this perspective, too.
Can your holidays, the glorious years of life, and the moments of their greatness be wasted
I'm offering you an idea.
Can you develop a skill during your holidays, can you add a new thing that will make your personality proud
If you do not know how to swim then you can decide that if I learn to swim during the holidays or if I do not know how to ride a bike then I will learn to ride a bike.
Even today, if I type in the computer with two fingers, can I do the signature training
How many types of skills do we have to develop our personality
Why can't we learn them
Why don't we remove our shortcomings
Why don't we develop our energy
Now think about it, there is no need for a big training, there is no need for a trainer, there is no need for a higher fee or a huge expenditure.
In the same way, we will also interact with other friends.
I believe that you will definitely do it and tell me what you have learnt from it.
My name is Abi Chaturvedi.
Hi, Prime Minister, you had said that during the last summer holidays, let's heat the summer season for the birds and therefore we should have a cup of water for them in the balcony and in the terrace of the house, so that they could get water.
I was very happy when I did this work, through which I became friends with a lot of birds.
I request you to repeat this process in your Mann Ki Baat.
He has phoned and reminded me of a good action.
I was asking you to fill the earthen pots outside your house during the summers.
He told me that he has been doing this work throughout the year, so many birds have loved him.
Mahadev Varma, one of the greatest poets of the world in Hindi literature, had a great love for the birds.
He has sung that he would not allow you to go far and wide in his poems, he would fill the circle with grains, he would fill the water with cold water everywhere.
Shilpa Cook from Mysuru put forward a very delicate idea.
Have we ever given them water
Shilpa, thanking you from the bottom of my heart, you have presented a very emotional idea in a very natural way.
My farmer brothers and sisters, You must have heard a lot about Digital India.
For some people, this Digital India is something related to the youth of some city.
If you download this app on your mobile phone, then all the information related to agriculture and weather will be available in your hands.
It will provide information on the conditions in the markets, the conditions in the markets, the trend of good harvesting and the manner in which pesticides will be suitable.
If you ask them any questions, they answer it or make you understand it.
I want my farmer brothers and sisters to download the app on their mobile phones for the convenience of farmers.
We have tried to create assets for water conservation through Manrekha.
There may be several such villages in the country that have created awareness, there may be many leading farmers, there may be many alert citizens.
I welcome this.
There were about 612 crore diabetes patients in India in 2014.
Figure 3 of the total deaths is due to diabetes.
Diabetics are of two types, one type 1, the other type 2.
Type 1 is hereditary and hereditary.
Type 2 is caused by obesity because of habits, age.
It has been set up as the theme of World Health Day on the 7th of March 2020, as diabetes has caused concern all over the world.
Our way of life has been a major reason for this.
Physical labor is declining.
Encouraged by the 7th April, will we be able to work towards defeating diabetes in our lives
If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my India will also be healthy.
There are times when we do not have to go through a difficult phase of clinical trials.
It is only after the situation has worsened that the disease of diabetes has been there for a long time.
There is a shortage of TB patients in our country in comparison to the number of TB patients in other countries.
With proper treatment, one can end this disease.
We have to free India from the clutches of these diseases.
But without your cooperation, it cant be eliminated only by governments, doctors and medicines.
Therefore, I appeal to the people of the country that we should all fight against diabetes and eliminate TB.
My dear countrymen, several important events are going to be held in April, especially on the 14th of April, the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
The 125th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi was celebrated all over the country throughout the year.
On the 14th of April this year, I got the good opportunity to visit the birthplace of Baba Saheb Ambedkar in Mhow.
Baba Saheb has given us all that we need to become a better citizen.
We can pay a special tribute to him by traveling on his way and living as a good citizen.
Vikram will start the year in a few days.
The New Year is being celebrated in different states in different forms.
Best wishes to everyone on the New Year.
The last time I had said that you can hear my Mann Ki Baat whenever you want, you know it and you can hear it in about 20 languages.
You can ask for it at a convenient time.
You can hear it on your mobile phone.
I am very happy to be with you.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
I wish all of you the very best on Easter.
My young friends, all of you will be on one side of the exam.
There's a great inspiration.
You might be aware that India is going to host the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2017 next year.
Why do I say this thing just to emphasise that interest in football is also increasing, but will it be a great opportunity for us to not only become champions of India but also to fulfil our duties while keeping the doors of the country open
Last time, I had also appealed to you that wherever you are going, you should give me the photo of that place.
Millions and millions of people of the country have contributed to the task that the tourism department has not been able to do, the work that our cultural department has not been able to do, the work that the state governments and the government of India have not done.
It is really a pleasure to see all the pictures they have shown.
We have to take this task forward and do it the same way, but this time we have to do something else.
Not just sending a photo, but also displaying your creativity, visiting new places and getting to know a lot of things.
India is full of diversity.
If you start travelling once you will be travelling all your life, you will be watching and enjoying it.
Normally, we should stay away from coal mines.
When we look at the pictures of the people there, we will go there and think about what will happen.
I hope my young friends will definitely help me in this task.
Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens, all of us will join hands in this task.
Your personality will be identified with this and your self-confidence will increase in a lot.
When people come to sell milk near our homes, when news papers come, when a postman comes, sometimes the sellers of the cup or the sellers of the cloth go through it.
Have we ever heard of the heat of summer so that their thirst is not quenched
Only then can a drop of rain water be used without wastage.
The beginning of farming for farmers is very important.
But the people of the country should also think about what would happen if there was no water.
You might have noticed this time that 5 lakh lakes are making efforts to create irrigation ponds.
I still remember that at my young age, when I heard the name TP, people were scared.
If we want to get rid of TB, proper treatment is important, complete treatment is important.
If we leave half the treatment in the middle, the disease will come back.
You can give a missed call and when you have the opportunity to listen to the old Mann Ki Baat programmes, you can hear it in your own language.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
In a way, this is my last episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be held in 2016.
In a way, every festival leaves an impression of when the next festival will be celebrated.
Sometimes, India is the economy that is being promoted by festivals.
These are the reasons for economic activities of the people at the bottom of the society.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country for Christmas and also my best wishes for the coming 2016.
May the year 2016 bring great joy and happiness to all of you, a new zeal, a new strength and a new resolve to take you all to new heights.
Be it terrorism, global warming, natural disasters, man-made difficulties.
And what can be a greater happiness than this that a human society should live a peaceful and peaceful life after recovering from all these things
This is the season of Savley Savarkarji. There is a huge number of domestic and foreign tourists, and people go to many places to celebrate Christmas.
I welcome Ganesh ji's ideas that how clean our tourist places are, so much so that the thought and image of India becomes stronger in the minds of others.
I will take Ganesh ji's ideas to the people.
When we come to our homes in the tradition of Atithi Devo Bhava, i.e. those who want to see the guests as gods, do we immediately start cleaning the house or not
Similarly, we have to keep our country's tourist destinations, centres and tourist places clean and clean, and we need to add even more strength to this.
I am glad that there are reports from all over the country about cleanliness.
Since the beginning, I have been congratulating the media friends on this subject.
This is because they dig small, good things and bring them to the public notice.
I have just read the news that he has constructed 100 toilets in Bhojpura village just because of his hard work. I want to share it with you.
Due to the relentless efforts of several people, the country is making rapid progress.
The 1.25 billion people of the country are walking on the path of progress by joining hands with each other and the country is also progressing.
Excellent education, improved skills, increasing employment opportunities
Life insurance schemes for citizens, banking facilities, doing business globally without disruption and establishing institutions that are required to set up new ventures on the one hand are happening on the other.
Now all the people of the simple family who cant even go near the banks can easily get loans through the Mudra scheme.
Now Indians have begun to understand that the entire world is engaged in the pursuit of Yoga.
When the whole world celebrated the International Day of Yoga, did we all feel that how proud our country was
We can feel this when our thoughts and ideas are in a big way.
And it came to pass, when his mother opened the mouth of the parable of butter, and his mother opened the mouth of the parable, that who could forget what she saw there, and what she saw there?
Similarly, on Yoga Day, Indians have given us the importance of India.
Nowadays, the talk of cleanliness is echoing in every house.
Be it a farmer, a poor man, a young man, or a mother-in-law, the feeling that they have been responsible for a new change in their lives, the government officials who are engaged in the task of bringing electricity to those villages, this is also a very positive thing.
Can't I do everything alone?
But when I tell you about this, can't I give my contribution
Even an ordinary citizen can access an app called Narendra Modi on his mobile phone and connect with me.
I am sharing simple things with you.
It is a matter of great happiness for me that people too share a lot of things with me.
Come, let us together engage with the common man about the welfare of the common man, let us take inspiration from the common man, let us take inspiration from him to get things that are right.
My young friends, on the 15th of August, I had placed a basic theme of Start-up India and Stand-up India from the Red Fort.
After that, the thinking in all the departments of the government was expedited.
Can India become the start-up capital
Start-up India, stand-up India, has provided a great opportunity to the younger generation.
My young friends, on the 16th of January, the Government of India is going to start the work on Start-up India and Stand-up India in a comprehensive manner.
Start-Up is a digital world and only those in the field of information technology. There is a distinct impression on the start-up that does not exist.
We have to change it keeping in mind the requirements of India.
The talent of our young generation is spreading across the country.
This start-up India, stand-up India should not be left in some or the other cities, it should not spread to the corners of India.
Therefore, I request all the state governments to take this scheme forward.
On the 16th of January, I will definitely share it with you in detail.
I look forward to your views.
My young friends, on 12th January, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated.
There are crores of people in this country like me.
We are celebrating Swami Vivekananda Jayanti from 1995 to 12 January as National Youth Day.
The celebrations will take place from January 12 to January 16 in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
I particularly urge my young friends to send your suggestions directly to me through my Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand what is in your mind.
Dilip Chauhan from Ahmedabad, Gujarat is a visually impaired person and he celebrates Accessible India Day in his school.
Dilip ji, Thank you very much.
Sometimes when we meet a man like him in our lives, there is a feeling in our minds.
Our thoughts and perspectives on men like him will be based on our thoughts.
There is no doubt that words have a significance for me.
This year when the Government of India launched the Swacch Bharat scheme, arrangements were made to participate in it.
But I was unable to attend this event because I had to go there due to the terrible floods in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially Chennai.
Even though I could not participate in this programme, my thoughts were inspiring.
There is a need for innovation, technology requirement, systems, understanding, etc. to make it easier for schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, accessible parkings, lifts, speech writing etc.
They should not be frozen and killed in files.
Even the schemes were meant for the common man and the poor
A few days ago, efforts were made to take the benefits of the scheme to the beneficiaries in an easy manner.
In our country, subsidy is being provided for gas cylinders.
Crores of rupees are being spent on this thing but no case has been filed for this.
The government has made a small change in the grant-in-aid to ensure that the subsidy is delivered to the genuine beneficiaries or whether it is delivered in time or not.
By the end of November, about 15 crore people will be beneficiaries of PAHAL.
Direct Benefit Transfer is going to the bank accounts of these 15 crore beneficiaries.
This is happening without the possibility of middlemen, recommendations or corruption.
On the one hand, the movement for Aadhaar ID card, opening of Jan Dhan bank account on the other, and on the other hand, the Central and State Governments have been working together to prepare the list of beneficiaries and link it to Aadhaar ID card and bank account.
There were allegations regarding the scheme.
Money is being deposited directly into the bank accounts of the workers who have worked in many places.
So far, about 35,400 crore rupees have been directly transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a golden moment for the Republic of India.
It is a very pleasant coincidence that this day is the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
We have to take this forward.
It is only during the elections that more advertisements will be published that 'Voting is a sacred duty' and that will be on the walls and layers will be placed.
During the elections, we will talk a lot about our duties, but why should not we talk about the same duties in our daily lives
This year as we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, cant we organize essay competition, poetry competition and talk competition in schools, colleges, our villages and cities, in different communities and societies, on the 26th of January as a reason
Just imagine how big a history will be created when the 125 crore countrymen take one step after the other with a sense of duty.
On the 26th of January, when we celebrate the Republic Day, cant we clean and decorate our city's Presidents Colours and Colours through citizens?
As citizens, I suggest that we can do this.
Later, we express our gratitude to all those leaders who have been inspired to install the statue with a lot of passion.
Cant we continue to clean as a society and as a country
On 26th January, we will join hands with all of us in this endeavour.
My dear countrymen, once again, my New Year greetings for 2016.
Thank you so much.
On the other hand, the festival of Christmas will begin.
I have a separate place for festivals in social life.
Sometimes festivals are also useful in causing injuries and sometimes they give a new impetus.
But sometimes there are times when there are difficulties during the festive season, they are very sad.
Every corner of the world is constantly receiving information about natural disasters.
There have been reports of disaster events, which have not yet been questioned.
We are now experiencing the rapid pace with which the impact of climate change is spreading.
State Governments are engaged in rescue and relief operations in full swing.
The central government is also working shoulder to shoulder with you as always.
I am confident that despite all these difficulties, Tamil Nadu will once again be on the path of rapid progress and contribute to the progress of the country.
But when we face such a difficult situation all around, there is a feeling that we have to bring about a change.
Until about 15 years ago, a natural calamity was associated with the agriculture sector, because at that time there was only drought and famine.
Governments, civil society, citizens, small and large organizations need to work scientifically in this area.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had an interaction with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
I suggested that all of us, South Asian countries, should work together to prepare ourselves for the disaster.
I am happy that a conference on this issue and a conference on Best Practices in Disaster Management was held in New Delhi.
This is a good beginning.
I am speaking to Lavender Singh from Jalandhar, Punjab.
We are engaged in organic farming here and many more are being guided by agriculture.
One of the reasons for this is that you are doing organic farming.
I am glad that you are not only doing this but also understanding the problems of the farmers.
Your concern is justified but it does not happen only in Punjab and Haryana.
This has become our routine throughout India. Traditionally, we have been burning the agricultural wastes that come after the harvest.
Earlier, we were unaware of the harm caused by the burning fire and everyone was doing it so that I too am doing it.
This is the reason why it continued to grow and today it has been associated with climate change.
The impact of this crisis on the cities began to be felt by the people.
That's the real concern you've expressed in that way.
In the first phase, our farmer friends should be trained and explained to them the truth.
This can save time, reduce the difficulty, and make the land ready for the next harvest.
But this is not the right set of guidelines.
Even the post-harvest agricultural waste is also very valuable.
They are natural fertilizers.
We're wasting them.
Not only this, if we make them small pieces, then they can also become guests for the animals.
Secondly, when we burn them, the surface of the ground burns.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Just think for a moment, our bones are strong, our heart works well, our kidneys work well, everything is right, but if the skin on the body burns then can we survive
Just as the skin of our body is burnt to death, similarly if we burn the harvested grains and agri-produce, the skin of the mother earth burns, and the upper layer of our soil burns.
Therefore, we have to take positive steps in this direction.
I got an opportunity to talk to the farmers engaged in the cultivation of banana.
They shared their wonderful experiences with me.
Earlier they had to spend Rs. 5000, 1000, 15000 per hectare in order to get their livelihood out of their daily routine.
No work was going on till the people were in the tractors to pick them up.
Last time in Mann Ki Baat, I spoke of organ donation.
In this regard, I mentioned the NOTO Free Phone number.
Many prominent personalities like film actress Raveena Tandon have joined the film.
Body organ donation can save many lives.
What else can be a bigger donation than this
The National Centre for Organ Transplantation was launched on 27th November, 2019, with details of the patients waiting for organ donation, organ donor and organ donor.
I am confident that awareness will spread in this field as well and those in need will get help in the right time.
This is because unless there is a person who does not want to donate, this help is not available in any way.
I had said earlier that we are observing 3rd December as Divyangjans Day.
Physically and internally, the differently-abled people have the courage and unparalleled potential.
Sometimes when they are depicted as funny things, they feel sad.
At times, compassion and kindness are shown to them.
But if we change our outlook, if we correct the vision that we see them, then they will become an inspiration for us as well as for us to realise the achievements.
One has to be highly appreciative of their grit and determination to face difficulties in their lives.
Today I want to talk about the 40-42 year old Javed Ahmad.
In 1996, militants attacked Javad Ahamed in Kutch.
But Jaweth did not accept Ahmad's defeat.
The wounds caused by terrorism did not make him angry.
There was not a single person who did not commit any crime and his youth was wasted even though there was no anger or anger in his mind.
He has been dedicated to child education for the last 20 years, despite his lack of physical cooperation.
As a social servant, as a conscious citizen, he is today making a peaceful revolution as the prophet of the differently-abled.
Shouldn't it be enough for all Indians to be inspired by Javed's life
On 3rd December, I would like to especially commemorate the life and work of Javedji, on his efforts and on his dedication.
Because of lack of time, today I have been able to talk only about Javed Ji but even then, in every nook and corner of India, these inspiring lamps are illuminated, they are inspiring the lives of people, they are shaking the path, they are shaking the path of life.
That is why, on 3rd December, we should seek inspiration from them.
In many cases, we have to work on governments.
The middle class, the lower middle class, the down-trodden people, the downtrodden, the deprived sections of the society, the oppressed, the exploited, the deprived sections of the society, have been associated with the government and the government.
As an ordinary citizen, they might have had some kind of bad experience with the government employees.
These couples are spending their livelihood on the development of the poor.
The entire population of the village of Thendakha, the smallest village in Balasore district of Odisha, belongs to the tribal community.
A village in poverty is a situation of being hit by malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, an ASHA worker from this village, decided that I will ensure that no one from this area will die of malaria.
He stepped up the struggle against malaria and prepared the entire village to face it.
There could be several such gems in the country.
You should not only study but also recommend to others.
A positive power is the greatest power.
You too will be sharing good stories, sharing these e-books and deliberating on these issues.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is deeply concerned about climate change.
On 14th December, 2018, the National Energy Conservation Day was celebrated.
Several schemes are being implemented on behalf of the Government.
The LED bulb movement is progressing rapidly.
I had once said that on the day of full moon, one hour after closing the street lights, one hour after bathing in the entire moon.
A friend had sent a link in my view and I got the opportunity to see it.
I wanted to share it with you.
He is trying to provide light to the poor by using solar energy, he is fighting darkness, he is working according to his name, he has formed a group of women.
He has also launched a solar powered lamp which will be powered by solar energy.
He is supplying these lamps at a rate of 100 rupees per month.
People are going to buy these lamps in the evening and in the morning they will be given electricity.
As long as I have heard of it, there are about 500 households that have been provided with such kind of electricity connection.
Noorjahan has been working in the direction of electrifying these ladars throughout the day.
But a good start has taken place.
In a very short span of time, 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42,000 crore through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am happy that out of these 66 lakh beneficiaries, 24 lakh are women.
I had earlier said that Swachh Bharat will create such entrepreneurs.
They have proved this in Sailesh Bonsley.
I am told that he has taken a tanker and has repaid 2 lakh rupees in less time to the bank.
This is our objective in relation to the Mudra Yojana.
Mamta Sharma of Bhopal City said the same in her case.
He also received Rs 40,000 from the bank under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He is working on making handcuffs.
Due to lack of interest payment, there is a saving of about 1000 rupees per month.
His family also got a good job.
But I want this scheme to be popularized and expanded.
All our banks need to approach it with greater understanding and help the small businesses in a big way.
In fact, they are the economic drivers of the country.
These are the economic forces of the country.
It is for them that we want to encourage.
Good things have happened, but this has to be more and more efficient.
This means that it is the price of liberty that we pay for freedom by constantly awakening the nation with a sense of selflessness.
The nation's unity must be heard continuously.
But I look for more suggestions.
I am confident that your suggestions will definitely be fruitful.
My dear brothers and sisters, The winter season is about to begin.
Once again my best wishes to the people of my country Jai Hind
Once again I got the opportunity to talk to you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the fifth one-day cricket match between India and South Africa is being played in Mumbai.
The 5-day tournament will be titled Gandhi Mandela Series.
Therefore, there is an increasing interest in the final competition.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today I congratulate all the friends of All India Radio.
Therefore, I heartily congratulate and convey my best wishes to all the friends of the Kannur Radio Station.
Once again I would like to mention Kerala.
My dear Maryupper Primary School girls from Chittoor, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter was a special one in many ways.
One, these girls had registered their thumbnail and painted Bharat Mata kiDura with a great cloth.
They have sent me the map of India on the auspicious occasion of Mother India.
First of all, I was surprised that they had to draw this film with their thumb impressions.
But after reading the letter written by them, I understood how big index news they have sent me.
They are engaged in an awareness campaign on organ donation.
The 80-year-old Vasant Rao Suduke of Maharashtra has been running a movement for a long time.
He wants to celebrate organ donation as a function.
Nowadays I am receiving information and phone calls.
Devesh ji from Delhi has also sent this message to me.
Devesh from Delhi, the efforts being made by the government on organ donation and the policy initiatives related to it make me very happy.
Countries like China are in a very advanced stage of organ donation and I am told that the goal of organ donation for 10 lakh rupees given by the government is commendable.
The country needs more than 2.12 lakh kidney, heart and liver donation every year.
But in a country of 1.25 billion people, we have only 5,000 organ transplants.
One lakh eyes need to be illuminated every year.
But we can only provide eye sight to 25,000 people.
When four people need eyes, only one person can get it.
Efforts are also being made to guide the State Governments in this regard.
Some states have made good progress in the efforts to simplify and speed up the administrative procedures in this regard.
I am told that Tamil Nadu ranks first in organ donation.
A 24-hour helpline number 1800 11 4770 is also being provided.
Our ancestors have not even called Madhu Trikten Punjjita.
That is, the joy of sacrificing your life is what they have said through the mantra of 'Thyaktenna Punjjita'.
In the last few days, Delhi's G.
The surgery was successful, saving a life.
A few days later, we are also celebrating the festival of Diwali.
We also celebrated the celebrations of Eid-ul-Fitr.
India Africa Summit is scheduled to be held in the capital city of India, New Delhi from 26th to 29th October 2018.
This is the first time that such a large conference is being organized on Indian soil.
Leaders from 54 African countries and Unions have been invited to participate in the conference.
Our two countries also account for one-third of the world's population.
It is said that hundreds of thousands of years ago, India and Africa had been the same earthquake and later became two parts of the Indian Ocean.
There is a lot of unity among us.
There are many similarities between the wildlife and wildlife of Africa.
There is a great similarity in natural resources.
About 27 lakh Indians have been living in African countries for years.
India and African countries have links in economic, cultural and political spheres.
But, above all, India is playing a big role in training the young generation of African countries.
More than 25,000 African students have been educated in India for Human Resource Development and Skill Development.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, is organising a very special event.
Competitions have been organized for all the schools affiliated to CBSE in the form of poetry writing and increasing their participation.
Tens of thousands of school students had written about Indian African links.
Hundreds of thousands of school children witnessed the exhibition, the villagers saw what was the contribution of Mahatma Gandhi in the connectivity between Africa and India. People came to know and understood how his impact was on the minds of the people of these two regions.
There were many outstanding contributions in this competition.
I like a poem with a smile on my mind, so I want to read it to you.
I congratulate Karima and all the students participating in this competition, over 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
On the 15th of August 2014, I had mentioned about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana and the model village of the Parliamentarians.
After that many member friends have fulfilled this task.
They are deeply involved in it.
Last month, a seminar was organized in Bhopal.
The village heads, district collectors, some MPs and officials from the Central and State Governments participated in a detailed discussion on the model Gram Yojana.
It has brought out many new ideas and inspired them.
I would like to draw your attention to some of the things.
Jharkhand, in a way, has a large tribal population.
Unfortunately, it comes to mind when we talk of Maoist extremism, bomb culture and massacres in Jharkhand.
Many parts have been destroyed due to the impact of this left-wing extremists.
But our senior MP, Kariya Munda, who is also the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of that region, has dedicated his life for the tribal people.
He started going there, instilled confidence in the people, tried to revive the system, encouraged the officers to come and work there.
He had set the country to take development to that area which had been neglected for a long time.
Apart from infrastructure in the model village, a successful effort to create awareness among the people was also made in this Parsi village of Jharkhand.
I convey my best wishes to the respected MP, Kariya Munda.
Other arrangements are in place and he has created a great innovation in this regard.
He handed over a task to the students studying in the schools there.
He asked the school students who are studying in higher classes to teach their parents in this class.
The school provided education to students in the morning and to their parents in the evening.
The same children taught about 550 uneducated senior citizens.
You see, without any budget in the society, without a circular, without any special facility, how big a change has been made only through the determination of the mind
This is the lesson taught by the village panchayat of Dwarabodi.
This village is known for sugarcane production and also for sugarcane festival.
Ruvala ji started the sugarcane festival in this village on 11th March.
He has drawn our attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I would like to remind you one thing that after the festival of Diwali last year, a movement has been organized in our country, especially in the media.
The more we try to clean before the festivities, the more you think about it after the festivities, the more it will be done, the more it will be done.
This is how our work should be done during every public event.
I congratulate all the media of India today.
On 2nd October, 2018, on the occasion of the launch of Gandhi Jayanti and Swachh Bharat Mission, India had the privilege of participating in the Swachhta Pakhwada organised by the India Today Group.
He has been encouraging the work related to cleanliness during the last one year through E-TV, and his newspapers carry news about it, and he only focuses on constructive work.
She has linked 51 lakh children of about 55 to 56,000 schools from Andhra and Telangana under the Swachh Bharat Mission.
He has been running cleanliness drives in public places, railway stations, places of worship, hospitals, parks and so on.
These messages also strengthen the cause of a Swachh Bharat.
The ABP News Channel has launched an event titled India My Country.
The people of the country had spread the idea of cleanliness in their minds so that the awareness about cleanliness was spread among the people.
The NDTV has organized a campaign to create a clean India.
There are many channels in our country, many news papers and I am unable to mention the names of all because of lack of time but everyone has taken this mission forward.
For the past several years, this village has been working on cleanliness as a catalyst and every generation has been engaged in it.
A few years ago, this village has been awarded the Cleanest Village of Asia, he wrote in his letter.
I am very happy to note that a village in Meghalaya, which is located in the far-flung areas of our country, has been engaged for years on the issue of cleanliness.
This has become the culture of the village.
All of us are confident that such events will definitely make our country clean.
My dear countrymen, when I spoke from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 15th of August, I had said that corruption had slowed down the country.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
In the last budget, we made an important announcement.
Under this, you can pay your gold in the bank, and how you get an interest in your investment amount, similarly you can get an interest in gold stored in the bank.
Now the gold will be in the bank, but the money will be given to you through bank interest.
Now tell me, my countrymen, whether the money of gold will be wasted or not
Couldn't gold be converted into a full-fledged life force?
Do not keep gold at home in vain.
Do not miss the benefit of the two advantages of its safety and security.
Therefore, we will not have to buy gold, we will not have to save gold, no one will steal the paper.
I will also dedicate this security scheme to the people of the country next week.
However, we have used only foreign currency till now or have used foreign gold bars.
Why should there not be a valid indigenous code in our country
Therefore, in the coming week, on the auspicious occasion of Dhanteras, the Indian gold coin with 5 gms and 10 gms of Ashoka Chakra will be released.
In addition to this, 20 grams of gold will also be supplied to the people.
I am sure that this new scheme will bring a new change in the path of economic development and I will get your full cooperation in it.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, is the birth anniversary of Iron Man SardarVallabhbhai Patel.
When Patel thought of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat and thought of them, the whole of India would be touched upon.
This great man has played a big role in the unity of India.
If there are not only these variations, then the beauty that has given us pride will not reach us.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
The Run for Unity has been going on for the past several years on the 31st of October.
I have got the good opportunity to take part in it.
I have been told that this time too, arrangements are being made at various places and people are preparing for the Run for Unity with enthusiasm.
Run for Unity is actually a movement towards development.
In another way, unity is the guarantee of growth.
Come, let us pay our homage to Sardar Saheb.
Let us carry the mantra of unity forward.
My dear brothers and sisters, You all are engaged in preparations for the festival of Deepavali.
Have fun on the occasion of Deepavali, but I especially urge my parents that they should not suffer any harm even on the occasion of Diwali and we should do cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, on the next day of Diwali, I will go to Britain.
This time my visit to Britain is very interesting.
There is a special reason for this.
I firmly believe that when our children go to study in Britain, this memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage centre for them.
As much as possible and as much as possible, my best wishes to the nation. This is the message from Baba Saheb Ambedkar that he did not live.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Basaveshwara for democracy and empowerment of women is a matter of concern for all.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Basaveshwara to the people of the world in London is a shining example of how the thinking of the greats of India was centuries ago and how far-sighted it was.
When such an event takes place then the hearts of all the people of the country are filled with confusion.
Your suggestions are coming to me through in.
Later programmes are being prepared on All India Radio with your letters, government officials are being invited and discussions are being held, some are being made to find solutions to their problems while writing about their problems.
In a country like India, we need to learn many languages.
Even though I have a few languages, it is true that I have not been able to learn many languages.
In your language, I will definitely try to enter your minds at 8 pm.
Look how beautiful our relationship has blossomed.
The last one year was over.
Today we are stepping into the new year.
Once again my heartfelt greetings to the people of my country.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all, this is the 12th episode of Mann Ki Baat.
I have a great importance for the people's power in democracy.
There is an idea in my life that is the basis of which I have great faith in this people's power.
But Mann Ki Baat has taught us a lot of things, they have shared their experiences and they have made us understand how great this power of the people is.
Our ancestors have made it clear that Jan Shakti is a majesty.
With my experiences in Mann Ki Baat, I can say that in the minds of our ancestors, there is a lot of strength and a lot of reality.
In this regard, I would like to congratulate All India Radio for not only seeing these suggestions in paper but also looking forward to it by the people.
As far as administration is concerned, the basic principle is that information should be from bottom to top, and guidance should be from top to bottom.
Who would have thought that Mann Ki Baat would become a source of information
But that's how it happened.
On October 2, we mark Gandhiji's birth anniversary.
There was a time when there used to be Khadi for the country but today there should not be Khadi for the language.
I said don't much, buy some.
I am happy to share that over the last one year, the sale of Khadi Khadi has played a significant role.
It is difficult to clear subsidies to the common man of the society, the middle class and the lower middle class.
Yet they forsook it.
Is it not a peace revolution?
Is it not the expression of people's power?
Even beyond the domain of power in government departments, there is a huge manpower that can be learnt by governments as well as by being capable and committed.
After Mann Ki Baat, all these things have become a commitment to me.
Therefore, today, through Mann Ki Baat, I once again wish to salute the peoples power for several crores.
People considered even the smallest things that I had said, as a matter of fact, for the welfare of the nation, they had included themselves in it.
What else can be a matter of happiness than this
This time in Mann Ki Baat, I thought of adopting a new approach.
I had requested the people of the country to contact you through phone and register your questions and your suggestions.
There are suggestions from all parts of India that there is no space for invitations.
This is a pleasant experience.
All ages have given advice.
Even after listening to some suggestions, my team is paying attention to the others.
You might have spoken for a few minutes but for me, your suggestions and messages are very important.
The government will definitely pay full attention to your suggestions.
In all four areas, it seems that neutrality is full of negative thoughts.
But my experience is different.
In particular, appeals from the differently-abled were received from the differently-abled as well as from the visually impaired.
One of the main reasons is that they are not able to watch TVs, they are asking for radios.
Pawan Acharya of Alwar in Rajasthan has been sharing information with me.
I want the people of the country to listen and follow the advice of Pavan Acharya ji.
My name is Pavan Acharya, and I belong to Alwar in Rajasthan.
On the occasion of Deepavali, I appeal to the people of the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to make an appeal to the people of the country, to make use of the large quantities of kerosene lamps.
He further said that the use of soil weeds will not only pollute the environment but also provide employment to the poor who earn thousands of soil.
If we listen to the suggestion of Lord Acharya during the upcoming festivals then the lights of our homes will be illuminated, but I appeal to the people of the country that the lamp will be lighted in the family of the poor.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the three forces on the occasion of Vinayaka Chaturthi.
50 years after the end of the 1965 war with Pakistan, an exhibition titled Gallantry Worship is being organized near India Gate in Delhi.
We have been questioning the glorious moments of war, the indomitable courage and sacrifice of our soldiers, and there are no photographs or photographs of that period.
If you want to create history, you should understand the nuances of history very well.
History connects us with our roots.
Cleanliness should be our own nature and we should also provide the tools for that.
I don't think this is wrong.
I see this thing in a very good way that even the Parliament of the country is engaged in discussions about cleanliness.
On the other hand, on the one hand, Parliament on the other, and on the other, both the children of the country are talking about cleanliness. What else can the country be proud of
The movement of ideas has created an environment against pollution and has created an awareness about cleanliness.
Do you know what Gandhiji said?
Once he said that if I want to choose one between freedom and cleanliness, then first I want cleanliness and then only the country's independence.
Cleanliness was more important than freedom for Gandhiji.
Gulshan Arora, a resident of Delhi, has posted a message on MyGov.
Deen Dayal Upadhyay Ji wanted to know about his century.
Even last year, I had said that there might be a lot of fashion clothes, clothes, but I had asked one of them to stay with the other.
I request you to give me something or the other.
Last time you almost doubled sales.
How many poor people have benefitted from this
You have done the work that the government could not do even after spending several crores of rupees with small help.
This is the power of the people. Therefore, I request you again in this matter.
My dear countrymen, my mind is also filled with happiness for something else.
I would like to share this with you.
I was in Kolkata in May and the family members of Subhas Bose had come to meet me.
His brother son Chandra Bose had organized the meeting.
It was only last week that more than 50 family members of Subhas Bose would be visiting the Prime Ministers residence.
Can you imagine how happy this is for me
Many of Subhas Babu's family reside in other countries.
Is it a matter of great happiness for all of you that everyone is coming for this purpose
I look forward to welcoming them.
We have to take this as a habit.
I want the youth of the country to try to get themselves included in the electoral rolls and I want to definitely participate in the elections.
In the course of elections, I have been saying one thing, first of all, then only the other thing.
Everyone should do this sacred work.
Of them, I met a boy who was studying in class 7.
He studied at the Kendriya Vidyalaya in Banaras Hindu University.
So, I got the opportunity to meet a girl named Sonam Patel.
This 9-year-old girl, who lives in Sunderpur, Varanasi, is the daughter of Sadhavraj Patel.
She belongs to a very poor family.
But the biggest thing is that when she asked about any slogan of the song, she stopped it and gave her English explanation and Hindi language explanation.
When I asked her father about this, she said she was saying this from her fifth year.
He added that it is a matter of great surprise for all of us in his family.
This has had a big impact on me in itself.
Some children have an attachment to celebrities, but Sonam has no such involvement.
It only seemed to me that God had given her some special power.
It is a special thing that I have met these two children during my visit to Kashi.
I wanted to share this with you.
Once a month, the Mann Ki Baat programme you will have to be launched once a week, because we get more inspiration from it.
Sandeep ji, you don't know what you want to do or what you want to do from me
Now this is the best time for a month.
One year has passed since Mann Ki Baat began.
Do you know how Subhas Babu used the skylight
He started broadcasting in Germany and spread his message through radio about the freedom struggle for the people of India.
The launch of Azad Hind Radio was done through a weekly news report.
He broadcast radio in several languages - English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Urdu and Pashtun.
I too have started broadcasting on my radio through Mann Ki Baat and one year has come to an end.
Your contribution is precious to me.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
Once again I got a good opportunity to inform you about my Mann Ki Baat.
People are celebrating Onam in the southern part of the country and yesterday the festival of Raksha Bandhan was celebrated all over the country.
The Government of India has implemented many new schemes for the welfare of the people in the interest of the people.
I am glad that in such a short span of time, everyone has joined these schemes in a big way.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, I had made a small appeal to our sisters to take advantage of these security schemes.
I have been told that in a short span of time about 11 crore families have been linked to this scheme.
I am happy that half of the beneficiaries are in the form of mothers and sisters.
I think this is a good sign.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
About a year ago, we started implementing Jan Dhan Yojana in a big way.
Several questions and doubts were raised whether a project which could not be completed in 60 years could be implemented in such a short span of time.
But it is a matter of happiness that all the departments and all the branches of the banks that have been involved in the implementation of this scheme are engaged in it with full force and with complete dedication.We have been successful in this thing, we are about 17 on the basis of the information that has been given to me so far.
Even though it was said that zero balance accounts can be opened, they have saved 22,000 crore rupees.
The banking sector is one of the key drivers of the economy and has also reached the homes of the poor.
Today 1.
25 lakh bank friends are working on the ground.
This has provided employment to the youth.
Now, there are thousands of people who have been empowered and empowered to take over the scheme because of Jan Dhan Yojana.
There is a hope that the poor will also get bank loans.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all those associated with it and I appeal to all the poor not to cut down their connect with the banks at any time.
Banks are yours, don't leave you alone.
We have brought the banks to the doorsteps of your homes. Do not leave it, hold fast.
There should be money in the bank accounts of all of us.
I have a firm belief that you will do this.
A few days ago, the incidents of violence and violence in Gujarat caused peace to the entire country and this is a natural feeling.
Such a tragedy on the soil of Gandhi Ji and Sardar Saheb is deeply distressing and anguishing for all the citizens of the country.
Peace, unity and brotherhood - this path is right.
We all have to stand shoulder to shoulder in the path of progress.
Progress can only be a solution to all our problems.
The first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru ji, visited Bodh Gaya.
I am proud to be a part of this event being attended by Buddhist monks from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Once again I would like to share my Mann Ki Baat with you.
I am ready to accept any suggestion related to the welfare of the farmers and I have come forward several times in this regard.
My farmer brothers and sisters, dont let my farmer brothers and sisters die, dont panic.
I assure you that if anyone tries to mislead you and in order to make you forget, we will not take any action.
For us, every citizen of the country has a value, but there is a special importance for the views and voices of the farmers.
We brought an emergency law.
The Terms of Reference for the Ordinance will expire on 31st August, 2020.
This will ensure that the farmers do not face economic losses.
For us, the words "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" are not mere rhetoric. I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that this is a mantra.
The interests of the poor farmers living in the villages are in our minds.
That is why I had mentioned in my Independence Day speech that the Ministry should work not only in the field of agriculture but also in the field of agriculture and farmers welfare.
We have been taking this resolution forward at a fast pace.
I'd like to talk about one more thing.
Two days ago, 50 years after the end of the 1965 war were over.
Whenever we talk of the 1965 war, it is a natural thing to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
Similarly, we will remember the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
Our scientists are really making great progress.
Many new information have been given to me.
It has been inspiring and encouraging for me.
Many young scientists have shared with me very quickly and I have had many dreams in their eyes.
In the last Mann Ki Baat too, I had said that we should guide our student wealth towards science.
Even during my Independence Day speech, I had spoken about the need for a face-to-face examination on the ground.
When an interview is called, every poor family and widow will have to go through the issues related to getting a letter of recommendation and helping someone to get a job.
This is also one of the reasons for corruption at the ground level.
I had said that there should not be a face-to-face exam under certain circumstances.
I am glad that the government is moving forward in this direction at a fast pace and suggestions are being given so that the resolution is almost complete and the system of interviewing the ground level posts is exhausted.
Today, international figures are coming to India.
In order to reduce maternal and infant mortality, 24 countries of the world have organized a conference in India in collaboration with the implementation of call to action plans.
This is the first time that a brainstorming session was held in India outside the United States.
Every year about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die due to childbirth.
Just as we have been freed from polio, we have also been freed from Tetanus, one of the reasons for maternal and infant mortality.
The world has accepted this.
But even today we have to save our mothers and our mothers and save our mothers.
Brothers and sisters, Today, dengue is spreading.
It is true that dengue fever is dangerous, but it is very simple to avoid it.
My request for a clean India is connected with it.
Even if we look at advertisements on TV, our attention does not go on them.
Even if there are advertisements in newspapers, our thinking is not there in them.
People are being made aware about small things at home and the ways to protect clean and clean drinking water.
We live in a good house, there are many facilities in it, but sometimes we do not know that the water is stuck around us.
I request you not to spread the blanket to death in such an easy way.
Life is very valuable.
The lack of care for water stagnation and cleanliness are the calls for death, not correct.
About 514 dengue fever centers have been set up across the country and free testing is being arranged here.
Timely testing and treatment is the only way to save life.
Your cooperation is very important in this regard.
From Raksha Bandhan to Deepavali, the celebrations and festivals of our country will be full of celebrations.
Why dont we connect all our festivals with cleanliness
Good records will become a habit or not
My dear countrymen, I would like to share a happy message with you.
Hinder Mahajan, Dr.
The interests of the tribal people of our country are in the minds of Mahendra Mahajan Ji.
These two brothers have made India proud.
This year, both of these brothers have won the contest and have made India proud.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to these two brothers.
But in all these efforts, they are engaged in the welfare of the tribal communities - Team India, Vision for Tribals.
See, how everyone is making their own contribution in the progress of the country
When we hear about such incidents, we feel proud.
Sometimes we commit the cruel injustice to our younger generation because of our perspective.
There is a perception in the old generation that no new generation knows anything and I believe that this trend has been going on for centuries.
But my experience with the younger generation is different.
Sometimes we are able to learn many things while talking to the youth.
I have met many young people who have decided to ride a bike on Sunday.
Some people are observing it as a cycle day that one day a week I will ride on a bicycle.
They say that it gives me good health, good environment, and joy from youth.
These days, cycle clubs are being run in many cities of our country and there are many people who are encouraging the cycle journey.
This is a good initiative for health and environmental well-being.
Just as the achievements of the two youth of India have brought glory to the country, the attitude of the youth of the country is also noteworthy.
It has been a long time since the establishment of the memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on the Hindu Mills land in Mumbai.
The memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, who is going to London to travel around the world, where the government of Maharashtra will be formed.
I convey my heartfelt prayers and appreciation to the state government of Maharashtra for their efforts in building these two monuments which will honour Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you and thank you very much.
There is a huge shortage of pulses and oil seeds in our country.
The poor are in need of pulses and a little bit of oil is required to be added to the bourgeoisie.
I am happy that the increase in the area under oilseeds is about 33 and the increase in the area under oilseeds is about 50.
I convey my best wishes to my farmer brothers and sisters for this thing.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of July is celebrated as the day of Kargil victory in the history of our country.
The Kargil war was not confined to the border areas but every village and town in India had contributed to it.
On 26th July, I consider it a matter of great significance as well.
Just a few months after the formation of our government in 2014, we launched the MyGov portal on 26th July.
I am happy that about one year of the formation of the government, nearly 2 crore people have gone to the MyGov portal and nearly 5.12 lakh people have come to know about their views.
It is a matter of great happiness that more than 50,000 people have given their suggestions on the PMO application and have spent their golden time with it and have put their thoughts into it.
They have given very interesting suggestions.
But the attention of the government has not been paid to the people in this regard, but the government has taken a serious consideration to the advice of brother Akhilesh Vajpayee and today we are implementing it.
Today, a logo and tag line is being developed for any government scheme, projects are being formulated and policies are being formulated and most positive suggestions are being received on MyGov.
These days, on the 15th of August, I have also started getting suggestions on mygov address about what I should talk about.
Sushidara Raghvacharya of Chennai has given me many suggestions.
He said that we should talk about Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Swachh Ganga, and Swachh Bharat.
This is an idea in my mind that you can register your views on the 15th of August this year, which I would like to talk about.
You can send it to MyGov, write to Radio and send it to the Prime Minister's Office.
It is a wonderful idea to see what will be the place in my address on 15th August from the general public.
Of course, I think you will offer me the best ideas.
Two days ago, I had visited Delhi on an accident and after that incident, the life of that person who had traveled in the scooter was lost for ten minutes.
He did not receive any help.
People have been asking me on several occasions that you should talk about road safety and create awareness.
That's right with all of you.
If we look at the statistics, the heart will stop.
There is an accident happening every minute in our country.
I urge the parents to create an environment in the family about the safety of children, be it a vehicle for driving a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle or a vehicle for a wheel for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a driver for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle or a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a driver for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle or a vehicle for a vehicle for a vehicle for a car.
The government has also made several efforts in this regard - be it road safety awareness or be it road construction engineering or be it law enforcement or be it emergency care for the injured in the aftermath of the accident.
In the coming days, we are also planning to take several important initiatives to implement the National Road Safety Policy and the Road Safety Strategy.
From Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, we have to place emphasis on cashless treatment on national highways like Mumbai and Ranchi.
According to this, we are thinking about the best life-saving measures and how to make it available in the first 50 hours, keeping away from the issues related to who will pay if there is no money.
We should first approach it from the point of view of how accidents are not happening, in fact every life is worth the price.
Sometimes I used to say that the workers should be Karmayogis.
In the last few days, I am sharing some of the events that touched my heart with this idea.
It is a good feeling to see how they can bring alive even in their work.
Vijay Biswal has shown how he was able to integrate his dance, his art and talent with his work.
I hope that Vijay Biswala's film will be a subject of discussion in the days to come.
A large team of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh is working on a project that touches my heart and I am also interested in it.
Sometimes, some small things also make me very happy and that is why I share them with you.
There is a village named Keshla in Rajnandka of Chhattisgarh state .
In the last few months, they have tried to build a toilet.
Now there is no need for anyone in that village to use the natural resources in an open area.
Even though this had happened, the entire village celebrated it like a big festival when it was completed.
Excellencies, How the values of social life change, how the attitude of the people is changing, how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward and how they are leading the country.
Bavesh Dey of Guwahati has written to me about the problems faced by the North-Eastern states.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country, a Ministry named DoNER was created, which means the Ministry of Development of North Eastern States.
Well, we cant decide the interests of the North-East by sitting in Delhi or not
Therefore, a team of officials from the Government of India visited the North East including Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim.
This effort is going to have good results in the coming days.
This is an effort to move from Delhi to far-flung areas.This is what I call the ACT EASTERN policy.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to learn about the success of the Seva Yatra.
A few days ago, India had launched five satellites of the UK through its PSLV C28.
Even though this message is not a matter of much interest, it is a great achievement.
Sometimes when we ask the young people of the country what they want after your development then they answer that only one of them wants the maximum number of scientists.
It is a matter of concern that our lack of science is a matter of concern.
Following this, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has launched a National Innovation Mission.
I urge the officers of the government of India to spend one and a half hours in a week to motivate the students from schools and colleges around you, to share your experiences with them, and this will definitely help them.
Our villages should get electricity for 24 hours or not
This task is difficult, but it has to be accomplished.
Today, even if you want to charge mobile, you have to go to another village.
The benefits available to the cities should also be extended to the villages and the poor should get the opportunity to avail these facilities.
That is why we have launched the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti.
Our country is the largest country with thousands of villages and we have to ensure that electricity is supplied to the remotest parts of the country.
Your views will be helpful to me.
Thank you very much
When I said so, I didn't expect you to receive such a huge response.
Hundreds of thousands of people were photographed via Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
I have also re-tweeted some of those things that attracted my attention.
If some people in Andhra Pradesh (B) do not record the pictures of caves, then many people in the country may not know that there are such caves.
The same is the photograph of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh.
We are always aware that Rajasthan is a water deficient state, but it is surprising that one from there sends pictures of the waterfalls.
That is, in fact, a wonderful thing has happened.
I can say this thing with conviction that Yoga is not confined to the Sun only.
No Indian will be proud of the fact that the world is spreading the message of Yoga through red carpet.
Even I was in the flood of joy, and my heart was radiant.
While the River Sin and the Eiffel Tower are very proud of the people of France, they also chose the place behind these symbols to practice yoga.
The people of New York had discovered the Times Square to practice Yoga.
As one speaks of Australia's Sydney, the Abera House scenes are very vivid.
The Australian citizens performed Yoga in front of the Abera House Memorial.
Rajpath became a yoga practice.
A new spirit, a new enthusiasm, a new zeal in every corner of the world has been able to feel a new enthusiasm.
A few days ago, a photo of a Vietnamese child, who had trained in Yoga, was tweeted by his family that it was a matter of great humour and it became famous all over the world.
Women, men, elderly, children, villagers, residents, developed countries, developing countries all joined in the yoga practice.
Yoga has indeed become a connecting factor for the world.
I do not know how the world of knowledge will care and criticize this incident.
But it is a matter of pride for every Indian that the world is eager to know about India.
There is an increasing interest in India and the world is eager to know about India's values, traditions and culture.
But only if we have the honour and pride of our heritage, we will be able to present it to the world.
Sometimes we think of what is new in this, for example, our family values.We do not know that India's family values are very big for the people of the world.
I appeal to the youth of the country, especially the youth of the IT sector that all of you, the youth of the country, jointly make a program of online yoga.
Do you know that there is an AYUSH sector in the government
Nobody's attention will be diverted to that.
There will be reports of two or four times in five years, a small sector in a corner.
But it was during Yoga Day.
This tiny sector has been doing a great job globally.
This is an example of how even a very small institution can accomplish great tasks when the goal is before us.
The world was surprised to see how our people rescued those who were stranded in Yemen.
In just a few hours, the world saw that Indians had rushed to Nepal and helped them.
If we start working with conviction, then the government too will be quick to work, the government employees will also be quick to work, the common man will also be hanged on his head and will celebrate.
This is my own experience.
This is the real power of the country's progress.
Last month we had announced three people's life insurance schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people are engaged in life insurance schemes in some way or the other, but we have to take it forward.
There is a thought in my mind, and I would like to put it before you.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan in August, all of us, the people of the country, let us start a strong peoples movement before the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Come, let us all work together to fulfil this pledge.
When I hear Mann Ki Baat, many people give me advice.
This time, many people have suggested to me that I should inform you about the monsoon rains.
You must have heard the voice of the people about the monsoons like Thiruvalluvar, Yogesh Tandon from Nagpur, Harshavardhan, Pravin Nagarani and Divyanshu Gupta from Mysuru.
They have also offered good ideas in their role.
You too may have enjoyed it during this rainy season along with the hot cooked rice, millet and maize.
Just as the sun's rays give us life, similarly, rain also gives us strength.
Every drop of rain is valuable.
As a citizen and as a society, we must develop the spirit of protecting every drop of water.
Water in the village should be in the village as well as water in the city should be used for urban use.
We have to protect every drop of water, be it obstructions or water management, be it small ponds or lakes.
If you go to Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji, if you can see his house then you can see a dam in his 200-year-old house on the ground of saving water in which there is a facility of direct water supply.
You must see this.
Even at that time, this level of concern has been raised.
We can do this too!
It must serve as a mass movement.
This should be followed throughout the village.
Similarly, Greens spoil our eyes.
How beautiful is the life of a greener
Trees, plantations, gardens, parks, all these make life green.
During this rainy season, all of us have to take up tree plantation and related activities on a large scale through social organisations and youth.
I would like to suggest from my own experience that this rural technology is a very successful one.
When you plant a pot in the middle of the tree, just place an old earthen pot near the plant and fill it with water.
Due to moisture in the environment, microorganisms are growing multiplication and health is essential.
Cleanliness is very important.
It is necessary to drink clean water .
Most of the people are wedded to boil water in this season.
It also has good results.
The more we take care, the more we get protection from diseases.
There is also a need for water and rain, but it is also important to be safe from the pandemic.
Ladies and Gentlemen, We have just introduced three new schemes, especially for the urban population.
Under the AMRUT scheme, we have launched a mission to make our cities liveable.
By 2022, when India celebrates its 75th year of independence, every Indian should be given a house.
Keeping these three things in mind, we have started a big scheme.
It provided a boost to all the parents to take selfie with their daughters and register on social websites.
In Haryana, the rate of girls is very low as compared to boys.
There are 100 such aspirational districts in the country.
This is very high in the state of Haryana.
In some way or the other, we have to convert the BetiBachaoBetiPadhao program into a mass movement.
Keep looking, you will feel how happy this movement will give to the daughters, their dignity and the safety of the daughters.
Enjoy the rainy season!
Make our country green.
I have experienced this.
Take this forward.
The next time I meet you for Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes some people think that I should tell you about the welfare schemes of the government in my Mann Ki Baat programme.
This is what makes me happy.
Mann Ki Baat: June 2019
You can imagine how this period would have passed.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month, at 11 o'clock in the morning, I feel that something has disappeared.
But what was then, no, I thought it should be a Sunday event.
But I was eagerly waiting for Sunday to come.
Several people have asked me why I had visited Kedarnath in the midst of an election rush.
But if I started moving in that direction then the course of Mann Ki Baat could change.
So I left when the election time was overrun and the conjectures of victory and the vote continued.
Many consider it to be a political element.
For me, I consider it as an opportunity to meet me.
In a way, I am going to meet myself.
I cant say when I will do it but I will certainly do it because it is my duty to tell you the right to choose.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I continuously feel your efforts to strengthen the positive things in your words.
The inputs in Mann Ki Baat's letters are quite different from the regular government offices.
Sometimes there are words that open the door between my thoughts.
When someone writes about cleanliness, he expresses his anger against filth and cooperates with efforts to create cleanliness.
If someone discusses the environment, it reflects his anguish.
But at the same time, he also mentions his efforts, and also mentions his thoughts.
That is, in a way, the solution to the problems will be reflected in his words as to how it can be included in the entire society.
Mann Ki Baat serves as a mirror to the country and society.
This shows that there is no dearth of talent, strength and determination in the minds of the countrymen.
There is a need to integrate those strengths and skills, create opportunities and engage in constructive efforts.
Mann Ki Baat tells us that 130 crore Indians want to be strong and constructive in the progress of the country.
One has written a letter to the Prime Minister of the country, but you can imagine that he has not submitted any application for himself....
The feelings of crores of such people of the country will be so high
When I look at all these things, I leave your imagination, how much happiness it gives me, how much enthusiasm it gives me.
You are driving me, you are driving me fast, you are not able to imagine that you are giving me life every moment.
I was waiting in the heat without this relationship.
Today my mind is filled with happiness.
In this spirit, let us take forward Mann Ki Baat, let us move forward with this spirit
When there was an emergency in the country, the struggles against it were not limited to political limitations or even to political leaders.
It has not been imprisoned in the midst of prison bars.
There was anger in every citizen's mind.
There was a bit of a reaction to the discredited democracy.
We don't know what to starve when we eat food every day.
Similarly, when one comes to know about the rights of democracy in normal life and the happiness it gives, one is only when one snatches away our democratic rights.
At the time of emergency, every citizen of the country felt that something had been snatched away.
I can say with great pride that India is a prosperous society due to this tradition.
That is why the people of the country felt the lack of democracy and during the Emergency, we experienced this lack.
Therefore, the country made not just for itself, but for the security of democracy, not for its own sake.
We ignore the wonders of any thing, whether it is a thing or a thing that is far away from our hands, when we underestimate the importance of it.
In India, more than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
This figure may seem very simple to us, but if we look at China from the perspective of the world, more and more people than the population of any country in the world have voted in this election.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha election is more than double the total population of the United States, which is far more than the population of the entire Europe.
This symbolizes the vastness and diversity of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha Elections, so far, has been the world's largest democratic election.
Just imagine how much material and human resources will be required to manage such a grand election.
This has been possible due to the hard work of millions of teachers, officers and staff working day and night.
This time, due to the hard work of all of them, the turnout was even more than the last time.
In order to vote, around 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh voting machines and more than 17 lakh VVPATs across the country...
I leave the grandness of the arrangements to your imagination.
All this was done to ensure that no voter is denied the right to vote.
In a remote part of Arunachal Pradesh, only one polling station was set up for a female voter.
You will be surprised to know that it took two days for election officials to reach there.
This is the real respect given to democracy.
The highest polling station in the world is located in India.
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahaul Spiti of Himachal Pradesh.
In addition to this, there is one more thing that will add pride to this election.
This is also the first time in history that women are more than men and women have been actively participating in the polls.
The voting rate of women and men was almost identical in this election.
One more interesting thing in this regard is that today, the number of women members in the House is 78, which is a record number.
My dear countrymen, you might have often asked me that it is not a bouquet but a book.
I was asking them to replace flowers with books on occasions such as receptions, honour.
Since then, people have started giving books at several places.
Now someone has given me a book titled Premchand's famous stories and I like it a lot.
I have not had time for several days, but due to my visits abroad, I have got the opportunity to read some of his stories again.
Premchand has described the reality of the society in his stories and those scenes start moving in your mind as a painting.
Every thing he wrote is very lively.
My young days were spent in my mind...
The second story touched the depths of my mind and its name was 'Idgah'.
A child's compassionate understanding, a pure love he has with his grandmother, and his pious heart at such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid arrives at his grandfather to buy a piece of bread from the festival, in fact, the human spirit touches the peak.
Similarly, the name of a short story touched by the heart is 'Bus Ki Radha'.
The story depicts a difference in the lives of a poor farmer.
Even after losing his crop, why is a farmer named Haldu happy that he does not need to sleep in his field in the cold of melting bones.
But even though these stories are written about a century ago, we can feel that these stories are still relevant today.
After reading these things, I felt a unique experience.
While talking about the reading, I was reading some or the other media about the Akshara library in Kerala.
There was a time when people used to tie books in bundles and even carry them on their backs.
Today this library is showing a new direction not only to the tribal children but also to everyone.
Gujarat's Wancho - Gujarat campaign is a successful effort.
Hundreds of thousands of people from all age groups have participated in this book-reading campaign.
In today's digital world, during the period of Google Guru, I request you to devote some time to make books a place in the middle of your daily routine.
In fact, you will not only love this, but also write about the book you have read and also on the NarendraModi App, so that the listeners of Mann Ki Baat also get to know about it.
My dear countrymen, it gives me great pleasure to know that our people are not keeping up with the present and are also thinking about challenging things in the future.
When I read the comments made by you on the Narendra Modi App and Mygov, I was able to see a lot of people writing about water.
Apart from Bavan Kaurai of Belkawi, Siddhamsu Mohan Farida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf have also written several other issues related to water.
Water has a great importance in our culture.
As regards water in the hospital of Rigveda, it is said about water - Abohista Mayobuva: It means water is the power to give life, it is the power to give life.
May water be equal to mother, motherliness bless us with blessings and may we have mercy on us.
Water conservation affects several parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 per cent of the water received through rain during the entire year can be stored in our country.
That's just 8 percent.
Therefore, the time has come for a solution to this problem.
I am confident that like all of us, with the help of Jan Bhagidaari, with the opening of 130 crore countrymen through Jan Shakti, with cooperation and resolve, this crisis can also be solved.
Keeping in mind the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created in the country.
This will make decisions on all water related issues at a faster pace.
A few days ago, I tried to do something differently.
I have written a letter to the Panchayat leaders and village leaders of the country.
I had written a letter to them so that they could collect water, collect water, maintain every drop of rain water, join the village council and join the villagers in a discussion.
I am extremely glad that they have been involved in this work. On the 22nd of this month, crores of people participated in thousands of panchayats.
People from every village had pledged to save every drop of water and contributed to their fitness.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about the leader of the Panchayat.
The people of that place are once again ready to make a positive contribution towards water conservation.
My best wishes to all the Panchayat leaders and all the village heads who have done a positive job from my side.
There are many leaders who have taken up this challenge of water conservation throughout the country.
In a way, this is an opportunity for the entire village.
There is a feeling in my mind that the villagers are now engaged in a temple for water in their village.
As I have said, positive results are obtained through social initiatives.
There is not only one way to deal with the water crisis across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country in different ways.
But everyone's goal is to save water and maintain water.
Waterways in Punjab are being restored.
This effort will get rid of the problem of obstructions.
There is a change in the lives of the villagers due to the setting up of water tanks at Thimpupalli in Telangana.
A big change has been brought about in the development of small ponds in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
While reading about a social initiative at Vellore in Tamil Nadu, I am aware that 20,000 women have joined the task of reviving the river Naga.
At the same time, I also read about the daughters of Garhwal region and they have done a wonderful job of rain water harvesting in harmony with each other.
When people gather, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I make three requests to the people of the country.
My first appeal was - just as the countrymen turned cleanliness into a peoples movement, come, let us begin a peoples movement of making water conservation a peoples movement.
Let us all resolve to save every drop of water together.I believe that water is the gift of God and it is a wonderful rasamani.
It was said that this rasamani would have iron gold.
But you too are such a rasmani and new life is being produced by the spray of water.
We have to create an awareness campaign to save every drop of water.
My second request to the countrymen was, behold, several traditional methods of water conservation have been prevalent in our country for centuries.
I appeal to all of you to share these traditional methods with all of you.
If any one of you got the opportunity to visit the place of birth of a venerated brother in Porbandar, then there is a 200-year-old water conservation tank in a house behind the house of a elder brother.
Come, let us create a comprehensive list of water conservation related issues and encourage people to take up water conservation activities.
All of you, Janshakti4, Jal Shakti- share your thoughts with others.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you and the people of the world for one more thing.
Presidents of many countries of the world, Prime Ministers, celebrities and ordinary citizens, tweeted to me how Yoga is being practiced in every country.
That day, the world was seen as a happy family.
We are aware of the need for healthy and intelligent people to establish a healthy society and this ensures that yoga is done.
Therefore, the spread of yoga is a great job of social service.
Shouldn't it be honored to give recognition to such services
In 2019, the announcement of the Prime Ministers Awards for the outstanding contribution for the promotion and development of Yoga provided me with an incredible spirit.
This award is being presented to organizations that have made significant contribution to the spread of Yoga across the world.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs various institutes and training courses there.
Similarly, Ms.
He is an example of inspiration.
When it comes to Yoga, tell us whether India is at home or not
Yoga should be widely celebrated, Yoga must be celebrated, Yoga must be given respect and honor to those who take the message of Yoga to their homes.
My dear countrymen, this journey of ours has started today, a new spirit, a new experience, a new resolve, a new energy.
Yes, wait for your suggestions and ideas as always.
We will meet again and again and we will be happy to talk.
I hear your feelings, gather and understand it.
Sometimes I try to live up to those feelings.
Let your blessings continue.
You are my ideas, you are the ones who give me strength.
Come, let us all enjoy Mann Ki Baat, let us fulfill our duties in life.
Once again, we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat next month.
Many many thanks to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, when Mann Ki Baat begins, my mind is filled with hope.
Ten days ago, Mother India had lost her brave sons.
These brave-hearts have lost their lives defending our 1.25 billion countrymen.
Our brave sons had sacrificed their lives day and night so that the countrymen could sleep peacefully.
After the sacrifices of our brave soldiers in the Pulwama terror attack, the hearts of our countrymen are wounded and angry.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families all around.
I salute the brave soldiers of the country who have laid down their lives to protect Mother India.
The task of facing this challenge before the country should be to forget all the differences of casteism, communalism, and regionalism so that our efforts and decisions against terrorism are firmly and determined.
Our armed forces have always displayed unparalleled courage and valour.
On the one hand, they have shown their outstanding potential for peace and have done the job of responding to the attackers in the same language.
You can see how the operations were carried out within 100 hours of the attack.
The military has taken a pledge to throw Kelly at the root of the terrorists and their supporters.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the words and ideas inspired by their relatives through the media have been widely disseminated and strengthened across the country.
Mina, the wife of Prasanna Sahu, a martyr of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha, celebrates her immense courage all over the country.
He has pledged that he will join the Central Border Security Force (BSF) and his only son.
When Vijay Shorena, who was armed with a tricolor, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, he told Sulur that his nephew son and I would join the army.
It is the passion of this cage that today, within the body and inside the body of every child in India, there is a lot of enthusiasm among the children.
Whether it be the family of Vijay Maurya, the sacrifice of Deoria, the parents of Tilakraj, the martyr of Gangtok, or the six-year-old Balagan of Hemraj, who belongs to Kota, the story of every family of the martyrs is a source of inspiration and a source of inspiration.
I appeal to the younger generation that we should try to understand, understand and understand the feelings shown by these families and the goals pointed out by them.
There is no need to distort the history of the past to know what patriotism means, sacrifice and penance.
My dear countrymen, more and more living...
The waiting period is about to end when all of us are waiting for a War Memorial for so long as independence is attained.
It is natural that the enthusiasm and zeal of the countrymen is there in this regard.
On the NarendraModiApp, Shri Onkar Shetty, a native of Karnataka has expressed her happiness over the establishment of the National War Memorial.
It is surprising and sad that no national level War Memorial has been established in our country so far.
I wanted it to be a memorial decorated with the bravery of the soldiers who laid down their lives while defending the nation.
I am confident that such a monument will definitely be built in the country.
The second wheel, the wheel of valour, is a symbol of the courage and bravery of the soldiers.
The walls of the gallery will be decorated with the valour of the soldiers.
After this the wheel of sacrifice;
This wheel indicates the sacrifice of the soldiers.
The names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the nation will be inscribed in gold papers.
The Rakshak wheel then symbolizes the security.
There is a queue of dense trees on this wheel.
It is impossible to put in words the immense contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces towards the progress of the country.
In October last year, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
The memorial is a manifestation of the spirit of gratitude towards our police personnel, men and women, who are always on the verge of extinction.
I am sure you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you visit those places, you must share your photographs on the social media so that others are inspired to visit these places and are eager to visit these holy places.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, thousands of letters and comments from you have come to me in different ways.
This time when I was reading your views, an interesting comment by Adish Mukhopadhaya ji drew my attention.
He was only 25 years old when the British arrested Birsa Munda on 3rd March , 1900.
Similarly, on March 3rd, the birth anniversary of Jamsetji Tata was also a coincidence.
He added that though these two men belong to completely different families, both of them have fulfilled the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
Paying tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamsetji Tata in their Mann Ki Baat address, in a way equals to the glorious history and traditions of Jharkhand.
These two great men have brought glory not only in the name of Jharkhand but also in the name of the entire country.
The entire country is grateful to them for their contribution.
Today, if an inspiring person is required to guide our youth, then he is the Lord Birsa Munda.
And when the British slept with a loud voice and with awe, they took him.
Do you know why they have kept such a thing?
Because even the British who had established such a grand empire were afraid of him.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda, with his traditional bow arrows, shook the British rule using guns.
In fact, if people get an inspiring leadership, then the will of the society becomes bigger than the power of weapons.
He took the oppressed, the oppressed, and the exploited, to the sun, from darkness to light.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the end of his 25 years.
Like Birsa Munda, the sons of Mother India are born in all parts of the country.
Such great men were full of such great men everywhere that they could not be found anywhere in India as they did not contribute to the centuries-old freedom struggle.
But it is unfortunate that the stories about their sacrifice, heroism and sacrifice will not reach the new generation.
If people like Lord Birsa Munda have shown us the way we are, then people like Jamsetji Tata have given great institutions to the country.
In fact, Jamsetji Tata was a visionary prophet who not only saw India's future but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He was well aware of the future need to make India a science, technology and industry hub.
It was because of his vision that the Tata Institute of Science was established and is now known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Not only this, he also established a number of trusted companies and industries like Tata Steel.
It was the result of the interaction that the Indian Institute of Science was born.
My dear countrymen, on the 29th of February, the birth anniversary of the former Prime Minister of our country, Mr.
You all are aware that this day will come only once in four years.
Similarly, a peaceful person, Morarji Bhai, is one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Morarji Bhai Desai ji was the first to submit the highest budget statement in the Parliament of Independent India.
At a very difficult time, he led India efficiently. At that time, the democratic system of the country was in a major threat.
Morarji Desai ji had dedicated himself against emergency in order to protect democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price for his old age.
He was arrested and imprisoned by the then government.
But when the Janata Party won in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
It was during his rule that the 44th constitutional amendment was passed.
Why is it so important that the 42nd constitutional amendment to introduce a state of emergency was brought in, in addition to reducing the powers of the Supreme Court, some of the provisions contained in it have shattered our democratic values and therefore were withdrawn.
The amendment of the 44th Constitution made a provision to empower the functioning of the Parliament and the Legislatures in the newspaper.
It was for the first time that the President can declare a state of emergency only on the recommendation of the Cabinet in written form and that the period of emergency cannot be extended by more than six months in a single manner.
Morarji Bhai had assured him that he would not be able to revive the Emergency, the manner in which democracy was assassinated and buried in 1975.
His contribution to the preservation of the dignity of Indian democracy will be remembered for generations to come.
Once again I offer my tributes to such a great leader.
They have made a positive difference in the lives of others in different ways through their hard work.
They are true Karmyogis, who do service to the people, service to the society, and above all, service to the nation in a way that is selflessly beneficial.
When Padma awards are announced, you may have seen people asking for the award.
In a way, I consider this as a great victory because these people will not be seen on the cards of television and newspapers, they are away from the world of hate.
However, those who do not have any concern that they should be named, those who believe in working on the ground.
Yoga: They are people who live by chanting Karmasu Kaushalam.
I would like to share with you some of these things.
You must be aware of Odisha's Tahrir Naik that there was no reason why he was not called the Canal Man of Odisha and that Tai Ji had cut the mountain in his village by his own hands and built a three kilometer long canal.
I have presented to former President of the United States of America, Mr. Barack Obama as a souvenir, on the '3e of Life' painting made by Abdul Kafur.
Among the Padma awards, Shapbir Saiyat of Marathwada is also known as Pashutha's servant.
How he devoted his entire life to the service of the cow is extremely unparalleled.
For the first time in Tamil Nadu, a small child from Madurai who was a victim of the sufferings and the empowerment of the oppressed was taken up through the storehouse mission in Tamil Nadu and also started community-based micro finance institutions.
Even after hundred years, he has taught yoga to people all over the world, and till now he has made 1500 people Yoga trainers world over.
Jamuna Tudoo, a famous lady named Lady Tarzan of Jharkhand, has done a courageous job of combating oaks and oaks, who prevented the destruction of 50 hectares of forest and mobilized 10,000 women to protect trees and wildlife.
It is due to the untiring hard work of this Jamunaji that today, all the villagers are planting 18 trees and 10 trees during every daughter's marriage.
The story of Raj Kumari Devi, a farmer from Muzaffarpur in Bihar is very inspiring.
Now wherever I go in the country, I try to meet some of the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana i.e.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme.
I can clearly see what a big change has been brought about in the lives of the poor.
This scheme belongs to all such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the examinations are about to begin in schools.
Several Boards of Education across the country will start conducting Board Examinations for Classes 10 and 12 in the next few weeks.
I convey my best wishes to all the students of the examination, their parents and all the teachers from my side.
A few days ago, a big event was organized at the Town Hall in Delhi, in the form of Pariksha Pe Charcha.
One of the highlights of the Pariksha Pe Charcha 2020 is that the discussions on subjects related to examinations have been conducted without any hindrance.
Because we have thousands of years old culture and traditions.
A few days later, Mahashivratri will come on the holy day. This time, on Monday, the auspicious occasion of Shivaratri, a special significance spreads the fragrance of flower in our hearts.
A few days ago I had gone to Kashi and there I got the opportunity to spend some time with my differently abled brothers and sisters.
I was able to talk to them about many things and their self-confidence really impressed them.
During the conversation, a visually impaired youth said he was a stage artist and when he introduced himself as a mechanic in the programme, I asked him who you would speak.
He said that he would talk like a Prime Minister and make a mockery of it.
As soon as I did something, I had a pleasant surprise. Just as I spoke in Mann Ki Baat's voice, he showed Mann Ki Baat through a medium.
I was happy to learn that people not only listen to Mann Ki Baat but also remember it on many occasions.
In fact, I was very surprised to see the power of these differently abled people and they had made a big impact on me.
My dear countrymen, connecting with you through Mann Ki Baat has given me a unique experience.
In a way, I have been interacting with crores of families through radio every month.
I feel that while talking to you many times and reading your letters and listening to your phone calls, you consider me as your family member.
This feeling fills my heart with a pleasant experience, it quenchs the peace.
Friends, Elections are the biggest celebrations of democracy.
For the next two months, we are all in the fray for the elections.
Even I am standing as a candidate in this election.
The next Mann Ki Baat will take place on the last Sunday in May, in recognition of the healthy democratic tradition.
That is, in March-April, all my feelings during these three months, with a new hope after the elections, with the strength of your blessings, once again I will start my conversation with Mann Ki Baat, and I will keep moving with your Mann Ki Baat for many years.
Once again I express my gratitude.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Sivakumar Swamiji devoted his entire life towards social service.
Sivakumar Swami ji follows this philosophy.
He served for the social, educational and economic development of thousands of people in his 111 years of life.
How widespread his scholarship was, he had a great sense of humor in English, Sanskrit and Kannada.
He's a social reformist.
He spent his entire life in providing food, shelter, education and spiritual enlightenment to the people.
Swamiji's life had been primarily aimed at the welfare of the farmers.
Siddhaganga Mutt has been organizing cattle and farming fairs in a systematic manner.
I have often heard of Swamiji's blessings.
In 2007, on the occasion of the centenary celebrations of Sri Sri Sri Sivakumar Swamiji, our former President Dr.
On this occasion, Kalam used to read a poem written for the venerated Swamiji.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Ayya, describes the life of Shri Shri Shri Shri Sivakumar Swamiji in a beautiful way and the purpose of the Siddhaganga Mutt.
There is a very important institution in our country .
This is an integral part of our democracy, far more ancient than our democracy. I talk about Election Commission of India.
On the 25th of January, we are celebrating the founding day of the Election Commission as National Voters Day.
When we look at the scale of elections in India, the world is amazed at the fact that the world is holding a finger on the nose.
In Himachal Pradesh, polling stations are being set up at a height of 15,000 feet and polling stations are being set up at Andaman and Nicobar Islands too.
You might have heard about Gujarat.
In a remote location in Gir forest, only one polling station has been set up for one voter.
Imagine friends...
Keeping that in mind, the entire team of Election Commission staff goes to far-flung areas to ensure that the voters get the opportunity to exercise their franchise this is the beauty of our democracy.
I heartily congratulate the Election Commission of India for continuously striving to strengthen the democratic system.
I congratulate the Election Commission of all the States, all the Security Forces, and other personnel involved in the conduct of elections, in a free and impartial manner.
This year the Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country.
This is the first time that the youth of the 21st century will cast their votes in the Lok Sabha elections.
They will have the opportunity to carry the responsibility of the nation on their shoulders.
They are now becoming partners in the resolution process of the nation.
It is a time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the nation.
I appeal to my young friends that if you are eligible to vote, you must register with your name on the electoral rolls.
If we are unable to vote for anything in life, we must feel sorry for it.
If we say something wrong has happened in the country then we must feel sorry for it.
This process has to become our nature.
I appeal to the people of the country that all of us should collectively register a voter, vote on polling day and this time we should organize a campaign and create awareness.
I am sure that the younger generation will register their names in large numbers and will contribute to our democracy and further strengthen it.
My dear countrymen, there have been times in this great land of India when great men have done something wonderful, something unforgettable for mankind.
On 23rd January, we celebrated his birthday in a new way.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I had the opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the freedom fighters who had contributed to the country's freedom struggle.
Inside the Red Fort, many such cells have been closed since independence till now.
The cells of the Red Fort have been converted into museums, dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, Yaad-e-Jallian.
The museum built in the memory of Indias first war of independence in 1857 has also been dedicated to the entire complex as Kranti Mandir.
Every brick in these museums smells the glorious history of our nation.
It was here that the British Government had tried the valiant sons of Mother India, Colonel Prem Saigal, Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Tilon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
At a time when I was watching the memories associated with Netaji at the Kranti Mandir of the Red Fort, one of the family members of Netaji had presented me a very special cap.
In fact, the courage and patriotism of our heroes needs to be restored to our new generation, in different dimensions, to a sustainable future.
About a month ago, on 30th December, I had gone to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
75 years ago, I got the opportunity to hoist the tricolour at any place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had unfurled the tricolour.
On this occasion, the announcement related to the Azad Hind Government was made 75 years ago.
Subhas Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and an able administrator.
Such a brave soldier has made an important contribution in the freedom struggle.
With the inspiration and inspiration of Delhi Salo, you give me blessings and I give you freedom, Netaji accomplishes the resolve of every Indian.
For many years there was a demand for secret files about him to be brought to the public domain.
I am extremely happy that we have done this work.
I don't think that all the family members of Netaji had come to my house one day.
Together, we talked about several things related to Netaji, and presented our red carpet to Netaji Bose.
Efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
May it be 26, Alipur Road, Sardar Patel Museum associated with Baba Saheb Ambedkar and may it be Kranti Mandir.
If you come to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today as we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, I would like to share an incident related to the life of Netaji with you in Mann Ki Baat.
I have always considered radio as an important media that connects people.
I have been told that this radio station has been broadcasting news every week in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjab, Pashtun, Urdu and other languages.
In the management of this radio station, M.K.
R.
Vyas ji's contribution is noteworthy.
The programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were dear to the common man, whose programmes provided strength to our freedom fighters.
A museum has been built in this Kranti Mandir.
Efforts are being made to explain Indian art and culture in a more attractive way.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum, where there are more than 450 paintings and art works 3 centuries old.
The Museum showcases some of the finest works of great artists like Amrita Sher-e-Keyil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy, Silos Mukherjee among others.
I especially urge all of you to visit the place and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Well, what is this that he is talking about art, but you can imagine that going here he is talking about the great works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You all know Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to say that Gurudev is also an artist.
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to his great work.
He wanted the viewer to understand it, and the message he gave through the film should be viewed from his perspective.
His paintings are exhibited in European countries, Russia and the United States.
I am confident that you will visit Kranti Mandir and see his paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is a land full of saints.
Our saints have spread the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Such a saint is Chand Ravidas.
On 19th February, the birth anniversary of Ravidas ji was also celebrated.
In fact, if God is present in all human beings, it is not appropriate to divide and divide him into castes, creeds and sects.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Saint Ravidas ji through his message worked throughout his life to spread the message of majesty and magnificence of labour and labour.
It is not too much to say that he has told the world the essence of the importance of labour.
I once again remember the venerable Ravidas Ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddhar Ji in MyGov has urged to speak in Mann Ki Baat about the Indian space sector and the dimensions related to its future.
Vikram Sarabhai has made a great contribution to India's space mission.
Our space programme covers the contributions of countless young scientists of the country.
It is a matter of pride for us that the satellites and soundingrocketed by our students are reaching space.
On 24th January this year, Kalamsat was launched by our students.
Even sounding rockets produced by university students in Odisha have earned a reputation.
In the last four and a half years, so many space missions have been undertaken since independence in 2014.
We have successfully launched 104 satellites in one orbit.
We will soon record India's presence in the Moon through the Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is making use of space technology in a very efficient manner for the safety of life-saving devices.
Space technology has helped a lot in the rescue, relief of rail and road safety.
NavIC equipments have been distributed to our fishermen brothers and sisters, which has helped in economic development and protection of them.
We have been doing well in service delivery and accountability of the government using space technology.
About 40 lakh households in 23 states have been provided with bio-degradable houses under the Housing for All scheme.
Moreover, nearly 3.5 crore assets have been geo-tagged as per the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).
Our satellites today are the symbols of the country's growing power.
It is because of its contribution that we have excellent relations with many countries of the world.
There is a unique effort called South Asia Satellite, which gives a boost to the development of friendly countries in our neighbourhood.
Through its efficient launch services, India today is not only the developing countries but also the satellites of the developed countries.
The skies and the stars have always been a matter of attraction for children.
Our space programme offers opportunities and opportunities to think big, and to move beyond those boundaries.
Our children are attracted to the stars and are also inspired to seek new stars, giving them a vision.
My dear countrymen, whosoever plays, they grow and blossom, this time the players of 'Khelo India' have brightened up.
In January, about 6000 players took part in 18 sports events at the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
If a player performs his best at the local level, he will be able to understand the best practices in the world.
This time, players from all the states in Khelo India have displayed their best.
He lives in a car with his family.
Similarly, the captain of the women under 21 years of age in Maharashtra, Sonali Halvi, is a resident of Sarada.
He lost his father at a very young age, and his brother and his mother encouraged Sonali with confidence.
We have often seen that women do not get much encouragement in sports like Kabaddi.
But beyond all this, he chose Sonali Kabaddi and performed well.
Abhinav Shah, a 10-year-old from Asansol, has the distinction of winning a Gold in the Khelo India Youth Games at a very young age.
The daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, Akshaya Vatwani Kamthi, won the gold medal in the weightlifting event.
His father is a farmer from Belgaum.
But did you hear about the competition to clean the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets took part in this unique competition which is going on for nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is a clean and beautiful toilet.
People also kept their toilets clean, beautifully decorated, painted with some paintings From Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup, a lot of photographs are available on social web sites.
I appeal to all the Panchayat leaders and the village leaders to take the lead in such a movement in your panchayat.
You must share a picture of your clean and beautiful toilet with MyIzzatghar on the social platform.
Friends, We made a memorable visit on October 2, 2014, together with the aim of cleaning the country and freedom from open defecation.
Due to the cooperation of the people of India, today, before the 2nd of October, 2019, we are moving forward in the direction of getting rid of open defecation so that on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Anna Hazare ji, we can dedicate our tribute to him.
In this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat, the contribution of Mann Ki Baat's listeners is immense and that is why I am happy to share this thing with you that more than 5.5 lakh villages and 600 districts have declared themselves free from open defecation and the sanitation coverage of rural India has reached 98 percent of the population and about 9 crore families have been provided with toilets.
My young friends, the exam days are getting closer.
Anshul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has appealed to me to talk about exams and exam warriors.
And, Anshul, I thank you for bringing this matter forward.
Yes, the first part of the year is a test time for many families.
From students, their parents to teachers, everyone is engaged in exam related activities.
This time, students from many foreign countries will also participate in the event.
In this Pariksha Pe Charcha, I will talk about all the aspects related to examinations, especially the exam related with our young friends.
I have requested people to send their inputs and suggestions for the same.
I am very happy that a large number of people are sharing their views on MyGov.
I will certainly present some of these ideas and suggestions on the Town Hall programme.
You must take part in this program...
You can also see its live telecast through the social media and through the Namo App.
May this visit of 2019 be a successful one.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
It is only then that we have the opportunity to gain from the experiences and the confidence to do something new is also there.

Electricity has been provided to every village of the country.
All the world's most valued institutions have come to the fore as India achieves its goal of being free from poverty at a rapid pace.
The countrymen are also moving ahead on their journey of 95 per cent of the cleanliness content, due to their unwavering commitment.

The women of the country have brought laurels for the country through their endeavours to travel around the world in Navika Sagar Parikrama, on the lines of Navika Sagar Parikrama.

This time, India has won a lot of medals in the Asian Games.
India has done very well in the Para Asian Games.
If I talk about the efforts of every Indian and our social efforts only then our Mann Ki Baat will be long and will be born in the year 2019.
All this is due to the relentless efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
Jaya Chandran joined the Lord.
People say that he was constantly striving to provide treatment to patients.
Similarly, Sulkitti Narasimha from Karnataka joined the Lord on 25th December.
Sulkitti Narasimha helped in the delivery of pregnant mothers.
He has served thousands of mothers in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
Earlier this year, he was honored with the Padma Shri award.
While talking about healthcare, here I would like to talk about the social efforts of the doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some members of our party told me that some young doctors in the city had organized a camp and provided free treatment to the poor.
Every month, several poor patients are benefitting from this scheme.
The zeal of these medical friends who have been working selflessly and selflessly, is indeed commendable.
Today, I am extremely proud of the fact that Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a successful movement because of social efforts.
A few days ago, some people told me that in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people have joined the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan at the same time.
The people from all walks of life, municipal, voluntary organisations, students from schools and colleges, and the people of Jabalpur have participated with great enthusiasm in this Mahakumbh of cleanliness.
The success stories of innovative youth and entrepreneurs at com have been described in detail.
Okay, will we do a job?
Can we share information on such websites amongst us
We will also spread a positive spirit to all of us.
With this, a large number of people will come to know about our heroes who are transforming the society.
There is a special place for sports in all communities.
When playing, it fills the hearts of those who see it.
We feel a lot of respect for the name, identity and respect of the players.
But sometimes there are many things in their background and there are more things than the world of sports.
I want to mention about a girl from Kashmir, Hanaya Nisar, who won a gold medal in the Cartage competition in Korea.
Hanaya is a 12-year-old girl from Anantnag in Kashmir.
Because of her hard work and hard work, Karate got trained and made a record.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I wish him a bright future.
Many good wishes and good wishes to Hanaya.
Similarly, another 16-year-old daughter, Rajni, has also received a lot of news in the media. You must have read it.
Rajni has won a gold medal in the under-privileged section of the Womens Boxing Championship.
When Rajni won the medal, she immediately went to a nearby milk shop and drank a cup of milk.
After that, Rajini wrapped his medal in a cloth and put it in his bag.
Yeah, you all think about why Rajni has drunk a cup of milk, right?
He did this in a way to pay tribute to his father, Jasmer Singh, who is selling lassi in a shop in Panipat.
Rajni later said that she had made a great sacrifice to achieve this situation and suffered many hardships.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
This year, a 20-year-old young Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune became the first Asian to become the world's fastest-growing bicycle.
He travelled for 159 days at an average of about 300 kilometres a day.
His unwavering interest in riding a bicycle is indeed commendable.
When we hear about such achievements and successes, do we get inspired
The names of all these festivals may be different but the feeling of celebrating everything is the same - these festivals in some way or the other are associated with crops, crops and crops, they are associated with farmers, they are connected with villages and with crops.
At this time, the time of sunrise and the sunset of Uttarayan is about to enter the Rasi.
After that, gradually the day starts increasing and the harvest of winter crops starts.
My best wishes to the farmer brothers and sisters who are going to feed us.
Unity in Diversity Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is the essence of our festivals.
We can see how close our ties with nature are with our festivals and festivals.
Many of our festivals are specially created in the spirit of preserving rivers and water.
On the day of Sat Puja, the sun is worshipped in the rivers and water bodies.
During Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people take holy dip in the holy rivers.
Share the photographs taken during these festivals with everyone so that everyone can see the diversity of India and the beauty of its culture.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Congregation is of great magnitude and it is full of divinity and magnificence.
People from all over the country and the world come and associate themselves with the Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, people come to the sea with hope and fame.
Millions of people from within the country and abroad join in one place at a time.
The tradition of Kumbh Congregation is a flower that blossoms in our great cultural tree.
This year, from 15th January, the world famous Kumbh Mela to be held in Prayagraj, is eagerly awaiting you.
Saints and saints have started coming to Kumbh.
Last year, the UNESCO Kumbh Mela was included in the list of INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF HUMANITY, i.e.
A few days ago, ambassadors of many countries visited the preparations for the Kumbh.
At the same time, flags of many countries were flown.
People from more than 150 countries are likely to participate in the Kumbh Mela being organized at Prayagraj.
With the divinity of the Kumbh Mela, India's glory will display its magnificence on the world stage.
The Kumbh Mela is a great tool to feel oneself and every person coming here gets a different experience, they look at the worldly things with a spiritual perspective and understand them.
In particular, it offers a great learning experience to the youth.
I had visited Prayagraj a few days ago, and I could see the arrangements for Kumbh as a matter of great concern.
People from Prayagraj are very excited about the Kumbh.
I dedicated the Integrated Command Control Centre, Integrated Command and Control Centre to the people there.
Cleanliness along with difficulty in organizing the events will also provide good tidings to the remotest parts.
This time, the devotees will be able to have a holy darshan of Akshayvat after the holy dip in the Sangam.
This Akshayvat, the symbol of peoples faith, remained confined to the fort for thousands of years so that devotees could not see it even if they wanted to.
Now the doors of the Akshayvat have been opened for everyone.
May this Kumbh of spirituality be the magnificence of India's philosophy, the Prime Minister said.
May this Kumbh of faith be the magnificence of the nation.
May this Kumbh of the devotees become the magnificence of the world tourism.
Babu had a connection with South Africa which was not associated with him.
In the same South Africa, it was Mohan and Mahatama.
It was in South Africa that Gandhiji started his first Satyagraha and gave a decisive voice against diversity.
He established Phoenix and Tolstoy, from where the voices of peace and justice all over the world started fluttering.
He had the courage and inspiration to spend years in prison.
What do you know about Mandela's brother-in-law? "The Gandhis had been an inseparable part of our history because he had conducted his first experiment with eloquence here.
Here he clearly expressed his commitment to justice;
It was here that he re-emphasized his philosophy of Satyagraha and his methods of struggle, the Prime Minister said.
He set up his brother-in-law as a model.
Anna and Mandela have been the source of inspiration for the world and their goals have always inspired us to build a society of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a conference of Directors General of Police was held at Kevadia, on the banks of the Narmada Bank of Gujarat, where meaningful discussions were held with the top police officials of the country.
There were extensive discussions on how to make efforts to further strengthen the security of the country and its people.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the nation.
He was always associated with maintaining the unity of India.
Sardar Patel used to think that the power of India is inherent in unity in diversity.
We will be able to pay our respects to Sardar Patel through this award.
My dear countrymen, on the 13th of January, the holy birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji was celebrated.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna.
For a large part of his life, his work was in North India, and he joined the Nanded of Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India, is at Nanded for the last moments of life.
In a way, the entire India is blessed with his blessings.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
But whenever efforts were made to suppress the voices of the poor and weaker sections, and injustice was done to them, then Guru Gobind Singh ji gave a voice to the poor and the weaker sections, and he fought shoulder to shoulder with his resolve. Therefore, he says - , , , , , , , , , , , , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , :
He would say, , , , that one cannot express one's strength by confronting the weak.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that the greatest service is to wipe out the sorrows of the human society.
He was a man of virtues of heroism, heroism, sacrifice and conduct.
Apart from this, Gurumukhi was an expert in several languages, namely, Prajabhasha, Samskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are several incidents in the country that do not have much discussion.
The FSSAI is such a unique attempt.
Programmes are being organized across the country on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
At Right India, health-India campaigns are being carried out through the campaign to make proper meals.
When India becomes clean and healthy, it becomes self-reliant.
Nutritious food is the most important requirement for good health.
Knowledge of the importance of food is essential from childhood itself.
My dear countrymen, this is the end of the year 2018. Let us re-connect in the year 2019 and re-interpret our minds.
Whether it is personal life, the life of the nation or the life of the society, inspiration is the source of development.
Come, new inspiration, new enthusiasm, new resolve, new successes, new heights - let us move, let us change, let us change, let us change the country.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On 3rd October, 2014, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, we all undertook a journey together through Mann Ki Baat.
This time most of the letters and phone calls from you have been related to this 50th part.
On MyGov, Delhis Ansu Kumar, Amar Kumar, Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monika Jain from Narendra Modi App, PranjitSarkar from Parwan, West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri from Nagpur have all raised similar questions.
Your enthusiasm is natural.
Today, when nearly all the radios have been forgotten, why is Modi connecting through the radio
I'd like to tell you about an incident.
This happened in 1998.
I was working as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Himachal Pradesh.
I was going to one place in May.
He said, take one of the laddoos that were kept in his cup of tea and eat the first laddoo before it gets ready for tea.
I was astonished and asked if there was such a superstition as a wedding in the house.
No no brother, don't you know?
I'm just thinking about that.
You see, first of all listen to the radio, he said.
At that time they were talking about it on the radio.
In this forest, in the midst of the snow-clad mountains, a common man wants to listen to the radio throughout the day for selling tea.
Therefore, when I became the Prime Minister, it was not surprising for me to turn my attention to radio, which is the most powerful medium.
It was the spirit that inspired Mann Ki Baat to take farmers from remote villages to cities, from young professionals to young professionals.
Every month, lakhs of letters were read, calls were heard, comments were received on the app and MyGov.
The journey of these 50 areas, which were connected in an interesting way by connecting all these things together, has been done by all of us.
Today, All India Radio has also carried out a review of Mann Ki Baat.
Some of the recesses that have been found are quite interesting.
70 of those surveyed have been continuously receiving Mann Ki Baat.
Those who have developed a positive attitude in the society are considered to be the greatest contributor to Mann Ki Baat.
People's movements have been encouraged in a big way through Mann Ki Baat.
There has been a widespread discussion on Independency.
All this underscores the positive attitude and the positive spirit in the minds of our countrymen.
People are sharing their thoughts that self-interest has increased due to Mann Ki Baat.
It is a big change in the mindset of the people that they should be engaged in social service.
But people are not only connected with this event through video conference.
People are also ensuring their contribution through television, FM radio, mobile, internet, Facebook, Periscope, and even through the Narendra Modi App.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the members of the Mann Ki Baat family for their faith in Mann Ki Baat and for transforming it into a place.
Your suspicions are correct.
The conclusion of their analysis was that this event was not politically motivated.
When Mann Ki Baat began, I had resolved that there should not be any politics in this or that there should not be any pressure on the government and that Modi should not be seen anywhere in that.
There was a clear indication of the expectations of the audience in letters, e-mails and telephone calls before each episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Modi will come, he will go, but this country will continue for ever, and our culture will not perish.
There is no secret to the tiny stories of 130 crore countrymen.
I read the letter and if this same feeling had appeared in another letter, I would also accept it.
Along with this, I also share my experiences with you.
No government can have the power to disseminate this kind of awareness and that too in a small village in Haryana and even in a country or abroad.
When each and every section of the society and every celebrity comes together, when said in a new chapter of change in society, todays generation understands this, there is an invisible awareness.
The soul of India is about social justice and about social power.
There are thousands of angles in social life, one of which is political.
If everything is done in politics, it is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes, the extent to which political events and politicians dominate, the different skills and efforts of the society are being crushed.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
In a way, it has been heard because of your consent.
If I have to answer the question that you asked me directly, then I will not be involved in any of the preparations.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is an easy task for me.
People's letters come before every episode of Mann Ki Baat.
It's not just a paper for me;
In fact, for nearly 40-45 years, I have lived the life of a saint, I have gone to most parts of the country and spent a considerable time in the remote districts of the country.
To tell the truth, in Mann Ki Baat, the voice is mine, but examples, emotions and feelings are all my countrymen.
I have not been able to mention the names of lakhs of such people in Mann Ki Baat today, but they are not disappointed, they are sending their letters and comments.
I am confident that your ideas will reach me more than ever before, and the role of your ideas will be to make me more interesting and influential.
Efforts are also being made to inform the concerned department about the letters, comments that have not been received in Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to express my gratitude to all my friends in All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other television and social media platforms.
In this way, they become Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I express my gratitude and appreciation to all of them for their skills and talents.
I appeal to all of you that you must definitely listen to this event in your regional languages.
Any politician would never be happy with the media, he would always think that only a very small coverage is available and that too negative.
But many of the issues raised in Mann Ki Baat were made by the media themselves.
Cleanliness, road safety, drugless India, and a selfie with a daughter are some of the innovative methods that the media has done to take forward and move forward as a mission.
If you had no cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Finance Minister, Thank you very much for your phone call.
To tell the truth, I have no secret.
It becomes easier to understand anyone, until the fruits of our life are divided.
At times, we talk about the gap between rich and poor in families, and between rich and poor.
In fact, talking to the majority of the elderly is scarcely enough.
I have always been trying to connect with the youth through unique programmes or social media platforms.
I have always been trying to figure out what they are doing or what they think.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I have been giving a lot of importance to the efforts of the youth.
But I believe that there is no time for youngsters to waste, this thing helps the younger generation to innovate more, because they want to finish things faster.
Today, the youth of the country is thinking about more talented people and big things.
Good, let them dream big, let them achieve big successes.
Some say that the younger generation wants to do many things at the same time.
I'm asking, why can this be wrong?
Several projects are being done at the same time so that the farmers are able to do the same.
If we look around us, be it social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports or other sectors, the biggest change in the society is our youth.
These young people start asking questions and they have the ability to dream.
We can bring a positive change in the country if we place the thinking of the youth on the ground, if we provide an independent environment to shape them and they are doing it.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram, Vinita ji, in mygov, I would like you to talk about the Constitution Day tomorrow i.e.
This day is special, he added, that in the 70th year we had adopted our constitution.
Vinitha, thank you very much for your advice.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
This is the day when we think of the great men who gave us the Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
It took 2 years, 11 months and 17 days for the Constituent Assembly to complete this historic task, which was drafted by the Constitution.
Just imagine, within three years, these great personalities have voted for such a comprehensive constitution.
Even today, the speed with which they have enacted the Constitution is an example of time management and productivity.
We are also inspired to accomplish our responsibilities in a time bound manner.
The speciality of our Constitution is that it has been explained in detail about rights and duties.
It is a memorable event to increase the awareness of the Constitution among the youth and to link them with the various dimensions of the Constitution.
In 2020, as a Republic, we will complete 70 years of our Independence and 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Come, let us take the values of our Constitution forward and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, we should never forget the contribution of that great man who was at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
That man is the honorable doctor.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
On the 6th of December, the day of his Mahaparinirvana i.e.
I pay my tributes to Baba Saheb on behalf of all the countrymen and he gave away the right to live with dignity to crores of Indians.
He used to say that democracy is in sync with the nature of Baba Saheb and the democratic values of India are not imported from outside.
What is democracy, what is the parliamentary system is not a new thing for India.
My salutation to Baba Saheb, the son of Baba Saheb, for the second time.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on the 23rd of November, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji was celebrated and next year in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought about the welfare of mankind.
He had always shown the way to the society in terms of mouth, work, service, compassion and brotherhood.
All the State Governments and UTs have been asked to celebrate the occasion with great vigour.
Similarly, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated across the world.
And a train will also be built on the holy places associated with Guru Nanak Devji.
Today, when I was taking part in a meeting related to this thing then I got to know about Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
The Gurudwara had suffered a major loss during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat.
But it is an example even today that the state government has revived it by joining those circles.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat, let us meet again in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat. Today, for the first time, I have got the opportunity to share the emotions behind Mann Ki Baat.
The more I connect with you, the more it will be our journey, the more it will be a matter of happiness for all.
The question of what I got through Mann Ki Baat can be raised in the minds of some people.
Today, I want to tell you that all the people of the family, sitting together and listening to Mann Ki Baat, sitting among us, sharing our things with us. Many people say that our family leader is sitting among us and sharing our thoughts with us.
Look at your comforts, my love.
Your expectations, my expectations.
Your desires are aspirations, and my desires are aspirations.
Come, let us take this journey forward.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On October 31, this is the birth anniversary of our great personality Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This year too, the youth of the country are ready to participate in the Run for Unity.
Now the weather is like this.
Therefore, I urge you people to participate in the Run for Unity as much as possible.
About six months before the country's independence, on January 27, 1947, the world-renowned international newspaper 'Time' appeared on its front page with a photograph of Sardar Patel.
In the lead-up to the newspaper, the map of India was also published.
But that map is not the same as it is now.
India showed a piece of the map.
It contained more than 550 monasteries.
When they left the country, they wanted India to wear various pieces.
The Times reported that India faces a number of threats, such as separatism, violence, food shortages, price rise and power politics.
It was SardarVallabhbhai Patel who had said that it was possible to unite the country and to heal the wounds that occurred in the minds of the people.
The article was a part of the History of Life on the Iron Man of India.
It included the manner in which he carried out relief operations during the floods in Ahmedabad in 1920 and the Bardoli Satyagraha.
His integrity and commitment was so strong that he could rely on farmers, workers and industry captains.
Sardar Patel took every issue in his hand to unite the country as he used to wear a thread by a single thread.
He ensured that all the countries in the country are united with India.
Whether it is the plains of Junagarh, Hyderabad, Thiruvankaraur or Rajasthan, whether it is Rajasthan or Rajasthan, if we see an integrated India today, it is because of Sardar Patel's foresight and vision.
Built on the banks of the Narmada River in Gujarat, this statue is twice as high as the statue of the freedom fighter of America.
It will be the tallest statue in the world.
Every Indian will be proud of the worlds tallest statue in the world, he added.
Sardar Patel, the true son of our soil, will also decorate our airspace.
I hope that this statue, which has made the mother of India proud, will make every Indian proud.
It is natural for every Indian to have a desire to see the Statue of Unity.
I am confident that this statue will be a place for public viewing across the country.
My dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we all celebrated Kalapatthi Diwas.
I salute everyone who is a part of Indias security forces.
I also salute the families of our soldiers.
You should also be aware of the fact that today we are celebrating the festival of Kalapatthi.
Indian forces have taken a foot in Kashmir this day to save the valley from being caught in the clutches of occupation.
This incident is also directly related to SardarVallabhbhai Patel.
I read an old interview by our respected army officer Sham Manekshaw.
Field Marshal Sham Manekshaw recalled his time as Karnal.
It was at that time that military operations started in Kashmir.
In a meeting held at that time, Field Marshal Manekshaw had mentioned how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was determined to delay the sending of troops to Kashmir and he had given clear instructions to Sardar Patel to resolve the issue at the earliest.
After this, if our forces fly to Kashmir then we are able to know how our army has successfully worked.
The commemoration of the former Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, falls on October 31.
Let us pay our respects to Indira Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, who doesnt like sports
If the youth of our country has these qualities, then the country will not only develop in the field of economy and science and technology but it will also take pride in the field of sports.
I am very happy to have two recent meetings.
I congratulate them and their determination in breaking the barriers and getting success will be an inspiration for all the people of our country.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the Youth Summer Olympics held in Argentina in 2018.
You are aware that the performance of our youth during the 2018 Summer Olympics has been outstanding as never before.
In this competition, we won 13 medals and three medals in the Mixed Doubles category.
You should also remember that in the recent Asian Games, the performance of Indian players has been outstanding.
You would have noticed that I have often referred to the word Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.
This is a reality that reflects Indias progress in the field of sports every day.
Not only in the field of sports, India is also setting new benchmarks in many fields.
For example, I would like to point out to you the differently-abled player, Narayan Thakur, who won the Gold Medal in the Asian Games 2018 for the Persons with Disabilities.
He was a differently abled man.
He lost his father when he was eight years old.
After that, he has been staying at home for eight years.
He also left the house and spent his life cleaning the buses of Delhi Transport Corporation and working in the roadside amenities.
It is the same Narayan who won India's medal in the International Competition.
Not only this, it is also important to note how fast the Indian sports sector is excelling.
Moreover, India has not won a medal in the Judo event in either junior or senior.
However, in the Youth Olympics, Indias Tababi Devi has won a silver medal and has won a historic record.
Dababi Devi, a 16-year-old, belongs to a village in Manipur.
His father is an ordinary worker and mother deals with fish.
It's a time when we don't even have money to buy food.
Despite such poverty, his zeal and dedication have not diminished.
He has made history by winning medals for the country.
The whole world appreciated the success of this competition.
FIFA Under-17 World Cup has created a record number of participants in the field.
More than 12 lakh sports enthusiasts have seen football in different sports disciplines in the country and have given a big boost to the young players.
This year, we have got the opportunity to host the 2018 World Cup in Bhubaneswar.
The World Cup will be held from November 28 to December 16.
Every Indian, be it a player in any game or be it a player in any game, will definitely be eager for a hockey match.
In the hockey game, India has made great achievements in the field of gold writing.
India has won gold medals in various competitions and has also won the World Championships one time.
India has also produced a number of best hockey players.
Whenever a quote on the hockey game, we cannot finish without mentioning our recorders.
Major Dayanand, considered to be the father of hockey, is known all over the world.
India Hockey has a long tradition from Balbir Singh Sr, Lesley Gladys Mohammad Shahid to Uttam Singh Dhanraj Pillai.
Even now, the Indian contingent is inspiring the younger generation if they focus on their hard work and targets.
This is a good opportunity for the sports enthusiasts who want to see beautiful competitions.
Go to Bhubaneswar and encourage every Indian team to play there.
The state of Odisha has not only a great historical background but also a rich cultural heritage.
The people of that state are very fond of it.
This is a great opportunity for the players to see Odisha.
You can also see the world famous holy places like Konark sun temple, Puri Jagannath temple and Chilka lake along with sports competitions.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Men's contingent for this competition and also assure them that they have the support of the 1.25 billion Indians.
I congratulate all the teams participating in this competition from different countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, the attitude of those who have come forward to serve society, in fact, is an inspiration and inspiration for all the citizens of the country.
But in today's new era, the new generation has been able to fulfil their dreams with renewed vigour and enthusiasm with innovative methods.
I attended the launch of a new portal, My Government's scheme, and the country's IT and Electronics Industry, to encourage workers to take up community activities and provide them the opportunity to work in this field.
Their dedication and valour make every Indian proud.
I am not - the change that has been brought about by the IT sector has created a new environment for the society to work from the individual to the society.
Some people are giving lessons to old people.
Some are dedicated to the cause of cleanliness and some are helping the farmers.
But behind whose actions they are, there is no motivation, and their determination is the driving force.
However, a person who learns to sit on a wheel chair and play chess can help a differently abled player in a wheel chair.
This spirit and dedication is a work culture.
This will make every Indian proud.
'I am not - we' will definitely be an inspiration for all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, In view of the suggestions made by you people in Mann Ki Baat today, the idea of a person from Puducherry was very encouraging.
Through the Mann Ki Baat programme, My Government has made an appeal to the tribal people and their traditions and rituals as examples of natural environments.
How can we adopt tribal traditions in our lives to achieve sustainable development and learn from such traditions, he added.
I congratulate you all for putting this problem in front of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
The whole world, particularly the western countries, is discussing environmental protection and exploring new ways of adopting a balanced life style and encouraging us to understand our glorious past and our ancient traditions.
Our country is also facing the same problem.
But in order to find a solution, we need to remember the past and understand our traditional richness and the way of life of our tribal people.
Collaboration with nature is an integral part of the lives of our tribal people.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees, plants and flowers as gods.
The Bil tribal people of Central India, especially those living in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the Beipal and Arjun trees.
The Bishnoi tribe living in the desert areas of Rajasthan guide us on how to protect the environment.
In particular, they are prepared to give their lives more than one tree is affected by the protection of trees.
The people of Mishmi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh are associated with the LTTE.
They consider the LTTE as their brothers and sisters.
The LTTE is also a forest guard in Nagaland.
The Worli people of Maharashtra regard the LTTE as their guests and consider the LTTE to be among them and represent their prosperity.
The Gaulle community in central India feels that the LTTE is directly connected to their lives and that if the LTTE does not get food, the entire village will be starving.
Millions of people of central India also stop fishing in the Kaithan river during the breeding season.
They consider this area as a sanctuary of fish, and they think that nutritional fish are available in abundance due to this belief.
Besides, the tribal people are building their homes with strong and eco-friendly natural products.
In some isolated pockets of the Nilgiri mountain range in south India, the people of the Todar tribe build their own settlements only with the things they get in the region.
My dear brothers and sisters, This is a testimony to the belief that the tribal people are very peaceful and harmonious and there is no hesitation in fighting for their rights if anyone tries to harm or harm their natural resources.
It is no surprise that many of our freedom fighters, many of them belong to the tribal community.
Nobody can forget Bhagwan Birsa Munda who fought hard against British imperialism to defend their forest cover.
Apart from what I have said so far, the tribal communities that have taught us about how to co-operate with nature, can list a lot.We are extremely grateful to our tribal people for making the existing forest areas in the country remain protected as forest areas.
We all have to come forward to express our gratitude to them.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, we mentioned individuals and organisations who have contributed immensely to the society.
But these tasks are not enough, however, they have inspired a very deep sense of thought to show a new way of working for the society.
A few days ago, I had read about the farmer brother Gurbachan Singh of Panchayat.
The marriage of that farmer brother Gurbachan Singh's son will take place.
Gurbachan Singh has categorically told the parents of the bride to treat the marriage with ease.
There is no need to spend a lot of money on wedding reception or any other matter.
He said that this should be treated as a very simple one and he suddenly put down a condition.
The condition is that a woman's house should ensure that she does not burn straw and agricultural waste on her farm fields.
You should think about the social strength of this idea very well.
However, it shows how high his well-being is so that a large number of families in our society can understand their personal problems and how they can solve them for the benefit of the entire society.
The family of Mr. Gurbachan Singh showed us such an example.
I also read about the village of Kalmarmajra near Nabha in Punjab.
Instead of burning straw, the village of Kallarmajra has come to light by the farmers who have adopted the new technology of crushing the straw.
Congratulations to Gurbachan Singh
I congratulate the people of the village of Kallarmajra and all those who have done their best to ensure that there is no pollution in their surroundings.
All of you have been the true torchbearers of a healthy life-style of India.
Just like the sea is being created by a small drop of water, it is necessary to create a positive environment for every positive activity.
My dear countrymen, our scriptures also tell us: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Every soul within me, every heart and the universe must be at peace.
Shanti: Shanti:
Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be engraved with golden letters.
For India, November 11 this year is significant as the First World War ended on November 11, hundred years ago.
It has been a hundred years since the end of that war, and it has been 100 years since the end of the disaster and loss of human lives.
For India, the First World War is very important.
In fact, we have no direct connection to the war.
However, our soldiers fought valiantly and made supreme sacrifices in that battle.
Indian soldiers have also made it clear that if it comes to war, Indians will not be disappointed.
Our soldiers have displayed their courage and bravery in difficult terrains and adverse weather events.
The only purpose was to bring peace.
The world knows that a large number of deaths and damage occurred during the First World War.
About one crore soldiers and the same number of innocent people have lost their lives.
This is what made the whole world realize the importance of peace.
The meaning of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
Today, peace is not only a war, but a solution to terrorism, climate change, social change and economic development requires global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true example of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North Eastern states are unique.
There is no parallel to the natural beauty of the North-East. The people of this region are also very talented.
Today, the North East is well known for its excellent work.
The North East Region has made great strides in organic farming.
The State of Sikkim received the Gold Award for the 2018 Value Added Policy for promoting sustainable food systems a few days ago.
Not only this, Sikkim won the award, leaving behind the recommendations from 25 countries.
I heartily congratulate the people of Sikkim for this thing.
I believe that such festivals will be an opportunity to take new pledges.
Your progress is extremely important for the country's progress.
If you develop, this country will also develop.
My best wishes to you all.
